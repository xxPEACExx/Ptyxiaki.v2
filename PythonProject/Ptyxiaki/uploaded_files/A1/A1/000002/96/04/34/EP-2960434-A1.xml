The compressor aerofoil is either a rotor blade or a stator vane. Also the present invention relates to a compressor rotor assembly which includes a casing and an annular array of the compressor aerofoils defining a tip gap therebetween. The casing is a stator casing surrounding an annular array of the compressor blade aerofoils or a rotor drum surrounded by an annular array of the compressor vane aerofoils.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A compressor of a gas turbine engine comprises rotor components, including rotor blades and a rotor drum, and stator components, including stator vanes and a stator casing. The compressor is arranged about a rotational axis with a number of alternating rotor blade and stator vane stages as is well known and each stage comprises an aerofoil. The efficiency of the compressor is influenced by the running clearances or radial tip gap between its rotor and stator components. The radial gap or clearance between the rotor blades and stator casing and between the stator vanes and the rotor drum is set to be as small as possible to minimise over tip leakage of working gases, but sufficiently large to avoid significant rubbing that can damage components.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The pressure difference between a pressure side and a suction side of the aerofoil causes the working gas to leak through the tip gap. This flow of working gas or over-tip leakage generates aerodynamic losses due to its viscous interaction within the tip gap and with the mainstream working gas flow particularly on exit from the tip gap. This viscous interaction causes loss of efficiency of the compressor stage and subsequently reducing the efficiency of the gas turbine engine.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP2378075A1"><text>EP 2 378 075 A1</text></patcit> discloses a turbine blade having a tip that carries winglets which project laterally from the turbine blade at the radially outer end of the suction surface and pressure surface respectively. A gutter is formed in the winglet's tip and the position and direction of the gutter exit provides control over mixing losses associated with the return of gases from the gutter to the main working gas flow.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP1013878B1"><text>EP 1 013 878 B1</text></patcit> discloses a turbine blade including an airfoil having pressure and suction sidewalls joined together at leading and trailing edges and extending from a root to a tip plate. Twin ribs extend outwardly from the tip plate between the leading and trailing edges and are spaced laterally apart to define an open-top tip channel therebetween. Each of the tip ribs has an airfoil profile for extracting energy from combustion gases flowable around the turbine blade. The pressure side tip rib is stepped away from the main airfoil pressure surface and extends from the leading edge of the airfoil.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, two main components to the over tip leakage flow have been identified. A first component that originates near a leading edge of the aerofoil at the tip and which forms a tip leakage vortex and a second component that is created by leakage flow passing over the tip from the pressure side to the suction side. This second component exits the tip gap and feeds into the tip leakage vortex thereby creating still further aerodynamic losses.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The winglet configuration of <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP2378075A1"><text>EP 2 378 075 A1</text></patcit> aims to prevent the formation of the tip leakage vortex by virtue of the winglets overhanging the pressure and suction surfaces and the winglet being present at the leading edge of the aerofoil.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The tip rib configuration of <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP1013878B1"><text>EP 1 013 878 B1</text></patcit> aims to extract work from the main working gas flow by diverting a portion of the working gas flow into its channel and turning the flow from the leading edge to the trailing edge.

Thereby the present invention seeks to reduce the strength of the tip leakage vortex and therefore increase efficiency. Another objective is to reduce the interaction of the tip leakage vortex and the leakage flow passing over the tip from the pressure side to the suction side. Another object of the present invention is to increase the efficiency of compressor aerofoils.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">To address the problems of known compressors and turbines described above and for the advantages described below, there is provided a compressor aerofoil for a turbine engine, the compressor aerofoil comprises a suction surface wall having a suction surface and a pressure surface wall having a pressure surface, the suction surface wall and the pressure surface wall meet at a leading edge and a trailing edge, a tip plate extends between the suction<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> surface wall and the pressure surface wall and has a first tip rib and a second tip rib extending therefrom, the tip plate has a tip surface, the first tip rib has a first height R1 and the second tip rib has a second height R2 extending from the tip surface, a camber line is defined as passing through the leading edge and the trailing edge and the camber line length is from the leading edge to the trailing edge along the tip plate, the first tip rib and the second tip rib define a slot generally arranged along the camber line of the aerofoil, the first tip rib is begins a distance L1 from the leading edge towards the trailing edge and the second tip rib is begins a distance L2 from the leading edge, wherein the distances L1 and L2 may be between and equal to 1% and 20% of the camber line length.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">the distances L1 and L2 may be between and include 5% and 15% of the camber line length.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">the distances L1 and L2 may be approximately 12% of the camber line length.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">L2 may be greater than L1.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">L2 may be greater than L1 by 1-10% of the camber line length.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The first tip rib is located a distance T1 from the trailing edge towards the leading edge and the second tip rib is located a distance T2 from the trailing edge, wherein T1 and T2 may be less than 10% of the camber line length.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The at least one of the first tip rib and the second tip rib may have a blend portion between the height h2 and the tip surface.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The blend portion may be between 2 and 10% of the camber line length.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The slot may have a width G and G varies between the leading edge and the trailing edge.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The aerofoil has a thickness D and the slot has a width G and G which may be equal to or greater than 30% of the respective aerofoil thickness D at any location between the leading edge and the trailing edge.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The first tip rib may have a width E1 and the second tip rib has a width E2, wherein at least one of the first tip rib and the second tip rib may have a variable width.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The at least first tip rib may define a rib pressure side surface, the rib pressure side surface is flush with the pressure surface.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The slot may have a slot extension, the slot extension has a depth h3 below the tip surface and h3 is up to twice the tip gap H.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In another aspect of the present invention there is provided a compressor rotor assembly for a turbine engine, the compressor rotor assembly comprises a casing and a compressor aerofoil as recited in any one of the above paragraphs, wherein the casing and the compressor aerofoil define a tip gap H defined between the tip plate and the casing.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The height h2 of the tip rib may be between and including 20% and 80% of the tip gap H.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0025" num="0025">The above mentioned attributes and other features and advantages of this invention and the manner of attaining them will become more apparent and the invention itself will be better understood by reference to the following description of embodiments of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein

The gas turbine engine 10 comprises, in flow series, an inlet 12, a compressor section 14, a combustor section 16 and a turbine section 18 which are generally arranged in flow series and generally about and in the direction of a longitudinal or rotational axis 20. The gas turbine engine 10 further comprises a shaft 22 which is rotatable about the rotational axis 20 and which extends longitudinally through the gas turbine engine 10. The shaft 22 drivingly connects the turbine section 18 to the compressor section 14.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In operation of the gas turbine engine 10, air 24, which is taken in through the air inlet 12 is compressed by the compressor section 14 and delivered to the combustion section or burner section 16. The burner section 16 comprises a burner plenum 26, one or more combustion chambers 28 and at least one burner 30 fixed to each combustion chamber 28. The combustion chambers 28 and the burners 30 are located inside the burner plenum 26. The compressed air passing through the compressor 14 enters a diffuser 32 and is discharged from the diffuser 32 into the burner plenum 26 from where a portion of the air enters the burner 30 and is mixed with a gaseous or liquid fuel. The air/fuel mixture is then burned and the resulting combustion gas 34 or working gas from the combustion is channelled through the combustion chamber 28 to the turbine section 18.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The turbine section 18 comprises a number of blade carrying discs 36 attached to the shaft 22. In the present example, two discs 36 each carry an annular array of turbine blades 38. However, the number of blade carrying discs could be different, i.e. only one disc or more than two discs. In addition, guiding vanes 40, which are fixed to a stator 42 of the gas turbine engine 10, are disposed between the stages of annular arrays of turbine blades 38. Between the exit of the combustion chamber 28 and the leading turbine blades 38, inlet guiding vanes 44 are provided and turn the flow of working gas onto the turbine blades 38.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The combustion gas from the combustion chamber 28 enters the turbine section 18 and drives the turbine blades 38 which in turn rotate the shaft 22. The guiding vanes 40, 44 serve to optimise the angle of the combustion or working gas on the turbine blades 38.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The turbine section 18 drives the compressor section 14. The compressor section 14 comprises an axial series of vane stages 46 and rotor blade stages 48. The rotor blade stages 48 comprise a rotor disc supporting an annular array of blades. The compressor section 14 also<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> comprises a casing 50 that surrounds the rotor stages and supports the vane stages 48. The guide vane stages include an annular array of radially extending vanes that are mounted to the casing 50. The vanes are provided to present gas flow at an optimal angle for the blades at a given engine operational point. Some of the guide vane stages have variable vanes, where the angle of the vanes, about their own longitudinal axis, can be adjusted for angle according to air flow characteristics that can occur at different engine operations conditions.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The casing 50 defines a radially outer surface 52 of the passage 56 of the compressor 14. A radially inner surface 54 of the passage 56 is at least partly defined by a rotor drum 53 of the rotor which is partly defined by the annular array of blades 48 and will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The present invention is described with reference to the above exemplary turbine engine having a single shaft or spool connecting a single, multi-stage compressor and a single, one or more stage turbine. However, it should be appreciated that the present invention is equally applicable to two or three shaft engines and which can be used for industrial, aero or marine applications. The term rotor or rotor assembly is intended to include rotating components, including rotor blades and a rotor drum. The term stator or stator assembly is intended to include stationary or non-rotating components, including stator vanes and a stator casing. Thus the term rotor-to-stator is intended to relate a rotating component, to a stationary component such as a rotating blade and stationary casing or a rotating casing and a stationary blade or vane. The rotating component can be radially inward or radially outward of the stationary component.

The tip plate 92 can extend either between the suction surface wall 88 and the pressure surface wall 99 or the tip plate 92 can be positioned on the end of each of the suction surface wall 88 and the pressure surface wall 90. The tip 80 of the aerofoil 70 has a tip surface 86. The tip gap 82 is defined by the tip surface 86 and the radially outer surface 52. The radial extent of the tip gap is H and which is defined from the tip surface 86 and the radially outer surface 52.

From the tip surface 86 a first tip rib 101 and a second tip rib 102 extend away from the surface 86 and into the tip gap 82. The first tip rib 101 can be referred to as the suction side tip rib and the second tip rib 102 can be referred to as the pressure side tip rib. The compressor rotor assembly comprises the casing or drum, where the casing or drum and the compressor aerofoil define a tip gap H defined between the tip plate and the casing. The heights R1, R2 of the tip ribs 101 and 102 respectively is approximately 50% of the tip gap H, but can be between and including 20% and 80% of the tip gap H. The first tip rib 101 and the second tip rib 102 are shown having the same height, however, in some circumstances the heights may be different and which can depend on the local flow speed. Either one of the tip ribs 102, 101 can be higher than the other thus providing, for example, an accelerating or decelerating path to the leakage flow. An accelerating leakage flow would occur where the first tip rib 101 is higher than the second tip rib 102. A decelerating leakage flow would occur where the first tip rib 101 is lower than the second tip rib 102.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0044" num="0044">It is an important aspect of the present invention that the second tip rib 102 is flush with the pressure surface 91. In other words, a rib pressure side surface 103 of the second tip rib 102 is continuous with the pressure surface 91 of the aerofoil 70. Further, the rib pressure side surface 103 of the second tip rib 102 is not stepped inwardly towards the camber line line 108 or outwardly of the pressure surface 91 to create an overhang. In the exemplary embodiment shown in the figures the first rib 101 has a rib side surface 105 and which is flush with the suction surface 89. Thus in this example, the tip ribs 101, 102 are not offset from their respective pressure or suction surfaces 91, 89. In other examples, it is possible for the first tip rib 101 to be offset from the suction surface 89 without incurring significant aerodynamic losses. Thus the rib side surface 105 is stepped towards the camber line line 108 and away from the suction surface 89.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The first tip rib 101 and the second tip rib 102 define a slot 110 therebetween and the slot 110 is generally arranged along the camber line 108 of the aerofoil 70. The slot 110 is further defined by the tip surface 86. In this embodiment the tip surface 86 is generally flat or planar. In this embodiment the tip surface 86 does not have any cavities or depressions. The slot 110 has a width G and G varies between the leading edge 76 and the trailing edge 78. If the aerofoil 70 has a thickness D at the tip the width G is equal to or greater than 30% of the respective aerofoil thickness D at any location along the camber line 108 between the leading edge 76 and the trailing edge 78. The width G can be up to and including 80% of the respective aerofoil thickness D. A minimum width G is approximately 20% of the thickness of the aerofoil D. Thus the width E of the tip ribs 101, 102 can vary accordingly along the camber line 108 of the aerofoil 70. The tip ribs 101, 102 as shown with approximately equal widths, however, the width E2 of the second tip rib 102 can be the dimension D greater than the width of the aerofoil 70 at any given point along the camber line 108 and vice versa.

In this embodiment, the tip rib 101 and the second tip rib 102 have heights R1 and R2 which are approximately equal. The first tip rib 101 and the second tip rib 102 have constant heights R1 and R2 along their camber lineal lengths. In the embodiment shown the first tip rib 101 and the second tip rib 102 have a leading blend portion 104 and a<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> trailing blend portion 106 where the height of the tip ribs smoothly blends between the heights R1, R2 from the tip surface 86.

The blend portions 104, 106 are tangential at the intersection with the tip surface 86 and the rib surface. In the embodiment shown, the blend portions 104, 106 are approximately 5% the length of the camber line length.

In addition, it can be seen that the trailing blend portions 106 of the tip ribs 101, 102 can be tapered or reduced in their width E, towards the trailing edge 76, to form a divergent outlet 114 of the slot 110. These leading and trailing blend portions 104, 106 of the tip ribs 101, 102 reduce or taper in the transverse-camber line direction. The tapering or reduced width of the tip rib 101 is towards the suction surface 89, such that the suction surface 89 has no steps or offset. Similarly, the tapering or reduced width of the second tip rib 102 is towards the pressure surface 91, such that the pressure surface 91 has no steps or offset. Thus the leading and trailing blend portions 104, 106 reduce in both height and width from the main portions of the first and second tip ribs to the suction or pressure surface accordingly. This smooth blend avoids sharp corners and prevents additional or local vortices from forming and causing further aerodynamic losses.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0003"><b>FIGS.3</b></figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004"><b>4</b></figref><b>,</b> the first tip rib 101 is located a distance L1 from the leading edge 76 in the direction towards the trailing edge 78 and the second tip rib 102 is located a distance L2 from the leading edge 76 in the direction towards the trailing edge 78. Specifically, the distances L1 and L2 are from the leading edge 76 of the aerofoil 70, along the camber line 108 and to a line normal to the camber line 108 that intersects the very leading point of the leading blend portions 104. In this exemplary embodiment, the distances L1 and L2 are approximately 12% of the camber line length where the camber line length is the distance along the camber line line 108 from the leading edge 76 to the trailing edge 78. The camber line line 108 is defined by a line joining the mid-points of the through thickness dimension D at the tip surface intersection.

In this embodiment the slot 110 is deepened by a slot extension 124, which extends the slot 110 into the tip plate 92 such that it extends laterally between the pressure and suction walls 90, 88. The slot 110 is extended below or into the tip surface 86. Between the tip<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> ribs 101, 102, side walls 121, 122 of the slot 110 form a generally rectangular in cross-sectional shape and can continue this shape to its bottom surface 123; however, in this exemplary embodiment the side walls 121, 122 are convergent below the tip ribs 101, 102 and towards the bottom surface 123.

The camber lineal extent of the slot extension 124 is shown as approximately mirroring the profile along the camber line 108 and extent of one or both the tip ribs 101, 102. The slot extension 124, towards the leading edge 76, has a deepening lead-in portion 125 and towards the trailing edge 78, has a rising lead-out portion 126. These lead-in and lead-out portions can be generally similar to mirroring the leading and trailing blend portions 104, 106. However, at least one or possibly both of the lead-in portion 125 and the lead-out portion 126 can be a step or in other words form a radially aligned end wall.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The depth h3 of the slot extension 124 is approximately equal to the tip gap 82, dimension H in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG.4</figref>. At a maximum the depth h3 of the slot extension 124 is approximately equal to twice the tip gap 82, or 2H. In other examples, the depth of the slot extension 124 can vary along its camber lineal length and in particular, towards the leading edge 76 the slot extension 124 is a depth approximately h2 and towards the trailing edge 78 the slot extension 124 is a depth approximately h2/2. Thus the slot extension 124 reduces in depth between leading and trailing edges 76, 78.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The slot 110 and slot extension 124 are therefore capable of capturing and retaining over tip leakage flow S and channelling at least a part thereof to towards the trailing edge 78 where it is exhausted away from the leading edge vortex 118. This reduces the aerodynamic interaction and reduces efficiency losses. In the case where the slot extension 124 reduces in depth between leading and trailing edges 76, 78, the over tip leakage flow in the slot 110 is accelerated to join the main working gas flow as a more similar velocity and therefore further reducing aerodynamic losses.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055"><figref idrefs="f0006"><b>FIG.9</b></figref> illustrates the working gas flow 116 passing around and across the leading edge 76 of the aerofoil 70. An over tip leakage flow M of the main working gas flow 116 passes over the tip surface 86, free of the tip ribs 101, 102, and creates a tip leakage vortex 118. However, a slot-flow P, part of the over tip leakage flow M, is channelled through the slot 110. In channelling part of the over tip leakage flow M away the tip leakage vortex is significantly reduced in strength. This in itself improves efficiency by reducing the over tip vortex in size and longevity. Increasingly along the camber line length on the pressure side of the aerofoil further<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> over tip leakage flow S spills over the tip. A part this over tip leakage flow S then is drawn into the slot 110 to join the slot-flow P. Thus the amount of over tip leakage flow S flowing over the first or suction side tip rib 101 is reduced. The reduction in the amount of over tip leakage flow S is beneficial because there is then less interaction with the over tip leakage vortex 118 thus less loss generation and more efficiency.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail for a preferred embodiment the invention is not limited to these disclosed examples and other variations can be deducted by those skilled in the art in practicing the claimed invention.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90459753" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A compressor aerofoil (70) for a turbine engine, the compressor aerofoil comprises a suction surface wall (88) having a suction surface (89) and a pressure surface wall (90) having a pressure surface (91), the suction surface wall and the pressure surface wall meet at a leading edge (76) and a trailing edge (78),<br/>
