The invention can be applied in passenger cars as well as in heavy duty vehicles such as trucks or buses.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In order to fulfil current stringent emission legislation more or less all vehicles with internal combustion engines are provided with an exhaust gas aftertreatment device comprising at least one catalytic converter with at least one catalytic substrate. A catalytic converter substrate generally comprises a channelled structure which exhaust gases can pass through while being exposed to the large surface area of the catalytic substrate. The channels of the substrates may be fluidly connected by perforating holes or like allowing gases to pass between adjacent channels. This enables gas to diffuse through the substrate structure. For petrol engines the most frequently used catalytic converters are of Three Way Catalyst (TWC) type, while catalytic converters of Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) type and/or Lean NOx Trap (LNT) type are the most frequently used converters for diesel engines. It is also preferred that the TWC or the DOC/LNT is supplemented by a converter with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) functionality for improved NOx reduction. Typically, when using a catalytic converter of SCR type a liquid or gaseous reductant is added to the exhaust gas emission flow before the exhaust gases enters the catalytic converter of SCR type. The addition of reductant enables the catalytic reduction were NOx is reduced to diatomic nitrogen, N2, and water, H2O.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Catalytic converters combining the functionalities of more than one type of catalytic converter in one catalytic converter also exist.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Combining more than one catalytic converter can be problematic since exhaust gas aftertreatment devices often are associated with design restrains due to the limited<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> available space in the engine compartment. Thus, small exhaust gas aftertreatment devices are preferred from an engine packaging perspective, but small exhaust gas aftertreatment devices usually means that the flow distance between the inlet and the catalytic substrates of the catalytic converter is limited. Limited distance means that the time and distance during which mixing of the exhaust gas emissions can occur is limited. Insufficient mixing of the exhaust gas emissions gives inhomogeneous exhaust gas emission mixture. This might e.g. be problematic for emission gas sensors, arranged in the exhaust gas emission flow, to work properly and give accurate emission measurements.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Other problematic areas for catalytic converters are high back pressure and insufficient heating. High back pressure implies significant exhaust gas flow resistance. This is negative for the efficiency of the combustion engine resulting in a decrease of power output. Compensation of such decrease in power output leads to an increase in fuel consumption. If there is a difference in back pressure between two possible flow paths the flow through the flow path with lowest backpressure will be larger than the flow through the flow path with the higher backpressure. The flow ratio will be in proportion to the difference in back pressure. Heating of the catalytic converter is crucial since the catalytic converter is most effective at relatively high temperatures. Thus, it is desirable that the catalytic converter reaches its optimum operation temperatures as soon as possible and that the catalytic converter stays warm during operation.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Insufficient mixing of the exhaust gas emissions are of particular interest if a catalytic converter with a catalytic substrate with SCR functionality is used. For catalytic converters with SCR functionality, a liquid or gaseous reductant such as e.g. urea is introduced in the exhaust gas emission flow in order for the reductant and exhaust gas emissions to mix before reaching the substrate with SCR functionality. When a liquid reductant is used it is also desirable that the liquid reductant is evaporated. Consequently, sufficient mixing and reductant evaporation is essential for the substrate with SCR functionality to work properly.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US8607551B"><text>US 8607551</text></patcit> discloses an exhaust gas purifier and system for exhaust gas purification including an NOx catalyst of SCR type and a Catalyst Supported diesel particulate Filter (CSF) arranged in series, and being dispensed in an exhaust passage of an internal combustion engine.

The object is achieved by an exhaust gas aftertreatment device according to claim 1. By arranging two catalytic converters in series, wherein the second catalytic converter is of SCR type, and applying a pressure differential in connection to the injection of reductant a compact exhaust gas aftertreatment device with desired shape and improved mixing and reductant evaporation characteristics is provided.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Further advantages and advantageous features of the present invention are disclosed in the following description and in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Another object of the present invention is to provide a manufacturing method of such exhaust gas aftertreatment device.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As is known to a person skilled in the art a catalytic converter may comprise more than one catalytic substrate. E.g. catalytic converters of TWC type generally comprise two substrates. It is also possible to use a single catalytic substrate with coating providing two different functionalities, such as the functionality of DOC type and of LNT type. This is not part of the present invention per se and for clarity and simplicity reasons hereinafter the respective catalytic converter of the present invention is simply referred to as a first and a second catalytic substrate. With respective first and second catalytic substrate catalytic converters possibly comprising more than one substrate are considered to be included.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> The present invention can be used both in vehicles with spark ignited engines and in vehicles with compression ignited engines. If the exhaust gas aftertreatment device is used in a vehicle with a diesel engine the first catalytic substrate is preferably of Diesel DOC type or LNT type. If the exhaust gas aftertreatment device is used in a vehicle with a gasoline engine, or any other spark ignited fuels such as e.g. an ethanol based fuel, the first catalytic substrate may be of TWC type. The technical aspects of DOC, TWC and LNT catalyst are known to a person skilled in the art, as is the advantages and disadvantages with respective type of catalyst. The type of catalytic converter used as first catalytic converter is not part of the invention per se.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Thus, as will be apparent throughout the description of the present invention, when referring to said first catalytic substrate what might be intended is a catalytic converter of TWC type, thus actually comprising of two catalytic substrates.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Exhaust gas aftertreatment devices for purification of exhaust gas emissions for vehicles are generally arranged in exhaust gas passages subsequently of an internal combustion engine. As the exhaust gas emissions of said internal combustion engine are discharged through said exhaust gas passage they enter said exhaust gas aftertreatment device. The exhaust gas passage is generally enclosed by an encapsulating portion enclosing of the exhaust gas aftertreatment device.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The exhaust gas aftertreatment device of the present invention comprises said first catalytic substrate and said second catalytic substrate, wherein said first catalytic substrate is arranged upstream of said second catalytic substrate. The first and second catalytic substrates are arranged such that respective catalytic substrate covers a majority of respective flow cross sectional area of said exhaust gas passage. Preferably the whole cross sectional area of the catalytic converter is covered, but as will be apparent according to some aspects of the present invention part of the cross sectional area may be occupied by e.g. a reductant injecting device or a reductant injecting pipe. Part of the cross sectional area may also be used in order to provide exhaust gas circulation.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The first and second catalytic substrates are extending a respective length in a flow direction of said exhaust gas passage such that an exhaust gas emission flow discharged from said internal combustion engine flows through the length of said first catalytic substrate and subsequently through the length of said second catalytic substrate.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> According to the present invention the second catalytic substrate is preferably of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) type. However, the second catalytic substrate may also be of other design where injection of a liquid or gaseous fluid with reductive, or other chemical property, is desired.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Thus, according to the present invention the exhaust gas aftertreatment device additionally comprises a reductant injecting device, capable of injecting liquid or gaseous reductant into the exhaust gas aftertreatment device. The reductant injecting device preferably comprises at least an injector nozzle and an injector conduit arranged such that the injector conduit extends through the encapsulating portion of the exhaust gas aftertreatment device. The injector nozzle, arranged to the part of the reductant conduit extending into the exhaust gas aftertreatment device, is provided such that reductant can be added to the exhaust gas flow. The reductant injecting device is preferably arranged to a reductant tank and to means suitable for providing reductant from the reductant tank to the reductant injecting device. The functionality of an SCR catalyst and a reductant injecting device as disclosed above are considered to be known to a person skilled in the art and are not part of the present invention per se.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the present invention a pipe extends in said flow direction of said first catalytic substrate such that said pipe provides a passage through said first catalytic substrate. Said pipe comprises an obstructing portion arranged such that said obstructing portion covers the cross sectional area of said pipe. The obstructing portion is provided such that a difference in back pressure is obtainable between said pipe and said first catalytic substrate. The pressure difference obtained provides different flow rates for the exhaust gas flow through the first catalytic substrate and for the exhaust gas flow through the pipe. Said reductant injecting device is extending through said encapsulating portion and into said pipe such that reductant is injectable within said pipe.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In order for a catalytic substrate of SCR type to efficiently purify exhaust gases suitable relation between injected reductant and exhaust gases, sufficient evaporation of injected reductant and good mixing of evaporated reductant and exhaust gases are required. The mixing and evaporation properties are favoured by turbulent exhaust gas flow and maintained high exhaust gas temperature. Also, the longer the time and the distance<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> during which the exhaust gas and the injected reductant can mix is the better mixing and reductant evaporation is obtained.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">By arranging the reductant injecting device within said pipe the distance from where the reductant is injected to the subsequently arranged catalyst of SCR type will be prolonged which will be beneficial for mixing and reductant evaporation.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Thus, according to an aspect of the present invention said reductant injection device is arranged such that said reductant is injectable downstream of said obstructing portion. As has been stated, injecting the reductant downstream of said obstructing portion, wherein said obstructing portion is arranged in a pipe, enables that reductant is injectable further away from the second catalytic converter than otherwise would be possible.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to yet one aspect of the present invention said pipe is arranged centrally of said first catalytic substrate. Arranging the pipe centrally of said first catalytic substrate may be advantageous from a manufacturing perspective. However, it is also possible to arrange the pipe radially displaced. Depending on the design of the exhaust as aftertreatment device displacing the pipe radially may be used in order to improve the mixing properties. Since the exhaust gas flow through the first catalytic substrate and the pipe will be different, by displacing the pipe radially it is possible to obtain a swirling, turbulent flow motion after the pipe and the first catalytic converter which is beneficial for the mixing characteristics.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The obstructing portion may be of different configurations. According to one aspect of the present invention said obstructing portion has a higher back pressure than said first catalytic substrate. According to a preferred aspect of the present invention the difference in back pressure between the pipe, provided by the higher back pressure of the obstructing portion provided in the pipe, and the first catalytic substrate may be configured such that approximately 10% of the exhaust gas mass flow flows past the obstructing portion, not taking the smaller cross sectional area of the obstructing portion in consideration. According to another preferred aspect as low as 2% of the mass flow flows past the obstructing portion. Depending on current exhaust gas aftertreatment device design the obstructing portion may have anything from merely noticeable gas flow obstructing effect to being completely impermeable.

Centrally of said first catalytic substrate 30 a pipe 60 is arranged, and in the upstream part of the said pipe 60 an obstructing portion 70 is arranged. The exhaust gas aftertreatment device 10a is encapsulated by an encapsulating portion 20a, wherein a reductant injecting device 50a are extending through said encapsulating portion 20a at a part of the encapsulating portion 20a provided upstream of said first catalytic substrate 30. Said reductant injecting device 50a also extends trough said obstructing portion 70 such that reductant is injectable inside said pipe 60 and downstream of said obstructing portion 70.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">By introducing said pipe 60, and injecting the reductant within said pipe 60 instead of injecting the reductant at a position provided downstream of said first catalytic substrate 30, the distance from where the reductant is injected to said second catalytic substrate 40 will be prolonged. This means that the injected reductant will also be exposed to hot exhaust gases for a longer period of time before reaching the second catalytic substrate 40 of SCR type which will improve the evaporation properties of said reductant and also that injected reductant and exhaust gases will be able to mix during a longer period of time. A homogenous, balanced mix between exhaust gases and fully evaporated reductant is desirable to obtain the best possible catalytic effect by a catalyst of SCR type.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The obstructing portion 70 has a higher backpressure than said first catalytic substrate 30. In order for the first catalytic substrate 30 to be efficient it is desirable that the exhaust gases spends as long time as possible within the substrate and thereby is exposed to as large catalytic surface as possible during the passage of the substrate. It is also desirable that that the backpressure of said first catalytic substrate 30 is as low as possible since the engine efficiency is dependent on the gas flow through the exhaust system.
