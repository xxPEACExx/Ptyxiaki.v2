A typical throttle valve of the currently marketed type has a valve body provided with a tubular feeding duct through which the intake or compressed air for the internal combustion engine flows; a throttle plate is housed in the feeding duct and is splined to a rotating shaft to rotate between an opening position and a closing position of the feeding duct. The rotation of the throttle valve plate is controlled by an actuator device normally comprising an electric motor coupled to the throttle valve plate shaft by means of a gear drive and at least one spring which pushes the throttle valve plate shaft towards the closing position (or rather towards a limp-home position close to the closing position).<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The electric motor has a cylindrical body which is arranged in a tubular housing of the valve body arranged by the side of the feeding duct. The gear drive is arranged in a chamber of the valve body, which is defined by two shells, a first shell defining a removable lid and a second shell being arranged next to the feeding duct and next to the tubular housing.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Finally, the valve body comprises a conditioning circuit which is defined by a channel, which may assume various conformations and routes; if it is substantially L-shaped, it has a major branch obtained in the upper portion of the second shell and a minor branch obtained in the upper portion of the tubular housing. The channel is in hydraulic communication with a pump which circulates the conditioning fluid and feeds the channel itself to condition the various parts of the throttle valve.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1348850A"><text>EP1348850</text></patcit> describes, for example, a throttle valve provided with a heating circuit adapted to prevent the freezing of the valve itself provided with an elastically deformable tube made of a fuel and oil resistant rubberized fabric arranged in a variable section channel of an appendix of the valve body having a smaller diameter than the diameter of the elastically deformable tube which is arranged inside it.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="DE19625154"><text>DE19625154</text></patcit> instead describes a device for heating<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> a throttle valve made by means of an appropriately shaped tube which is connected to the valve body by means of mechanical fixing means, such as a pair of brackets for example; furthermore, a layer of heat-conducting paste is interposed between the tube of the heating device and the valve body. The heat-conducting paste does not have a structural function and therefore mechanical fixing means are needed to connect the tube to the valve body.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The entire valve body of most of the throttle valves present on the market is made of metallic material, preferably aluminum, and is monolithic (i.e. is formed seamlessly in one piece).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The valve body (i.e. the second shell, the feeding duct and the tube housing) is made by casting (normally die-casting) and, if needed, is then mechanically machined. Pinholes and/or micro air bubbles may form in the valve body because the material is injected at rather high temperatures (in the order of 700 °C), at equally high pressures (in the order of 1000 bar) and very rapidly for manufacturing the valve body by casting (normally die-casting); the pinholes and/or micro bubbles are difficult to see with unaided eye (but are visible only under X rays) and are difficult to identify during the step of setting and tuning the throttle valve.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Such pinholes and/or micro bubbles are particularly dangerous because with the aging of the valve body and in the case of rather high pressures involved, the passage of conditioning fluid in the conditioning circuit channel may put different micro bubbles into mutual communication and thus cause the formation of channels for the passage of conditioning fluid towards the other components and in particular towards the electric motor, towards the feeding duct or towards the outside environment.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Description of the invention</u></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">It is the object of the present invention to provide a throttle valve for an internal combustion engine provided with a conditioning circuit, which throttle valve is free from the drawbacks of the prior art and is easy and cost-effective to make at the same time.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for making a throttle valve for an internal combustion engine which is free from the drawbacks of the prior art and which is easy and cost-effective to implement at the same time.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to the present invention a throttle valve for an internal combustion engine provided with a conditioning circuit and a manufacturing method of a throttle valve for an internal combustion engine are<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> provided as disclosed in the appended claims.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>Brief description of the drawings</u></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, which show a non-limitative embodiment thereof, in which:

In other words, the first<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> material of which the valve body 2 (i.e. the shell 13**, the feeding duct 4 and the tubular housing 9) is made by injection co-molding so as to define the seat 18 obtained for housing the tube 19.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As shown in detail in figures from 3 to 6, the tube 19 is inserted in the seat 18 obtained in the valve body 2 once the casting process of the valve body 2 itself is completed.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A trace T of structural and heat-conducting resin is applied once the casting process of the valve body 2 is completed. The trace T of the structural and heat-conducting resin is deposited by means of a specific application tool, preferably on the bottom of the seat 18 itself (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">figures 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>). According to a preferred embodiment, a structural and heat-conducting resin is used, the basic fluidity of which is variable from liquid to semi-solid. According to a preferred embodiment, a structural heat-conducting and thermosetting resin is used. According to different, mutually alternative embodiments, the structural heat-conducting resin is epoxy, or polyurethane or acrylic based.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">It is worth noting that the resin used for the trace T performs both functions illustrated hereto; indeed it has structural value to allow the anchoring of the tube 19 in the seat 18 and at the same allows the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> transmission of heat between the conditioning fluid which circulates the tube 19 and the various parts of the throttle valve 1.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">After having deposited the trace T of the structural and heat-conducting resin, the tube 19 is inserted in the seat 18. The resin present on the bottom of the seat 18 moves upwards so as to completely skim the inner surface 20 of the seat 18 and partially the outer surface 21 of the tube 19 so as not to protrude from the seat 18 towards an upper surface 22 of the valve body 2. A substantially uniform layer S of structural and heat-conducting resin is thus formed between the seat 18 and the tube 19 (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">figure 6</figref>).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">According to a preferred variant, the valve body 2 is substantially subjected to a thermal treatment (e.g. by means of infrared, induction or by means of the passage in polymerization ovens) to allow to complete the polymerization of the structural and heat-conducting resin. Alternatively, the structural and heat-conducting resin may be of the thermosetting type. A monocomponent structural and heat-conducting resin or a bicomponent structural and heat-conducting resin may be advantageously applied; the polymerization temperature of the structural and heat-conducting resin is variable as a function of the components of the structural and<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> heat-conducting resin itself.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Once polymerized, the resin can constrain the tube 19 to the seat 18 and further allows the heat exchange between the conditioning fluid and the air aspirated by the internal combustion engine which flows through the tubular feeding duct 4 defined in the valve body 2. Furthermore, the structural and heat-conducting resin has a high resistance to thermal shocks and rather high working temperatures (in the order of 380°C) equal to double the temperatures which can be found in the valve body 2.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">According to a preferred embodiment, the seat 18 is open on the top and the tube 19 is rigidly constrained to the seat 18 exclusively by means of the structural and heat-conductive resin; in other words, there are no mechanical locking means for constraining the tube 19 in the specific seat 18.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">According to a further variant, mechanical locking means (not shown) of the tube 19 in the specific seat 18 are provided, as for example a number of fixing brackets or plates distributed along the entire length of the tube 19.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">It is apparent that the conditioning circuit 17 may have alternatively different conformations from the substantially L-shape conformation described above.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In particular, according to alternative variants,<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> the conditioning circuit 17 (i.e. the seat 18 and tube 19) has a rectilinear shape and is obtained in the upper portion of the shell 13** or in the upper portion of the tubular housing 9.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The throttle valve 1 described above has many advantages.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Firstly, the valve body 2 of the throttle valve 1 described above is simple and cost-effective to make because it can be easily made by injection molding the valve body 2 (i.e. the shell 13**, the feeding duct 4 and the tubular housing 9) and subsequently applying the resin for locking the tube 19 in the seat 18.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Furthermore, the valve body 2 of the throttle valve 1 described above has extremely low weight and manufacturing costs.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Finally, the throttle valve 1 allows to prevent the passage of conditioning fluid used in the conditioning circuit and contained in the tube 19 towards, for example, the electric motor 3, the feeding duct 4 or towards the outside environment during use, independently from the aging phenomena.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90459715" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A throttle valve (1) for an internal combustion engine comprising:
