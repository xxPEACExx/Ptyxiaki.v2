Typically, drillstring comprises of bottom-hole assembly positioned directly above the bit and followed by drillpipe all the way up to the rotary table or top drive. In a rotary drilling mode, a drillstring is used to transfer the rotary motion from the surface equipment to drill bit, thereby causing the drill bit to rotate and penetrate formation. In a sliding drilling mode, drill string does not rotate whereas the rotary motion of the bit is caused by mud motors or rotary steerable systems assembled as part of bottom-hole assembly above the drill bit. Whether in rotary or slide drilling mode, once the planned Total Depth (TD) of each section of the well has been achieved, the standard drilling practice is to trip the drill string out of hole one stand at a time (generally each stand is equal to 3 joints of drill pipe or approximately 93 feet long) and during this process a manual drifting of each stand is performed once the stand is racked back on the rig derrick. The drifting of the drillstring is essential in order to ensure that no debris or obstructions are present inside the drillstring bore. The presence of any such debris or obstruction if not detected and removed could lead to very expensive remedial work if the drillstring is run back in the hole for setting a liner or screen or for drilling of the next section of the well.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Drifting every stand on the rig is a time consuming practice and the deeper the well the longer it would take to drift every stand on the rig. Secondly and more importantly is the potential risk associated with raising the often heavy drift about 93ft above the rig floor and dropping it from this height down through each stand, hence giving rise to possibility of a drop object on the rig floor which could have catastrophic consequences for safety of personnel present on the rig floor during this operation.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">One solution to this problem is to perform the drifting of the drillstring while the entire drillstring is still inside the well. This would result in much faster drifting of the entire drillstring and it would also remove the safety hazard associated with drifting at heights above the rig floor. The drifting is generally performed inside the drillpipe hence there is no requirement to drift any component located below the drillpipe, for this reason, it would be advantageous to have a device installed directly below the lower last joint of drillpipe in the drillstring in order to capture the drift which would be dropped inside the drillstring from the rig floor.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1611312B1"><text>EP 1 611 312 B1</text></patcit> discloses a method of checking for restrictions in a string of tubing, the method comprising providing a profile in the tubing string and providing a drift member adapted to engage with said profile. The drift member comprises a generally cylindrical body and a hardened nozzle ring that is in sealing engagement with the inner wall of the body of the drift member. A drift sub and an external configuration of the body are as such that the body is substantially a sealing fit within the drift sub such that any fluid passing through the string from the surface must then pass through the nozzle and will therefore experience a pressure drop. The restriction introduced into the string bore by the nozzle is reflected at surface by a readily identifiable increase in pump pressure which indicates to the operators on the surface that the body has engaged with the drift sub and that the pipe string is substantially free of obstruction and restriction. Radial flow ports are provided<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> in the body between its leading end and the nozzle ring. If the leading end should encounter an annular pipe restriction, preventing flow between the exterior of the leading end and a pipe wall, fluid may still pass through the flow ports.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">In view of the above-described situation, there exists a need for a drifting system with improved characteristics.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">This need may be met by the subject matter according to the independent claims.

Numerous other advantageous may be achieved with embodiments of the herein disclosed subject matter.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to an embodiment, the catcher sub has at least one closure element closing the lateral outlet of the drifting element when the drifting element is received in the seat. The closure element may lead to a pressure spike in the drilling fluid in the drillstring which may be detected by monitoring the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> pressure in the drillstring. The pressure spike may arise due to the interruption of bypass flow through the lateral outlet. Interruption of the bypass flow through the lateral outlet may lead to a pressure spike which is easily distinguished from a rather gradual pressure increase due to landing of the drifting element on an obstruction in the drillstring. According to an embodiment of, the drifting element has an outer diameter which is smaller than the inner diameter of the drillstring. Hence, when the drifting element lands on an obstruction, drilling fluid is capable of exiting the lateral outlet and continuing down the drillstring.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to an embodiment, the closure element is a surface portion e.g. of the catcher sub facing the lateral outlet when the drifting element is received in the seat. For example, according to a further embodiment the surface portion may be adapted for contacting the drifting element around each port of the lateral outlet. According to a further embodiment, the surface portion of the catcher sub forming the closure element for at least part (e.g. for some of the ports) of the lateral outlet conforms to the shape of an outer surface of the drifting element around the ports. If the closure element is provided by a surface portion of the catcher sub, the closure element may be provided at low costs. According to an embodiment, the surface portion forming the closure element may be part of a tubular surface portion, e.g. part of a cylindrical surface portion where the surface portion extends in axial direction. According to a further embodiment, the surface portion may be parallel to the axial direction or, in another embodiment, angled or curved with regard to the axial direction.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to an embodiment, the lateral outlet is configured for generating through the lateral outlet a flow which is uniformly distributed about a circumference of the drifting element. The uniformly distributed flow laterally exiting the drifting element during pumping down the drifting element through the drillstring may assist in centering the drifting element in the drillstring.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> According to an embodiment, the lateral outlet comprises at least two outlet ports of identical cross section of flow; and the at least two ports are evenly spaced about an outer circumference of the drifting element.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to an embodiment, the drifting element (and/or the catcher sub) may be configured so as to provide a gradual transition between different cross sections of flow. For example, the transition may be provided by a conical surface portion.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Generally herein, a conical surface portion is not to be understood as necessarily referring to a cone in a mathematical sense, although this is not excluded in an embodiment. Rather, in the sense of this application a conical surface portion is generally a surface portion which provides a gradual change of a cross section of flow that is at least partially (e.g. entirely) defined by the conical surface portion. For example, with regard to an axial direction of the catcher sub or the drifting element (i.e. to a direction of flow through the catcher sub/the drifting element), the conical surface portion may e.g. be curved, straight but slanted, or configured in any other suitable way which provides a gradual change of the respective cross section of flow. Further, while in some embodiments the conical surface portion is continuous in a circumferential direction, in other embodiments the conical surface portion may be discontinuous in circumferential direction.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to an embodiment, the lateral outlet comprises at least one outlet port extending through the wall from the through flow passage in the first axial region of the drifting element. According to an embodiment, in the first axial region the through flow passage has a conical cross-section of flow which is narrowing in a downstream direction. In such a case, the lateral outlet port extends from the conical portion of the through flow passage through the wall.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> According to an embodiment, the drifting element has an outer conical surface portion, particularly in the first axial region; and the catcher sub has an inner conical surface portion forming the seat and being adapted for receiving the outer conical surface portion to thereby catch the drifting element. According to an embodiment, the inner conical surface portion of the catcher sub is only slightly angled with regard to the axial direction. For example, according to an embodiment the angle which the inner conical surface portion of the catcher sub forms with the axial direction is within a range between 2 degrees and 30 degrees or, in another embodiment, between 3 degrees and 10 degrees.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to a further embodiment, the lateral outlet comprises at least one outlet port extending through the wall from the through flow passage in the second axial region of the drifting element. Apparently, an outlet port extending from the through flow passage in the second axial region also leads to a bypass flow through this outlet port. In accordance with an embodiment, the outlet port extending from the through flow passage in the second axial region is configured according to one or more embodiments described above with regard to an outlet port extending from the through flow passage in the first axial region. For example, the bypass flow stemming from the second axial region of the through flow passage may be adapted to center the drifting element with regard to the drillstring during pumping down of the drifting element.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In accordance with the above described embodiments of, the lateral outlet comprises at least one first outlet port extending from the through flow passage in the first axial region and at least one second outlet port extending from the through flow passage in the second axial region. According to an embodiment, the accumulated cross section of flow of the at least one first outlet port is smaller than the accumulated cross section of flow of the at least one second outlet port. This may improve stabilization of the drifting element with regard to the axial direction of the drillstring. It is noted that due to the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> small spacing of both types of ports (first and second outlet ports) the individual pressure spikes generated by interrupting the bypass flow through the at least one first outlet port and the at least one second outlet port occur simultaneously on the relevant timescale and hence only a single pressure spike is detected. Herein, stabilization of the drifting element means stabilization of the travel of the drifting element down the drillstring.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to an embodiment, the lateral outlet comprises at least two outlet ports with respective port openings on the outer surface of the drifting element, wherein the port openings on the outer surface of the drifting element are spaced from each other in axial direction and/or in circumferential direction. Such a configuration of the lateral outlet may further improve stabilization of the drifting element with regard to the axial direction.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">According to an embodiment, at least one outlet port has a tapered cross-section at least in an axial section plane, wherein tapered cross section opens up towards the through flow passage. According to an embodiment, one or more of the outlet ports have a rectangular cross-sectional shape when viewed along the port through the wall. According to a further embodiment, one or more of the outlet ports have a circular cross-sectional shape when viewed along the port through the wall.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">According to an embodiment, the through flow passage of the drifting element is a free passage without any obstructing elements. According to other embodiments, structural elements may be located in the through flow passage or in the path to the through flow passage. For example, according to an embodiment the drifting element comprises a central fish neck which allows wireline retrieval of the drifting element.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">According to an embodiment, the seat of the catcher sub is formed by an inner surface portion of the catcher sub which defines a gradually decreasing cross<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> section of flow in downstream direction. Compared to a stepwise change of a cross section of flow, a gradual change of the cross-section of flow avoids edges which may damage the drifting element. This may enable reliable operation of the drifting system even after multiple reuse of the same drifting element.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">According to an embodiment, the catcher sub has an inner conical surface portion forming the seat. Hence, in accordance with an embodiment the inner conical surface portion forming the seat opens (i.e. its cross-section of flow widens) in the upstream direction.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">For example, according to an embodiment the inner conical surface portion forms an angle with an upstream direction wherein the angle is smaller than 60 degrees, smaller than 40 degrees or even less.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">According to an embodiment, the through flow passage of the drifting element has a clearance diameter which is larger than a diameter of an activation seat of a tool that is located downstream the catcher sub. In such a case, a method of operating the drifting system comprises: pumping the drifting element down the drillstring until an increase in the monitored pressure indicates landing of the drifting element in the seat of the catcher sub; and pumping an activation element (e.g. a ball) for the tool down the drillstring and through the through flow passage of the drifting element into the activation seat of the tool.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Generally, it is noted that conical surfaces portions lead to a rather gradual change of a cross section of flow may have the advantage that turbulences in the flow of drilling fluid and abrasion (e.g. washout) in the drifting system can be maintained on a low level or even avoided.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The drifting system described herein may be used to conduct post drilling drifting of a drillstring prior to tripping the drillsting out of hole.

This design allows the safe capturing and/or containment of the drifting element inside the catcher sub yet the conical internal geometry of the catcher sub does not present any obstruction to any device being lowered through the drillstring bore which may need to pass through catcher sub and/or through the drifting element. Furthermore, the absence of any shoulder or ledge in the internal bore of the catcher sub reduces the risk of damaging the catcher sub, the drifting element or any other device being lowered through the catcher sub.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In the above there have been described and in the following there will be described exemplary embodiments of the subject matter disclosed herein with reference to a drifting system, a drifting element, a catcher sub, and a method of operating a drifting system.

The through flow passage 102 has a first cross section of flow 106 in a first axial region 108. In accordance with an embodiment, the first axial region 108 is located upstream a second axial region 112. In this regard it is noted that the arrow at 104, indicating the axial direction, is pointing in downstream direction, i.e. in the direction of the flow of drilling fluid when the drifting element is pumped through a drillstring. Accordingly, an upstream direction 113 is the direction opposite to the downstream direction. Further, the through flow passage 102 has a second cross section of flow 110 in a second axial region 112. In accordance with an embodiment, the through flow passage 102 is defined by a tubular wall 114.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">According to a further embodiment, the tubular wall 114 comprises a lateral outlet 116 extending from the through flow passage 102 in the second axial region 112 and extending from the through flow passage 102 in the first axial region. In accordance with an embodiment, the lateral outlet 116 comprises at least one first outlet port 120 (e.g. four first outlet ports 120 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) extending from the through flow passage in the first axial region 108 through the wall 114 to an outer surface of the drifting element 100, e.g. to an outer conical surface portion 128. In accordance with a further embodiment, the lateral outlet 116 comprises at least one second outlet 122 (e.g. four second outlet ports 122 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) extending from the through flow passage 102 in the second axial region 112 through the wall 114<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> to an outer surface of the drifting element 100, e.g. to an outer cylindrical surface portion 123.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In accordance with an embodiment, the lateral outlet 116 is configured for generating through the lateral outlet 116 a flow which is uniformly distributed about a circumference of the drifting element 100. In accordance with an embodiment, shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, this uniformly distributed flow is generated by the following measures: First, an identical cross section of flow of the first outlet ports 120 and an identical cross section of flow of the second outlet ports 122. (Nevertheless, the cross section of flow of the first outlet ports 120 and the cross section of flow of the second outlet ports 122 may be different, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.) Second, an even spacing of the first outlet ports 120 about an outer circumference of the drifting element 100 and an even spacing of the second outlet ports 122 about the outer circumference of the drifting element 100. However, it should be understood that a flow which is uniformly distributed about the circumference of the drifting element 100 may be achieved by other measures.

In accordance with an embodiment, at least part of the inner conical surface portion 124 is provided in the first axial region 108.

According to an embodiment, the outer conical surface portion 128 forms an (acute) angle with respect to the axial direction 104, e.g. an angle of about 5 to 25 degrees. Such a small acute angle 128 reduces abrasion of the outer surface of the drifting element.

According to an embodiment, in the contact area 302 the inner conical surface portion 204 of the catcher sub 200 conforms to the outer conical surface portion 128 of the drifting element. According to an embodiment, the contact area 302 is blocking at least some of the outlet ports of the lateral outlet, e.g. the outer openings of the first outlet ports 120.

It is noted that in such a case usually the seat 310 of the downhole tool 308 has a smaller diameter than the seat 204 of the catcher sub 200. In such a case, the method of operating the drifting system 300 may comprise pumping the drifting element 100 down the drillstring, monitoring the pressure in the drillstring above the drifting element and, if a pressure spike generated by the drifting element 100 upon landing in the catcher sub is detected (indicating the absence of an obstruction in the drillstring), pumping an activating element 312 for the tool down the drillstring and through the through flow passage 102 of the drifting<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> element into the seat 310 of the downhole tool 308. Hence, after the drifting the drillstring and activation of the downhole tool may be performed without retrieval of the drifting element. Due to the advantageous drifting system 300 according to embodiments of the herein disclosed subject matter, a reliably detectable pressure spike is generated in the drillstring upon landing of the drifting element 100 in the catcher sub 200 even if the drifting element 100 has a large clearance diameter 314 which allows the activating element 312 to pass the drifting element 100.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Further, it is noted that a retrieval of the drifting element is possible even without fish neck. For example, a hook assembly (not shown) may be configured to expand after passing through the through flow passage 102 of the drifting element 100, thereby a catching a lower edge 306 of the drifting element 100, thus allowing retrieval of the drifting element 100 e.g. by means of a wireline attached to the hook assembly. In other embodiments of, the drifting element 100 may stay in the catcher sub until the whole drillstring together with the catcher sub is tripped out of the bore hole (well).</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Finally it is noted that any conical surface portion described herein, of either the drifting element or the catcher sub, may according to respective embodiments form an acute angle with the axial direction which is less than 30 degrees and preferably less than 20 degrees or even less than 10 degrees. According to an embodiment, for a conical surface portion which is curved with regard to the axial direction, the above requirement is fulfilled for any point of the curved surface portion. In this regard, it should be understood that, in order to provide a "conical" surface portion, the acute angle with the axial direction is larger than 0 degrees, e.g. larger than 2 degrees or larger than 4 degrees.
