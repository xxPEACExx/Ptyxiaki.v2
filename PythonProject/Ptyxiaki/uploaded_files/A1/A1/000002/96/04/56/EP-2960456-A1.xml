The invention can be applied in passenger cars as well as in heavy duty vehicles such as trucks or buses.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In order to fulfil current stringent emission legislation more or less all vehicles with internal combustion engines are provided with an exhaust gas aftertreatment device comprising at least one catalytic converter substrate. A catalytic substrate generally comprises a channelled structure which exhaust gas can pass through while being exposed to the large surface area of the catalytic substrate. The channels of the catalytic substrates may be fluidly connected by perforating holes or like allowing gas to pass between adjacent channels. This enables gas to diffuse through the catalytic substrate structure. For petrol engines the most frequently used catalytic substrates are of Three Way Catalyst (TWC) type, while catalytic substrates of Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) type and/or Lean NOx Trap (LNT) type are the most frequently used catalytic substrates for diesel engines. It is also preferred that the TWC or the DOC/LNT is supplemented by a catalytic substrate with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) functionality for improved NOx reduction. Typically, when using a catalytic substrate of SCR type a liquid or gaseous reductant is added to the exhaust gas emission flow before the exhaust gas enters the catalytic substrate of SCR type. The addition of reductant enables the catalytic reduction were NOx is reduced to diatomic nitrogen, N2, and water, H2O. Catalytic substrates combining the functionalities of more than one type of catalytic substrate in one catalytic substrate also exist.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Combining more than one catalytic substrate can be problematic since exhaust gas aftertreatment devices often are associated with design restrains due to the limited available<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> space in the engine compartment. Thus, small exhaust gas aftertreatment devices are preferred from an engine packaging perspective, but small exhaust gas aftertreatment devices usually means that the flow distance between the inlet and the catalytic substrates of the exhaust gas aftertreatment device is limited. Limited distance means that the time and distance during which mixing of the exhaust gas emissions can occur is limited. Insufficient mixing of the exhaust gas emissions gives inhomogeneous exhaust gas emission mixture. This might e.g. be problematic for emission gas sensors, arranged in the exhaust gas emission flow, to work properly and give accurate emission measurements.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is also desirable that positioning of the inlet and outlet of the exhaust gas aftertreatment device is flexible and that said inlet and outlet not necessarily have to be aligned. Compact design and flexible positioning of the inlet and outlet enables optimized and minimized packing volume.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Other problematic areas for exhaust gas aftertreatment devices are high back pressure and insufficient heating. High back pressure implies significant exhaust gas flow resistance. This is negative for the efficiency of the combustion engine resulting in a decrease of power output. Compensation of such decrease in power output leads to an increase in fuel consumption. If there is a difference in back pressure between two possible flow paths the flow through the flow path with lowest backpressure will be larger than the flow through the flow path with the higher backpressure. The flow ratio will be in proportion to the difference in back pressure. Heating of the catalytic substrate is crucial since the catalytic substrate is most effective at relatively high temperatures. Thus, it is desirable that the catalytic substrate reaches its optimum operation temperature as soon as possible and that the catalytic substrate stays warm during operation.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Insufficient mixing of the exhaust gas emissions are of particular interest if an exhaust gas aftertreatment device with a catalytic substrate with SCR functionality is used. When a liquid reductant is used it is also desirable that the liquid reductant is evaporated. Consequently, sufficient mixing and reductant evaporation is essential for the catalytic substrate with SCR functionality to work properly. A homogenous exhaust gas and reductant mix, and suitable ratio between exhaust gas and injected reductant, is also beneficial for the catalytic properties of catalytic substrates of SCR type. The mixing of injected reductant and exhaust gas is benefitted by long distance between the reductant injecting device and the catalytic substrate of SCR type. The evaporation of injected reductant is also benefitted by long distance between<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the injection of reductant and the subsequently provided catalytic converter of SCR type such that the injected reductant can be exposed to hot exhaust gas for a longer period of time. Thus, compact design directly contradicts other desirable properties of the exhaust gas aftertreatment device such as sufficient mixing.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20080041036A1"><text>US 2008/0041036 A1</text></patcit> discloses a method for adding at least one, in particular liquid, reactant to an exhaust gas stream of an internal combustion engine and a device for treating an exhaust gas stream of an internal combustion engine.

The object is achieved by an exhaust gas aftertreatment device according to claim 1. Said exhaust gas aftertreatment device is provided in order to purify exhaust gas discharged from an internal combustion engine (ICE). By arranging two catalytic substrates close to each other in series, wherein the second catalytic substrate is of SCR type, and arranging said catalytic substrates such that the exhaust gas flow flowing through the first catalytic substrate angled relative an exhaust gas flow direction through the second catalytic substrate, a compact exhaust gas aftertreatment design is provided. Further advantages and advantageous features of the present invention are disclosed in the following description and in the dependent claims.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The exhaust gas aftertreatment device of the present invention is provided to be arranged downstream of an ICE such that exhaust gas discharged from the ICE can be purified. The exhaust gas aftertreatment device can be used both in vehicles with spark ignited engines and in vehicles with compression ignited engines. If the exhaust gas aftertreatment device is used in a vehicle with a diesel engine the first catalytic substrate is preferably of DOC type, LNT type or a combination thereof. If the exhaust gas aftertreatment device is used in a vehicle with a gasoline engine, or any other spark ignited fuels such as e.g. an ethanol based fuel, the first catalytic substrate may be of TWC type. In SCR systems a reductant is added to the exhaust gas flow in order for the substrate with SCR functionality to reduce NOx. The reductant, such as e.g. urea, anhydrous ammonia or aqueous ammonia, is added to the exhaust gas emission flow and such that it reacts with the NOx of the exhaust gas emissions.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The reductant evaporation is also benefitted by that the exhaust gas, and other components of the exhaust gas aftertreatment device, are as warm. The catalytic substrates are generally also most efficient at higher temperatures. Thus, it is desirable that the cooling of the exhaust gas aftertreatment device and the exhaust gas is minimized.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The mixing of reductant and exhaust gas and the evaporation of the reductant is also dependent on the injection characteristics. Injecting the reductant opposite, or at least crossing, the flow direction of the exhaust gas flow is beneficial for the mixing characteristics. In embodiments where the reductant is injected over the surface of a catalytic substrate it is desirable that the reductant is evenly distributed over a large designated area.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The exhaust gas aftertreatment device of the present invention comprises a housing, a first and a second catalytic substrate and a reductant injector. Said housing is provided to encapsulate said exhaust gas aftertreatment device. Said first and second substrate are arranged inside said housing and said first catalytic substrate is provided upstream of said second catalytic substrate. Such arrangement provides that an exhaust gas flow discharged from an ICE provided up stream of the exhaust gas aftertreatment device will pass through the first catalytic substrate before passing the second catalytic substrate. Said reductant injector is arranged in between said first and said second catalytic substrate such that reductant is added to the exhaust gas flow before said exhaust gas flow reaches the second catalytic substrate which preferably is of SCR type.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Said first catalytic substrate is arranged such that a fluid flow, according to the present invention in form of an exhaust gas flow, passes said first catalytic substrate in a first main flow direction, and said second catalytic substrate is arranged such that a fluid flow passes said second catalytic substrate in a second main flow direction, wherein said first and second main flow directions are angled to each other. An angled design provides flexibility when it comes to vehicle packaging requirements. Further, a flow redirecting wall is arranged downstream of said first catalytic substrate, whereby a fluid flow, preferably exhaust gas discharged from an ICE, between said first catalytic substrate and said second catalytic substrate at least partially is redirected such that said fluid flow passes an outer circumference of said first catalytic substrate before reaching said second catalytic substrate. Said redirecting wall is inclined to an outlet surface of said first catalytic substrate with a first angle. The redirecting wall is thereby inclined in relation to said first main flow direction out of the first catalytic substrate such that said fluid flow approaching said redirecting wall may perform a rotational movement. Said reductant injector is arranged at said redirecting wall at a position with a first distance, in said first main flow direction of said first catalytic substrate, which is further away from said outlet surface than an average distance between said outlet surface and said redirecting wall. Said reductant injector is directed with a second angle to said outlet surface of said first catalytic surface. The redirecting wall may also be provided with a catalytic surface providing additional emission degrading properties.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A two catalytic substrate exhaust gas aftertreatment device with as compact design as of the present invention, which normally would imply short distance between the two catalytic substrates, would normally be problematic due to insufficient mixing. However said redirecting wall of the present invention enables that exhaust gas is at least partially redirected and is passing the outer circumference of said first catalytic substrate before reaching said second catalytic substrate. Arranging said reductant injector at the redirecting wall also improves evaporation of reductant. Arranging said reductant upstream of the outer circumference from a flow direction perspective also ensures that the distance during which mixing can occur before reaching the second catalytic substrate is sufficient.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Arranging said reductant injector at the second end of said inclined redirecting wall enables that said reductant injector can be arranged further away from the outlet surface of the first catalytic substrate, whereby the reductant will mix with and be exposed to hot exhaust gases<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> for a longer period of time before reaching said outlet surface. It also enables that said first angle can be provided such that said reductant can be distributed over a larger area of said outlet surface than would have been possible if said reductant injector e.g. was provided at a position centrally of said redirecting wall. Both increased mixing and exposure to hot exhaust gas and the distribution of reductant over a larger surface are beneficial for the evaporation characteristics.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The redirection of the exhaust gas by said redirecting wall does not only prolong the distance between said first and second catalytic substrate, by directing the hot exhaust gas such that the exhaust gas pass the outer circumference of said first catalytic substrate before reaching said second catalytic substrate the cooling of said first catalytic substrate will be minimized.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to one aspect of the present invention said redirecting wall is directing the exhaust gas flow such that at least a main part of the fluid flow between said first catalytic substrate and said second catalytic substrate is directed in an opposite direction from said first main flow direction of said first catalytic substrate. As previously stated, injecting reductant opposite the exhaust gas flow is beneficial for the exhaust gas and reductant mixing.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Further, said redirecting wall is provided with a first and a second end, wherein said ends are provided essentially opposite each other. Said first end is a point of said redirecting wall furthest away from said outlet surface of said first catalytic substrate and said second end is a point of said redirecting wall positioned closest to said outlet surface of said first catalytic substrate. Both said first and said second end is arranged in level with an outer circumference of said first substrate. Arranging said first and said second end accordingly provides that the redirecting wall is inclined as of the present invention.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The outer surface of said housing formed by the redirecting wall may e.g. be rounded or spherically shaped. The important feature of said surface is that it enables said redirecting wall to be provided such that a first and a second end is formed, wherein the first end is provided at a longer distance from said outlet surface of said first catalytic substrate than said second end, such that said redirected wall is inclined.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to one aspect of the present invention said reductant injector is arranged at a vicinity of said first end of said redirecting wall. Arranging said reductant injector at said first<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> end provides best possible injection characteristics allowed by the design of the exhaust gas aftertreatment. As previously stated, in embodiments where the reductant is injected over the surface of a catalytic substrate it is desirable that the reductant is evenly distributed over a large designated area. By arranging the reductant injector far away from the outlet surface this is achieved.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to another aspect of the exhaust gas aftertreatment device said second catalytic substrate is arranged in the vicinity of said second end.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According yet another aspect of the present invention said redirecting wall is provided with at least one guiding means. Said guiding means enables that said fluid flow from said first catalytic substrate is directed over at least a portion of said outer circumference of said first catalytic substrate before reaching said second catalytic substrate. Said guiding means are provided such that at least a portion of said fluid flow is directed to said redirecting wall. At said redirecting wall said fluid flow will be redirected to flow over at least a portion of said outer circumference of said first catalytic substrate. Thus, said guiding means prevents said fluid flow to, after passing said first catalytic substrate, directly flow to said second catalytic substrate without passing at least a portion of said outer circumference of said first catalytic surface. This will secure that said fluid flow is at least partially mixed with injected reductant before reaching said second catalytic substrate.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The larger said guiding means is the larger portion of said fluid flow is forced to flow over said outer circumference of said first catalytic substrate.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Said guiding means is disclosed more in detail in the detailed description.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to one aspect of the present invention the guide seals against the housing and seals against the outer circumference of said first substrate such that a fluid flow passing said first catalytic substrate is fully redirected at the redirecting wall to pass said outer circumference of said first catalytic substrate.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The channelled structure of a catalytic substrate forms a main flow direction through the catalytic substrate. According to a preferred aspect of the present invention the exhaust gas aftertreatment device is arranged in an angle of essentially 90 degrees. Such arrangement may be advantageous from a vehicle packaging perspective. Thus, according to one aspect of the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> present invention said first main flow direction through said first catalytic substrate and said second main flow direction through said second catalytic substrates are essentially perpendicular to each other. Thus, after passing the first catalytic substrate the exhaust gas flow will be redirected at said redirecting wall and subsequently by passing the outer circumference of said first catalytic substrate such that the exhaust gas flow enters and flows through the second catalytic substrate in a main flow direction essentially perpendicular to said first main flow direction through said first catalytic substrate. According to still one aspect of the present invention said first catalytic substrate is provided with a diameter essentially corresponding to a length, in the first main flow direction, of said first catalytic substrate. Such arrangement provides a compact exhaust gas aftertreatment design with favourable backpressure characteristics and excellent packaging properties. High back pressure is disadvantageous from a fuel consumption and engine efficiency perspective. The large flow through surface of the latter aspect of the present invention provides a low backpressure.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">According to another aspect of the present invention said reductant injector is a high pressure injector injecting reductant at pressures higher than what conventionally is used for injection of reductant in SCR systems. According to a preferred aspect may such higher pressures be between 25 and 75 bar. According to yet an even more preferred aspect of the present invention may such higher pressure be essentially 50 bar. High injection pressure provides that the reductant can be distributed as smaller droplets, over a larger surface area and that the reductant can be added in shorter injection pulses. High pressure injectors also provide that the injected reductant better can penetrate an exhaust gas flow, enabling that a surface provided at a distance from a reductant injector still can be reached. This is e.g. desirable in configurations where the reductant is injected essentially in a direction opposite the exhaust gas flow. For some aspects of the present invention the reductant injectors may be of air pressure assisted type.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As previously stated, in order for a catalytic substrate to be as effective as possible it is desirable that the exhaust gas flow through a catalytic substrate is homogenous. This can be accomplished either by providing such that the flow entering the catalytic substrate is homogenous or such that the flow is homogenously distributed in the catalytic substrate. Thus, according to one aspect of the present invention the flow through properties of said<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> second substrate is adapted such that the flow through said second catalytic substrate is essentially homogenous.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">According to yet one aspect of the present invention said outlet surface of said first catalytic substrate is provided with a surface configured to protect against corrosion or like. Said surface is also preferably configured to contribute to the degradation of the injected reductant. As previously stated, it is desirable that the reductant is completely evaporated. The higher the degree of evaporated reductant is the more efficient will the NOx reduction be at the second catalytic substrate of SCR type. The first catalytic substrate will be heated by the hot exhaust gas, discharged from the ICE, flowing through the first catalytic substrate. Additionally, the cooling of the outer portions of the first catalytic substrate will be minimized due to the redirected exhaust gas passing the outer circumference of the first catalytic substrate. Thus, the first catalytic substrate will have a substantially homogenous temperature. Consequently, the evaporation of reductant will be improved by spraying reductant onto the warm surface of the first catalytic substrate.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">According to one aspect of the present invention said surface is configured to resist a spray of injected reductant by applying a hydrolytic coating on said surface, improving the emission degrading properties of the first catalytic substrate even more. According to other aspects of the present invention other coatings are used such as e.g. coatings improving the durability.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The present invention also comprises a vehicle provided with an exhaust gas aftertreatment device according to the present invention.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0033" num="0033">Aspects of the present invention will now be described with reference to figures, wherein:

The exemplary exhaust gas aftertreatment device 1a comprises a first catalytic substrate 8 and a second catalytic substrate 9 of SCR type. The first catalytic substrate 8 may be of DOC type, LNT type or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">It is generally desirable that exhaust gas aftertreatment devices, even when comprising two catalytic substrates, are as compact as possible due to the limited space in vehicles for mounting such device. However, compact, two substrate exhaust gas aftertreatment devices generally means that the distance between the substrates is limited which may be problematic e.g. from an exhaust gas mixing perspective. Where catalytic substrates of SCR types are used compact arrangements may also be problematic since evaporation and reductant/exhaust gas mixing characteristics may be neglected.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">According to the aspect of the present invention disclosed in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1</figref> the discharged exhaust gas enters said exhaust gas aftertreatment device 1a in a first main flow direction A of the first catalytic substrate 8. Said exhaust gas aftertreatment device 1a is further provided with a housing 3, encapsulating said exhaust gas aftertreatment device 1a, and a reductant injector 10 provided to inject reductant upstream of said second catalytic substrate 9. Said housing 3 forms a redirecting wall 11 provided between said first and said second catalytic substrates 8, 9. At said redirecting wall 11 the exhaust gas flow is redirected such that said exhaust gas will turn to flow in a flow direction essentially opposite said first main flow direction A and subsequently turn additionally to flow in a second main flow direction B, wherein B is essentially perpendicular to said first main flow direction A. Said first catalytic substrate 8 is provided such that an outer circumference 15 of said fist catalytic substrate 8 is provided<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> within and at a distance from said housing 3, wherein said redirected exhaust gas flow passes said outer circumference 15 of said first catalytic substrate 8 when being redirected and turning from said first main flow direction A to said second main flow direction B.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">According to the exemplary aspect of an exhaust gas aftertreatment device 1a disclosed in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1a</figref> said first main flow direction A of the first catalytic substrate 8 is essentially perpendicular to said second main flow direction B of the second catalytic substrate 9, wherein an outlet portion 19 of said exhaust gas aftertreatment device 1a is essentially perpendicular to said inlet portion 18.

Further, said first catalytic substrate 8 comprises an outlet surface 12a, wherein a distance D-1 between said first end 13 and said outlet surface 12a in said first main flow direction A is longer than an average distance D-AV in said first main flow direction A between said outlet surface 12a and said redirecting wall 11. Said reductant injector 10 is directed with a first angle a to said outlet surface 12a of said first catalytic substrate and said redirecting wall is inclined with an angle b to said outlet surface 12a.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">That the redirecting wall in inclined with the angle b in regards to the outlet surface 12a and that the reductant injector 10 is directed towards said outlet surface 12a with the angle a enables that the reductant injector 10 is provided further away from the outlet surface 12a, than would be possible if the redirecting wall and the outlet surface 12 where arranged in parallel, and that reductant can be injected over a larger area of the outlet surface 12a, than would be possible if the reductant injector 10 was arranged somewhere in the middle of the first and second ends 13, 14.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The exemplary embodiment disclosed in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1a</figref> provides a compact exhaust gas aftertreatment device 1a. The redirection of the exhaust gas flow at the redirecting wall 11 provides that sufficient mixing is obtained before reaching said second catalytic substrate 9 since that distance during which mixing can occur is prolonged. Additionally, by arranging said reductant injector 10 at said first end 13, which is provided as far away from said outlet<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> surface 12a as the design allows the evaporation of the injected reductant and the mixing of reductant and exhaust gas is maximised.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">According to the aspect of the present invention disclosed in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1a</figref> said first catalytic substrate 8 has a length L-1 which is about equal to a diameter D-2 of said second catalytic substrate 9.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1b</figref> shows a cross sectional view of the exemplary aspect of the exhaust gas aftertreatment device 1a of the present invention disclosed in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1a</figref>, visualizing the movement of the exhaust gas flow when passing the outer circumference 15 of first catalytic substrate 8. After passing said outer circumference 15 of first catalytic substrate 8 on the inside of the housing 3, the exhaust gas flow will pass the second catalytic substrate 9 in the second main flow direction B of the second catalytic substrate 9.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2a</figref> shows a second embodiment of an exhaust gas aftertreatment device 1b according to the present invention. One feature of the embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2a</figref> that is configured differently than for the embodiment disclosed in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1a and 1b</figref> is the outlet surface 12b of the first catalytic substrate 8. The outlet surface 12a of the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1a</figref> is perpendicular to said first flow direction A through said first catalytic substrate 8 whereas the outlet surface 12b of the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1b</figref> is inclined in an angle c which is less than 90 degrees. The configuration of said outlet surface 12b enables that a larger surface area of said outlet surface 12b is facing the reductant injector 10. Corresponding to what previously has been described in relation to <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1a and 1b</figref> reductant is injected, by spraying, into the exhaust gas flow by a reductant injector 10. The configuration of said outlet surface 12b increases the distance between the reductant injector 10 and the outlet surface 12b, which will prolong the time and distance for reductant evaporation and mixing. If unevaporated reductant still reaches the outlet surface 12b the configuration of the outlet surface 12b enables that unevaporated reductant is more evenly distributed over the outlet surface 12b. The evaporation of the unevaporated reductant reaching the outlet surface 12b of the first catalytic substrate 8 is promoted by that the first catalytic substrate 8 is heated by the hot exhaust gas flow. Thus, the configuration of the outlet surface 12b is beneficial from an reductant evaporation standpoint both due to the prolonged distance for mixing and evaporation and due to the larger surface facing the reductant injector.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The exhaust gas aftertreatment device 1b of the exemplary aspect of the present invention shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2a</figref> additionally comprises guiding means 17.

The guiding means 17 provide that at least a portion of the exhaust gas flow after passing said first catalytic substrate 8 is forced to said redirecting wall 11 where it will be redirected to pass said outer circumference 15 of the first catalytic substrate 8. The larger guiding means 17 that are used, the larger portion of the exhaust gas flow from said first catalytic substrate 12b is forced to pass said outer circumference 15. Said arrangement comprising guiding means 17 may improve the mixing of exhaust gas flow and injected reductant and can be used to secure that no exhaust gas flow can flow directly from said first catalytic substrate 8 to said second catalytic substrate 9, without at least passing a small portion of the outer circumference 15.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Further, according to the exemplary aspect of the present invention shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2a</figref> an angle c between the first main flow direction A of the first catalytic substrate 8 and a third main flow direction C of the second catalytic substrate 9 is less than 90 degrees. Depending on design and related packaging requirements of the vehicle arranging the second catalytic substrate essentially perpendicular in regards to the first catalytic substrate may be problematic or even impossible. Thus, such arrangement, where said angle is less than 90 degrees, as well as aspects where said angle is more than 90 degrees, may be advantageous for different vehicle designs with different packaging requirements.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2b</figref> discloses a cross sectional view of the exemplary aspect of the exhaust gas aftertreatment device 1b of the present invention disclosed in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2a.
