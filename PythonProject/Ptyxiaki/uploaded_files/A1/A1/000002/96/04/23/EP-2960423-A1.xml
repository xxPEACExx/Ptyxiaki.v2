The lifting cords or chains have been mounted so that the blind can be lifted up into a roll or folded together by means of them and be brought down again to be opened or unbent.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The roller blind has been lifted up into a roll in its upper position. Pleated blinds are otherwise like roller blinds but they are folded instead of being rolled.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">All of the above mentioned shades are moved up and down steplessly in a known way with cord, chain, spring or electrical mechanisms.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The cords and chains of different blinds, such as the functional loops of roller blinds, can cause a risk of strangling for children, since the children can put their head through the loop. Hanging long cords and loops have therefore been classified as sources of danger.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Long cords and chains can be kept unreachable for children by means of different accessories for the blinds, or minimization of the risk of strangling can otherwise be taken into consideration in the design of the products.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to regulations of today, i.e. the EU standards EN 13120, EN 16433 and EN 16434, cords and loops have to be kept away from being reached by the children e.g. by wrapping<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the cords to the wall around a hook or to another suitable attachment point at least on a height of 1,5 m from the floor.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Some small windows that are generally used in many European countries can be opened so that they are opened from above and are tilting inwards. A blind is often used in these windows as a visual obstruction during the ventilation. In these case, such a sc. Mini Cassette is generally used, which has side lists that can be taped to the window frame. The blind is kept in place behind the side lists even if the window has been opened from above and tilts inwards. However, in this situation, the loop of the cord or chain is freely hanging but people prefer not to fasten separate hooks or the like to the window frames through which the cord or chain loop would pass.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Neither is there so far a solution for a problem that arises when a blind or the like is mounted on a distance from the wall or e.g. to a balcony with no possibilities to fasten the chain or cord to the wall.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The object of the invention is therefore a new and alternative safety solution that works in all conditions and as an alternative for fastening the cord or chain loop to the wall.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The invention is concerned with a blind that can be lift up and having fastening members that can be mounted to a window frame, wall or the like. The blind has a lifting mechanism, with which the blind can be moved between an upper position and a lower position. The lifting mechanism consists of a lifting strap that forms a loop. The blind is mainly characterized in that the lifting strap is placed inside a side list in the blind. The lifting strap can be moved by means of a handle that is connected to the side list.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The preferable embodiments of the invention have the characteristics of the sub claims.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">At the front side (that is facing the room), the lifting strap has been mounted to be moved in a groove inside the side list and to continue around a round-shaped part at the lower edge of the side list and further to the back side of the side list in order to form a loop. The round-shaped<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> part is for example a pin positioned in a corner piece placed at the lower edge of the side list.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The handle can be realized in different ways. It can be connected to permanently move together with the strap or it can be foreseen with a spring by means of which an inner part of the handle can be moved inside the outer part of the handle to lock the handle to the lifting strap and analogously, to free the handle from the lifting strap. In such a way, the handle can be moved without moving the lifting strap, when the handle is loose from the lifting strap.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The lifting strap is in the first hand a chain or a ball chain, but it can equally well be a cord, a band or a thread. The blind is in the first hand designed to be a roller blind but can also be a pleated blind.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the following, the invention will be presented by means of some figures and embodiments.

The support member of the blind 4 can be fastened to the wall by means of the fastening members 6. Usually, the fastening members 6 are brackets fastened to the ceiling or the wall.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The blind 4 can be moved up and down between an upper position and a lower position by means of a lifting mechanism 2, which in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> is a chain loop, by means of which the lifting and lowering in question takes place by pulling from the chain.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The solution used in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> for the lifting mechanism 2 includes a pressure spring inside the side winder that uses a chain drive. The pressure spring is released by pulling from the chain loop, whereby the blind can be brought up and down. When the pulling is stopped, the spring is again pressed against the axis and the blind stays on its place.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, the lifting strap 2 is freely hanging and can cause a risk of strangling for children, since children can put their head through the loop when they are playing. To keep such a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> lifting strap unreachable for children, it should be fastened to a hook in the wall or other suitable fastening point at a height of at least 1,5 m from the floor.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The loop of the lifting cord or chain would still hang and the fastening would require separate fastening members or the like to be fastened to the wall.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the invention, the lifting strap 2 is placed inside a side list 1 in the blind 4 as in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>, wherein an embodiment of the invention is presented. The lifting strap 2a has been brought inside the side list 1 by placing it in a groove 10 in the side list 1.

Here in this <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 4b</figref>, the handle 3' is foreseen with a spring 12, by means of which an inner part 13 of the handle 3' can be moved inside an outer part 11 in order to lock the handle 3' to the string 2b and to release the same form the string, respectively.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">When the spring is pressed down to the bottom, the handle 3' is free from the cord 2b, whereby it can be moved without moving the cord 2b. When the spring 12 is released, the handle 3' moves together with the cord 2b. Naturally, a ball chain or other lifting strap 2 could be used in this embodiment as well.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref> presents the construction of a blind of the invention from behind.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5a</figref> is a detailed partial view of <figref idrefs="f0005">figure 5</figref>, wherein the position and path of the lifting strap 2 can be seen more in detail. The lifting strap, which in <figref idrefs="f0005">figure 5a</figref> is a ball chain 2a moves in front of the side list 1 and continues around a round-shaped part 14 at the lower edge of the side list 1 behind the side list 1 thus forming a loop. The round-shaped part 14<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> is e.g. a pin positioned in the corner piece 7 at the lower edge of the side list 1. In the corner piece 7 there is also a guiding part 15 that locks the side list 1 on its place and guides the lifting strap 2a around the round-shaped part 14.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0006">Figures 6 and 6a</figref> otherwise presents the same constructions as <figref idrefs="f0005">figures 5 and 5a</figref> except that it is a cord 2b that is used as lifting strap, which moves in front (referenced as 2b") of the side list 1 and continues around a round-shaped part 14 fastened in a corner piece 7 at the lower edge of the side list 1 and further behind (referenced as 2b") the side list 1 thereby forming a loop.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90459764" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A blind (4) that can be lift up and having fastening members (6') that can be mounted to a window frame, wall or the like and further having a lifting mechanism by means of which the blind (4) can be moved between an upper position and a lower position and which lifting mechanism consists of a lifting strap (2, 2a, 2b) forming a loop, <b>characterized in that</b> the lifting strap (2, 2a, 2b) is positioned in a side list (1) in the blind (4), and which lifting strap (2, 2a, 2b) can be moved by means of a handle (3, 3') connected to the lifting strap (2, 2a, 2b).</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0002" num="0002"><claim-text>A blind (4) of claim 1, <b>characterized in that</b> in the front of the side list (1), the lifting strap (2, 2a, 2b) moves in a groove (10) inside the side list (1) and continues around a round-shaped part (14) in the lower edge of the side list (1) behind the side list (1) thereby forming a loop.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0003" num="0003"><claim-text>A blind (4) of claim 2, <b>characterized in that</b> the round-shaped part (14) is in a corner piece (7) placed at the lower edge of the side list (1).</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0004" num="0004"><claim-text>A blind (4) of any of claim 1, 2, 3, or 4, <b>characterized in that</b> the handle (3) is fastened to the lifting strap (2, 2a, 2b) to move together with the lifting strap (2, 2a, 2b).</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0005" num="0005"><claim-text>A blind (4) of any of claim 1, 2, 3, or 4, <b>characterized in that</b> the handle (3') is foreseen with a spring (12), by means of which the inner part (11) of the handle (3') can be moved inside the outer part of the handle (3') to lock the handle (3') to the lifting strap (1) and to release it from the lifting strap (2, 2a, 2b), respectively.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0006" num="0006"><claim-text>A blind (4) of any of claim 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, <b>characterized in that</b> the lifting strap (2) is a chain (2a), a ball chain, cord (2b) or a band.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0007" num="0007"><claim-text>A blind (4) of any of claim 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,or 6, <b>characterized in that</b> the blind (4) is a roller blind or a pleated blind.</claim-text></claim></claims><drawings mxw-id="PDW20422478" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --><figure id="f0001" num="1"><img id="if0001" file="imgf0001.tif" wi="146" he="194" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --><figure id="f0002" num="2,2a,2b"><img id="if0002" file="imgf0002.tif" wi="165" he="188" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --><figure id="f0003" num="3,3a"><img id="if0003" file="imgf0003.tif" wi="165" he="146" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --><figure id="f0004" num="4,4a,4b"><img id="if0004" file="imgf0004.tif" wi="165" he="215" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --><figure id="f0005" num="5,5a"><img id="if0005" file="imgf0005.tif" wi="165" he="154" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --><figure id="f0006" num="6,6a"><img id="if0006" file="imgf0006.tif" wi="165" he="165" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><search-report-data><doc-page id="srep0001" file="srep0001.tif" wi="159" he="233" type="tif"/><doc-page id="srep0002" file="srep0002.tif" wi="159" he="233" type="tif"/></search-report-data><copyright>User acknowledges that Fairview Research LLC and its third party providers retain all right, title and interest in and to this xml under applicable copyright laws.
