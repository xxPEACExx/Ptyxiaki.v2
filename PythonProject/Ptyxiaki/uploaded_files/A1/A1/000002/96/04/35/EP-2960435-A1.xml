Furthermore the invention relates to a gas turbine comprising at least one transition duct and a method of manufacturing a transition duct.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Gas turbine engines include a compressor, a combustor and a turbine arranged in flow series and generally about a rotational axis. During operation, the compressor supplies compressed air to the combustor and which is mixed with a gaseous or liquid fuel. The air/fuel mixture is then burned and the combustion gas is channelled via a transition duct to the turbine section. The combustion gases force rotation of the turbine which in turn drives the compressor via an interconnecting shaft. For gas turbine engines having a cannular combustor arrangement, which is an annular array of combustor cans each having at least one a burner and a combustion chamber, the transition duct has typically a circular inlet that interfaces with the combustor chamber and an outlet in the form of an annular segment. An annular array of transition duct outlets form an annulus for channelling the combustion gases to the turbine.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The transition duct is manufactured from sheet metal walls or could be cast having relatively large surface areas. These large surfaces incur significant thermal expansions and contractions which cause stresses within the walls. These thermal stresses are increased where there is a significant thermal gradient. In addition, the inherent geometry of the transition duct, which transitions from a circular inlet to an annular segment and the interfaces between the combustor and turbine, creates unique stress regimes when subjected to the hot working gases from the combustor.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The service life of the transition duct is partly determined by the absolute temperature it experiences and the temperature distribution or gradient across the component. To protect the component material from over-heating, conventionally thermal-barrier coatings (TBC) are applied on the hot gas exposed area and often the entire hot side of the part, which in this case<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> is the internal surface of the transition duct. Here the temperature distribution of the combustion gas flow egressing the combustor is not uniform and therefore the application and uniform thickness of TBC is determined by the maximum temperature experienced and the material's thermal capability. The temperature difference across the transition duct's internal surface can be in the region of 700°C. TBC is applied to the entire internal surface of the transition duct because failure of the TBC commonly occurs at the edges or discontinuities of the TBC. Failure is usually a debonding of the TBC material from the surface of the transition duct or cracking of the TBC. For this reason, conventional application of TBC is made to the entire internal surface of the transition duct which includes an inlet ring and an exit flange that form a complex geometrical shape.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Conventional application of TBC is in a uniform thickness and to the entire internal surface of the transition duct and which is satisfactory in reducing the temperature experienced by the sheet metal wall material. However, there remains a considerable thermal gradient across the transition duct and in-service experience has uncovered thermally-induced debonding and cracking of the TBC because of thermal stresses.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">To address the problems of known transition ducts described above and for the advantages described below, there is provided a gas turbine engine having a combustor, a turbine and a transition duct, the transition duct is located between the combustor and the turbine to channel hot gas from the combustor to the turbine, the transition duct has an internal surface on which the hot gas impinges to cause a varying temperature profile over the internal surface, a thermal barrier coating is located on the internal surface and comprises at least a first thermal barrier coating patch and a second thermal barrier coating patch, the first thermal barrier coating patch having a first predetermined thickness located on the internal surface and within a first area subject to a higher temperature than an uncoated part of the internal surface and bounded by a first isotherm of a first predetermined temperature, the second thermal barrier coating patch having a second predetermined thickness located on the internal surface and within a second area subject to a higher temperature than the uncoated<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> part of the internal surface and bounded by a second isotherm of a second predetermined temperature, wherein the second predetermined temperature is higher than the first predetermined temperature and the second predetermined thickness is thicker than the first predetermined thickness.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The thickness may be a minimum thickness within the first thermal barrier coating patch and/or the second thermal barrier coating patch, and the minimum thickness is located about the respective first isotherm and/or second isotherm.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The thermal barrier coating may comprise a transition portion, the transition portion has a varying thickness.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The thermal barrier coating comprises a step.

The gas turbine engine 10 comprises, in flow series, an inlet 12, a compressor section 14, a combustor section 16 and a turbine section 18 which are generally arranged in flow series and generally about and in the direction of a longitudinal or rotational axis 20. The gas turbine engine 10 further comprises a shaft 22 which is rotatable about the rotational axis 20 and which extends longitudinally through the gas turbine engine 10. The shaft 22 drivingly connects the turbine section 18 to the compressor section 14.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In operation of the gas turbine engine 10, air 24, which is taken in through the air inlet 12 is compressed by the compressor section 14 and delivered to the combustion section or burner section 16. The burner section 16 comprises a burner plenum 26, one or more combustion chambers 28 and at least one burner 30 fixed to each combustion chamber 28. The combustion chambers 28 and the burners 30 are located inside the burner plenum 26. The compressed air passing through the compressor 14 enters a diffuser 32 and is discharged from the diffuser 32 into the burner plenum 26 from where a portion of the air enters the burner 30 and is mixed with a gaseous or liquid fuel. The air/fuel mixture is then burned and the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> combustion gas 34 or working gas from the combustion is channelled through the combustion chamber 28 to the turbine section 18 via a transition duct 17.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">This exemplary gas turbine engine 10 has a cannular combustor section arrangement 16, which is constituted by an annular array of combustor cans 19 each having the burner 30 and the combustion chamber 28, the transition duct 17 has a generally circular inlet that interfaces with the combustor chamber 28 and an outlet in the form of an annular segment. An annular array of transition duct outlets form an annulus for channelling the combustion gases to the turbine 18.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The turbine section 18 comprises a number of blade carrying discs 36 attached to the shaft 22. In the present example, two discs 36 each carry an annular array of turbine blades 38. However, the number of blade carrying discs could be different, i.e. only one disc or more than two discs. In addition, guiding vanes 40, which are fixed to a stator 42 of the gas turbine engine 10, are disposed between the stages of annular arrays of turbine blades 38. Between the exit of the combustion chamber 28 and the leading turbine blades 38 inlet guiding vanes 44 are provided and turn the flow of working gas onto the turbine blades 38.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The combustion gas from the combustion chamber 28 enters the turbine section 18 and drives the turbine blades 38 which in turn rotate the shaft 22. The guiding vanes 40, 44 serve to optimise the angle of the combustion or working gas on the turbine blades 38.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The turbine section 18 drives the compressor section 14. The compressor section 14 comprises an axial series of vane stages 46 and rotor blade stages 48. The rotor blade stages 48 comprise a rotor disc supporting an annular array of blades. The compressor section 14 also comprises a casing 50 that surrounds the rotor stages and supports the vane stages 48. The guide vane stages include an annular array of radially extending vanes that are mounted to the casing 50. The vanes are provided to present gas flow at an optimal angle for the blades at a given engine operational point. Some of the guide vane stages have variable vanes, where the angle of the vanes, about their own longitudinal axis, can be adjusted for angle according to air flow characteristics that can occur at different engine operations conditions.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The casing 50 defines a radially outer surface 52 of the passage 56 of the compressor 14. A radially inner surface 54 of the passage 56 is at least partly defined by a rotor drum 53 of the rotor which is partly defined by the annular array of blades 48.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The present invention is described with reference to the above exemplary turbine engine having a single shaft or spool connecting a single, multi-stage compressor and a single, one or more stage turbine.

The terms forward and rearward refer to the general flow of gas through the engine. The terms axial, radial and circumferential are made with reference to the rotational axis 20 of the engine.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIGS. 2 and 3</b></figref> which show two perspective views on the inlet and outlet respectively of a transition duct 17 and in accordance with the present invention. The transition duct 17 has a generally circular inlet 50 that interfaces and connects to the downstream end of the combustor can 27 and an outlet 52 in the form of an annular segment that connects to the turbine 18. An annular array of transition ducts forms an annulus for channelling the combustion gasses to the turbine. The transition duct 17 has internal surfaces 54, 55, 56, 57 that are radially inner, radially outer and opposing lateral internal surfaces respectively. Referring back to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG.1</figref>, the radially inner internal surface 54 and the radially outer internal surface 55 are also referenced for clarity.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The transition duct 17 is manufactured from sheet metal, which define the wall or walls, generally denoted 51, and having relatively large surface areas, in particular internal surfaces 54 and 55. These large surfaces incur significant thermal expansions and contractions which cause internal stresses in the sheet metal. These thermal stresses are increased where there is a significant thermal gradient over the surfaces and throughout the walls 51 of the transition duct. In addition, the inherent geometry of the transition duct, which transitions from a generally circular inlet 50 to an annular segment outlet 52 and the interfaces between the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> combustor and turbine, creates unique stress regimes when subjected to the hot working gases from the combustor. In some gas turbines and dependent on the thermal loading, the transition duct 17 may comprise one wall of sheet metal, as shown here, and an outer wall. Cooling air is often supplied between the two wall of sheet metal to cool the components via convection and conduction from its surfaces. The present invention is equally applicable to these double walled transition ducts.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0003"><b>FIG.4</b></figref> is a view on the radially inner internal surface 54 and depicts an approximate thermal contour plot of the temperature of the surface of a transition duct 17 during operation of the turbine engine 10. The contour plot includes a series of isotherms 60-64 that each connect points of equal temperature and demarcate areas 65-70 of the surface that indicate a range of temperatures between the isotherms. Generally, the isotherms 60-64 increase in temperature from the inlet 50 to the outlet 52. Therefore, the surface temperature experienced by the areas 65-70 increases from area 65 to area 70.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The temperature distribution of the combustion gas flow 34 egressing the combustor 16 is not uniform and which therefore incurs a significant temperature difference or gradient across the transition duct 17 which can be in the region of 700°C. Furthermore and as can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG.1</figref> a centre-line 35 of the combustor 16 is incident on the radially inner internal surface 54. Therefore the combustion gases 34 have a tendency to impinge on a particular area of the internal surface 54 and in this example surface areas 69 and 70 incur particularly high temperatures and therefore temperature gradients causing high thermally induces stresses and strains within the transition duct wall 51 material. This impingement of the combustor gases further exacerbates the temperature gradient throughout the transition duct 17.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">For the absence of doubt it is one object of the present invention to reduce the temperature of the surface of the wall of the transition duct and therefore the bulk temperature of the wall itself. The presence of a thermal barrier coating reduces the temperature of the surface of the transition duct wall under and by virtue of the thermal barrier coating and therefore the temperature of the wall is correspondingly reduced. Where<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> applied, the outer surface of the thermal barrier coating still experiences the same or nearly the same hot gases temperatures as an uncoated wall surface.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0003"><b>FIG.5</b></figref> is a similar view to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG.4</figref> of the radially inner internal surface 54. A thermal barrier coating generally shown as 100 having a first thickness is applied to a first patch 72P which is bounded by line 73. The line 73 is a boundary of the first patch 72P and denotes a first predetermined isotherm value. The line 73 is smoothed between isotherm points so that the TBC patch has a smooth edge or boundary. The metal or wall temperature within the first area 72A is limited or reduced by virtue of the TBC. The thermal barrier coating 100 has a second thickness and is applied to a second patch 74P which is bounded by line 75. The line 75 is a boundary of the second patch 74P and denotes a second predetermined isotherm value. The line 75 is smoothed between isotherm points so that the TBC patch has a smooth edge or boundary. The metal or wall temperature within the second area 70 is limited by virtue of the TBC having a second thickness. The thickness of or within the second TBC patch 74P is greater than the thickness of the first TBC patch 72P. By virtue of the greater thickness of the second TBC patch 74P greater thermal protection is afforded the underlying wall 51 or internal surface temperature. In this way the temperatures experienced by the underlying wall surface 54 in the areas 69 and 70 are reduced or similar to those in the neighbouring uncoated area or areas. Thus the temperature gradient is reduced across the surface 54. The absolute temperatures of the wall's 51 internal surface 54 within the areas 70 and 69 underlying the TBC patches 74P and 72P are reduced and are approximately similar. Thus in reducing the temperature gradient, stresses and strains in the walls 51 of the transition duct are also reduced.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The temperature value of the predetermined isotherm boundary lines 73, 75 of the TBC patches 72 and 74 are determined by a number of factors including the temperature profile across the surface, the properties of the TBC to protect the underlying surface 54, the temperature capability and thermal expansion characteristics of the transition duct wall material and the mechanical stress-strain characteristics of the transition duct during engine operation.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0039" num="0039"><figref idrefs="f0004"><b>FIG. 6</b></figref> is a schematic of section A-A shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref> showing a first arrangement of varying thickness 72P, 74P of thermal barrier coating 100. The thermal barrier coating 100 overlies part of the internal surface 54 of the wall 51. The internal surface 54 has a nominal surface profile, for example where this thermal barrier coating 100 is applied as a retrofit or refurbishment. The thermal barrier coating 100 having a first thickness 72T is applied to the first patch 72P which is bounded by the first predetermined isotherm line 73. Thermal barrier coating 100 having a second thickness 74T is applied to the second patch 74P which is bounded by line 75. The line 75 is a boundary of the second patch 74P and denotes a second predetermined isotherm value. The second predetermined isotherm value is greater than the first predetermined isotherm line 73.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">As can be seen the thickness of the thermal barrier coating 100 varies between first thickness 72T and second thickness 74T. In one variant of the first arrangement the first thermal barrier coating patch 72P may have a stepped thickness at or about the isotherm line 73 and as shown by the dashed line 76. Similarly the second thermal barrier coating patch 74P may have a stepped thickness increase at or about the isotherm line 75 and as shown by the dashed line 78. However, in a second variant the thickness of the thermal barrier coating is achieved over a transition portion 80 which varies between the internal surface 54 and the first thickness 72T, which is at or about the first isotherm line 73. Similarly, a transition portion 82 varies in thickness between the first thickness 72T and the second thickness 74T, which is at or about the second isotherm line 75.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In either variants of the first arrangement of thermal barrier coating 100, the thickness could be said to be stepped and that such stepping is varying the thickness of the thermal barrier coating 100 from the first to the second thicknesses. The transition portions 80, 82 can further gradually limit the temperature experienced by the underlying surface 51 by virtue of its gradual thickening. It should be noted that the transition portions 80, 82 are provided in front or on the cooler side of the first and second isotherm lines 73, 75. Note that the first and second isotherm lines 73, 75 are predetermined temperature boundaries at which the desired first and second thicknesses 72T, 74T are achieved. The first and second isotherm lines 73, 75<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> can be predetermined based on thermal paint tests or thermal imaging of the surface of the transition duct in use. The operational point of the engine at which the predetermined first and second isotherm lines 73, 75 can be where the greatest thermal gradient is experienced and which can be during the maximum engine output, but could also be at a lower engine output.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042"><figref idrefs="f0004"><b>FIG. 7</b></figref> is a schematic of section A-A shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref> showing a second arrangement of varying thickness of thermal barrier coating 100.

The thickness of the thermal barrier coating 100 is indicated as first and second thicknesses 72T, 74T and which each thickness occurs at or about first and second predetermined isotherm lines 73, 75 respectively. In this second arrangement of varying thickness of thermal barrier coating 100 the portion between first and second thicknesses 72T, 74T is gradually increased from isotherm line 73 to isotherm line 75. The same transition portion 82 is applied to the internal surface 54 up to the first isotherm line 73 to smoothly blend between the surface 54 and the required thickness of thermal barrier coating 73T at isotherm 73. The intention is to vary or graduate the thickness of thermal barrier coating 100 to gradually increase thermal protection to the wall 51 where associated with a gradual increase in temperature profile experienced by and over the surface from the combustion gases. Thus by gradually increasing the thickness of thermal barrier coating 100, the wall can be kept at a more constant temperature thereby reducing or minimising thermal stresses.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idrefs="f0004"><b>FIG. 8</b></figref> is a schematic of section A-A shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref> showing a third arrangement of varying thickness of thermal barrier coating.

Thus not only is the location of the isotherms 73, 75 selected by virtue of the parameters mentioned above, but also in conjunction with the thickness of the thermal barrier coating patches 72T and 74T.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Once the isotherms 73, 75 and the thicknesses of the at least two thickness of thermal barrier coating patches 72T, 74T have been selected to minimise the temperature gradient across an internal surface of the transition duct 17, the first and second isotherm values are inputted to the controller 112 and a programme within the controller 112 then formulates the coordinates of the isotherm lines 73, 75. The required thicknesses of the first and second thermal barrier coating patches 72T and 74T are also inputted to the controller 112. Thus the controller 112 formulates a path for the delivery nozzle to follow and deposit thermal barrier<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> material to form the thermal barrier coating 100. The controller 112 also formulates the required speed of the delivery nozzle 116, the rate of deposition of material and number of passes to form the required thickness at any location within the thermal barrier coating 100. The controller is also programmable to formulate necessary deposits to form the transition portions 80, 82.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058"><figref idrefs="f0006"><b>FIG. 13</b></figref> is a schematic section A-A showing the transition duct wall 51 and the first arrangement of varying thicknesses of thermal barrier coating 100. This first arrangement is an exemplary embodiment and the method for forming the thermal barrier coating may be equally applied to all the embodiments described herein. In the direction of arrow 34, the thermal barrier coating 100 can be divided into a number of zones. Zone 132 is the transition portion 80, zone 134 is the constant thickness TBC patch 72P, zone 136 is the transition portion 82 and zone 138 is the constant thickness TBC patch 74P.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In the direction of arrow 130, for zone 132, increased deposition thickness of the thermal barrier coating can be made by any one or combination of reducing the speed of the nozzle 116 and increasing the rate of feed of TBC material from the hopper 118 to the nozzle 116 to increase the amount of TBC material landing on the surface 51. Over the TBC patch 72A and in zone 134, where there is a constant thickness of TBC, the nozzle speed and rate of feed of TBC material can be held constant, although either can be increased or decreased respectively to maintain a desired deposition rate and thickness.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Depending on the required thickness of the first and second thicknesses 72T, 74T of the TBC 100, the second TBC patch 74P can be formed in two ways. Firstly, in the direction of arrow 130, for zone 136, the increased deposition thickness of the transition portion 82 can be made by any one or combination of reducing the speed of the nozzle 116 and increasing the rate of feed of TBC material from the hopper 118 to the nozzle 116 to increase the amount of TBC material landing on the surface 51. Over the TBC patch 74A and in zone 138, where there is a constant thickness of TBC, the nozzle speed and rate of feed of TBC material can be held constant, although either can be increased or decreased respectively to maintain a desired deposition rate and thickness. In this case reducing the speed of the nozzle 116 and increasing<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> the rate of feed of TBC material from the hopper 118 to the nozzle 116 will be in addition to the respective rate compared to those of the zone 134. Secondly, the first patch 72P of TBC can be extended and cover the second area 74A. In this case the zones 136 and 138 can be formed by two or more layers over the extended first patch 72P in the same way as zones 132 and 134 and will not be repeated again.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061"><figref idrefs="f0007"><b>FIG.14</b></figref> is a view on the internal surface of the transition duct showing patches 72P, 74P of thermal barrier coatings applied to areas 72A, 74A and having different or varying thicknesses 72T, 74T. A number of paths of the delivery nozzle 116 can be programmed to form the thermal barrier coating 100.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In one embodiment, the variable thermal barrier coating 100 is formed by a first path 140 which extends across the entire thermal barrier coating patch. The TBC is deposited in rows with each row forming adjacent the next in the direction of arrow 142. As the deposition nozzle 116 traverses the internal surface 54 the varying thicknesses of the thermal barrier coating is achieved by any one or combination of altering the speed of the nozzle 116 and altering the rate of feed of TBC material from the hopper 118 to the nozzle 116 to increase or decrease the amount of TBC material landing on the surface 51 as described above.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">In another embodiment, where the thermal barrier coating is too thick to deposit in one layer e.g. the second TBC patch 74P, the delivery nozzle 116 retraces the relevant part of the first path 140 to form a second (or more) layer and thus the thickerTBC patch 74P. Alternatively, where the first patch 72P of TBC is extended and covers the second area 74A, a second path 144 of the delivery nozzle 116 traverses the second thickness patch 74T. This path 144 is shown creating rows of TBC deposit in a transverse manner to the first path 140. However, the second path can be in any orientation relative to the first path 140.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In another embodiment, the transition portions 80, 82 or where the thermal barrier coating 100 gradually changes thickness, the delivery nozzle 116 is directed along a third path 146. As the rows of thermal barrier coating are deposited, generally in the direction of arrow 148, the delivery nozzle speed is decreased and/or the rate of feed of TBC material from the hopper 118 to the nozzle 116 is increased.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></p><p id="p0065" num="0065"><figref idrefs="f0007"><b>FIG.15</b></figref> is a view on the internal surface 54 of the transition duct 17 showing an array of effusion cooling holes 150 and in dashed lines a number of dilution holes 152. In addition to any of the varying thickness thermal barrier coating arrangements described herein, effusion cooling holes 150 may be provided to provide a film of cooling fluid over a part of the surface 54. The effusion cooling holes 150 penetrate through the wall 51 of the transition duct 17 and through any thermal barrier coating 100. The application of the variable thickness thermal barrier coating 100 may reduce the number and /or extent of the effusion cooling holes 150. Consideration of the cooling effect of the effusion cooling holes 150, where present, is taken into account when devising extent, location and thickness of the thermal barrier coating 100 and its varying thicknesses. Essentially, for a transition duct 17 with effusion cooling holes 150 the isotherm lines 73, 75 and the method of determining the isotherm lines, remain related to the actual temperature of the surface 54 of the wall 51. Similarly, where the transition duct 17 includes dilution holes 152 the local temperature of the surface of the wall can be affected and again the isotherm lines 73, 75 and the method of determining the isotherm lines, remain related to the actual temperature of the surface 54 of the wall 51.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066"><figref idrefs="f0008"><b>FIG.16</b></figref> is a schematic graph depicting a temperature profile 154 of the surface temperature along section B-B, shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG.5</figref>, of the wall 51 of the transition duct 17. Profile line 156 represents the temperature of the surface 54 of the transition duct without thermal barrier coating. Profile line 158 represents the temperature of the surface of the transition duct 17 with a uniform thickness thermal barrier coating applied over the entire internal surface. Profile line 160 represents the temperature of the surface of a transition duct 17 with a varying thickness thermal barrier coating 100 applied in accordance with the present invention and as described herein.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">For the uniform thermal barrier coating case its temperature profile line 158 is shown as reducing the temperature of the surface 54 by a uniform amount and as shown by temperature difference 164 between the profile lines 156 and 158. The temperature difference 164 is constant along the entire temperature profile 154 graph. The temperature range 168, between maximum and minimum temperatures, along the profile 158 is the same as a temperature<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> range 170 of the uncoated surface 54. Thus the temperature gradient along the surface 54 remains the same with or without the uniform thermal barrier coating. As can be seen the temperature profile 160</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">In contrast, for the varying thickness thermal barrier coating 100, the temperature difference between the profile lines 156 and 160 varies between zero, in regions 161, and a maximum 166. In regions 162 there is no thermal barrier coating 100. The maximum 166 temperature difference does not necessarily occur where the thickest portion of thermal barrier coating is applied. Thus the temperature difference 168 and hence temperature gradient across the wall is greatly reduced. Hence, the varying thickness thermal barrier coating 100 significantly reduces stresses and strains throughout the transition duct 17. Furthermore, the peak maximum temperature of the surface is also reduced.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Another aspect of the present invention is a method of forming the transition duct 17 having the depressions 84 as described with particular reference to <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005">FIGS.8-11</figref>.
