For such purpose, usually a wire is used to connect the electrics of said exterior element with the electrics of said appliance.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, where the exterior element is hinged to the appliance structure, there is a problem in that the wire has to be routed from said exterior element to said appliance structure. Thereby, the wire has to cross the hinge axis. In connection therewith, various problems arise. The wire is prone to breakage, twist and/or may be clamped in between, for example door and appliance structure or the hinge or its mechanism.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Therefore, a need exists for providing a more simple and more safe solution to route such wire from such exterior element, e.g. the door, to the electrics of the appliance, e.g. a power board.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Particularly, there is the need to provide a solution where such wire is not prone to be clamped by the hinge, or between door and structure of the household appliance.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE102008029709A1"><text>DE 10 2008 029 709 A1</text></patcit> discloses a hinge mechanism, more particularly an arrangement for guiding a wire from the corpus of an appliance to a hinged closing element.

a first element and a second element with wiring routed from said first element to said second element, and<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> -->a hinge mechanism comprising at least one pivot point, wherein said hinge mechanism is mechanically connecting said first element and said second element, such that said first element is arranged at a first side of said hinge mechanism and that said second element is arranged at a second side of said hinge mechanism,<br/>
wherein said household appliance further comprises a cover for said wiring,<br/>
characterized in that<br/>
said cover is pivotally attached at said first side of said hinge mechanism, wherein at least a section of said wiring is arranged between said hinge mechanism and said cover.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A household appliance as used herein, preferably is a kitchen appliance, more preferably a household appliance having a door comprising an electronic component and/or command. Preferably, a kitchen appliance as used herein is selected from the group comprising kitchen cabinet, oven, microwave, refrigerator and steam oven. It will be immediately understood that with the hinge mechanism according to the present invention and, particularly in that a wiring is routed from said first element to said second element, electronic elements, e.g. switches, displays, or the like integrated in or on such first element or second element, e.g. mounted on or inside of a door or door frame, can be connected to the electronics of the other element, e.g. the appliance itself or a structure or corpus thereof.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A hinge mechanism comprises at least one pivot point, and is mechanically connecting said first element and said second element. Thereby, the hinge mechanism allows for a pivotal movement,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> e.g. an opening/closing movement, of one of the elements relative to the other element, respectively. For example, a door is mechanically connected by such hinge mechanism to the appliance structure, and can be opened or closed via a pivotal movement allowed and mediated by the hinge mechanism. A person skilled in the art knows various types and forms of hinge mechanisms, which may be advantageously applied within the present invention. A hinge is understood to be a type of bearing that connects mechanically the two elements. Thus, a first element is arranged at a first side of said hinge mechanism and that said second element is arranged at a second side of said hinge mechanism. A hinge, as used herein, preferably allows a limited angle of rotation between them. Two elements connected by an ideal hinge rotate relative to each other about a fixed axis of rotation. However, also hinges are particularly considered herein, which cause one element to perform a translatory movement relative to the other element. Hinges, as used herein, may be of various material, said material selected from the group comprising metal, e.g. stainless steal, zamak or aluminum, or non-metal, e.g. plastics. Preferably, a hinge, as used herein is manufactured by, or at least parts thereof are manufyctured by metal molding and/or plastic molding.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The hinge mechanism according to the present invention comprises a cover for said wiring, more particularly for covering said wiring. This is of particular advantage, in that said cover protects the wiring against damage, however, and may also be of esthetic purpose, in that the wiring is advantageously hidden from the view of the user.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The hinge mechanism according to the present invention provides and/or comprises a moveable cover for a wiring, wherein said wiring is or at least a section of said wiring is arranged between said hinge mechanism and said cover. In that said cover is<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> pivotally attached at said first side of said hinge mechanism the cover may be opened or closed, preferably flipped open or closed, or tilted. This is of particular advantage in that the cover is pivotally movable in that said cover is pivotally attached at said first side, and the wiring is therefore accessible easily. Accordingly, mounting of such wiring is also advantageously facilitated.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Said section of said wiring preferably refers to the section, which is the section of the wiring routing from said first element to said second element, and traversing a gap between the first element and the second element. It will, however be understood, that such wiring will further route into or along the first and/or the second element, in order to be connected to its target, e.g. an electrical device, display, power supply, or the like. Therefor, said section of said wiring being arranged between said hinge mechanism and said cover, preferably refers to at least a part of the section of said wiring being arranged traversing the gap between the first and the second element.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">It is to be understood that the wiring preferably, routes from said first element to said second element at the level or height of the hinge mechanism. Preferably, the section which is the section of the wiring routing from said first element to said second element is at least partially arranged within the hinge mechanism of a household appliance.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Preferably, a cover as used herein is or forms part of the hinge mechanism.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Where at least a section of said wiring is arranged between said hinge mechanism and said cover, it will be understood that this facilitates this connection, particularly as said wiring is<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> placed in the hinge, where, more preferably, the relative movement between these assembly groups is kept minimal.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In a preferred embodiment of the inventive hinge mechanism the wiring is guided inside the hinge itself, and, particularly the wiring is not guided in a level above, below or next to the hinge.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In a further preferred embodiment the cover is supporting the wiring. Preferably, the cover supports the wiring, preferably by fixing its position against movement of the wiring within the hinge in at least one direction. Preferably, such support is fixing the wiring within the hinge against movement in a vertical direction. More preferably, such support allows a movement of the wiring within the hinge in a horizontal direction.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">It will be understood that the hinge mechanism according to the present invention allows using the hinge mechanism integrating the wiring path inside of it. Said wiring path may comprise at least a guiding structure for guiding said wire, a fixing structure for fixing said wire in at least one direction and/or a support structure for supporting said wire.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The term "wiring" as used herein, preferably refers to electric wiring, e.g. an electric cable, power line, data cable or the like.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Said cover is pivotally attached at said first side of said hinge mechanism. In connection therewith, is to be understood that the cover may be attached at the first element or at the second element or at any other part of the hinge mechanism, for example, an articulated arm or linkage. A person skilled in the art will immediately recognize, depending on the particular<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> hinge mechanism chosen, where said cover may be advantageously pivotally attached at said first side of said hinge mechanism.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In an advantageous embodiment of the inventive household appliance one of said elements is a structure of the household appliance and the other of said elements is an opening element, preferably a door.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A structure of said household appliance preferably is a corpus or a framework structure of said appliance. An opening element as used herein, preferably refers to a door, a flap or the like. A person skilled in the art will know various forms thereof. For example, a door may be a French door, door wing, side-opening door or drop down door, or the like.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In a further advantageous embodiment of the inventive household appliance said hinge mechanism is configured as a four-bar-linkage and/or four-bar-hinge.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">A four-bar linkage and/or four-bar-hinge, in general, is the simplest movable closed chain linkage. It consists of four bodies, called bars or links, connected in a loop by four joints or pivot points, i.e. linked in the form of quadrilateral. It will be immediately understood that two opposing bars, referred to herein as the main bars, are each connected to either the first element and the second element, respectively. Preferably, the joints are configured so as the links and/or bars move in parallel planes, also called a planar four-bar linkage. For a planar four bar linkage, the sum of the shortest and longest links preferably is not greater than the sum of the remaining links, particularly if there is to be continuous relative rotation between two members.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">An opening/closing movement of an element relative to the other element, e.g. a door relative to an appliance structure, linked by such four-bar hinge is defined as a kinematic chain in which one of the links is fixed according to a particular hinge mechanism. Accordingly, a four bar mechanism may be advantageously applied and/or adjusted by the appropriate selection or choice of the length of the bars and/or links and the degree of freedom of each joints or pivot. Different versions of four bar linkage may be thus obtained by fixing any one of the links or bars. Such different versions, which can be obtained by fixing any of the different links, are usually called its "inversions".</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In connection with the present invention a four-bar-linkage, preferably, has four hinged joints with axes being substantially arranged parallel to each other. Such four-bar-linkage, preferably is a planar four-bar linkage. A person skilled in the art will know various configurations of four-bar linkages, particularly useful in connection with the present invention, for example, as disclosed in European Patent Application No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP13198942A"><text>13 198 942.8</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The kinematics and dynamics of planar four-bar linkages are known to a person skilled in the art. It will be understood, that such planar four-bar linkage is preferably constructed from four links connected in a loop by four one degree of freedom joints or pivot points. Such pivot point or joint may be either a revolute, which is a hinged joint, or a prismatic, as sliding joint.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The four-bar-linkage, preferably is a planar quadrilateral linkage, more preferably formed by four links and four revolute joints or pivot points.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">A person skilled in the art will immediately understand and will be able to select and configure the four-bar hinge or four -bar linkage, particularly a planar or planar quadrilateral linkage according to the present invention for the desired particular inventive purpose.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In connection therewith, it is to be understood that a particular inversion of a four bar hinge or four-bar linkage according to the present invention will give rise to different mechanisms of practical utility, when the proportions of the link lengths are changed. By this principle of inversion of a four bar linkage and/or four bar hinge, several useful mechanisms can be obtained. Different inversions of four bar mechanisms and/or four bar hinges can be obtained by fixing different links of the kinematic chain. A four bar hinge according to the present invention.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Preferably, a first main bar of the four-bar hinge according to the invention serves as the fixed link, being fixed to the first element.
