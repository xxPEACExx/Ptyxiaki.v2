An electric supercharger that uses an electric motor as a drive source instead of a turbine has become common. In the electric supercharger, the electric motor is disposed at a shaft of the electric supercharger. The electric motor rotationally drives a compressor so as to improve acceleration responsiveness of the electric supercharger. The rotation shaft of the electric supercharger is provided with a rotor made of a permanent magnet, an iron core, or the like.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Even if the rotational balance of each structural member that composes a rotor of a compressor wheel or the like of the electric supercharger is accurately adjusted, the rotational unbalance of the whole assembly of the individual structural members may be lost due to an assembling error or the like. If the unbalanced rotor is rotated at a high speed, the rotor may vibrate or break. Thus, before the electric supercharger is shipped, the rotor is rotated so as to contactlessly accurately measure the rotational unbalance of the rotor. A circumferential portion of the rotor that causes the rotational balance of the rotor to be lost is machined by shaving based on the measured result so as to correct the rotational unbalance of the rotor. Patent Document 1 discloses a related art reference that contactlessly measures a position and an amount of a portion where a rotational unbalance occurs in a rotor. In the method disclosed in Patent Document 1, a magnetized nut is mounted on a part of the rotor. Reference direction and position are detected by the magnetized nut. In addition, rotational unbalance<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> portions and rotational unbalance amounts of the rotor are measured based on the reference direction and position.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2008058008A"><text>Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2008-58008</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">When the rotational unbalance of a cartridge type assembly of a conventional turbo or an assist turbo is corrected, a mark that represents reference direction and position is placed on the turbine side so as to obtain the unbalance direction. However, since an electric compressor does not have a turbine, it is necessary to place a mark on a compressor wheel. When the rotational unbalance of the compressor wheel is corrected, a mark that represents the reference direction and position is used. Since the mark is normally placed on the rear surface side of the compressor, it is difficult to apply the mark in the case that the rational unbalance of the cartridge type assembly is corrected.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Although the rotational unbalance correction method disclosed in Patent Document 1 can contactlessly detect rotational unbalance positions and rotational unbalance amounts of the compressor wheel, since the magnetized nut that is detected is expensive, after the rotational unbalance of the compressor wheel is corrected, the magnetized nut is removed and reused. As a result, the number of production steps adversely increases. In addition, unless the magnetized nut is frequently calibrated, after the magnetized nut is removed, the unbalance component of the magnetized nut itself is removed. As a result, the compressor wheel becomes unbalanced.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention is made to solve the foregoing problem.

In other words, the optical sensor 30 is nearly perpendicular to the sensor detection surface 500, namely the bottom surface 510b of the hole portion 510a.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">As a result, the irradiation light L1 of the optical sensor 30 is regularly reflected on the sensor detection surface 510. The reflected light L2 enters the optical sensor 30. In other words, the optical sensor 30 detects the sensor detection surface 510 with the reflected light L2 of the irradiation light L1 with which the optical sensor 30 irradiates the sensor detection surface 510. On the other hand, when a region where the sensor detection surface 510 is not formed on the circumferential surface 504b of the boss portion 504 is irradiated with the irradiation light L1, since the irradiation light L1 is reflected at approximately 45° from this region of the circumferential surface 504b, the reflected light L2 does not enter the optical sensor 30.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">According to the present embodiment, the hole portion 510a is inclined to the circumferential surface 504b of the tip end portion 504a of the boss portion 504. Thus, when the rotational unbalance of the compressor assembly 50 (refer to <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>) on which the compressor wheel 500 is disposed is detected and corrected, the optical sensor 30 detects the reflected light L2 only when the sensor detection surface 510 of the compressor wheel 500 passes through the front of the optical sensor 30. As a result, when the rotational unbalance of the compressor assembly 50 is detected and corrected, the sensor detection surface 510 that becomes reference direction and position in which a rotational unbalance position and a rotational unbalance amount of the compressor wheel 500 are contactlessly measured can be accurately detected.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">In addition, according to the present embodiment, the bottom surface 510b of the hole portion 510a is closer to a rotation axis A5 side of the compressor wheel 500 than a maximum cut range of the balance cut portion 505. In other words, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7A</figref>, since a depth D1 of the hole portion 510a in which the sensor<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> detection surface 510 is formed is greater than a depth D2 of the balance cut portion 505, the sensor detection surface 510 can be formed in the balance cut portion 510 so that the sensor detection surface 510 overlaps with the balance cut portion 510. Thus, since a length of the tip end portion 504a of the boss portion 504 of the compressor wheel 500 according to the present embodiment becomes shorter than that of the compressor wheel according to each of the first to fourth embodiments, the compressor wheel 500 can be compacted.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">As described above, the compressor wheel according to each of the embodiments of the present invention has a sensor detection surface at any portion other than its rear surface as a mark not necessary to be removed after the rotational unbalance of the compressor wheel is corrected. Since reference direction and position are detected based on the sensor detection surface, after a cartridge type compressor assembly is assembled, when the rotational unbalance of the compressor assembly is detected, the sensor detection surface as the reference detection portion is not hidden. As a result, after the compressor assembly is assembled, the rotational unbalance of the compressor assembly can be easily detected. In addition, since the sensor detection surface can be easily formed on the compressor wheel in advance, after the compressor assembly is assembled, the rotation unbalance of the compressor assembly can be detected without need to use a new tool such as a magnetized nut. Thus, the process for detecting the rotational unbalance of the compressor assembly can be shortened.</p><heading id="h0016">(Structure of Compressor Assembly)</heading><p id="p0075" num="0075">Next, with reference to an accompanying drawing, a structure of a compressor assembly on which a compressor wheel according to each of the embodiments of the present invention is disposed will be described. <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an outlined structure of a compressor assembly on which a compressor wheel according to each of the embodiments of the present invention is disposed.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">The compressor assembly 50 includes a rotation shaft 52, a rotor core 54 mounted on one end side of the rotation shaft 52, a compressor wheel 100 (200, 300, 400, 500) according to each of the embodiments, the compressor wheel being mounted on another end side of the rotation shaft 52, and bearings 56, 58 that support the rotation shaft 52.
