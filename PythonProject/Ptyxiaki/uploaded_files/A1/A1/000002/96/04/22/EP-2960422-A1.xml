id="h0002">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates, in general, to an improved single-cord type blind and, more particularly, to an improved single-cord type blind which has less parts than in a conventional product and in which a stopper and a rotor are compressed and released with friction force of a spring so that a screen can be safely and accurately raised and lowered.</p><heading id="h0003">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Generally, a roller blind is used, instead of a curtain, in an office, home, a restaurant, etc. The roller blind blocks light incident through a window or the like with the action of drawing, in one direction, a ball chain engaged with a sprocket, which is mounted on one side of a bracket, so that a screen is unwound and lowered from a rotary shaft with a spring force of a spring and then is fixed at a certain position.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a conventional roll blind 10 is configured such that a rotary member 5 and a speed-reduction member 8 are respectively mounted on both brackets 9, and a winding shaft on which the screen is wound is mounted to surround the members.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The rotary member 5 is configured such that a connecting shaft 3 having a rotary ring 2 is connected to a rotary body 1, and a spring 4 is fixedly mounted between the rotary body 1 and the rotary ring 2 to surround the connecting shaft 3 so that the rotary body 2 laterally moves the connecting shaft 3 with spring force of the spring 4.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The speed-reduction member 8 is configured such that a reducer 6 is mounted at the front of another rotary body 1 having an adjuster and a stationary shaft 7 having a reduction nut 7a is coupled to the reducer.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A rotary shaft on which a screen is wound is coupled to the outside of both the rotary bodies 1, and the brackets 9 are fastened to a window frame or a wall around a window using screws or the like.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The screen is raised or lowered by drawing a ball chain cord which is engaged around and hangs down in two strings from a sprocket. Specifically, when one string of the ball chain cord is drawn, the screen is lowered to block light, and when the other string of the ball chain cord is drawn, the screen is raised to make the window clear.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, according to the conventional roller blind, since the ball chain cord hangs down in two strings so that the careen can be raised or lowered using the two strings, the operation of the screen is carried out inconveniently. Further, such a long dangling cord is likely to be a target<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> with which children play, so that a safety accident such as the cord being coiled around the neck of a child may occur.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">To solve the above problems, a single-cord type blind has been proposed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="KR875633"><text>Korean Patent No. 875633</text></patcit> assigned by the applicant.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the single-cord type blind includes a fixing body 10, a gear unit 50, an operating plate 60, a blocking plate 70, a transfer member 80, and a cover 90.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The fixing body 10 includes a fixing plate 15, which is provided on one side with a central raised fixing section 12 having a fixing groove 11 into which a coiled spring 19 is coupled. The raised section has a fixing shaft 13 protruding from the center thereof and a plurality of fixing protrusions 14 around the fixing shaft.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The gear unit 50 includes a central gear 20, which is mounted around the outer surface of the fixing shaft 13 and has symmetrically-arranged reinforcing steps 21 on an inner surface thereof and an outer threaded part 22, circumferential small-gears 30, which are coupled to the fixing protrusions 14 and each have threaded parts 31 in such a way as to be engaged with the central gear 20, and a fixing ring 40 which is connected with the central gear and has symmetrically-arranged outer fixing steps 42 each having a cut groove 41 into which an engaging step 45 of a spring 44 is fastened.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The operating plate 60 includes a rotary gear 65 which has<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> internal and external threads 64 and is coupled in a coupling groove at the front of the operating plate in such a manner as to internally engage with the circumferential small-gears 30, wherein a rotary cord 62 having a grip 61 on its lower portion is wound around an outer circumference thereof.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The blocking plate 70 has a central through opening 71 and is fixedly mounted at the front of the operating plate 60 so as to prevent the gear unit 50 and the rotary cord 62 from being getting out of their positions.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The transfer member 80 is mounted through the through opening 71 of the blocking plate 70 such that it abuts against the reinforcing steps 21 of the central gear 20, and has a central opening 81, into which the fixing shaft 13 is inserted, and has a front threaded end 84 and a rear coupling groove 83 having opposite side walls, one of which has an inclined surface 82.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The cover 90 is provided, in one side thereof, with a rotary part 93 which has a central opening 92 and a threaded end 91 to be engaged and coupled with the front threaded end 84 of the transfer member 80.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">However, such a conventional structure has a drawback in that the raising operation of the screen performed by separation of the cover and the rotary part is carried out in a different manner for different users, being inconvenient in operation.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems occurring in the related art, and the present invention is intended to propose a single-cord type blind in which the operation of a screen is performed by compression and release between a stopper and a rotary part using a spring force of a spring, instead of a conventional gear mechanism, thereby facilitating an accurate operation of the screen irrespective of different users.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In order to achieve the above object, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a single-cord type blind including: a stationary body, in which a fixing plate having a fixing shaft is disposed at the front side thereof and a torsion spring is mounted, wherein the stationary body has a rotary plate having a rotary cylinder with engaging parts and coupling grooves formed on an inner surface and a distal end thereof, respectively, the fixing shaft being provided on an outer surface thereof with a washer groove and being fixedly mounted in the rotary cylinder; a gear unit having a plurality of gears, an operating plate having a gripped operating cord and configured to rotate in cooperation with the plurality of gears; a blocking plate preventing the gear unit and the operating cord from getting out of their<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> positions; and a transfer member screw-coupled with a rotary part of a cover so as to couple and decouple the cover, the single-cord type blind further including:
