The pre-ignition tends to cause strong vibration. When there occurs abnormal combustion that causes strong vibration, such as knock or pre-ignition causing high-intensity vibration, there is a possibility that the vibration caused by those types of abnormal combustion may still linger in the knock detection period for the next cylinder. When this is the case, there is a possibility that it may be determined mistakenly that knock is occurring in the next cylinder, though knock is not occurring actually.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention has been made in view of the above-described circumstances, and its object is to provide a technology that enables an abnormal combustion detection apparatus for a spark ignition internal combustion engine having a plurality of cylinders to detect abnormal combustion such as pre-ignition and knocking with improved accuracy.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0007"><b>[MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS]</b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">To achieve the object, according to the present invention, in an abnormal combustion detection apparatus for an internal combustion engine that measures the intensity of vibration of a spark-ignition internal combustion engine having a plurality of cylinders and detects the occurrence of abnormal combustion by comparing the measured vibration intensity and a determination threshold, when the occurrence of abnormal combustion is detected, the apparatus is adapted to correct the determination threshold for a next cylinder using as parameters a peak value of the vibration intensity at the time of the occurrence of abnormal combustion and the engine speed.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Specifically, there is provided an abnormal combustion detection apparatus for a spark-ignition internal combustion engine having a plurality of cylinders, comprising:
<ul><li>measurement means for measuring the vibration intensity of the internal combustion engine;</li><li>determination means for performing determination processing, which determines that abnormal combustion occurs, if the vibration intensity measured by said measuring means in a determination period set for each cylinder is higher than a determination threshold; and</li><li>correction means for correcting a determination threshold to be used in determination processing for a next cylinder on the basis of a peak value of the vibration intensity measured by said measurement means at the time when the abnormal combustion occurs and an engine speed, when it is determined by said determination means that the abnormal combustion occurs.</li></ul></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">When abnormal combustion that causes strong vibration occurs in one cylinder of an internal combustion engine, there is a possibility that the vibration caused by the abnormal<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> combustion lingers in a determination period for the next cylinder. The intensity of vibration lingering in the determination period for the next cylinder correlates with the peak value of the intensity of vibration caused by the occurrence of abnormal combustion and the length of time from the time of detection of the aforementioned peak value to the determination period for the next cylinder. The length of time from the detection of the aforementioned peak value to the determination period for the next cylinder correlates with the rotation speed of the crankshaft.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Therefore, it can be considered that the intensity of the vibration lingering in the determination period for the next cylinder correlates with the aforementioned peak value and the engine speed. Therefore, the abnormal combustion detection apparatus according to the present invention is adapted to correct the determination threshold to be used in the determination processing for the next cylinder on the basis of the aforementioned peak value and the engine speed. In consequence, when abnormal combustion is not occurring in the next cylinder, an incorrect determination that abnormal combustion is occurring is unlikely to be made. Therefore, the determination processing for the next cylinder can be performed with improved accuracy.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The correction means according to the present invention may be adapted to calculate the intensity of vibration lingering in the determination period for the next cylinder using as parameters the aforementioned peak value and the engine speed and correct the determination threshold by adding the result of calculation to the determination threshold. With this feature, the determination processing for the next cylinder can be performed with improved accuracy, even in the case where vibration caused by abnormal combustion lingers in the determination period for the next cylinder.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> When abnormal combustion causing strong vibration such as knock or pre-ignition with high vibration intensity occurs, there is a possibility that the vibration intensity may exceed the upper bound of the measurement range of the measurement means. One countermeasure to this is to extend the measurement range of the measurement means. However, extending the measurement range can lead to a deterioration in the detection accuracy for knocks with low vibration intensities.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In view of the above-described circumstance, in the case where the measurement signal of said measurement means exceeds the upper bound of the measurement range of the measurement means, the correction means according to the present invention may use, as a value correlating with the vibration intensity, the duration of the period (overflow period) during which the measurement signal is equal to or higher than the upper bound value. In other words, the correction means may correct the determination threshold to be used in the determination processing for the next cylinder on the basis of the duration of the overflow period and the engine speed.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The duration of the period (overflow period) during which the measurement signal of the measurement means is equal to or larger than the aforementioned upper bound value correlates with the vibration intensity at the time when abnormal combustion occurs. Thus, higher vibration intensities lead to longer overflow periods. Therefore, the duration of the aforementioned overflow period may be used instead of the aforementioned peak value as a parameter in correcting the determination threshold for the next cylinder, whereby the determination threshold for the next cylinder can be corrected to an appropriate value. In consequence, it is possible to prevent or reduce the occurrence of incorrect determination while preventing deterioration of the accuracy of knock detection.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> When the duration of a period during which the vibration intensity measured by said measurement means is equal to or higher than an upper limit value of the measurement range (overflow period) is equal to or longer than a predetermined length of time, the determination means according to the present invention may determine that the measurement signal of the measurement means contains noise.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">One known method of measuring the intensity of vibration of an internal combustion engine is to extract vibration components (vibration intensities) in a specific frequency band from a measurement signal of a sensor (e.g. knock sensor) that measures the vibration of the internal combustion engine. In this method, there is a possibility that the measurement signal may contain white noise having a large amplitude superimposed on it. When this is the case, there is a possibility that it may be determined that abnormal combustion is occurring, though abnormal combustion is not occurring actually. The white noise has uniform intensity throughout the entire frequency range. Consequently, when there is white noise, the duration of the overflow period is longer than that in the case where abnormal combustion occurs. Therefore, if the duration of the overflow period is equal to or larger than a predetermined length of time, it may be determined that there is noise. The predetermined length of time mentioned above is a length of time longer than the overflow period in the case where abnormal combustion occurs. This length of time is determined in advance by an adaptation process based on, for example, an experiment.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The determination means according to the present invention may be adapted to integrate the vibration intensity measured by said measurement means in every equal calculation period shorter than said determination period and determine that there is noise if the number of the calculation periods in which the integrated value exceeds a specific value is<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> equal to or larger than a predetermined number.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">When vibration is caused by abnormal combustion, the vibration intensity diminishes with the passage of time. On the other hand, when there is white noise, the vibration intensity is unlikely to diminish with the passage of time. Thus, in the case where abnormal combustion occurs, the aforementioned integrate value increases at the time when abnormal combustion occurs and diminishes with the passage of time thereafter. On the other hand, in the case where there is white noise, the aforementioned integrated value tends to be substantially constant. Therefore, when the number of the calculation periods in which the aforementioned integrated value is equal to or larger than a specific value is larger than a predetermined number, in other words, when a state in which the integrated value is equal to or larger than a specific value continues, it may be determined that there is noise. The "predetermined number" mentioned above is a value larger than the value obtained by dividing the length of the period throughout which the integrated value is expected to exceed the specific value when abnormal combustion occurs by the length of the calculation period. This predetermined value is determined in advance by an adaptation process based on, for example, an experiment.</p><heading id="h0008"><b>[ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECT OF THE INVENTION]</b></heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">The present invention enables an abnormal combustion detection apparatus for a spark-ignition internal combustion engine having a plurality of cylinders to detect abnormal combustion such as pre-ignition and knock with improved accuracy.</p><heading id="h0009"><b>[BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS]</b></heading><p id="p0021" num="0021"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a diagram showing the general configuration of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> an internal combustion engine to which the present invention is applied.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a graph showing the change with time in the vibration intensity and its relation to a determination period for a next cylinder in a case where abnormal combustion occurs.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a graph showing a method of correcting a determination threshold to be used in determination processing for the next cylinder when abnormal combustion occurs.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a graph showing another method of correcting a determination threshold to be used in determination processing for the next cylinder when abnormal combustion occurs.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> is a flow chart of a processing routine executed by an ECU when abnormal detection processing is performed in a first embodiment.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> is a graph illustrating a case where the vibration intensity measured in the determination period for the next cylinder is corrected when abnormal combustion occurs.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> is a graph showing a case where the intensity of vibration caused by abnormal combustion overflows beyond a measurement range.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8(a)</figref> is a graph showing the measurement signal of a knock sensor in the case where abnormal combustion occurs.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8(b)</figref> is a graph showing the measurement signal of the knock sensor in a case where there is white noise.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9(a)</figref> is a graph showing a vibration intensity waveform in a case where abnormal combustion occurs.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9(b)</figref> is a graph showing a vibration intensity waveform in a case where there is white noise.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10</figref> is a flow chart of a processing routine executed by the ECU when abnormal detection processing is performed in a second embodiment.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010"><b>[EMBODIMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION]</b></heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the following, specific embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> The dimensions, materials, shapes, relative arrangements, and other features of the components that will be described in connection with the embodiments are not intended to limit the technical scope of the present invention only to them, unless particularly stated.</p><heading id="h0011"><b>&lt;Embodiment 1&gt;</b></heading><p id="p0023" num="0023">Firstly, a first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">Figs. 1 to 7</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a diagram showing the general configuration of an internal combustion engine to which the present invention is applied.

For example, the ECU 9 performs the processing of detecting abnormal combustion (abnormal combustion detection processing) in the internal combustion engine 1 using as parameters output signals of the above-described sensors, in addition to known control processing such as fuel injection control and ignition control. In the following, how the abnormal combustion detection processing is performed in this embodiment will be described.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the spark-ignition internal combustion engine 1, the air-fuel mixture is ignited by the ignition plug 3, whereby flame is generated. The flame grows from the neighborhood of the ignition plug to the boundary of the combustion chamber. During this process, the unburned air-fuel mixture in the region remote from the ignition plug 3 (end gas) is pressed against the piston and the cylinder wall, and its temperature and pressure become high because of adiabatic compression. If the temperature and pressure of the end gas exceed a limit, the end gas may self-ignite instantaneously to cause knock.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">On the other hand, if lubricant oil enters the combustion chamber or a deposit is formed on the wall of the combustion<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> chamber, the lubricant oil and the deposit can be an ignition source that ignites the air-fuel mixture before it is ignited by the ignition plug 3 to cause pre-ignition in some cases.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">When abnormal combustion such as knock or pre-ignition occurs, it is necessary to perform processing such as retarding the operation time of the ignition plug 3 (ignition timing) or reducing the air-fuel ratio (enriching). To execute such processing, it is necessary to determine or detects the occurrence of abnormal combustion accurately.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">A known method of detecting abnormal combustion is to obtain the highest intensity (peak value) of vibration or the vibration intensity waveform appearing in a determination period (e.g. from the late stage of the compression stroke to the early stage of the expansion stroke) set for each cylinder 2 and to compare the peak value with a determination threshold or compare the vibration intensity waveform with a reference waveform, thereby determining whether abnormal combustion is occurring or not.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In the case where abnormal combustion causing strong vibration such as knock or pre-ignition with high vibration intensity occurs, there is a possibility that the vibration caused by such abnormal combustion may linger in the determination period for the next cylinder. In particular, when the engine speed is high, there is a possibility that relatively strong vibration may linger because the interval between the determination periods is short. For example, if abnormal combustion with a vibration intensity much higher than the determination threshold occurs in one cylinder 2 of the internal combustion engine 1, the vibration lingers in the determination period for the next cylinder as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. Then, the intensity of the lingering vibration may exceed the determination threshold. In this case, there is a possibility that it may be determined mistakenly that abnormal combustion<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> is occurring in the next cylinder, though it is not occurring.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In the abnormal combustion detection processing in this embodiment, when it is determined that abnormal combustion occurs in one cylinder 2, the ECU 9 computes the intensity of vibration that will linger in the determination period for the next cylinder and corrects the determination threshold to be referred to in the determination processing for the next cylinder.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The intensity of vibration lingering in the determination period for the next cylinder can be computed using as parameters the peak value of the vibration intensity at the time of the occurrence of abnormal combustion, the damping rate of the vibration intensity, and the length of time from the time at which the vibration intensity reaches the peak value to the time of beginning of the determination period for the next cylinder (which will be hereinafter referred to as the "allowance time").</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The peak value of the vibration intensity can be determined based on the vibration intensity waveform. The damping rate of the vibration intensity depends on the damping capability (vibration damping rate) of the cylinder block, and it can be determined in advance based on the vibration damping rate of the cylinder block. The allowance time can be calculated from the position of the crankshaft (crank angle) at the time when the vibration intensity reaches the peak value, the crank angle at the time of beginning of the determination period of the next cylinder, and the engine speed as parameters.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The ECU 9 computes the magnitude of the intensity of the vibration lingering at the time of beginning of the determination period for the next cylinder (which will be hereinafter referred to as the "lingering vibration<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> intensity") using as parameters the peak value of the vibration intensity, the damping rate of the vibration intensity, and the allowance time. In connection with this, the relationship of the lingering vibration intensity with the peak value of the vibration intensity, the damping rate of the vibration intensity, and the allowance time may be prepared as a map or function expression stored in the ROM of the ECU 9. Since the damping rate of the vibration intensity and the crank angle at the time when the determination period for the next cylinder begins are constant, a map or function equation of which parameters are the peak value of the vibration intensity, the crank angle at the time when the vibration intensity reaches the peak value, and the engine speed may be used.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Then, the ECU 9 corrects the determination threshold to be used in the determination processing for the next cylinder to change it to a value larger than the aforementioned lingering vibration intensity (as indicated by chain line in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>). For example, the ECU 9 may set the determination threshold for the next cylinder to a value equal to the sum of the determination threshold before correction and the lingering vibration intensity. While the determination threshold after correction is a constant value in the illustrative case shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the determination threshold may be varied with change in the vibration intensity over time. For example, the ECU 9 may decrease the determination threshold in accordance with the damping rate of the vibration intensity as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">If the determination threshold for the next cylinder is corrected in a fashion shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> or <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>, an incorrect determination that abnormal combustion is occurring in the next cylinder is unlikely to be made when abnormal combustion is not occurring in the next cylinder. Consequently, in the case where abnormal combustion causing strong vibration such<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> as knock or pre-ignition with high vibration intensity occurs in one cylinder, the determination processing for the next cylinder can be performed with improved accuracy.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In the following, the procedure of performing abnormality detection processing in this embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5.

For example, the ECU 9 extracts vibration components in a specific frequency band from values measured by the knock sensor 12 during the determination period. In this process, the ECU 9 may use a band pass filter that passes only vibration components in the specific frequency band. The "specific frequency band" mentioned above is a band which includes frequencies of vibrations caused by abnormal combustion. The measurement means according to the present invention is embodied by the extraction of the vibration intensity from measurement signals of the knock sensor 12 by the ECU 9. Then, the ECU 9 divides the aforementioned determination period into equal calculation periods (e.g. periods corresponding to every five-degree crank rotation) and integrates the vibration intensity in each calculation period. The ECU 9 computes a vibration intensity waveform in which the crank angles and the integrated values in the respective calculation periods are interrelated with each other. The ECU 9 determines the peak value from the vibration intensity waveform. Then, the ECU 9 determines whether or not the aforementioned peak value is larger than a determination threshold.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In the processing of step S102, the ECU 9 determines whether or not abnormal combustion is occurring.

Even in cases where vibration caused by abnormal combustion occurring in one cylinder 2 lingers in the determination<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> period for the next cylinder, correcting the determination threshold in this way enables the determination processing for the next cylinder to be performed with improved accuracy. Consequently, an incorrect determination that abnormal combustion is occurring in the next cylinder is unlikely to be made when abnormal combustion is not occurring in the next cylinder.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The correction means according to the present invention is embodied by the execution of the processing of steps S103 to S105 by the ECU 9.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">When it is determined in the processing of step S102 that abnormal combustion is not occurring, the ECU 9 terminates the execution of this processing routine without correcting the determination threshold to be used in the determination processing for the next cylinder.
