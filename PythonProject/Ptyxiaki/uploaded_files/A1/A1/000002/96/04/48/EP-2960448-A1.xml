Thus, upon the amount of accumulated PM reaching a predetermined amount, so-called forced regeneration for burning and removing the accumulated PM needs to be carried out. Therefore, it is desirable to precisely measure the amount of accumulated PM in order to control the forced regeneration.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For example, PATENT LITERATURE 1 discloses a PM sensor that detects an amount of accumulated PM on the basis of an electrostatic capacity (capacitance) of a capacitor formed by a pair of electrodes.

The DPF inlet temperature sensor 31 is arranged upstream of the DPF outlet temperature sensor 32.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The in-pipe injection device 13 injects unburned fuel (primarily HC) into the exhaust passage 12, in response to an instruction signal from an electronic control unit (hereinafter referred to as "ECU") 20. The in-pipe injection device 13 may be omitted if post-injection through multiple-injection of the engine 10 is carried out.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The DPF inlet temperature sensor 31 detects the temperature of the exhaust gas flowing into a DPF 16 (hereinafter referred to as "inlet temperature T<sub>IN</sub>"). The DPF outlet temperature sensor 32 detects the temperature of the exhaust gas flowing out of the DPF 16 (hereinafter referred to as "outlet temperature T<sub>OUT</sub>"). The inlet temperature T<sub>IN</sub> and the outlet temperature T<sub>OUT</sub> are introduced to the ECU 20, which is electrically connected to the DPF inlet temperature sensor 31 and the DPF outlet temperature sensor 32.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The exhaust gas post-treatment device 14 is constituted by an oxidation catalyst 15 and the DPF 16 disposed inside a casing 14a. The oxidation catalyst 15 is arranged upstream of the DPF 16.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The oxidation catalyst 15 includes, for example, a ceramic carrier having a cordierite honeycomb structure, with a catalyst component supported on a surface of the ceramic carrier. When forced regeneration of the DPF 16 is carried out, the oxidation catalyst 15 oxidizes the unburned fuel (primarily HC) upon the unburned fuel being supplied by the in-pipe injection device 13 or through post-injection, thereby causing the exhaust gas temperature to rise. Thus, the temperature of the DPF 16 is raised to the PM-burning temperature (e.g., approximately 600 degrees C), and the accumulated PM is burned and removed.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The DPF 16 includes, for example, a number of cells arranged along the flowing direction of the exhaust gas. The cells form lattice-patterned exhaust flow channels defined by<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> partition walls. The partition walls are made from porous ceramics. The cells are plugged alternatingly at their upstream sides (upstream ends) and their downstream sides (downstream ends).

Blockage members 6 are provided in the center cells 1. A pair of cells 2 are disposed diagonally across each of the center cells 1, and first electrodes A are received in the respective cells 2 (hereinafter, the cells 2 are referred to as "first-electrode cells").

The first electrodes A are received in the first-electrode cells 2 from the unplugged side (their downstream ends in the flow direction of the exhaust gas), and the second electrodes B are received in the second-electrode cells 3 from the unplugged side, respectively. Thus, the four electrodes are arranged diagonally across the center cell 1, and four capacitors are formed between the first electrodes A and the second electrodes B. In the following description, the four cells 4 that are situated adjacent to each other around the partition walls of the center cell 1 and sandwiched between the first-electrode cells 2 and the second-electrode cells 3 are referred to as "measurement cells."</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The first electrodes A received in the first-electrode cells 2 have their end portions protruding outward on the downstream side of the exhaust passage, and these end portions are connected to each other by a first connecting member A1 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2a</figref>) made from a conductive metal wire. In a similar manner, the second electrodes B received in the second-electrode cells 3 have their downstream end portions protruding outward on the downstream side of the exhaust passage, and these end portions are connected to each other by a second connecting member B1<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2a</figref>) made from a conductive metal wire.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In this embodiment, a protruding amount (length) of the first electrode A is greater than a protruding amount (length) of the second electrode B in order to prevent the first connecting member A1 and the second connecting member B1 from coming into contact with each other. It should be noted, however, that the protruding amount of the first electrode A need not be greater than the second electrode B, i.e., the protruding length of the second electrode B may be greater than the protruding length of the first electrode A.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, each of the first connecting members A1 and the second connecting members B1 may have a flat plate shape. In this configuration, the first connecting A1 may have a fixture hole a1 such that an end of the first electrode A extends through the fixture hole a1 and is secured by welding, and the second connecting B1 may have a fixture hole b1 such that an end of the second electrode B extends through the fixture hole b1 and is secured by welding. The second connecting member B1 may have a through hole b2 that has a larger diameter than the first electrode A such that the first electrode A can extend through the through hole b2 without contacting the through hole b2.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">An orifice 8 is provided at the upstream end of the measurement cell 4 to throttle the exhaust gas flowing into the measurement cell 4 (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3a-3e</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4a-4e</figref>). The "upstream end" is the end positioned upstream in terms of the flow direction of the exhaust gas. The orifice 8 reduces a flow rate of the exhaust gas flowing into the measurement cell 4, and therefore it is possible to delay the accumulation of PM on the partition walls of the measurement cell 4. As such, if the opening diameter of the orifice 8 is set to an optimal value under given conditions, it is possible to adjust the timing of saturation of the changing electrostatic capacity between the first electrode A and the second electrode B to desired timing.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">A blockage member 6 for blocking (closing) the exhaust passage is provided in each of the center cells 1. For example, the blockage member 6 is made from ceramics, which is the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> same material as the DPF 16. In this embodiment, the blockage member 6 extends from the plugged end to the unplugged end of the center cell 1 such that the blockage member 6 closes the entire exhaust passage inside the center cell 1, and the entire interior of the center cell 1 is filled with the blockage member 6 (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3a-3e</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4a-4e</figref>).</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Accordingly, the exhaust gas flowing into the measurement cell 4 does not flow into the center cell 1, but flows into the first-electrode cells 2 and the second-electrode cells 3. Thus, the PM in the exhaust gas flowing into the measurement cell 4 is collected (retained) on the surfaces of the partition walls of the electrode cells 2 and 3. The accumulation of PM on the partition walls on the center cell 1 side is effectively suppressed. In particular, due to the synergetic effect with the orifice 8, it is possible to effectively reduce not only the accumulation of PM on the partition walls of the measurement cell 4 on the center cell side, but also on a turned U-shaped (U-shaped) accumulation of PM on the rear face of the plug and the partition walls in the measurement cell 4.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">It should be noted that the entire interior of the center cell 1 may not be filed with the blockage member 6.

In the illustrated embodiment, the additional blockage members 7 are provided in the first electrodes A. In this configuration, it is possible to effectively suppress the accumulation of PM on not only the partition wall surfaces on the center cell 1 side but also on the partition wall surfaces on the first-electrode cells 2 side.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Referring back to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the ECU 20 of this embodiment will be described. The ECU 20 controls fuel injection and other operations of the engine 10 and the in-pipe injection device 13,<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> and includes a known CPU, ROM, RAM, input port, output port, and so on. The ECU 20 includes, as part of its functional elements, an electrostatic capacity calculating unit 21 and a PM accumulation amount estimating unit 22.

The amount PM<sub>DEP</sub> of accumulated PM can be estimated by using an approximation formula, a map, or the like obtained or prepared in advance through an experiment.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Operations and advantages of the particulate matter measuring device of this embodiment will now be described.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In the conventional PM sensor, one capacitor is only formed by a pair of electrodes disposed with a single cell interposed therebetween (e.g., only two capacitors are formed by two<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> electrodes A and two electrodes B). Therefore, in order to increase the number of measurement cells, the number of electrodes needs to be increased, and problems arise, i.e., the fabrication cost increases and the PM collection performance of the DPF drops due to an increase in the number of electrode cells.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">On the contrary, in the particulate matter measuring device of this embodiment, the two first electrodes A are received in the corresponding pair of cells 2 located diagonally across the center cell 1, the two second electrodes B are disposed in the corresponding pair of cells 3 located diagonally across the center cell 1, and four capacitors are formed between the two first electrodes A and the two second electrodes B. In other words, four cells located diagonally across the center cell 1 serve as the measurement cells for measuring the electrostatic capacity.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Therefore, according to the particulate matter measuring device of this embodiment, a large number of capacitors can be formed effectively without significantly increasing the number of the electrodes A and B, and an increase in the fabrication cost and a decrease in the PM collecting capability of the DPF can effectively be suppressed.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In the conventional PM sensor, the upstream ends of the four cells opposing each other over the measurement cells are only plugged, and their downstream ends are not plugged. Thus, the PM in the exhaust gas flowing into each measurement cell accumulates in a substantially rectangular shape on the surfaces of the partition walls of the measurement cell. If the PM accumulates in the substantially rectangular shape on the partition wall surfaces of the measurement cell in this manner, the electrostatic capacity between the electrodes of the capacitor becomes a saturated condition in a short time (quickly). This results in a problem, i.e., the sensitivity of the capacitor drops.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">On the contrary, in the particulate matter measuring device of this embodiment, the orifice 8 is provided at the upstream end of each measurement cell 4 to reduce the flow rate of the exhaust gas. In addition, the blockage member 6 is provided in the center cell 1 to block<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> (close) the exhaust passage inside the center cell 1.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">As such, the flow rate of the exhaust gas flowing into the measurement cell 4 is reduced by the orifice 8, and therefore the PM accumulation on the partition walls of the measurement cell 4 is reduced. Also, the flow of the exhaust gas into the center cell 1 is blocked by the blockage member 6, and therefore the PM accumulation on the partition walls on the center cell side is reduced (see <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>). Furthermore, the synergetic effect of the orifice 8 and the blockage member 6 effectively suppresses the PM accumulation on not only the partition walls of the measurement cell 4 on the center cell side, but also on the rear face of the plug and the turned U-shaped (U-shaped) accumulation of PM on the partition wall surfaces inside the measurement cell 4. As a result, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 9</figref>, it is possible to significantly delay the timing of saturation of the changing electrostatic capacity, as compared to the conventional PM sensor.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Therefore, the particulate matter measuring device of this embodiment can effectively prevent the early saturation of the changing electrostatic capacity and reliably prevents the deterioration of the sensitivity.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">It is to be noted that the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and can be implemented with changes and modifications, as appropriate, within the scope that does not depart from the spirit of the present invention.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">For example, although the DPF 16 is disposed in the exhaust passage 12 with the plugged sides of the center cells 1 facing toward the upstream side of the exhaust passage in the foregoing description, the DPF 16 may be disposed with the unplugged sides of the center cells 4 facing toward the upstream side of the exhaust passage. It should also be noted that the blockage members 6 in the center cells 1 may be dispensed with, if the orifices 8 alone can adjust the saturation timing of the electrostatic capacity to desired timing.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 10</figref>, a bypass passage 18 that branches off from the exhaust passage<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> 12 at a position downstream of the oxidation catalyst 15 may be provided, and a measurement DPF 16 having a reduced capacity may be disposed in the bypass passage 18.
