Typically, the DPF includes a number of cells that form lattice-patterned exhaust flow channels defined by partition walls of porous ceramics, and these cells are plugged alternatingly at an upstream side and a downstream side.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The DPF can only collect a limited amount of PM. Thus, upon the amount of accumulated PM reaching a predetermined amount, so-called forced regeneration for burning and removing the accumulated PM needs to be carried out. Therefore, it is desirable to precisely measure the amount of accumulated PM in order to control the forced regeneration.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For example, PATENT LITERATURE 1 discloses a PM sensor that detects an amount of accumulated PM on the basis of an electrostatic capacity (capacitance) of a capacitor formed by a pair of electrodes. The paired electrodes are disposed in a corresponding pair of cells that oppose each other with a measurement cell interposed therebetween. The measurement cell is plugged at its downstream end of the exhaust passage.</p><heading id="h0003">LISTING OF REFERENCES</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">PATENT LITERATURE 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2012241643A"><text>Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication (Kokai) No. 2012-241643</text></patcit><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0005">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">With the above-mentioned conventional PM sensor, it is difficult for the electrodes disposed in the cells to maintain their linear shapes (linearity). Thus, the outer peripheries of the electrodes partially come into contact with the surfaces of the partition walls of the cells. Typically, the electrode is made only from a conductive metal material. Thus, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref> of the accompanying drawings, a problem arises, i.e., when conductive PM accumulates in a substantially rectangular shape on the surfaces of the partition walls of a measurement cell 100 and is also collected (retained) in the partition walls, a pair of electrodes A10 and B10 are coupled to each other through the conductive PM and short-circuit to each other.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention has been made in view of such a problem, and an object of the present invention is to effectively prevent short-circuiting between electrodes that could occur due to PM accumulation.</p><heading id="h0006">SOLUTION TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">To achieve the above-mentioned object, a device for measuring particulate matter according to the present invention includes a filter that is provided in an exhaust passage of an internal combustion engine and that includes a plurality of cells forming lattice-patterned exhaust flow channels defined by porous partition walls, the cells being plugged alternatingly at an upstream side and a downstream side; a pair of electrodes disposed (received) in a corresponding pair of cells that oppose each other, with at least one cell, which serves as a measurement cell, being interposed between the paired cells, the paired electrodes being received in the corresponding paired cells from an unplugged side; and an accumulation amount calculating unit that calculates an amount of accumulated particulate matter collected by the filter, on the basis of an electrostatic capacity between the paired electrodes. Each of the electrodes includes a conductive wire core and an insulating layer that covers the conductive wire core.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The insulating layer may be made from a ceramic material or a glass material.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">One of the cells may be defined as a center cell. Four measurement cells may be disposed adjacent to four respective partition walls of the center cell, and four of the electrodes (a pair of diagonally disposed electrodes, and another pair of diagonally disposed electrodes) may be disposed in four respective cells located diagonally across the center cell. The device for measuring particulate matter may further include a first connecting member that connects a pair of diagonally disposed electrodes to each other, and a second connecting member that connects another pair of diagonally disposed electrodes to each other.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The filter may be disposed in the exhaust passage with the unplugged side of the measurement cell facing toward the upstream side.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The device for measuring particulate matter may further include a bypass passage that branches off from the exhaust passage at a predetermined position, and a second filter that is provided in the exhaust passage at a position downstream of the predetermined position (branching position of the bypass passage) and that collects particulate matter in the exhaust gas flowing through the exhaust passage downstream of the predetermined position.

Thus, the temperature of the DPF 16 is raised to the PM-burning temperature (e.g., approximately 600 degrees C), and the accumulated PM is burned and removed.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The DPF 16 includes, for example, a number of cells arranged along the flowing direction of the exhaust gas. The cells form lattice-patterned exhaust flow channels defined by partition walls. The partition walls are made from porous ceramics. The cells are plugged alternatingly at their upstream sides (upstream ends) and their downstream sides (downstream ends). Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2a, 2b</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, the detailed structure of the DPF 16 of this embodiment will be described.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2a and 2b</figref>, a plurality of cells 1 that are plugged at the upstream side of the exhaust passage are selected as center cells in the DPF 16. A pair of cells 2 are disposed diagonally across each of the center cells 1, and first electrodes A are received in the respective cells 2 (hereinafter, the cells 2 are referred to as "first-electrode cells"). Another pair of cells 3 are disposed diagonally across each of the center cells 1, and second electrodes B are received in the respective cells 3 (hereinafter, the cells 3 are referred to as second-electrode cells). Four cells 4 that are adjacent to the partition walls of the center cell 1 concerned, and that are each interposed between the associated first-electrode cell 2 and the associated second-electrode cell 3 are selected as cells for measuring an electrostatic capacity (hereinafter, the cells 4 are referred to as "measurement cells").</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the first electrode A and the second electrode B include wire cores A1 and B1 made from a conductive metal material and insulating layers A2 and B2 made from an insulating ceramic material or glass material, and the insulating layers A2 and B2 cover the outer peripheries of the wire cores A1 and B1. Thus, even if the electrodes A and B bend in the cells 2 and 3 and at least partially come into contact with the surfaces of the partition walls, the insulating layers A2 and B2 are present between the partition walls and the wire cores A1 and B1. Accordingly, even if conductive PM accumulates in a substantially rectangular shape on the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> surfaces of the partition walls of the measurement cell 4 and some of the conductive PM is also collected into the partition walls, short-circuiting between the first electrode A and the second electrode B can reliably be prevented.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The first electrodes A received in the first-electrode cells 2 have their end portions protruding outward on the downstream side of the exhaust passage, and these end portions are connected to each other by a first connecting member A3 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2a</figref>) made from a conductive metal wire. In a similar manner, the second electrodes B received in the second-electrode cells 3 have their downstream end portions protruding outward on the downstream side of the exhaust passage, and these end portions are connected to each other by a second connecting member B3 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2a</figref>) made from a conductive metal wire.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In this embodiment, a protruding amount (length) of the first electrode A is greater than a protruding amount (length) of the second electrode B in order to prevent the first connecting member A3 and the second connecting member B3 from coming into contact with each other. It should be noted, however, that the protruding amount of the first electrode A need not be greater than the second electrode B, i.e., the protruding length of the second electrode B may be greater than the protruding length of the first electrode A.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Referring back to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the ECU 20 of this embodiment will be described. The ECU 20 controls fuel injection and other operations of the engine 10 and the in-pipe injection device 13, and includes a known CPU, ROM, RAM, input port, output port, and so on. The ECU 20 includes, as part of its functional elements, an electrostatic capacity calculating unit 21 and a PM accumulation amount estimating unit 22.

The amount PM<sub>DEP</sub> of accumulated PM can be estimated by using an approximation formula, a map, or the like obtained or prepared in advance through an experiment.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Operations and advantages of the particulate matter measuring device of this embodiment will now be described.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">A conventional PM sensor is difficult to retain the linearity of electrodes disposed in cells. Thus, the electrodes partially come into contact with the surfaces of the partition walls of the cells. Because the electrodes are made only from a conductive metal material, there is a possibility that when conductive PM accumulates in a substantially rectangular shape on the surfaces of the partition walls of a measurement cell and some of the conductive PM is also collected in the partition walls, a pair of electrodes are coupled to each other through the conductive PM (see <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>) and a short circuit is established between the electrodes.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">On the contrary, in the particulate matter measuring device according to this embodiment, the first electrode A and the second electrode B include the conductive wire cores A1 and B1<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> with their outer peripheries being covered with the insulating layers A2 and B2. Thus, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>, even if the conductive PM accumulates in a substantially rectangular shape on the surfaces of the partition walls of the measurement cell and is also collected in the partition walls, the wire core A1 of the first electrode A and the wire core B1 of the second electrode B are reliably prevented from coupling to each other by the insulating layers A2 and B2 interposed therebetween.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Therefore, the particulate matter measuring device of this embodiment can reliably prevent short-circuiting between the first electrode A and the second electrode B that would otherwise occur due to PM accumulation. In particular, when the DPF 16 has a catalyst supported therein, the insulating layers A2 and B2 also function as protective layers, and thus corrosion of the first electrode A and the second electrode B can effectively be suppressed.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In the conventional PM sensor, one capacitor is only formed by a pair of electrodes disposed with a single cell interposed therebetween (e.g., only two capacitors are formed by two electrodes A and two electrodes B). Therefore, in order to increase the number of measurement cells, the number of electrodes needs to be increased, and problems arise, i.e., the fabrication cost increases, and the PM collection performance of the DPF drops due to an increase in the number of electrode cells.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">On the contrary, in the particulate matter measuring device of this embodiment, the two first electrodes A are disposed in the corresponding pair of cells 2 located diagonally across the center cell 1, the two second electrodes B are disposed in the corresponding pair of cells 3 located diagonally across the center cell 1, and four capacitors are formed between the two first electrodes A and the two second electrodes B. In other words, four cells located diagonally across the center cell 1 serve as the measurement cells for measuring the electrostatic capacity.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Therefore, according to the particulate matter measuring device of this embodiment, a large number of capacitors can be formed effectively without significantly increasing the number<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> of the electrodes A and B, and an increase in the fabrication cost and a decrease in the PM collecting capability of the DPF can effectively be suppressed.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">It is to be noted that the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and can be implemented with changes and modifications, as appropriate, within the scope that does not depart from the spirit of the present invention.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">For example, although the DPF 16 is disposed in the exhaust passage 12 with the unplugged side of the measurement cells 4 facing toward the upstream side of the exhaust passage in the foregoing description, the DPF 16 may be disposed with the plugged side of the measurement cells 4 facing toward the upstream side of the exhaust passage.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5</figref>, a bypass passage 18 that branches off from the exhaust passage 12 at a position downstream of the oxidation catalyst 15 may be provided, and a measurement DPF 16 having a reduced capacity may be disposed in the bypass passage 18. In this case, it is preferred that a DPF 17 (second filter) having a large capacity be provided in the exhaust passage 12 downstream of the branching portion, and an orifice 18a for adjusting the flow rate of the exhaust gas be provided in the bypass passage 18.
