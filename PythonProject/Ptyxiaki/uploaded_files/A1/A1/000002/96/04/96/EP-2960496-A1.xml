The nacelle is rotatably disposed on top of a tower, and a generator and so on is disposed in the nacelle. The blades are disposed rotatably with respect to a hub provided on the nacelle. In such a windmill, a rotation driving mechanism configured to rotate the nacelle (rotation-side structure) with respect to the tower (base-side structure) is used.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2013083247A"><text>JP2013-083247A</text></patcit> discloses a rotation driving mechanism including a yaw driving mechanism fixed on a nacelle and a ring gear fixed on a tower, wherein a pinion of the yaw driving mechanism is meshed with the ring gear. In the rotation driving mechanism, when the yaw driving mechanism works, the pinion makes a rotation while being meshed with the ring gear as well as makes a revolution, so that the nacelle (rotation-side structure) is rotated with respect to the tower (base-side structure).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the aforementioned rotation driving mechanism, since the number of teeth of the pinion and the ring gear, which<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> simultaneously contact with each other, is small, a large stress is generated in a drive transmission area between the pinion and the ring gear. This not only reduces a mechanism life of the rotation driving mechanism, but also impairs a drive transmission capacity of the mechanism. On the other hand, in order to elongate the mechanism life and to improve the drive transmission capacity, the rotation driving mechanism has to be enlarged in size.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention has been made for solving the above problem. The object of the present invention is to provide a small-size rotation driving mechanism for windmill having an excellent durability and an excellent drive transmission capacity.
<ol><li>(1) In order to solve the above problem, the rotation driving mechanism according to one aspect of the present invention is a rotation driving mechanism for windmill for use in a windmill including a base-side structure and a rotation-side structure that is rotatable with respect to the base-side structure, so as to rotate the rotation-side structure with respect to the base-side structure, the rotation driving mechanism for windmill comprising:
<ul><li>an annular track part formed in one structure of the base-side structure and the rotation-side structure, the annular track part having a track wall part whose wall surface is directed toward the other structure of the base-side structure and the rotation-side structure, and first teeth that are arranged such that each facewidth direction thereof radially extends along an in-plane direction of the wall surface;</li><li>a rotation driving part having a rotatable rotating shaft, the rotation driving part being fixed on the other structure; and</li><li>a swinging unit including swinging parts each having a meshing part to be meshed with a part of the first teeth, and a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> swinging part body provided with the meshing part, wherein the swinging parts are arranged along the facewidth direction of the first teeth, and the swinging unit is configured to be relatively moved with respect to the annular track part in a circumferential direction of the annular track part, when the rotating shaft is rotated so that the swinging parts are swung with maintaining a predetermined phase difference thereamong,</li><li>wherein the meshing part includes second teeth to be meshed with the first teeth.</li></ul></li></ol></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In this constitution, when the annular track part is disposed on the base-side structure, and the rotation driving part and the swinging unit are disposed on the rotation-side structure (i.e., when the base-side structure is the one structure, and the rotation-side structure is the other structure), the rotation driving mechanism for windmill is operated as follows. Specifically, the swinging parts are swung with maintaining a predetermined phase difference thereamong, while the second teeth in each swinging part are meshed with a part of the first teeth, so that the swinging parts are moved along a circumferential direction of the annular track part disposed on the base-side structure. Thus, the rotation-side structure, which is a structure on which the swinging parts are fixed, is rotated with respect to the base-side structure.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">On the other hand, when the annular track part is disposed on the rotation-side structure, and the rotation driving part and the swinging parts are disposed on the base-side structure (i.e., when the rotation-side structure is the one structure, and the base-side structure is the other structure), the rotation driving mechanism for windmill is operated as follows. Specifically, when the rotating shaft of the rotation driving part is rotated so that the swinging parts are swung with maintaining a predetermined phase difference thereamong, the annular track part disposed on the rotation-side structure is rotated. Thus, the rotation-side structure is rotated with<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> respect to the base-side structure.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Both in the aforementioned constitutions, the rotation-side structure is rotated with respect to the base-side structure, while the first teeth and the second teeth are meshed with each other. Namely, in this constitution, during the rotation of the rotation-side structure, the number of meshed teeth between the swinging unit and the annular track part can be increased. Thus, since a stress acting on a contact portion between the first teeth and the second teeth can be reduced, the risk in which the rotation driving mechanism is damaged can be reduced, and a mechanism strength can be enhanced. In addition, according to this constitution, since the number of meshed teeth can be increased, it is not necessary to enlarge the mechanism in size in order to elongate a mechanism life expectancy and to improve a drive transmission capacity.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Therefore, according to this constitution, a small-size rotation driving mechanism for windmill having an excellent durability and an excellent drive transmission capacity can be provided.
<ul><li>(2) Preferably, the first teeth are rotatably held with respect to the track wall part, or the second teeth are rotatably held with respect to the swinging part body.</li></ul></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to this constitution, under a state where the first teeth and the second teeth are meshed with each other, when a force of the first teeth acts on the second teeth or when a force of the second teeth acts on the first teeth, the teeth that are rotatably held are rotated. Namely, according to this constitution, since a frictional force can be reduced by the slidable contact between the first teeth and the second teeth, a stress acting on a contact portion between the first teeth and the second teeth can be further reduced. Thus, the durability and the drive transmission capacity of the rotation driving<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> mechanism can be further improved.
<ul><li>(3) More preferably, grooves are formed in the wall surface of the track wall part such that the grooves radially extend along the in-plane direction of the wall surface, each groove having a bottom part whose sectional shape in a plane perpendicular to a direction in which the groove extends is circular arc shape; and<br/>
each of the first teeth is accommodated in one groove of the grooves such that the facewidth direction of the first tooth extends along the direction in which the groove extends, each of the first teeth being a rod-like member that is rotatable while sliding with respect to the one groove.</li></ul></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As in this constitution, since the rod-like members rotatable with respect to the respective grooves formed in the track wall part are provided as the first teeth, the first teeth can be easily made rotatable with respect to the track wall part with such a simple structure.
<ul><li>(4) More preferably, the first tooth is formed to have a truncated conical shape having a diameter increasing from a radially inside portion toward a radially outside portion, when the first tooth is accommodated in the groove; and<br/>
the groove is formed to have a shape corresponding to (complementary to) the first tooth.</li></ul></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As described above, the swinging parts in each swinging unit are arranged along the facewidth direction of the radially arranged first teeth, and each swinging part is relatively moved along the arrangement direction of the first teeth (circumferential direction). Namely, in each swinging unit, a moving distance of the swinging part located on the radially outside (diametrically outside) is longer than that of the swinging part located on the radially inside (diametrically inside). Thus, since each of the first teeth is formed to have the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> truncated conical shape, the swinging unit can be moved more smoothly along the circumferential direction of the annular track part.
<ul><li>(5) Preferably, the second tooth is a roller that is rotatable about a shaft part attached to the swinging part body such that an axial direction thereof extends along the facewidth direction of the first tooth.</li></ul></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to this constitution, the second teeth can be easily made to be rotatable with respect to the swinging part body, with a simple constitution.
<ul><li>(6) Preferably, the rotation driving mechanism for windmill further comprises:

In the rotation driving mechanism for windmill 1, when the nacelle 103 is turned in one circumferential direction (direction shown by arrow A), the rotating shaft 13 of the electric motor 11 of each driving unit 10 is rotated (normally rotated) in one direction (direction shown by arrow B). Then, the three first eccentric parts 14 integrally provided on the rotating shaft 13 are rotated, with maintaining the phase difference of 120 degrees thereamong. At this time, the three second eccentric prats 14 are rotated, with maintaining the phase difference of 120 degrees thereamong. The rotation of second eccentric parts 19 is in synchronization with the rotation of first eccentric parts 14. As a result, the three swinging parts 15 are swung. In other words, the three swinging parts 15 translate along a circumferential path about the central axis of the rotating shaft 13. The plurality of second teeth 16b of at least one swinging part 15 (swinging part 15A in the state shown <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>) of the three swinging parts 15, which are swung by the respective first eccentric parts 14, are meshed with the plurality of first teeth 7 in the annular track part 2. Thus, when the electric motor 11 is normally rotated, the second teeth 16b of any one of swinging parts 15 (swinging part 15A in the state shown <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>) of each driving unit 10 push (urge) the first teeth 7 to move in a direction shown by an arrow C in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>. Thus, the driving unit 10 and the nacelle 103, on which the driving unit 10 is fixed, slightly move in the direction shown by the arrow A.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">When the swinging part 15A moves in the direction shown by the arrow C, the swinging part 15A moves away from the annular track part 2. However, at this time, the second teeth 16b of the succeeding swinging part 15B are meshed with<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> the first teeth 7 of the annular track part 2. Then, similar to the swinging part 15A, the swinging part 15B moves in the direction shown by the arrow C. Thus, the driving unit 10 and the nacelle 103 slightly move in the direction shown by the arrow A. When the swinging part 15B moves away from the annular track part 2, the succeeding swinging part 15C is meshed with the first teeth 7 of the annular track part 2. Thus, by performing an operation similar to the above, the driving unit 10 and the nacelle 103 further move in the direction shown by the arrow A. When the swinging part 15C moves away from the annular track part 2, the swinging part 15A is again meshed with the first teeth 7.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In this manner, in the driving unit 10, the three swinging parts 15 repeatedly perform the above-described operations in turn. Thus, the driving unit 10 moves along the one circumferential direction of the annular track part 2 (the direction shown by the arrow A in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>). As a result, the nacelle 103 on which the driving units 10 are fixed is rotated with respect to the tower 102 in which the annular track part 2 is formed. In order that the nacelle 103 is reversely rotated, the rotating shaft 13 of the electric motor 11 is rotated in a direction opposite to the above case.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">As described above, when the second teeth 16b push (urge) the first teeth 7, the first teeth 7 pushed (urged) by the second teeth 16b are rotated with respect to the grooves 5 in which the first teeth 7 are accommodated. Thus, a frictional force is reduced by the slidable contact between the second teeth 16b and the first teeth 7.</p><heading id="h0011">[Effect]</heading><p id="p0044" num="0044">As described above, in the rotation driving mechanism for windmill 1 according to the above embodiment, since the rotating shaft 13 of the electric motor 11 is rotated so that the plurality of swinging parts 15 are swung with maintaining a<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> predetermined phase difference thereamong, the swinging parts 15 are moved along the circumferential direction of the annular track part 2 provided in the tower 102. Thus, the nacelle 103, which is a structure on which the swinging parts 15 are fixed, is rotated with respect to the tower 102.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">During the rotation of the nacelle 103, the second teeth 16b of any one of the swinging parts 15 in the driving unit 10 are meshed with the first teeth 7 at any timing. Namely, in the rotation driving mechanism for windmill 1 according to this embodiment, upon rotation of the nacelle 103, the number of meshed teeth between the swinging unit 20 and the annular track part 2 can be increased. Thus, since a stress acting on a contact portion between the first teeth 7 and the second teeth 16b can be reduced, the risk in which the rotation driving mechanism 1 is damaged can be reduced, and a mechanism strength can be enhanced. In addition, according to this constitution, since the number of meshed teeth can be increased, it is not necessary to enlarge the mechanism in size in order to elongate a mechanism life expectancy and to improve a drive transmission capacity.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">As a result, according to this embodiment, a small-size rotation driving mechanism for windmill having an excellent durability and an excellent drive transmission capacity can be provided.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In addition, in the rotation driving mechanism for windmill 1, since the first teeth 7 are rotatably held by the upper wall surface 4, a frictional force can be reduced by the slidable contact between the first teeth 7 and the second teeth 16b. In addition, due to the constitution in which the first teeth 7 are rotatably held by the upper wall surface 4, it is possible to omit a heat treatment step, which is required when a large size gear having teeth integrally formed with a discoid portion or an annular portion is manufactured. A heat<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> treatment of a large component is expensive, and plants capable of performing such a heat treatment are few. Thus, by omitting the heat treatment step, a step resulting in increase in cost of a product can be omitted.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In addition, as in the rotation driving mechanism for windmill 1, since the rod-like members rotatable with respect to the respective grooves 5 formed in the annular wall part 3 are provided as the first teeth 7 of the annular track part 2, the first teeth 7 can be easily made rotatable with respect to the annular wall part 3 with such a simple structure.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In addition, as in the rotation driving mechanism for windmill 1, since each of the first teeth 7 has a truncated conical shape, the swinging units 20 can be more smoothly guided along the circumferential direction of the annular track part 2.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In addition, in the rotation driving mechanism for windmill 1, since the nacelle 103 can be rotated by the plurality of swinging units 20, a load that acts during its rotation can be dispersed to the plurality of driving units 10. Thus, the risk in which the driving units 10 are damaged can be reduced.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In addition, in this embodiment, the rotation driving mechanism for windmill 1 can be utilized as a yaw driving apparatus for rotating the nacelle 103 with respect to the tower 102.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The embodiment of the present invention has been described as above, but the present invention is not limited to the above embodiment. The present invention can be variously modified within the scope of the claims. For example, the following modification examples are possible.
<ol><li>(1) <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 8</figref> is a view schematically showing a driving unit 10a<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> (excluding an electric motor) of the rotation driving mechanism for windmill according to a modification example. In the above embodiment, the second teeth 16b of the driving unit 10 are integrally formed with the swinging part body 16a, and the first teeth 7 of the annular track part 2 are rotatably disposed on the annular wall part 3. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 8</figref>, rollers 26 serving as the second teeth may be disposed rotatably with respect to rotating shaft parts 21 fixed on a swinging part body 16c, and first teeth 7a of an annular track part 2a may be provided integrally with an annular wall part 3a (track wall part).</li></ol></p><p id="p0053" num="0053">According to this modification example, during the movement of the swinging part 15a along the circumferential direction of the annular track part 2a, when the rollers 26 of the swinging part 15a push (urge) the first teeth 7a, the rollers 26 are rotated. Thus, it can be restrained that a pushing force (an urging force) of the rollers 26 to the first teeth 7a concentrates on a contact portion between the rollers 26a and the first teeth 7a. Therefore, similarly to the above embodiment, the risk in which the rotation driving mechanism 1 is damaged can be reduced.
<ul><li>(2) <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 9</figref> is a view for explaining a rotation driving mechanism 1a according to a modification example, correspondingly to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>.</li></ul></p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In this modification example, an upper wall surface 4a of an annular wall part 3a is provided as an inclined surface that is recessed from a radially outside toward an inside. First teeth (illustration omitted in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 9</figref>) are radially arranged along the inclined surface. A driving unit 10 is fixed by a support 24 in a diagonal direction with respect to a lower surface of a nacelle 103, such that second teeth of each swinging part 15 of the driving unit 10 are meshed with the first teeth arranged along<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> the inclined surface. Similarly to the above embodiment, such a constitution also reduces the risk in which the rotation driving mechanism for windmill is damaged.
<ul><li>(3) In the above embodiment, the first tooth 7 is formed to have a circular truncated conical shape. However, not limited thereto, the first tooth 7 may be formed to have a columnar shape.</li></ul>
<ul><li>(4) Although the three swinging parts 1 constituting each swinging unit 20 have the same shape in the above embodiment, the present invention is not limited thereto. Specifically, the meshing parts of the swinging parts may have shapes corresponding to (complementary to) shapes of the first teeth 7 having different external diameters in the facewidth direction. Specifically, a pitch of the second teeth of the swinging part disposed radially inside may be smaller than a pitch of the second teeth of the swinging part disposed radially outside. Thus, the second teeth of each swinging part and the first teeth can be more suitably fitted with each other.</li></ul>
<ul><li>(5) Although the weight of the nacelle 103 is borne by the tower 102 through the bearing 106 in this embodiment, the present invention is not limited thereto. Specifically, the weight of the nacelle 103 may be borne by the tower 102 through the swinging parts of the respective swinging units.
