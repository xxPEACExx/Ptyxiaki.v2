The downhole stimulation system 1 comprises a well tubular structure 4 and a first annular barrier 6, 6A and a second annular barrier 6, 6B for isolating a production zone 101, the first annular barrier being arranged closest to a top of the well. Each annular barrier comprises a tubular metal part 7 mounted as part of the well tubular structure and an expandable sleeve 9 surrounding the tubular metal part and having an<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> inner face 10 facing the tubular metal part and an outer face 11 facing the wall of the borehole. Each end 12, 13 of the expandable sleeve is connected with the tubular metal part, defining an annular space 14 between the inner face of the expandable sleeve and the tubular metal part. The annular barrier further comprises an aperture 15 arranged in the tubular metal part for letting fluid into the space.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The downhole stimulation system 1 comprises a pump 16 adapted to provide pressurised fluid down the well tubular structure in order to stimulate the well and may also be used for expanding the expandable sleeves of the annular barriers. The downhole stimulation system 1 further comprises a sliding sleeve 17 having at least one profile 18, and the sliding sleeve is arranged between two annular barriers and has a closed position and an open position. In the open position, the sliding sleeve allows fluid communication between the inside of the well tubular structure and the production zone through an opening 19 in the well tubular structure. The profile of the sliding sleeve is positioned at a first distance X<sub>a</sub> from the aperture of the annular space,</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In addition, the downhole stimulation system 1 comprises a downhole tool 20 for bringing the sliding sleeve from the closed position to the open position. The downhole tool 20 comprises a tool body 21, an inflatable device 22 adapted to be inflated in the well tubular structure to divide an inside 5 of the well tubular structure 4 into a first part 5A and a second part 5B. The tool further comprises at least one key 23 engaging the profile in the sliding sleeve, so that when the inflatable device has been inflated and the first part of the well tubular structure is pressurised, the tool is moved downstream and the keys of the tool drag in the profile, forcing the sliding sleeve from the closed position to the open position. The inflatable device is arranged downstream of the aperture of the second annular barrier, so that the annular space of the second annular barrier is in fluid communication with the first part of the well tubular structure when the inflatable device is inflated. In this way, the pressurised fluid jetted out through the opening in the tubular structure is also able to flow from the inside of the well tubular structure in through the aperture of the second annular barrier and into the annular space to equalise the pressure between the production zone and the annular space of the second annular barrier. When fracturing the formation in order to gain more reservoir contact, pressurised fluid is jetted out through such opening in the well tubular structure. However, such increase in pressure in the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> production zone may compromise the isolation properties of the second annular barrier if the inflatable device is not located downstream of the aperture and thus further away from the top of the well than the aperture.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In order stimulate a well, the sliding sleeve, through which the fracturing is to occur, is detected, and then the keys of the tool are projected to engage the profile of the sliding sleeve. Shortly thereafter or simultaneously, the inflatable device is inflated, and then the inside of the well tubular structure is pressurised, whereby the pressurised fluid in the well tubular structure applies pressure onto the inflatable device, moving the tool away from the top of the well, sliding the sleeve from a closed position to an open position and letting pressurised fluid from the inside of the well tubular structure in through the aperture of the second annular barrier to equalise the pressure between the production zone and the annular space of the second annular barrier. Subsequently, the inflatable device is deflated when a predetermined pressure or sequence of pressures is/are reached.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The profile of the sliding sleeve has circumferential grooves matching the profile of the keys, so that the keys are able to get a firm grip of the sliding sleeve. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the tool has a diameter D<sub>t</sub> of the tool body which is smaller than an inner diameter D<sub>i</sub> of the well tubular structure, defining a fluid passage between the tool and the well tubular structure. The expandable sleeve is a metal sleeve and may be expanded by letting pressurised fluid in through the aperture of the annular barrier.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">A valve 28 may be arranged in the aperture 15 of the annular barrier as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, and the valve may be a one-way valve so that fluid is allowed into the annular space but unable to flow out of the space. When having a valve in the aperture, the expandable sleeve may be expanded by means of a compound which is arranged in the annular space and and is decomposable when subjegted to heat generating gas, which expands the sleeve.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the downhole system further comprises a third annular barrier 6C arranged closer to the top than the first annular barrier and a fourth annular barrier 6D arranged further away from the top than the second annular barrier, the inflatable device being inflated between the second and fourth annular barrier. By having two annular barriers arranged on either side of the production<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> zone, a double barrier is provided, so that if one barrier fails, the other will still provide the seal.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the tool comprises an inflation pump 29 for inflating the inflatable device 22. The tool further comprises a motor 31 for driving the inflation pump 29. The tool of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is wireless and is powered by a power supply 58, such as a rechargeable battery. The keys of the tool are arranged at a second distance X<sub>t</sub> from the inflatable device of the tool and as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> the second distance X<sub>t</sub> is greater than the first distance. The second distance may also be equal to the first distance in another embodiment. The keys are projectable keys 23 forming a piston part 32 which is slidable in a cavity 33 and projected by hydraulic fluid from the pump through channels 34, compressing a spring 43, which ensures that the keys return to their retracted position when no longer required, or if the power is cut off. The keys have a profile 42 matching the profile in the sliding sleeve. The pump further inflates the inflatable device 22 through channels 35. When deflated, the fluid leaves the inflatable device 22 through other channels 36. The tool further comprises a detection unit 37 for detecting the sliding sleeve. The detection unit 37 comprises a tag identification means 38 for detecting the sliding sleeve. The tool further comprises an activation means 39 for activating the inflatable device to both inflate and deflate when e.g. the fracturing operation has ended. The activation means 39 comprise an activation sensor 40 adapted to cause the inflatable device to deflate when a condition in the well changes, such as when a predetermined pressure is reached.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The tool further comprises a detection sensor 27 for detecting a condition of the well and/or the sliding sleeve, so that the operation is terminated if the conditions vary too much from the expected conditions. The tool also comprises a communication unit 47 for loading information from a reservoir sensor if requested.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In order to be able to propel itself up again, the tool comprises a self-propelling means 48, such as a turbine or a propeller. So when descending, a battery in the tool is charged in order to be ready to be used when emerging at the top of the well again. The tool further comprises a fishing neck 49 so that the tool is easily retrievable from the well.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, the sliding sleeve is a self-closing sleeve comprising a spring 51 for closing the sleeve. When the tool moves the sliding sleeve from a closed position to an open position, the spring in a cylinder housing 52 is compressed through the piston 53. The sliding sleeve further comprises an identification tag 54 so that one sliding sleeve is recognisable from another. Thus, the well tubular structure may comprise a plurality of sliding sleeves, each sliding sleeve having an identification tag 54.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Some of the annular barriers may have at least one intermediate sleeve 55 between the expandable sleeve and the tubular part. When having the intermediate sleeve 55, the expandable sleeve comprises an opening for equalising the pressure between the reservoir and the inside of the annular barrier, in that the intermediate sleeve seals between the reservoir and the inside of the well tubular structure.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, the pump pressurising the fluid for e.g. fracturing is submerged into the well tubular structure and powered through a wireline 56 so that only part of the well tubular structure is pressurised. The tool may be wireless as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figs. 1-3</figref> or be powered through a wireline 56 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>, the tool comprises a detection unit 37 for detecting the sliding sleeve and the aperture in order to determine the first distance X<sub>a</sub>. Thus, the detection unit comprises a tag identification means 38 for detecting the profile of the sliding sleeve and the aperture unit of the annular barrier and thus detecting the first distance between the profile and the aperture. The keys of the tool are arranged at a second distance from the inflatable device of the tool, and the second distance is adjustable due to the fact that the tool body comprises a length adjustable section 61 arranged between the key and the inflatable device. The adjustable section 61 is adapted to adjust the second distance in relation to the detected first distance and in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>, the length adjustable section is a telescopic section. If the first distance between the profile of the sliding sleeve and the aperture is known before entering the well, the length of the tool need not to be adjustable and the length adjustable section 61 can be dispensed with. However, if the first distance between the profile of the sliding sleeve and the aperture is not known before entering the well, or if the first distance seems to be different from what appears in the completion diagram, the tool length, and thus the second distance, is adjusted so as to fit the respective sliding sleeve.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> When the stimulation operation through one sliding sleeve has ended, the tool disengages the profile, so that the sliding sleeve moves into the closed position and the tool moves further away from the top of the well. Then a second sliding sleeve is detected, the keys of the tool are projected to engage the profile of the second sliding sleeve, and the inflatable device is inflated. Then the inside of the well tubular structure is pressurised, moving the tool away from the top of the well and sliding the second sliding sleeve from a closed position to an open position and letting pressurised fluid from the inside of the well tubular structure in through the aperture of the adjacent annular barrier, e.g. a fourth annular barrier, equalising the pressure between the production zone and the annular space of the fourth annular barrier.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">By fluid or well fluid is meant any kind of fluid that may be present in oil or gas wells downhole, such as natural gas, oil, oil mud, crude oil, water, etc. By gas is meant any kind of gas composition present in a well, completion, or open hole, and by oil is meant any kind of oil composition, such as crude oil, an oil-containing fluid, etc. Gas, oil, and water fluids may thus all comprise other elements or substances than gas, oil, and/or water, respectively.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">By a casing is meant any kind of pipe, tubing, tubular, liner, string etc. used downhole in relation to oil or natural gas production.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In the event that the tool is not submergible all the way into the casing, a downhole tractor can be used to push the tool all the way into position in the well.
