The nacelle is rotatably disposed on top of a tower, and a generator and so on is disposed in the nacelle. The blades are disposed rotatably with respect to a hub provided on the nacelle. In such a windmill, a rotation driving mechanism configured to rotate the nacelle (rotation-side structure) with respect to the tower (base-side structure) is used.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2013083247A"><text>JP2013-083247A</text></patcit> discloses a rotation driving mechanism including a yaw driving mechanism fixed on a nacelle and a ring gear fixed on a tower, wherein a pinion of the yaw driving mechanism is meshed with the ring gear. In the rotation driving mechanism, when the yaw driving mechanism work, the pinion makes a rotation while being meshed with the ring gear as well as makes a revolution, so that the nacelle (rotation-side structure) is rotated with respect to the tower (base-side structure).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the aforementioned rotation driving mechanism, since the number of teeth of the pinion and the ring gear, which simultaneously contact with each other, is small, a large stress is generated in a drive transmission area between the pinion and the ring gear. This not<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> only reduces a mechanism life of the rotation driving mechanism, but also impairs a drive transmission capacity of the mechanism. On the other hand, in order to elongate the mechanism life and to improve the drive transmission capacity, the rotation driving mechanism has to be enlarged in size.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention has been made for solving the above problem. The object of the present invention is to provide a small-size rotation driving mechanism for windmill having an excellent durability and an excellent drive transmission capacity.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">(1) In order to solve the above problem, the rotation driving mechanism according to one aspect of the present invention is a rotation driving mechanism for windmill for use in a windmill including a base-side structure and a rotation-side structure that is rotatable with respect to the base-side structure, so as to rotate the rotation-side structure with respect to the base-side structure, the rotation driving mechanism for windmill comprising:
<ul><li>an annular track part provided in one structure of the base-side structure and the rotation-side structure, the annular track part having a circumferential wall part, and first teeth that are arranged along a circumferential direction of the circumferential wall part such that a facewidth direction of each first tooth extends along a direction in parallel with a central axis direction of the circumferential wall part;</li><li>a rotation driving part having a rotatable rotating shaft, the rotation driving part being fixed on the other structure of the base-side structure and the rotation-side structure; and</li><li>a swinging unit including swinging parts each having a meshing part to be meshed with a part of the first teeth, and a swinging part body provided with the meshing part, wherein the swinging parts are arranged along the facewidth direction of the first teeth, and the swinging unit is configured to be relatively moved with respect to the ring gear in a circumferential direction of the ring gear,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> when the rotating shaft is rotated so that the swinging parts are swung with maintaining a predetermined phase difference thereamong,</li></ul>
wherein the meshing part includes second teeth to be meshed with the first teeth.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In this constitution, when the annular track part is disposed on the base-side structure, and the rotation driving part and the swinging unit are disposed on the rotation-side structure (i.e., when the base-side structure is the one structure, and the rotation-side structure is the other structure), the rotation driving mechanism for windmill is operated as follows. Specifically, the swinging parts are swung with maintaining a predetermined phase difference thereamong, while the second teeth in each swinging part are meshed with a part of the first teeth, so that the swinging parts are moved along a circumferential direction of the annular track part disposed on the base-side structure. Thus, the rotation-side structure, which is a structure on which the swinging parts are fixed, is rotated with respect to the base-side structure.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">On the other hand, when the annular track part is disposed on the rotation-side structure and the rotation driving part, and the swinging parts are disposed on the base-side structure (i.e., when the rotation-side structure is the one structure, and the base-side structure is the other structure), the rotation driving mechanism for windmill is operated as follows. Specifically, when the rotating shaft of the rotation driving part is rotated so that the swinging parts are swung with maintaining a predetermined phase difference thereamong, the annular track part disposed on the rotation-side structure is rotated. Thus, the rotation-side structure is rotated with respect to the base-side structure.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Both in the aforementioned constitutions, the rotation-side structure is rotated with respect to the base-side structure, while the first teeth and the second teeth are meshed with each other. Namely, in this constitution, during the rotation of the rotation-side<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> structure, the number of meshed teeth between the swinging unit and the annular track part can be increased. Thus, since a stress acting on a contact portion between the first teeth and the second teeth can be reduced, the risk in which the rotation driving mechanism is damaged can be reduced, and a mechanism strength can be enhanced. In addition, according to this constitution, since the number of meshed teeth can be increased, it is not necessary to enlarge the mechanism in size in order to elongate a mechanism life expectancy.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Therefore, according to this constitution, a small-size rotation driving mechanism for windmill having an excellent durability and an excellent drive transmission capacity can be provided.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">(2) Preferably, the first teeth are rotatably held with respect to the circumferential wall part, or the second teeth are rotatably held with respect to the swinging part body.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to this constitution, under conditions in which the first teeth and the second teeth are meshed with each other, when a force of the first teeth acts on the second teeth or when a force of the second teeth acts on the first teeth, the teeth that are rotatably held are rotated. Namely, according to this constitution, since a frictional force can be reduced by the slidable contact between the first teeth and the second teeth, a stress acting on a contact portion between the first teeth and the second teeth can be further reduced. Thus, the durability and the drive transmission capacity of the rotation driving mechanism can be further improved.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">(3) More preferably, the annular track part has an inner circumferential wall serving as the circumferential wall part. According to this constitution, the swinging parts can be swung along the inner circumferential wall.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">(4) Preferably, the annular track part has an outer circumferential wall serving as the circumferential wall part. According to this<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> constitution, the swinging parts can be swung along the outer circumferential wall.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">(5) Preferably, the circumferential wall part is provided with grooves arranged along the circumferential direction of the circumferential wall part such that a longitudinal direction of each groove extends along the direction in parallel with the central axis direction of the circumferential wall part, each groove having a bottom part whose sectional shape in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction is circular arc shape; and<br/>
each of the first teeth is accommodated in one groove of the grooves such that the facewidth direction of the first tooth extends along the longitudinal direction of the groove, each of the first teeth being pin member that is rotatable while sliding with respect to the one groove.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to this constitution, the first teeth can be easily made rotatable with respect to the circumferential wall part, with a simple constitution.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">(6) Preferably, the second tooth is a roller that is rotatable about a shaft part attached to the swinging part body such that an axial direction thereof extends along the facewidth direction.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to this constitution, the second teeth can be easily made to be rotatable with respect to the swinging part body, with a simple constitution.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">(7) Preferably, the rotation driving mechanism for windmill further comprises:
<ul><li>a plurality of the swinging units; and</li><li>a plurality of the rotation driving parts that are correspondingly provided on the respective swinging units, so as to swing the swinging parts of the respective swinging units.</li></ul></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to this constitution, since the rotation-side<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> structure can be rotated by a plurality of the swinging units, a load that acts during a rotation of the rotation-side structure can be dispersed to the plurality of swinging units. Thus, the risk in which the swinging units are damaged can be reduced.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">(8) Preferably, the rotation driving mechanism for windmill is used in a tower as the base-side structure, and a nacelle as the rotation-side structure.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to this constitution, the rotation driving mechanism for windmill can be used as a yaw driving apparatus for rotating the nacelle with respect to the tower.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to the present invention, a small-size rotation driving mechanism for windmill having an excellent durability and an excellent drive transmission capacity can be provided.</p><heading id="h0005"><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p id="p0024" num="0024"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a perspective view showing a windmill to which a driving apparatus for windmill according to this embodiment of the present invention can be applied.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a sectional view showing in enlargement a movable part where a nacelle is disposed rotatably with respect to a tower, showing an arrangement state of a rotation driving mechanism for windmill in the movable part.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a sectional view taken along a line III-III in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4A</figref> is a view seen from an arrow IVA in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4B</figref> is a sectional view taken along a IVB-IVB line in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4A</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> is a perspective view schematically showing a constitution of a driving unit.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> is a view seen from a direction of an arrow VI in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, showing only a rotating shaft and a first eccentric part.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7</figref> is a plan view schematically showing a shape of a swinging part.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 8</figref> is a view for explaining the rotation driving mechanism for windmill according to a modification example, correspondingly to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 9</figref> is a sectional view of <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 8</figref> taken along a IX-IX line, correspondingly to <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 10</figref> is a view schematically showing a driving unit (excluding an electric motor) of the rotation driving mechanism for windmill according to a modification example.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 11</figref> is a view schematically showing a driving unit (excluding an electric motor) of the rotation driving mechanism for windmill according to a modification example.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 12</figref> is a view schematically showing a rotation driving mechanism for windmill according to a modification example, wherein the rotation driving mechanism for windmill is applied to a hub as a base-side structure and a blade as a rotation-side structure.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0006"><u>EMBODIMENT FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0025" num="0025">An embodiment for carrying out the present invention will be described herebelow, with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a perspective view showing a windmill 101 to which a rotation driving mechanism for windmill 1 according to the embodiment of the present invention is applied.

In the rotation driving mechanism for windmill 1, when the nacelle 103 is turned in one circumferential direction (direction shown by arrow A), the rotating shaft 13 of the electric motor 11 of each driving unit 10 is rotated (normally rotated) in one direction (direction shown by arrow B). Then, the three first eccentric parts 14 integrally provided on the rotating shaft 13 are rotated, with maintaining the phase difference of 120 degrees thereamong. At this time, the three second eccentric prats 19 are rotated, with maintaining the phase difference of 120 degrees thereamong. The rotation of second eccentric parts 19 is in synchronization with the rotation of first eccentric parts 14. As a result, the three swinging parts 15 are swung. In other words, the three swinging parts 15 translate along a circumferential path about the central axis of the rotating shaft 13. The plurality of second teeth 16b of at least one swinging part 15 (swinging part 15A in the state shown <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>) of the three swinging parts 15, which are swung by the respective first eccentric parts 14, are meshed with the plurality of first teeth 7 in the ring gear 2. Thus, when the electric motor 11 is normally rotated,<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> the second teeth 16b of any one of swinging parts 15 (swinging part 15A in the state shown <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>) of each driving unit 10 push (urge) the first teeth 7 to move in a direction shown by an arrow C in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>. Thus, the driving unit 10 and the nacelle 103, on which the driving unit 10 is fixed, slightly move in the direction shown by the arrow A.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">When the swinging part 15A moves in the direction shown by the arrow C, the swinging part 15A moves away from the ring gear 2. However, at this time, the second teeth 16b of the succeeding swinging part 15B are meshed with the first teeth 7 of the ring gear 2. Then, similar to the swinging part 15A, the swinging part 15B moves in the direction shown by the arrow C. Thus, the driving unit 10 and the nacelle 103 slightly move in the direction shown by the arrow A. When the swinging part 15B moves away from the ring gear 2, the succeeding swinging part 15C is meshed with the first teeth 7 of the ring gear 2. Thus, by performing an operation similar to the above, the driving unit 10 and the nacelle 103 further move in the direction shown by the arrow A. When the swinging part 15C moves away from the ring gear 2, the swinging part 15A is again meshed with the ring gear 2.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In this manner, in the driving unit 10, the three swinging parts 15 repeatedly perform the above-described operations in turn. Thus, the driving unit 10 moves along the one circumferential direction of the ring gear 2 (the direction shown by the arrow A). As a result, the nacelle 103 on which the driving units 10 are fixed is rotated with respect to the tower 102 in which the ring gear 2 is formed.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">As described above, when the second teeth 16b push (urge) the first teeth 7, the first teeth 7 pushed (urged) by the second teeth 16b are rotated with respect to the grooves 5 in which the first teeth 7 are accommodated.

Namely, in the rotation driving mechanism for windmill 1 according to this embodiment, upon rotation of the nacelle 103, the number of meshed teeth between the swinging unit 20 and the ring gear 2 can be increased. Thus, since a stress acting on a contact portion between the first teeth 7 and the second teeth 16b can be reduced, the risk in which the rotation driving mechanism 1 is damaged can be reduced, and a mechanism strength can be enhanced. In addition, according to this constitution, since the number of meshed teeth can be increased, it is not necessary to enlarge the mechanism in size in order to elongate a mechanism life expectancy and to improve a drive transmission capacity.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">As a result, according to this embodiment, a small-size rotation driving mechanism for windmill 1 having an excellent durability and an excellent drive transmission capacity can be provided.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In addition, in the rotation driving mechanism for windmill 1, since the first teeth 7 are rotatably held by the inner circumferential wall 4, a frictional force can be reduced by the slidable contact between the first teeth 7 and the second teeth 16b.

A heat treatment of a large component is expensive, and plants capable of performing such a heat treatment are few.
