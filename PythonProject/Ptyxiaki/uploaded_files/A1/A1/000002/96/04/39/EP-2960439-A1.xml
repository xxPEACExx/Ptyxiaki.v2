But it is also possible that these components<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> border the respective areas. So, they are just partly located in the respective areas. A pressure of the different pressure areas can be about 20 bar. A pressure difference between the different pressure areas can be quite low, for instance just 1 bar for a first stage of a multi-stage turbomachine. In addition, there could be a secondary cooling system with resulting in an secondary pressure difference.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Preferably the stator component is a stator ring. The stator ring surrounds the rotatable rotor component. The sealing ring is located between the stator ring and the rotatable rotor component.

A temperature of the hot gas reaches temperatures of more than 1000 °C.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The high pressure area of the turbomachine comprises preferably at least one cooling channel with coolant fluid.

By this solution stator ring, guide vanes and the sealing ring form a unity. Preferably, the sealing ring is fixed to the stator ring with the aid of a fastening element. The fastening element can be formed by a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> weld. In a preferred embodiment, the fastening element is a screw. With the aid of the screw the stator ring and the sealing ring form a screwed construction. Stator ring and sealing ring are a screwed together such that stator ring and guide vanes are located at least partly in the high pressure area.
