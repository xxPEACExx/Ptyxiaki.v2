The mechanical combination locks are divided into ordinary mechanical combination locks and high-security mechanical combination locks, the ordinary mechanical combination locks have a small amount of keys and poor security, while the high-security mechanical combination locks have a large amount of keys and good security, but have tedious operations, cumbersome password inputting and password modification, and poor user experience. Electronic locks have a large amount of keys, password inputting and password modification are convenient in use, user experience is good, but the electronic locks have lots of electronic devices, the structure thereof is complex, and the probability of failure is high. Moreover, the electronic devices are unable to endure moisture, strong magnetoelectricity and strong vibration, so that the electronic devices have certain requirements for use environments, and the high failure rate is one respect of poor usability. However, mechanical locks can avoid these weaknesses by taking some measures. If the electronic locks fail, great inconvenience will be brought about to users, and it is not easy to repair them, which lets people feel quite helpless. Therefore, reserve mechanical unlocking means or mechanical backup unlocking has been added to many electronic locks, thereby solving the problems caused by the electronic locks.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, the current lock mostly uses a structure of an electronic lock and a mechanical lock, where respective corresponding input units are installed.
