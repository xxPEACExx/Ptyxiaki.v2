For this reason, attachment/detachment work of the knock sensor becomes complicated, and not only that, problems peculiar to the unit swing engine arise such as increase in the height of a riding seat disposed above the intake pipe in the case where the intake pipe is disposed at a higher position to prevent the knock sensor protruding upward from the cylinder block from interfering with the intake pipe.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention has been made in view of such circumstances, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a knock sensor mounting structure in a unit swing engine which enables attachment/detachment work of a knock sensor to be facilitated and an intake pipe to be disposed at a low position even in the case where the knock sensor is mounted on an upper wall of a cylinder block.</p><heading id="h0007">[Means for Solving the Problem]</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to achieve the above object, a first aspect of the present invention

wall of the cylinder block on the other side thereof in the vehicle widthwise direction.</p><heading id="h0008">[Effect of the Invention]</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to the first aspect of the present invention, the mounting boss is disposed on the upper wall of the cylinder block at a position not overlapping with the intake pipe as seen in the direction along the screw axis of the screw member for fastening the knock sensor to the mounting boss. Accordingly, the intake pipe is less likely to get in the way at the time of attachment/detachment work of the knock sensor to/from the mounting boss, whereby attachment/detachment work of the knock sensor can be facilitated and workability can be improved.

Thereby, the knock sensor 52 can be protected from bottom even in the structure where the part 52a of the knock sensor 52 projects outward from the cylinder block 26 in the vehicle widthwise direction.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Further, the mounting boss 51 is formed on the cylinder block 26 so that the screw axis SC of the sensor mounting bolt 53 is located outward in the vehicle widthwise direction with respect to the cylinder bore 30 of the cylinder block 26 as seen in the direction along the screw axis SC of the sensor mounting bolt 53. Hence, it is possible to suppress the influence of vibration noise, associated with the sliding movement of the piston 29 in the cylinder bore 30, on the knock sensor 52 and thereby further improve knocking detection accuracy.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Furthermore, the mounting boss 51 is formed on the cylinder block 26 so that the screw axis SC of the sensor mounting bolt 53 is located closer to the cylinder head 27 side than is the central portion in the front-rear direction of the mating surfaces 61 and 62 configured respectively between the cylinder block 26 and the crankcase 25 and between the cylinder block and the cylinder head 27. Thus, the knock sensor 52 is arranged near the combustion chamber 31, whereby knocking detection accuracy can be further improved.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">In addition, the mounting boss 51 is formed on the cylinder block 26 so that, as seen<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> in the direction along the screw axis SC of the sensor mounting bolt 53, the screw axis SC is located ahead of the connecting surface 63 which is formed in the upstream end portion of the intake pipe 35 to connect the throttle body 36 thereto. Thereby, the knock sensor 52 is arranged at a position away from the throttle body 36, whereby attachment/detachment workability of the knock sensor 52 can be further improved.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Moreover, the threaded hole 76 provided in the mounting boss 51 to screw the sensor mounting bolt 53 therein is disposed at such a position as to avoid overlapping with the water jacket 32 formed in the cylinder block 26 as seen in the direction along the screw axis SC of the sensor mounting bolt 53. Hence, the interference of the knock sensor 52 and the water jacket 32 with each other is avoided when the knock sensor 52 is mounted to the cylinder block 26, whereby sufficient cooling performance of the water jacket 32 can be secured. Besides, a relief structure for the threaded hole 76 does not need to be formed on the water jacket 32 side, which can simplify the structure of the water jacket 32.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Further, the threaded hole 76 provided in the mounting boss 51 to screw the sensor mounting bolt 53 therein is disposed at such a position as to avoid overlapping with the water jacket 32 formed in the cylinder block 26 as seen in the direction along the cylinder axis C.
