The existing locking mechanism mostly uses a swinging or moving lock block (or lock latch) to achieve jamming of the locking tab. Affected by factors such as the size and strength of the lock block (or lock latch) per se, supporting and moving of the lock block (or lock latch) and the size of the area for jamming of the locking tab, the locking mechanism often has a problem of insufficient locking strength, and exerting a force with slightly greater strength on the locking tab can cause failure of the locking mechanism (such as breakage of the locking mechanism); the locking mechanism is easily unlocked in an impacting manner, when an external impact force is exerted in a direction of a linear motion trajectory of a key-drawn locking mechanism, the key-drawn locking mechanism may produce instant movement, to move out of the motion trajectory of the locking tab, causing instant unlocking.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">With respect to the shortcomings of the prior art, the present invention provides a high-strength and anti-shock lock and a rotating bolt.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">To achieve the above objective, the present invention adopts the following<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> technical solution: a rotating bolt is provided, configured to lock a rotating tab of a lock, including a bolt body, wherein the bolt body is a column with a recess disposed on a side portion, and the bolt body is rotatable about a central axis thereof; during locking, a physical portion at the recess of the bolt body of the rotating bolt is rotated into a movement channel of the rotating tab; during unlocking, the physical portion at the recess of the bolt body of the rotating bolt is rotated out of the movement channel of the rotating tab.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Preferably, a cross section at a non-recess of the rotating bolt is circular or rectangular.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Preferably, a cross section at the recess of a side portion of the bolt body is semicircular or rectangular.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Preferably, the rotating bolt is driven by an electronic drive mechanism.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Preferably, the rotating bolt is driven by a mechanical drive mechanism.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Preferably, the rotating bolt can be separately driven by an electronic drive mechanism or a mechanical drive mechanism, respectively.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention further discloses a rotating bolt configured to lock a rotating tab of a lock, including a bolt body, wherein the bolt body is a column with a recess disposed on a side portion, the bolt body is rotatable about a central axis thereof, and the recess of the bolt body can be rotated into and rotated out of a rotation trajectory of the rotating tab.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention further discloses a lock, including a lock housing, a rotating tab, a transmission portion and a driving portion, wherein the rotating tab is rotatably disposed in the lock housing, the lock further includes the rotating bolt described above, and the driving portion drives the rotating bolt through the transmission portion.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Preferably, the transmission portion is a transmission gear.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Preferably, the driving portion is an electronic drive mechanism and/or a mechanical drive mechanism.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention has the following beneficial effects:

A support of the bolt body is in a form of a circular hole, which is easy to process, and it is easy to control accuracy thereof. Unlocking and locking state transition is carried out through rotation of the rotating bolt, the rotation manner of the rotating bolt is the same as the movement manner of the motor, and thus it is unnecessary to convert rotation of the motor to translational motion. In this way, mechanical transmission is relatively simple, and mechanical resistance of the rotation is less than that of the translational motion of the lock block and the movement is stable.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a schematic view of a rotating bolt according to a first embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> is a schematic structural view of a lock according to the first embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> is a schematic view of an unlocking state of the lock according to the first embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> is a schematic view of a locking state of the lock according to the first embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref> is a schematic structural view of a lock according to a second embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref> is a schematic structural view of an unlocking state of the lock according to the second embodiment of the present invention; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref> is a schematic structural view of a locking state of the lock according to the second embodiment of the present invention.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0005"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">To make the objective and the technical solution of embodiments of the present invention much clearer, the technical solution of the embodiments of the present invention will be clearly and fully described below with reference to the accompanying drawings of the embodiments of the present invention.
