Generally, the above-mentioned electric motor is hermetically isolated from the outside and housed in a protective and structural shell and protrudes on the outside, by a sealed joint or a sealing gasket, only by the portion relative to the hub to couple with the wheels for the movement of the robot and/or with a tool of the robot. In other words, the known self-propelled<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> robot has at least one mechanical power transmission which puts the inner part (a motor element) of the protective shell in contact with an external part (driven element) of the protective shell.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is known that the sealed joint and/or the sealing gasket are elements of the robot that are subject to wear over time, both due to corrosion due to humidity/water and due to the depositing of any debris at the mechanical power transmission, for example between the shaft of an electric motor and a respective hermetic seal of the transmission, thus often compromising the overall hermetic seal of the robot.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Restoring the seals and replacing the worn elements requires complex maintenance that also involves manual intervention by a skilled technician. Moreover, even the smallest water infiltration inside the protective shell of a self-propelled robot may adversely affect the electronic circuits and the connections of the electrical cables contained inside, thus compromising its operation.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It should also be noted that following maintenance of the robot where it was necessary to open the protective shell even partly, the impermeable seals must be restored again by applying sealing mastics on the edges and stops of the shell, which requires skilled labour by a technician and hardening and curing times involving increased maintenance costs.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">One aim of this invention is to provide a robot for the treatment of a surface which allows easy routine cleaning and washing maintenance in water by a user after use by means of a protective casing which is hermetically sealed from the outside and does not comprise even sealed connections between the inside and the outside of the shell.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A further aim of this invention is to provide a robot for the treatment of a surface which is free from the wear of the sealed joints at a mechanical power transmission which is designed to activate an element (a wheel or a tool) that is completely immersed in water, therefore is located outside the protective casing of the self-propelled robot, without resorting to sealed joints or to other types of impermeable seals subject to deterioration, aging<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> and wear.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">A further aim of this invention is to provide a structurally simpler self-propelled robot where the movable parts subject to wear such as the wheels or movement tracks or the impeller of an extractor of debris or a cutting blade can be replaced in a rapid and practical manner.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Further features and advantages of the invention are more apparent in the non-limiting description which follows of a self-propelled robot illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which:

More specifically, the protective guard 2 is made,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> at least partly, of an electrically insulating material, such as, for example, plastic.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The self-propelled robot 1 comprises at least one tool 3 for the treatment of a surface such as for example a floor, a garden lawn or the tiles of a swimming pool or tank or other similar surfaces which require a specific treatment.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Thus, the tool 3 of the self-propelled robot 1 is structured in a different way in accordance with the type of surface to be treated, and may comprise, by way of example, a rotary brush for collecting debris and dust, a rotary blade for cutting the grass of the garden lawn or a system with fixed brushes for removing debris and dirt from a surface, respectively. It should be noted that not all the above-mentioned embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Preferably, the tool 3 also comprises a suction system which is operatively associated with the above-mentioned rotary brush, blade or fixed brush to collect debris, dust, grass and dirt and to send them to an accumulation zone.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The self-propelled robot 1 also comprises movement means 4 comprising at least four wheels 4a, at least two of which wheels are motor-driven 4a (one for each side of the robot 1), to allow the movement of the self-propelled robot 1 on a predetermined travel path.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In accordance with the inventive concept of this invention, a preferred, but not exclusive and limiting, embodiment is described below of the self-propelled robot 1 according to the invention for the treatment of surfaces of a swimming pool or tank.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Preferably, the tool 3 of the self-propelled robot 1 comprises at least one extractor 3a for the treatment of a surface of the swimming pool or tank. The extractor 3a is designed to interact with a surface of the swimming pool or tank, by an impeller 3b designed to create suction from the surface towards a tank for collecting debris and dirt.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The self-propelled robot 1 comprises two extractors 3a positioned along a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> longitudinal plane "P" of the robot 1, where the impellers 3b of the two extractors 3a are of the axial type, as illustrated schematically in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>. The actuation of the impellers 3b of the extractors 3a is determined by a respective electric motor 3c for each impeller 3b. The extractors 3a are operatively associated with a plurality of brushes 3d positioned on the lower part of the self-propelled robot 1 in such a way as to collect the debris and dirt and to convey them to a treatment and accumulation zone (not shown in the accompanying drawings) positioned along the conduit of the respective extractors 3a.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The water, which is purified and filtered by removing the debris and dirt, is collected and reintroduced into the swimming pool through openings 3e positioned on the upper part of the self-propelled robot 1, at which the impellers 3b are also preferably located.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention, the movement means 4 of the self-propelled robot 1 comprise the wheels 4a coupled with a track 4b for each side of the self-propelled robot 1.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The tracks 4b are preferably provided with an abrasive surface or such as to generate a high friction coefficient between them and a surface of a swimming pool.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Preferably, in reference now to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, the movement means 4 comprise, for each motor-driven wheel 4a, a respective electric motor 4c powered by an internal battery (not shown in the accompanying drawings). The wheels 4a of the self-propelled robot 1 rotate relative to an axis of rotation "X," the axis of rotation "X" is also preferably the axis of rotation of the respective electric motor 4c of each motor-driven wheel 4a. Preferably, the self-propelled robot 1 has the protective guard 2 with substantially symmetrical spaces relative to a transversal plane "T," positioned perpendicularly to the longitudinal plane "P". In other words, the self-propelled robot 1 has the same shape for both sides facing in both directions of travel, except for minor differences not illustrated in detail in the accompanying drawings. This general symmetry of the self-propelled<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> robot 1 gives it increased properties of ease of handling, especially during the disengaging manoeuvres, and the same stability and capacity of movement in both directions of travel (as illustrated in detail in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>) with the same effectiveness.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The self-propelled robot 1 comprises at least one mechanical power transmission 5 designed to actuate the robot 1 in an operating configuration of use of it.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">For greater detail, a mechanical power transmission is defined as a connection designed to transmit a mechanical torque, and therefore power, from a motor element to a driven element. By way of example, a mechanical power transmission may be identified as a connection between a shaft of an electric motor (driving element) and a hub, keyed on the shaft, of a wheel (driven element) of a self-propelled robot. Similarly, a mechanical power transmission<br/>
may be identified between a shaft of an electric motor and the hub of an impeller of an extractor of a robot for the treatment of surfaces of a swimming pool, such as the self-propelled robot 1.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In accordance with the inventive concept of this invention, the self-propelled robot 1 comprises at least one mechanical power transmission 5 comprising at least one motor element and at least one driven element which are operatively associated by a magnetic and/or electromagnetic field.

Preferably, each plurality of magnetic material plates 7b and ferromagnetic material plates 8a of the energising drum 7 and of the driven crown 8, respectively, are numerically equal to each other.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In accordance with the inventive concept of this invention, relative to a reference point not illustrated in the accompanying drawings, the magnetic material plates 7b may have a succession of magnetic poles (generally identified as "N" for the negative pole and "P" for the positive pole) with a sequence N-P-N or with a sequence P-N-P.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Similarly, the respective ferromagnetic material plates 8a can be positioned in the same way and undergo induction from a different magnetic field depending on the type of positioning sequence of the magnetic material plates 7b. These positions do not influence the final result in terms of drive torque transmitted through the mechanical power transmission 5, however the numerical quantity of the plates 7b, 8a can determine a variation of the overall mechanical power transmitted to the movable parts, such as for example, the motor-driven wheels 4a. Preferably, the electric motor 3c, 4c may be of the traditional type or of the "brushless" type, for improved control of the operation of the self-propelled<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> robot 1, especially during disengaging manoeuvres.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In accordance with the inventive concept of this invention, in a different embodiment of the self-propelled robot 1 not illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in addition to being associated with at least two motor-driven wheels 4a of the movement means 4, the mechanical power transmission 5 is also operatively associated with the two extractors 3a of the tool 3 of the robot 1. In other words, the self-propelled robot 1 comprises both the movement means 4 and the tool 3, which are operatively associated with a mechanical power transmission 5. Advantageously, the driven element of the mechanical power transmission 5 comprises an impeller 3b of each extractor 3a of the tool 3, the impellers 3b are rotatable about a respective axis "Y". Therefore, a respective electric motor 3b is associated with the motor element of the mechanical power transmission 5 of the tool 3, the axis of rotation of the shaft 6 of the electric motor 3c preferably coincides with the axis of rotation "Y" of the impellers 3b.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Advantageously, each impeller 3b of the self-propelled robot 1 comprises a respective driven crown 8, which is fixed to the body of the impeller 3b to form a rigid piece without movements and rotations between them.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In an operating configuration of use of the self-propelled robot 1, the rotation of each energising drum 7, which is driven in rotation about the axis of rotation "Y" by the respective electric motor 3c, generates a magnetic field such as to induce the driven crown 8 into rotation about the axis of rotation "Y", thus putting in rotation the respective impeller 3b and allowing at least the cleaning of the surface of the swimming pool.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Vice versa, in a configuration of the self-propelled robot 1 having the non-operational tool 3, the energising drum 7 is stopped and therefore the magnetic field which interacts between the energising drum 7 and the respective driven crown 8 associated with it is zero or so weak that the respective impeller 3b connected to the driven crown 8 does not receive any drive torque such as to put the water into movement and create a<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> suction from the surface of the swimming pool.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In this configuration of the self-propelled robot 1, the impellers 3b are free to rotate about their own axis of rotation "Y" without any mechanical constraint of rotation.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The impellers 3b of the two extractors 3a and the respective driven crowns 8 (not illustrated in the accompanying drawings) are fixed on a respective connecting portion of the protective guard 2 and are completely positioned outside 100 the protective guard 2, therefore without having any contact with the inner compartment 2a in which the respective electric motors 3c are positioned.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">To avoid the direct contact with the water, the ferromagnetic material plates 8a of the driven crown 8, which is fixed on the hubs 4d of the wheels 4a and/or on the impellers 3b of the extractor 3a, may be covered by a thin layer of plastic material.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In a further embodiment of this invention, not illustrated in the accompanying drawings, a mechanical reduction gear unit is also interposed at a mechanical power transmission in such a way as to reduce the number of revolutions of the driven ring associated with the hub of the motor-driven wheel relative to the number of revolutions made by the energising drum and therefore by the electric motor associated with it. The aim of this invention has been reached by a self-propelled robot for the treatment of a surface such as a floor, a garden lawn or the tiles of a swimming pool or tank or other similar surfaces, like the one described above.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Advantageously, the self-propelled robot makes it possible to perform complete routine washing maintenance after its use without any risk of affecting electrical and/or mechanical components of the robot. In other words, the self-propelled robot may be completely immersed in water or subjected to a jet of high-pressure water for cleaning the tool (blade, brush or similar tool).</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Advantageously, the robot described allows performing extraordinary<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> maintenance quickly and economically by eliminating the need to replace gaskets and sealed joints due to wear since there are no movable sliding elements and/or elements in contact with a respective hermetic seal.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Another advantage of the robot is the one of allowing the replacement of the components most subject to wear, such as for example, the wheels and/or the tracks or the impellers of the tool, in a simple and rapid manner and without having to resort to opening the protective guard of the robot. Moreover, the self-propelled robot comprising the mechanical power transmission made as in this invention is advantageously free of any type of mechanical wear because there isn't any physical contact between a motor element and a driven element in an operating configuration of use thereof.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90459786" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A self-propelled robot (1) for the treatment of a surface, comprising:
