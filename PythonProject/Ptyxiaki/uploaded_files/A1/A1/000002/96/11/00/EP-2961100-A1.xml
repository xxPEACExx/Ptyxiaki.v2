In a packet-based network, the computing devices communicate data by dividing the data into small blocks called packets, which are individually routed across the network from a source device to a destination device. The destination device extracts the data from the packets and assembles the data into its original form. Dividing the data into packets enables the source device to resend only those individual packets that may be lost during transmission.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Certain devices, referred to as routers, maintain routing information that describes routes through the network. A "route" can generally be defined as a path between two locations on the network. Routers include a control plane, sometimes called a management plane, which maintains the routing information, and a forwarding plane, which forwards received packets according to the routing information.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Network service providers provide services such as security, tunneling, virtual private networks, filtering, load-balancing, VoIP/Multimedia processing and various types of application proxies (HTTP, XML, WAP, etc.) to incoming packets. Service providers also provide content-specific services designed to improve the quality of a user's experience, for example, video streaming and caching. To provide these new services, service providers have often turned to specialized, dedicated appliances. In some cases, routers have been modified to include additional hardware or software that applies various services to the incoming packets. For example, line cards installed in a service plane of a router may be configured to perform particular services, such as the services described above.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Deploying services and responding to network events that impact such services may be expensive and time consuming. For instance, manual provisioning of services may require substantial time and human resources to determine whether network resources are available. In the event of a network event, such as a link or device failure, services may need to be manually re-provisioned by determining whether an alternative set of network resources are available. As such, manual provisioning of services may result in higher operational costs because existing techniques often require time-consuming evaluation of multiple resources and the respective capabilities of such resources.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The invention is defined in the appended claims. In general, techniques are described for representing services, network resources, and relationships between such services and resources in a graph database with which to validate, provision, and manage the services in near real-time. Vertexes of the graph database represent services abstractions and network resources, and edges of the graph database represent relationships between the service abstractions and the resources or between the network resources and other network resources. The graph database representation and mapping techniques described herein may be usable by a software-defined networking (SDN) controller to validate and provision requests for networks services more efficiently than other conventional data modeling techniques, as well as to store a near real-time representation of the network topology and service<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> provided in the network. As such, modeling network resources in a graph database enables the SDN controller to fulfill requests for network resources more efficiently than manually validating and provisioning such services.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Techniques of the disclosure leverage the performance of the graph database to improve the fulfillment of requests for services by providing an interface at the SDN controller to receive standard, data-interchange formatted messages that indicate requests for services. In some examples, the interface provides customers that use the network with the flexibility to request and configure services in a cost-and time-effective manner. For instance, in response to receiving a data-interchange formatted message with a request to configure a service, the SDN controller may query the graph database to determine whether a set of network resources is available to fulfill the request. By modeling the network resources and their corresponding relationships in a graph database and providing an interface to receive data-interchange formatted messages that specify requests for network resources, techniques of the disclosure may reduce the amount of manual validation and configuration to fulfill a request for services, thereby reducing the amount of time and effort required to provision services. Furthermore, techniques of the disclosure may update the graph database in real-time in response to network events, such as link and device failures. In response to a network event, the SDN controller may query the graph database to automatically re-provision existing services to use different network resources. As such, techniques of the disclosure may reduce the amount of failover time and manual effort to re-provision services in the event of a failure.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In some examples, a method includes storing a graph database comprising a plurality of vertexes, each respective vertex representing a respective network resource of a plurality of network resources, and the graph database comprising a plurality of edges between a set of the plurality of vertexes, each respective edge indicating a relationship between at least two respective network resources of the plurality of network resources; receiving, at an application programming interface of a software defined network (SDN) controller, a data-interchange formatted message that indicates a service request to configure a network service within a network; querying, at least a portion of the plurality of vertexes and plurality of edges of the graph database based at least in part on the service request, to determine whether a set of the plurality of network resources can satisfy the service request to provision the network service within the network; and responsive to determining that the set of the plurality of network resources can satisfy the service request, configuring, by the SDN controller, the set of the plurality of network resources to provide the network service within the network.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In some examples, a non-transitory computer-readable medium includes instructions that cause at least one processor of a controller device to: store a graph database comprising a plurality of vertexes, each respective vertex representing a respective network resource of a plurality of network resources, and the graph database comprising a plurality of edges between a set of the plurality of vertexes, each respective edge indicating a relationship between at least two respective network resources of the plurality of network resources; receive, at an application programming interface of the controller device, a data-interchange formatted message that indicates a service request to configure a network service within a network; query, at least a portion of the plurality of vertexes and plurality of edges of the graph database based at least in part on the service request, to determine whether a set of the plurality of network resources can satisfy the service request to provision the network service within the network; and<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> responsive to determining that the set of the plurality of network resources can satisfy the service request, configure the set of the plurality of network resources to provide the network service within the network.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In some examples, a controller device includes: at least one processor; at least one memory to store a graph database comprising a plurality of vertexes, each respective vertex representing a respective network resource of a plurality of network resources, and the graph database comprising a plurality of edges between a set of the plurality of vertexes, each respective edge indicating a relationship between at least two respective network resources of the plurality of network resources; a service provisioning module that receives, at an application programming interface of the controller device, a data-interchange formatted message that indicates a service request to configure a network service within a network, wherein the service provisioning module queries, at least a portion of the plurality of vertexes and plurality of edges of the graph database based at least in part on the service request, to determine whether a set of the plurality of network resources can satisfy the service request to provision the network service within the network; and a path provisioning module that, responsive to determining that the set of the plurality of network resources can satisfy the service request, configures the set of the plurality of network resources to provide the network service within the network.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The details of one or more embodiments of this disclosure are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.

Access network 6 includes network nodes that execute communication protocols to transport control and user data to facilitate communication between subscriber devices 16 and gateway 8. Access network 6 may include a broadband access network, network, a wireless LAN, a public switched telephone network (PSTN), or other type of access network, and may include or otherwise provide connectivity for cellular access networks, such as radio access network (RAN) 4 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.

Core network 7 may represent a public network that is owned and operated by a service provider to interconnect a plurality of networks, which may include access network 6. Core network 7 may implement Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) forwarding and in such instances may be referred to as an MPLS network or MPLS backbone. In some instances, core network 7 represents a plurality of interconnected autonomous systems, such as the Internet, that offers services from one or more service providers. PDN 12 may represent an edge network coupled to core network 7, e.g., by a customer edge device such as customer edge switch or router. PDN 12 may include a data center.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In examples of network 2 that include a wireline/broadband access network, gateway 8 may represent a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG), a Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS), MPLS Provider Edge (PE) router, core router or gateway, or a Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS), for instance. In examples of network 2 that include a cellular access network as access network 6, gateway 8 may represent a mobile gateway, for example, a Gateway General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Serving Node (GGSN), an Access Gateway (aGW), or a Packet Data Network (PDN) Gateway (PGW). In other examples, the functionality described with respect to gateway 8 may be implemented in a switch, service card or other network element or component.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A network service provider that administers at least parts of network 2 typically offers services to subscribers associated with devices, e.g., subscriber devices 16, that access the service provider network. Services offered may include, for example, traditional Internet access, Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP), video and multimedia services, and security services. As described above with respect to access network 6, core network 7 may support multiple types of access network infrastructures that connect to service provider network access gateways to provide access to the offered services. In some instances, network system may include subscriber devices 16 that attach to multiple different access networks 6 having varying architectures.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In general, any one or more of subscriber devices 16 may request authorization and data services by sending a session request to gateway 8. In turn, gateway 8 typically accesses Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server 11 to authenticate the subscriber device requesting network access. Once authenticated, any of subscriber devices 16 may send subscriber data traffic toward service provider core network 7 in order to access and receive services provided by PDN 12, and such packets traverse gateway 8 as part of at least one packet flow. Flows 26 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> represent one or more upstream packet flows from any one or more subscriber devices 16 and directed to PDN 12. The term "packet flow," "traffic flow," or simply "flow" refers to a set of packets originating from a particular source device and sent to a particular destination device. A single flow of packets, in either the upstream (sourced by one of subscriber devices 16) or downstream (destined for one of subscriber devices 16) direction, may be identified by the 5-tuple: &lt;source network address, destination network address, source port, destination port, protocol&gt;, for example. This 5-tuple generally identifies a packet flow to which a received packet corresponds. An <i>n</i>-tuple refers to any <i>n</i> items drawn from the 5-tuple. For example, a 2-tuple for a packet may refer to the combination of &lt;source network address, destination network address&gt; or &lt;source network address, source port&gt; for the packet. Moreover, a subscriber device may originate multiple packet flows upon authenticating to service provider network 2 and establishing a communication session for receiving data services.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">As described herein, service provider network 2 includes a services complex 9 having a cluster of service nodes 10A-10N that provide an execution environment for the network services. That is, each of service nodes 10 apply one or more services. As examples, service nodes 10 may apply firewall and security services, carrier grade network address translation (CG-NAT), media optimization (voice/video), IPSec/VPN services, deep packet inspection (DPI), HTTP filtering, counting, accounting, charging, and load balancing of packet flows or other types of services applied to network traffic. Each of service nodes 10 in this way represents a service instance.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Although illustrated as part of a services complex 9, which may represent a data center, service nodes 10 may, for instance, be coupled by one or more switches or virtual switches of core network 7. In one example, each of service nodes 10 may run as virtual machines in virtual compute environment. Moreover, the compute environment may comprise a scalable cluster of general computing devices, such as x86 processor-based servers. As another example, service nodes 10 may comprises a combination of general purpose computing devices and special purpose appliances. As virtualized, individual network services provided by service nodes 10 can scale just as in a modern data center, through the allocation of virtualized memory, processor utilization, storage and network policies, as well as horizontally by adding additional load-balanced virtual machines.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, gateway 8 steers individual subscriber packet flows 26 through defined sets of services provided by service nodes 10. That is, each subscriber packet flow may be forwarded through a particular ordered combination of services provided by service nodes 10, each ordered set being referred to herein as a "service chain." In the example of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, one or more subscriber packet flows 26 are directed along a first service chain 28A and, therefore, receive services applied by service nodes 10A, 10B and 10N, in that order. Similarly, one or more subscriber packet flows 26 are directed along a second service chain 28B and, therefore, receive services applied by service nodes 10C, 10B and 10N.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In this way, subscriber flows 26 may be processed by service nodes 10 as the packets flow between access network 6 and PDN 12 according to service chains configured by the service provider. In the illustrated example, service chain 28A identifies the ordered set of nodes 10A, 10B, and 10N according to the listed ordering. Service chain 28B identifies the ordered set of nodes 10C, 10B and 10N. Accordingly, packet flows 26 processed according to service chain 28A follow a service path that traverses nodes 10A, 10B, and finally node 10N as the terminal node for the service chain 28A. A particular node 10 may support multiple service chains. In this example, service node 10B supports service chains 28A, 28B.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Once processed at a terminal node of the service chain, i.e., the last node 10 to apply services to packets flowing along a particular service path, the terminal node may direct the traffic back to gateway 8 for further processing and/or forwarding to PDN 12. For example, traffic engineered service paths may start and terminate with gateway 8.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Whereas a "service chain" defines one or more services to be applied in a particular order to provide a composite service for application to packet flows bound to the service chain, a "service tunnel" or "service path" refers to a logical and/or physical path taken by packet flows processed by a service chain along with the forwarding state for forwarding packet flows according to the service chain ordering. Each service chain may be associated with a respective service tunnel, and packet flows associated with each subscriber device 16 flow along service tunnels in accordance with a service profile associated with the respective subscriber. The arrows denoted as service chains 28A, 28B illustrate respective paths taken<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> by packet flows mapped to the service chains 28A or 28B. For example, a given subscriber may be associated with a particular service profile, which in turn is mapped to a service tunnel associated with service chain 28A. Similarly, another subscriber may be associated with a different service profile, which in turn is mapped to a service tunnel associated with service chain 28B. Gateway 8, after authenticating and establishing access sessions for the subscribers, directs packet flows for the subscribers along the appropriate service tunnels, thereby causing service complex 9 to apply the requisite ordered services for the given subscriber.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Nodes 10 may implement service chains 28A, 28B using internally configured forwarding state that directs packets of the packet flow long the service chains 28A, 28B for processing according to the identified set of service nodes 10. Such forwarding state may specify tunnel interfaces for tunneling between service nodes 10 using network tunnels such as Internet Protocol (IP) or Generic Route Encapsulation (GRE) tunnels, or by using Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) techniques, and so forth. In some instances, real or virtual switches, routers or other network elements that interconnect connect service nodes 10 may be configured to direct packet flow to the service nodes 10 according to service chains 28A, 28B.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, software-defined networking (SDN) controller 19 provides a high-level controller for configuring and managing routing and switching infrastructure of service provider network 2 (e.g., gateway 8, core network 7 and nodes 10). SDN controller 19 may be implemented as software, hardware, or a combination of software and hardware. In some examples, SDN controller 19 may be referred to as a controller device. In some instances, SDN controller 19 manages deployment of virtual machines within the operating environment of value-added services complex 9. For example, SDN controller 19 may interact with gateway 8 to specify service chain 28A, 28B information. For example, the service chain information provided by SDN controller 19 may specify any combination and ordering of value-added services provided by service nodes 10, traffic engineering information (e.g., labels or next hops) for tunneling or otherwise transporting (e.g., MPLS or IP tunnels) packet flows along service paths, rate limits, Type Of Service (TOS) markings or packet classifiers that specify criteria for matching packet flows to a particular service chain 28A, 28B.

Upon detecting a new flow, the gateway 8 selects the service chain for the flow based on the service profile and traffic type. For example, gateway 8 selects one of the service chains for the packet based on the service profile received for the subscriber and/or based on the type of traffic, e.g., HTTP traffic or VoIP traffic.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Service nodes 10 may receive subscriber-specific service requirements from other elements of service provider network, such as SDN controller 19, AAA server 11, policy control server 14 or other subscriber control systems to configure the services chains.

Network services applications 108 may invoke northbound API 150 to install/query data from these data structures. Constraints 154 represent a data structure that describes external constraints upon path computation. Constraints 154 allow network services applications 108 to, e.g., modify link attributes before path computation module 214 computes a set of paths. For examples, Radio Frequency (RF) modules (not shown) may edit links to indicate that resources are shared between a group and resources must be allocated accordingly. Network services applications 108 may modify attributes of link to effect resulting traffic engineering computations. In such instances, link attributes may override attributes received from topology indication module 166 and remain in effect for the duration of the node / attendant port in the topology.

In response to queries received via northbound API 150, path export 160 returns one or more path descriptors. Queries received may request paths between any two edge and access nodes terminating the path(s). Path descriptors may be used by network services applications 108 to set up forwarding configuration at the edge and access nodes terminating the path(s). A path descriptor may include an Explicit Route Object (ERO). A path descriptor or "path information" may be sent, responsive to a query from an interested party.

For instance, service provisioning module 26 may access one or more customer databases that include information about customers, sites, and services provided to the customers. Service provisioning module 26 may also use data from path provisioning module 174 that indicates state information about network devices and interfaces of network devices, including service nodes 10. Service provisioning module 26, when populating graph database 22, may automatically identify network resources and generate vertexes in graph database 22 for each network resource.

Topology indication module 166 may in some instances be a passive listener that neither forwards nor originates routing protocol advertisements. In some instances, topology indication module 166 may alternatively, or additionally, execute a topology discovery mechanism such as an interface for an Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) service.

Such TE information includes one or more of the link state, administrative attributes, and metrics such as bandwidth available for use at various LSP priority levels of links connecting routers of the path computation domain.

Examples of graph algorithms may include shortest-path, all shortest paths, Dijkstra's algorithm, depth-first search, breadth-first search, spreading activation, to name a few.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><p id="p0092" num="0092">Graph database 22 may determine the relationships specified by one or more of edges 206, 208 to vertexes 210 and 212, respectively.

Edge 208 indicates that customer "Citibank" represented by vertex 204 has a L3 VPN service represented by vertex 212.

Graph database 22 may determine the relationships specified by one or more of edges 214, 216 to vertexes 218 and 220, respectively. For instance, edge 214 indicates that the network device represented by vertex 218 is used by the L2 VPN service represented by vertex 210. Edge 216 indicates that the L2 VPN service represented by vertex 210 has a site represented by vertex 220. Graph database 22 may therefore determine that edge 214 satisfies a condition of the query that a network device exists for the L2 VPN service. In other words, to determine that a set of the plurality of network resources satisfies the service request, service provisioning module 26 may determine for a respective edge of the plurality of edges, a type of respective relationship between first and second network resources that respectively correspond to first and second vertexes of the respective edge; and responsive to determining that the type of relationship satisfies the query, service provisioning module 26 may select the first and second network resources to provide the network service within the network, as further described below.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">Since edge 214 satisfies the query for an L2 VPN, while edge 216 does not, graph database 22 may continue traversing graph 202 at vertex 218.

For instance, edge 222 indicates that the network device represented by vertex 218 is used by the L2 VPN service represented by vertex 222. Graph database 22 may make similar determination for each of edges 222-226.

For instance, edge 230 indicates that the customer "Wells Fargo" represented by vertex has an L2 VPN service represented by vertex 228. Graph database 22 may determine that edge 230 satisfies a condition of the query that an L2 VPN service exists for customer "Wells Fargo." Because a path through graph 202 satisfies the query, service provisioning module 26 determines that sufficient resources exist in the service provider network to fulfill the request for the L2 VPN service between customers "Citibank" and "Wells Fargo."</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">If the query determined that there were not sufficient resources to provision the L2 VPN service, service provisioning module 26 would send an error message to service provider system 24. However, because sufficient resources do exist in the example of <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, service provisioning module 26 selects the one or more corresponding resources, and generates one or more resource models (further described in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>) to configure the states of one or more network devices to provision the L2 VPN service.

By modeling relationships between network resources as edges in a graph, graph database 22 may examine a subset or fewer than all of the possible relationships in the service provider network, thereby improving the performance of querying and provisioning services. Techniques of the disclosure that implement resources and corresponding relationships in a graph database may reduce the complexity of queries required to determine whether services can be established in the service provisioning network, thereby simplifying implementation and maintenance of information that describes the service provider network.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">In some examples, service provisioning module 26 may update graph 202 of graph database 22 in realtime and/or responsive to the occurrence a network event. Although described with respect to topology module 164, service provisioning module 26 may also update graph 202 of graph database 22 as described herein with respect to service provisioning module 26. As described in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, network events may include but are not limited to link and/or device failures in the network determined by SDN controller 19. In some examples, a network event may include a rate that satisfies a threshold, such as bandwidth that falls below a threshold that indications congestion. As another example, a network event may include a rate of dropped packets that satisfies a threshold or a degree of confidence that satisfies a threshold that a packet flow includes a computer virus or a specific type of media. A network event may, generally, be any network occurrence that is determinable by a computing device, such as SDN controller 19.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">As an example, topology module 164 may determine a network event has occurred that indicates at least one change to the network. For instance, topology module 164 may determine that a link failure has occurred between two network devices. Responsive to detecting the link failure, topology module 164 may update, in real-time and based at least in part on the network event, at least one edge or at least one vertex in the graph database that corresponds to at least one of the network resources that is affected by the network event. For instance, if a service exists that uses the failed link, topology module 164 may remove one or more edges from graph 202 that represent the relationship between the service, the link, and the network devices connected by the link. Topology module 164 may also update attribute information for one or more of the vertexes and edges to reflect the changed state of the network.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">In some examples, responsive to detecting the network event, service provisioning modules 26 may automatically re-provision the service affected by the network event using other network resources by querying graph 202 of graph database 22. For instance, in the event of the link failure, service provisioning module 26 may traverse graph 202 to determine if an alternate path exists in the network to re-provision the service that was affected by the link failure. If an alternative path exists, service provisioning module 26 may automatically re-provision the service using the alternate path. To re-provision the service, service provisioning module 26 may configure one or more network resources that were determined using graph 202, and update graph 202 to reflect the changed state of the network that now uses the newly configured network resources.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">As such, network events that cause network resources to change, e.g., device failure, link failure, device overloaded, link congestion, the changes to network resources will be reflected in the graph database as values of vertex properties. It ensures a fast and accurate fault correlation. When required, services can be re-evaluated and redeployed according to pre-defined policies. In this way, techniques of<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> the disclosure may use graph database 22 and graph 202 to rapidly and automatically fail over to re-map services. If the service cannot be re-provisioned, service provisioning module 26 may send one or more alerts to the customer to indicate that the service cannot be re-provisioned automatically.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">In some examples, service provisioning system 26 may also include a service recommendation system. The service recommendation system may perform analytics on customers and their deployed services, and propose possible service packages that will likely be accepted by customers. Specifically, the service recommendation system may query graph database 22 to determine whether a customer and/or the customer's deployed services indicate a probability that a service package is likely to be accepted by the customer. Responsive to determining that the probability satisfies a threshold that a service package is likely to be accepted by the customer, the service recommendation system of service provisioning system 26 may notify the customer of the service package. Alternatively, the service recommendation system may notify a representative of the service provider network, who then initiates contact with the customer about the service package.</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">In some examples, service provisioning module 26 may simulate the provisioning of a service in the network before actually configuring nodes 10 to provide the service. In some examples, simulation may occur when indicated by a customer in the service request, while in other examples, simulation may occur to query for and configure a network service. By simulating the provisioning of the service, service provisioning module 26 may determine whether unforeseen issues may arise prior to actually configuring the service. Service provisioning module 26 may, to help with service planning, take a sandbox approach to evaluate and understand how a specific service can be deployed, and its potential impact to the network, by applying temporary property labels to the nodes and relationships in the graph database and performing the relevant queries.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">As an example, when querying at least a portion of the plurality of vertexes and plurality of edges of graph database 22 based at least in part on the service request, service provisioning module 26 may applying at least one tag to at least one vertex or one edge of the graph database. The tag may indicate the type of change that will occur to the vertex or edge when the service nodes are actually configured. In other examples, the tag may only indicate that the vertex or edge will change when the service nodes are actually configured. In any case, service provisioning module 26 may include tags on one or more edges and vertexes that corresponds to the resources and relationships that would be affected by provisioning service.</p><p id="p0105" num="0105">Service provisioning module 26 may then simulate, using the at least one tag, the configuring of the set of the plurality of network resources to provide the network service within the network. For instance, service provisioning module 26 may perform all or any of the various techniques as described with respect to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, except that service nodes 10 are not actually configured to provision the service. In other words, the state of the service nodes remains unchanged when simulating the configuring of the set of the plurality of network resources.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">Service provisioning module 26 may determine, based on the simulating, whether the set of the network resources can satisfy the service request. If a customer requested the simulation as part of the service request, service provisioning module 26 may send a message to the customer (e.g., at service provider system 24) indicating the results of the simulation. If the simulation was performed as part of the query and the set of the network resources can satisfy the service request, service provisioning module 26 will configure service nodes 10 to provision the service. If the simulation was performed as part of the<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> query and the network resources cannot satisfy the service request, service provisioning module 26 may send a message indicating an error code to the customer (e.g., at service provider system 24).</p><p id="p0107" num="0107"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is flowchart that illustrates example operations of a controller to provision services using a graph database, in accordance with techniques of the disclosure. While described with respect to service provisioning module 26 in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, the techniques may be implemented by any type of network device capable of performing one or more functions of SDN controller 19 described in the disclosure.</p><p id="p0108" num="0108">In the example of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, service provisioning module 26 receives a data-interchange formatted message, such as a JSON message, from service provider system 24 (250). The data-interchange formatted message may specify a service request to establish a VPN service between two customer sites. Service provisioning module 26 may validate the data-interchange formatted message against one or more schemas (251). If the data included in the data-interchange formatted message is not valid according the one or more schemas (176), service provisioning module 26 rejects the service request. In some examples, service provisioning module 26 rejects the service request by sending an HTTP error code (e.g., HTTP error code 403) to service provider system 24 (178).</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">If data included in the data-interchange formatted message is valid (253), service provisioning module 26 may map the request service to network resources to determine whether sufficient resources are available to service the request (180). For instance, service provisioning module 26 may generate a query to perform on graph database 22. To generate the query, service provisioning module 26 may translate a service abstraction included in the data-interchange formatted message into parameters according to a query language for a graph database 22. For instance, if a VPN service requires a provider edge router at each customer site and a route between the two provider edge routers, service provisioning module 26 may generate a query to search the graph for two resources that are provider edge routers, wherein each respective provider edge router is associated with a respective customer site specified in the service abstraction of the data-interchange formatted message. By mapping the requested VPN service as specified in the service abstraction to parameters in a query, service provisioning module 26 can search graph database 22 to determine whether resources are available to fulfill the request.</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">To query graph database 22, service provisioning module 26 may traverse one or more edges of the graph in accordance with the query to determine whether relationships between the vertexes satisfy the query. Taking the example service abstraction of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the customer "citi" may request a VPN between sites "SFO" and "NYC". Service provisioning module 26 may traverse one or more edges of the graph in graph database 22 to evaluate the conditions that the respective provider edge routers are coupled to the respective sites, that a route exists between the two provider edge routers, and that each of the two provider edge routers is configurable to provide a VPN. Service provisioning module 26 may, when traversing the graph, evaluate the relationships between the resources to determine whether the relationships satisfy the conditions of the query. In some examples, service provisioning module 26 may traverse the graph to evaluate other conditions or fewer conditions than described in the current example.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111">Service provisioning module 26 may, based on the query, determine whether resources are available to provide the VPN service (266). If sufficient resources are not available to fulfill the request (264), service provisioning module may send a response to service provider system 24 that rejects the service request. In some examples, service provisioning module 26 rejects the service request by sending an HTTP error code (e.g., HTTP error code 403) to service provider system 24 (178). If sufficient<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> resources are available to fulfill the request (268), service provisioning module 26 may generate and/or compile resource models to one or more data modeling files (270).</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">In some examples, path provisioning module 174 may generate and/or compile resource models using the YANG data modeling language, published as RFC 6020. YANG provides a standard modeling language to set the parameters of network equipment managed by SDN controller 19. In some examples, YANG is used with one or more protocols, such as SNMP, NetConf, TL1, to retrieve and set parameters that indicate the state of network equipment. YANG may be used to model the state of network elements and configuration data. Although the example of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is described with respect to YANG, any suitable protocol may be used. In the example of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, path provisioning module 174 may compile any resource models that may be needed to provision the network service into one or more modeling files according to the YANG standard. Alternatively or in addition to compiling resource models, path provisioning module 174 may directly configure service nodes 10 using southbound API 152.</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">Upon compiling the one or more modeling files, path provisioning module 174 may execute service provisioning jobs (248). Path provisioning module 174 may determine the contents of the one or more data modeling files to provision the VPN service. Path provisioning module 174 may perform configuration transactions and Subscriber Bus Interface (SBI) translations (274). To perform the configuration transactions and SBI translations, path provisioning module 174 may translate the YANG-standard formatted message to device-specific configuration information. Path provisioning module 174 then configures one or more service nodes, which correspond to the device-specific configuration information. In this way, service provisioning module 26 changes the states of one or more service nodes to provision the service. In other words, to configure the set of network resources to provide the network service within the network, path provisioning module 174 may generate, based at least in part on the set of network resources that satisfy the service request, one or more data models that define one or more configurations of one or more service nodes to provide the network service.

In either case, graph database includes at least one sub-graph that corresponds to the network service for a particular customer.
