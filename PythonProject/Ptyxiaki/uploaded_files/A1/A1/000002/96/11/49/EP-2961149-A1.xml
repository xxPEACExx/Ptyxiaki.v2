It is noted that the image scanner 10 is an example of an image processing apparatus according to aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The image scanner 10 is configured to scan a document set on an automatic document feeder (hereinafter referred to as an "ADF") (not shown) and generate scanned data. Namely, the image scanner 10 is a sheet feed scanner. The image scanner 10 includes a central processing unit (hereinafter referred to as a "CPU") 12, a storage device 14, a display 16, an input interface (hereinafter referred to as an "input I/F") 18, an image reading device 19, a detection sensor 20, a card reader 22, and a network interface (hereinafter referred to as a "network I/F") 24. These elements included in the image scanner 10 are communicably connected with each other via an input/output port (hereinafter referred to as an I/O port") 28. The display 16 is an example of a display according to aspects of the present disclosure. The input I/F 18 is an example of an operation device according to aspects of the present disclosure. The detection sensor 20 is an example of a sensor according to aspects of the present disclosure. The card reader 22 is an example of a reader according to aspects of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> present disclosure.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The CPU 12 is configured to execute operations in accordance with a first control program 30 and a second control program 31 stored in the storage device 14. It is noted that the storage device 14 is an example of a non-transitory computer-readable medium according to aspects of the present disclosure. The first control program 30 is a program for executing an image scanning operation and transmitting to the PC 50 scanned data generated in the image scanning operation. The second control program 31 is a program for registering a card and a shortcut button to be used for the image scanning operation. It is noted that the CPU 12 executing the control programs 30 and 31 may simply be referred to as the names of the programs. For instance, in the following description, "the control programs 30 and 31" may represent "the CPU 12 executing the control programs 30 and 31."</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The storage device 14 includes a data storage area 32 configured to store data necessary for execution of the first control program 30. The storage device 14 is formed by a combination of storage devices such as a random access memory (hereinafter referred to as a "RAM"), a read only memory (hereinafter referred to as a "ROM"), a flash memory, a hard disk drive (hereinafter referred to as an "HDD"), and a buffer provided to the CPU 12.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The display 16 has a display surface configured to display various functions of the image scanner 10. For instance, a liquid crystal display (hereinafter referred to as an "LCD"), an organic electroluminescence display (hereinafter referred to as an "OELD"), and a plasma display can be cited as examples of the display 16. The input I/F 18 is configured to accept user operations to buttons displayed on the display 16. For instance, the input I/F 18 may include a touch panel configured integrally with the display 16. Further, for instance, the input I/F 18 may include hard keys. The image reading device 19 is configured to read an image of a document. For instance, the image reading device 19 includes a plurality of conveyance rollers and an image sensor (such as a CCD image sensor or a contact image sensor). The plurality of conveyance rollers are driven by a motor. The image sensor is configured to read a document sheet being conveyed by the plurality of conveyance rollers. The image scanner 10 may be a flatbed scanner. In this case, the image reading device 19 may include a moving mechanism configured to move the image sensor in a sub scanning direction, in addition to or instead of the plurality of conveyance rollers. The detection sensor 20 is configured to detect whether there is a document set on the ADF of the image scanner 10. For instance, the detection sensor 20 includes a light emitting element configured to emit light and a light receiving element configured to receive the light from the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> light emitting element. When there is a document set on the ADF of the image scanner 10, the light from the light emitting element is blocked by the document.
