In Patent Document 1, there is disclosed a technology relating to a telephone exchange for forwarding an incoming call to another telephone set (number) in advance. Further, in the above-mentioned document, there is disclosed, as a secretarial function, a mechanism in which a relationship between a main telephone set and a sub-telephone set is registered in advance in the telephone exchange, to thereby call the sub-telephone set in response to a call to the number of the main telephone set. Further, there is disclosed a mechanism that facilitates a confirmation of presence/absence of a missed incoming call to the main telephone set and a connection to the sub-telephone set.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Further, in Patent Document 2, there is disclosed a mechanism of the telephone exchange system capable of discriminating which telephone terminal (number) an incoming call emitting sound is addressed to by a telephone set (proxy response source terminal) for conducting a proxy response as a part of a proxy response function so as to suit the secretarial function or the like. Specifically, there is disclosed a mechanism that provides, when a private branch exchange (PBX) causes a given telephone terminal to emit sound, display indicating a proxy response destination terminal to the telephone terminal to be caused to emit sound in a case where the incoming call is addressed to the proxy response destination terminal (number).</p><heading id="h0003">Prior Art Documents</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Document</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><p id="p0005" num="0005"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPH575712A"><text>JP-A-H5-75712</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JPH918910A"><text>JP-A-H9-18910</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of the Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">As described above, a telephone exchange system provides a function of proxy-responding to an incoming call to one or a plurality of predetermined telephone numbers. To conduct this proxy response, a telephone exchange or the like identifies an extension number or an outside-line number set in advance in internal or external storage means in a format of table information or the like, and subjects the incoming call to forwarding processing.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Further, the telephone exchange system provides a sliding-forwarding function of calling a call destination set in this proxy response while sequentially sliding the call destination among a plurality of telephone numbers (extension numbers or outside-line numbers) in a predetermined order. This sliding-forwarding function is used to proxy-respond to an incoming call to one or a plurality of predetermined telephone numbers within a predetermined group for secretarial work or the like.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further, the telephone exchange system provides a function of directly connecting even an incoming call to a predetermined telephone number for which the proxy response is set without forwarding the incoming call to a proxy-responding telephone terminal on condition that the incoming call is from a predetermined number set in advance. In the secretarial work, a secretary uses this direct connection function to relay a call source such as a customer to a proxy response destination such as his/her superior. Without this direct connection function, under a condition that the sliding-forwarding function is in operation, there is a problem in that the secretary cannot directly telephone the proxy response destination due to the sliding-forwarding function.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In each function of the proxy response, a telephone device (number) that proxy-responds is set in advance generally in units of persons or groups.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">However, there is a problem in that the telephone device (number) in which a person or group that is to receive forwarding is set in advance cannot be used at all times for a variety of reasons.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In a simple case example, the set telephone terminal or number cannot be used only by moving from a working room to a meeting room. Further, a predetermined telephone terminal or number cannot be used even while working outside at another office or during an off-duty hour. Further, even when an unintended telephone conversation with a proxy response source<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> is requested on the road or the like, it is not possible to directly connect to the proxy response source.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Further, when a sliding function is in operation, there is further another problem. For example, even when the secretary calls the number of the proxy response destination from an extension telephone, a cellular phone, or the like in the meeting room, a sliding operation is sequentially conducted within a secretary group, and hence it is not possible to directly call the proxy response destination.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">On the other hand, in consideration of an operational aspect, an individual in charge of the proxy response often has authority given to himself/herself from the proxy response destination or an organization. To give an example, the individual is authorized as the secretary. Further, in consideration of internal rules formed so as to pass the incoming call to an engineering department through sales staff in charge thereof, a sales representative is given authority as to whether or not to connect a telephone call from a customer or the like to the engineering department.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Further, it can be requested to connect directly to a leader or the engineering department from a telephone terminal or telephone number in which the secretary as in the above-mentioned case example or a person in charge is not set in advance. For example, there may be a future demand for a mechanism capable of carrying out the secretarial work even when not all members of a secretarial section are present in their office.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">This invention provides a telephone exchange system capable of notifying a proxy response requester of an incoming call to a predetermined proxy responder to be subjected to the proxy

exchange system 1 according to one embodiment mode of this invention.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref>, the telephone exchange system 1 is arbitrarily prepared with connections and settings in advance so as to be connectable to a plurality of telephone terminals (A to G) along with an outside line. Note that, the telephone exchange system according to this invention may be constructed of one telephone exchange 10 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref>, or may be constructed as a cooperative distributed telephone exchange system in which a plurality of telephone exchanges operate in cooperation with one another as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 1B</figref>. Further, examples of the telephone terminal to be connected thereto may include a key telephone, an IP telephone (voice over IP (VoIP) telephone), a personal handyphone system (PHS), a cellular phone, and a softphone.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the telephone exchange 10, a proxy response unit 11, a sliding-forwarding unit 12, an absent forwarding unit 13, and a direct switching setting unit 14 for enabling a direct connection to a proxy response destination without conducting sliding-forwarding under a predetermined condition are formed as control units relating to switching control of a call.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The proxy response unit 11 is operated to allow a predetermined number to be set as the proxy response destination based on information set in advance, and forward an incoming call to the predetermined number to a telephone terminal or number associated therewith as a proxy response source.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The sliding-forwarding unit 12 is operated to forward a call to a predetermined telephone terminal or number corresponding to the incoming call to a different telephone terminal or number in a predetermined order with a lapse of time based on information set in advance. In this case, for example, when a prioritized telephone terminal is busy during the telephone conversation, the connection is made to the next prioritized telephone terminal.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The absent forwarding unit 13 is operated to forward the incoming call to the telephone terminal or number serving as the proxy response source based on a forwarding setting set by a proxy responder or the like. The absent forwarding unit 13 retains the forwarding setting corresponding to each individual telephone terminal or number.

This function depends on the telephone terminal's own function and a line-side service. Examples thereof include a 3-way calling service carried out through an ISDN or mobile communications.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Now, a description is made of a secretarial function exhibiting convenience that is further increased by use of a telephone terminal having a mechanism capable of using two lines simultaneously.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066"><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref> illustrate a processing flow for holding the incoming call until the forwarding-destination telephone terminal and the proxy-response-destination telephone terminal are connected to each other to finish the secretarial work after the secretary or the like responds to the incoming call to the proxy-response-destination telephone terminal.

Note<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> that, a direct inward dialing line with respect to the leader may be used. The mobile telephone terminal may be provided with a dedicated secretary software (application), but it suffices that the operator inputs a number for the 2nd call through a dial operation or from a phone directory. The mobile telephone terminal uses a free B-channel line (B2 line in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref>) of the ISDN to set another call.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">Step 4: The telephone exchange 10 receives the incoming call serving as the 2nd call, identifies caller number information (calling number) or the like, discriminates a receiving call of the 2nd call, internally operates the B1 connected to the mobile telephone terminal into a hooking state, and shifts the terminating call (telephone conversation requester) to a holding state. The B2-line may be disconnected as soon as automatic response processing is finished. At the same time, the telephone exchange 10 causes the mobile telephone terminal (secretary) to listen to a dial tone, to notify that dialing is ready to be received. Note that, with the dedicated software, the B2-line may be used to receive a selection of the connection destination by data communications. During this processing, a large-scale exchange may notify the secretary side of the holding number as necessary.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">Step 5: The telephone exchange 10 receives the dialing of the extension number ("1000") of the connection destination (leader A) from the mobile telephone terminal (secretary), refers to the direct switching setting table or the like to carry out a number analysis of the received dial number, discriminates whether to directly conduct the "incoming call override" or conduct the "sliding operation" based on the comparison processing between the telephone number of the incoming call or the like and the set telephone number or the like, and calls a connection destination telephone terminal (telephone terminal of the leader A).</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">Step 6: When the leader A responds thereto, the mobile telephone terminal (secretary) and the connection destination telephone terminal (leader A) are shifted to the telephone conversation state.

At this point in time, the mobile telephone terminal (secretary) returns to an initial state. Note that, the telephone exchange system may be provided with the mechanism for shifting the leader A, the telephone conversation requester, and the secretary to a 3-way calling state thereamong as necessary. Next, the processing operation example of <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref> in which the additional number is used<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> is briefly described.
