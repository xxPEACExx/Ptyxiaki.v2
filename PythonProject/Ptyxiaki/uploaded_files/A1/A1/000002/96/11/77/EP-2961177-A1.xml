To this end, the broadcast signal receiving apparatus includes a communicator, for example, a cable modem to communicate with the headend and receive a broadcast signal.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The broadcast signal receiving apparatus may have a plurality of power modes and enter a standby mode (or a standby power mode), in which power supplied to idle elements is shut off to reduce power consumption, if a predetermined time elapses in the state that no operation is performed.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the related art, when the broadcast signal receiving apparatus is in the standby mode, the communicator is typically disconnected from the headend if there is no response for a predetermined time defined by a protocol of the communicator.

The signal processed in the operation S511, for example, an A/V signal is transmitted to the display apparatus 200 through the output 130, and thus output as an image/a sound through the display apparatus 200.</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">According to an exemplary embodiment, an apparatus with an interactive communicator can maintain connection with a headend even in the standby mode, and thus intermediately switch over from the standby mode to the normal mode without the provisioning process, thereby decreasing power consumption and minimizing a user's standby time.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111">Further, the communicator is woken up in only the minimum time needed for maintaining the connection with the headend and performs the operation of maintaining the connection, thereby keeping the registered information of the apparatus in the headend and decreasing average standby power.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">The foregoing exemplary embodiments may be recorded on a computer-readable recording medium and may be implemented in computer programs executed using various computer programs. The computer-readable recording medium includes a transmission medium and a storage medium for storing data readable by a computer system. The transmission medium may be implemented by a wired/wireless network where computer systems are connected to one another.</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">The foregoing exemplary embodiments may be implemented by hardware and combination of hardware and software. The hardware includes the controller 170, and the controller 170 includes a nonvolatile memory where the software, i.e., a computer program is<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> stored; a random access memory (RAM) to which the computer program stored in the nonvolatile memory is loaded; and a central processing unit (CPU), circuitry, a processor, a microprocessor, etc., for executing the computer program loaded to the RAM. The nonvolatile memory may include a hard disk drive, a flash memory, a read only memory (ROM), compact disc (CD)-ROMs, magnetic tapes, a floppy disk, an optical storage, a data transmission device using Internet, etc., but not limited thereto. The nonvolatile memory is simply an example of the computer-readable recording medium in which a program readable by a computer is recorded.</p><p id="p0114" num="0114">The computer program is a code that can be read and executed by the CPU, and includes codes for enabling the controller 170 to perform operations including the operations S501 to S511 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">The computer program may be involved in software including an operating system or applications provided in the broadcast signal receiving apparatus 100 and/or software interfacing with the external apparatus.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">Although a few exemplary embodiments have been shown and described, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in one or more of these exemplary embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">Attention is directed to all papers and documents which are filed concurrently with or previous to this specification in connection with this application and which are open to public inspection with this specification, and the contents of all such papers and documents are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p0118" num="0118">All of the features disclosed in this specification (including any accompanying claims, abstract and drawings), and/or all of the steps of any method or process so disclosed, may be combined in any combination, except combinations where at least some of such features and/or steps are mutually exclusive.</p><p id="p0119" num="0119">Each feature disclosed in this specification (including any accompanying claims, abstract and drawings) may be replaced by alternative features serving the same, equivalent or similar purpose, unless expressly stated otherwise. Thus, unless expressly stated otherwise, each feature disclosed is one example only of a generic series of equivalent or similar features.</p><p id="p0120" num="0120">The invention is not restricted to the details of the foregoing embodiment(s).
