Furthermore, the conference server device 12 may be software and services operating in a plurality of computers. Furthermore, the conference server device 12 has a mode of, for example, a so-called cloud service. Note that the conference server device 12 may be realized by various hardware configurations, as long as the conference server device 12 has a conference service function.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The conference client device 10 has functions of acquiring conference information, conference materials, etc., from the conference server device 12, receiving operations needed for the progress of the conference from the person performing operations such as the presenter, the operator, and the participant of the conference, and displaying the conference materials to be browsed. The person<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> performing operations such as the presenter, the operator, and the participant of the conference is able to participate in the conference from the conference client device 10.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The conference client device 10 may be a PC, a tablet terminal, a smartphone, a mobile phone, a mobile information terminal such as a PDA, a terminal exclusively used for conferences, an electronic whiteboard, and an image forming apparatus such as a MFP and a printer.

The conference client device 10 can be switched between the two modes of a sharing mode and an individual mode. For example, in the sharing mode, the conference material displayed on the screen of the conference client device 10 of the participant is displayed in<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> synchronization with the conference material displayed on the screen of the conference client device 10 of the presenter, along with the progress of the conference lead by the presenter or the operator. The synchronized display includes, for example, a page display of the conference material, a display of writing (handwritten memo) in the conference material, and a display of a pointer to the conference material.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Furthermore, in the individual mode, the conference material displayed in the screen may be freely displayed (asynchronous display), regardless of the progress of the conference lead by the presenter and the operator, and without synchronizing with the conference material in the screen of the conference client device 10 of the presenter. The conference material is an example of a target content for receiving input operations from the presenter or the operator (for example, changing the display page and adding a handwritten memo).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The conference display device 14 is an example of an output device for displaying the conference material on a large screen to be browsed, and is installed in, for example, a conference room.
