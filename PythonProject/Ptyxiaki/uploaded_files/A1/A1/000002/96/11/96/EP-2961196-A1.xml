Two poles of the connector are used for transmitting a stereo analog audio signal from the media device to the headphone. A third pole is often used to transmit microphone signals from a microphone included in the headphone to the media device. A fourth pole is used for transmitting a ground potential.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Besides a wired headphone, other kinds of accessories are desired to be connected to the media device. In conventional implementations, dedicated interfaces with separate connectors for connecting the accessory to the media device may be used. However, additional connectors need space, which is limited in modern media devices.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is an object of the invention to provide an improved interface concept for connecting a media device that allows easier connections between the media device and accessories.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> This object is achieved with the subject-matter of the independent claims. Developments and embodiments are subject-matter of the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The invention is based on the idea that for a media device with a four-pole connector the first and the second pole, normally used for transmitting analog audio signals, may alternatively be used for transmitting one or more supply signals depending on the requirements of a connected accessory. Hence, if a conventional audio headset, with or without a microphone, is connected to the media device, it receives the analog audio signals as usual. If a special accessory requiring a supply signal is connected, one or both of the audio poles of the four-pole connector are used for transmitting the required supply signals.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The decision regarding which kind of accessory is connected may be made based on an identification of the connected accessory. In this respect the term "accessory" comprises both conventional headphones and special devices such as sensors or the like, which may also transmit sensor data to the media device over the four-pole connector, in particular over the third pole or microphone pole of the four-pole connector.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A special accessory may also be able to process both audio signals and use the supply signal, but not concurrently.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The described functions may be implemented by respective interfaces, in particular by a host interface for a media device and by an accessory interface for an accessory device, in particular a headphone or a hands-free set.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Accordingly, with the improved interface concept, connection of various devices to a media device is simplified and particularly can be done with a single connector.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Such a four-pole connector may be a tip-ring-ring-sleeve, TRRS, connector, commonly also known as a 3.5 mm jack. Standard definitions of such connectors are given, for example, in EIA RS-453, or IEC 6063-11. Of course, other sizes of such a connector, like a 2.5 mm jack, may be used.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">An exemplary embodiment of a host interface for a media device according to the improved concept comprises a first host audio terminal for receiving a first analog audio signal, a second host audio terminal for receiving a second analog audio signal, a first connector audio terminal for connecting a first pole of the four-pole connector, and a second connector audio terminal for connecting a second pole of the four-pole connector. The host interface further includes a host control circuit that is adapted to detect whether a device is connected that requires a supply signal over the four-pole connector. If no device requiring the supply signal is detected, for example a conventional headphone, the host control circuit effects that the first analog audio signal is passed to the first connector audio terminal and the second analog audio signal is passed to the second connector audio terminal. If a device requiring the supply signal is detected, the host control circuit effects that the first connector audio terminal is connected to a supply terminal. In this case, the second connector audio terminal may be connected to a common ground terminal, to the supply terminal, to a further functional terminal, or may be kept on the second audio terminal.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In some implementations, the host control circuit is further adapted to detect whether a device is connected that requires the supply signal and further requires a further supply signal over the four-pole connector. If such a device further requiring the further supply signal is detected, the host control circuit assures that the second connector audio terminal is connected to a further supply terminal.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In various implementations, the supply terminal, respectively the further supply terminal, is operable to be connected to one of the following: a supply rail of the host interface, a voltage regulator of the host interface, a current regulator of the host interface, a supply rail of the media device comprising the host interface, a voltage regulator of the media device, a current regulator of the media device. The further supply terminal may further be connectable to a ground terminal being a reference potential terminal for the supply terminal being connected to the first connector audio terminal. The second terminal can also stay as an audio terminal.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In some implementations the host control circuit is adapted, if a device requiring the supply signal is detected, to generate a deactivation signal for deactivating respective audio amplifiers providing the first and the second analog audio signals. For example, an output stage of the amplifiers can be deactivated by such a deactivation signal, such that a physical electrical connection between the host audio terminals and the connector audio terminals may be maintained without any influence on the signal at the respective terminals.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">However, in addition or as an alternative, the host control circuit may be adapted, if a device requiring the supply signal is detected, to electrically disconnect the first connector audio terminal from the first host audio terminal and the second connector audio terminal from the second host audio terminal.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In various implementations the host interface further comprises a connector microphone terminal for connecting a third pole of the four-pole connector.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In some embodiments, the host control circuit is adapted to detect whether a device requiring the supply signal is connected based on an identification signal received at the connector microphone terminal. Such an identification signal may be an encoded digital sequence sent by the connected device, a signal sent from the connected device with a distinct frequency spectrum or with a special signal form. However, other implementations of an identification signal are also possible.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In some implementations a host interface according to the improved interface concept further comprises a host microphone terminal and a data receiver. In such an implementation the host control circuit may be adapted to detect whether a device is connected that transmits encoded data over the connector microphone terminal. If a device transmitting encoded data is detected, the host control circuit effects that the connector microphone terminal is connected to the data receiver for decoding received encoded data. If no device-transmitting encoded data is detected, the host control circuit effects that the connector microphone terminal is connected to the host microphone terminal.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> Accordingly, in the first case, the decoded data may be provided to the media device, for example as a digital bit stream or another appropriate representation of the received data. In the second case, an analog microphone signal generated, for example, by a microphone of a connected headset.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The host interface may be configured to transmit various signals over the connector microphone terminal. For example a current signal or a voltage signal may be generated by the host interface. This signal can be used at the accessory side for generating a supply signal, e.g. for electronic parts in the accessory. Clock information may be transmitted in encoded form over the connector microphone terminal, for example by various kinds of pulses that can be used directly or as a synchronization for a clock generator on the accessory side. A host identification signal may be sent over the connector microphone terminal that can be evaluated by the accessory side to potentially identify which kid of host the accessory is connected to.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In some implementations the host interface may further comprise a data transmitter that is configured to send an encoded digital signal, in particular an audio signal to connect a microphone terminal. The transmission may, for example, be done according to the I2S standard.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">An embodiment of an accessory interface according to the improved interface concept for a headphone or a hands-free kit comprises a first accessory audio terminal for connecting a first pole of the four-pole connector, a second accessory audio terminal for connecting a second pole of the four-pole connector, an accessory microphone terminal for connecting a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> third pole of the four-pole connector, a first accessory loudspeaker terminal for connecting a first loudspeaker and a second accessory loudspeaker terminal for connecting a second loudspeaker. The accessory interface further includes a class-D amplifier with a first and a second amplifier output and an accessory data receiver adapted to receive an encoded digital audio signal from the accessory microphone terminal for producing the digital audio data for the class-D amplifier. An accessory control circuit of the accessory interface is adapted to detect which kind of media device is connected at the four-pole connector.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The headphone can also be a headset in some applications.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A class-D amplifier, which is also known as a switching amplifier, is an electronic amplifier where all power devices, usually MOSFETS, are operated as binary switches. During operation these switches are either fully on or fully off. The digital input signal of the class-D amplifier may be a variable duty cycle square wave of which the low frequency portion of the spectrum is essentially the wanted output signal, and of which the high frequency portions serves the purpose of making the wave form binary so it can be amplified by switching the power devices. A passive low pass filter usually removes the unwanted high frequency components, i.e. smoothes the pulses out and recovers the desired low frequency signal. In conventional class-D amplifiers, to maintain high efficiency, the filter may be made with purely reactive components, which store the excess energy until it is needed instead of converting some of it into heat. Hence, the class-D amplifier can be operated with less power.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">For example, the accessory control circuit is adapted to detect whether a media device is connected at the four-pole connector having a host interface according to the embodiments described above with a data transmitter that is configured to send an encoded digital audio signal to the connector microphone terminal. If no such media device is detected, the accessory control circuit effects that the first accessory audio terminal is connected to the first accessory loudspeaker terminal and the second accessory audio terminal is connected to the second accessory loudspeaker terminal. Hence, a conventional analog stereo signal can be transmitted and played by respective loudspeakers connected to the accessory loudspeaker terminals.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">However, if such a media device with the defined host interface is detected, the accessory control circuit effects that a supply input of the class-D amplifier is connected to the first accessory audio terminal, which in this case receives a supply signal from the host interface of the media device. Furthermore, the digital audio data provided by the accessory data receiver are passed to the class-D amplifier, and the first amplifier output is connected to the first accessory loudspeaker terminal and the second amplifier output is connected to the second accessory loudspeaker terminal. Accordingly, the digital audio signal is converted to respective loudspeaker signals by the class-D amplifier and played by respective loudspeakers connected to the accessory loudspeaker terminals.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Hence, a headphone or a hands-free kit equipped with such an accessory interface is able to work both with conventional media devices and media devices which are equipped with the host interface according to the improved interface concept.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> This has the further advantage that class-D amplifiers with a high power efficiency can still be used despite a cable length between the media device and the accessory interface, as the audio data are sent in a digital format to the accessory interface and signal lines between the class-D amplifier and the loudspeakers can be kept short. This prevents or at least reduces potential electromagnetic interface, EMI, problems.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In some applications, the headset or the hands-free kit may include one or more microphones. For such applications the accessory interface may further comprise an accessory data transmitter adapted to receive a microphone signal from a microphone of the headset or the hands-free kit and to produce an encoded digital microphone signal thereof. In such an implementation the accessory control circuit is adapted to detect whether a media device is connected that is operable to process an encoded digital microphone signal. If such a media device is detected, the accessory control circuit effects that the encoded digital microphone signal is sent to the accessory microphone terminal. The encoded digital microphone signal may also include microphone data from more than one microphone, i.e. a multiplexed microphone signal.

A host interface to be used with or within a media device is connected to an accessory device with an accessory dongle and an accessory load. The physical connection between the host interface and the accessory device is made over a four-wire connection being implemented with a four-pole connector. Such a four-pole connector may be implemented with a standard 3.5 mm plug, also known as a TRRS jack. Preferably, the host interface is connected to a respective socket and the accessory device has a cable with the appropriate plug, which is depicted as an example. Other kinds of four-pole connectors may still be used. A first and a second pole of the four-pole connector may be connected to a left channel wire and a right channel wire LCH WIRE, RCH WIRE, which are usually used for transmitting analog audio signals, in particular a stereo audio signal. A third pole is connected to a respective microphone wire, MIC WIRE, and a fourth pole serves to establish a common ground connection GND.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">To this end the host interface comprises a connector microphone terminal CMT connected to the third pole, respectively the MIC WIRE, and a first and a second connector audio terminal CAT1, CAT2 connected to the LCH WIRE, RCH WIRE, respectively. The fourth pole GND may be connected to a ground terminal of the host interface or of the media device itself.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The host interface further comprises a host control circuit HCTRL and a host data receiver being coupled to the connector microphone terminal CMT. The host control circuit HCTRL and the host data receiver are further coupled to a host data terminal HDT for transmitting data to the media device. A host microphone terminal HMT is switchably coupled to the connector microphone terminal CMT and designed for being connected to a microphone input of the media device. The host interface further comprises a first and a second host audio terminal HAT1, HAT2, which are designed to receive a first and a second analog audio signal, for example from respective headphone amplifiers of the media device. The first and the second host audio terminal HAT1, HAT2 are coupled to the first and the second connector audio terminal CAT1, CAT2. Furthermore, the first connector audio terminal CAT1 is switchably coupled to a host supply terminal HST1.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In one application configuration a conventional headphone with or without a microphone may be connected to the four-pole connector. In this case the host control circuit HCTRL effects that the first and the second audio signal received at the first and the second host audio terminal HAT1, HAT2 are passed to the respective connector audio terminals CAT1, CAT2. This may be done by respective switching of a host switch HSW1 under control of the host control circuit HCTRL.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> Additionally, the connection of the connector microphone terminal CMT can be controlled depending on the type of signal going over that terminal CMT.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">For example, if a device with a conventional analog microphone is connected, the analog microphone signal is passed to the host microphone terminal HMT. If, however, an encoded digital signal is received at the connector microphone terminal CMT, this signal is passed to the host data receiver for decoding and further processing. This switching function is symbolized by the switch HSWM. For example, the switch HSWM has a default setting connecting the connector microphone terminal CMT to the host microphone terminal HMT.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In another application feasible with the host interface according to the improved interface concept, an accessory device is connected to the four-pole connector that is not designed for processing or playing analog audio signals. Instead, the accessory includes some kind of load, for example, a sensor, that requires a supply signal for being operated. To this end, the accessory load is connected to an accessory audio terminal AAT1. An output signal of the accessory load is provided to a dongle data transmitter of the accessory dongle that processes the output signal and provides an encoded version of the processed signal to an accessory microphone terminal AMT connected to the third pole MIC WIRE of the four-pole connector. A data transmission may be performed as described in international patent application <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP2014057175W"><text>PCT/EP2014/057175</text></patcit> of the ams AG dealing with bidirectional data communication over a single wire, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Accordingly, the accessory dongle may optionally include a supply extraction which generates a supply voltage or a supply current for the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> accessory dongle from a signal on the MIC WIRE. Furthermore, a clock extraction may be optionally included in the accessory dongle, which generates a clock signal, e.g. for transmission timing and/or analog-to-digital conversion. For example, the clock may be extracted from short pulses or peak signals received over the MIC WIRE.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In the configuration shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, data received from the accessory, respectively the accessory load, via the dongle data transmitter, are processed in the host data receiver by respective passing of the signal to the host data receiver and/or a respective switching setting of the switch HSWM.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">A stabilizing or smoothing capacitor may be optionally connected in parallel to supply terminals of the accessory loads, i.e. between the accessory audio terminal AAT1 and the ground terminal GND.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In order to be able to work both with conventional headsets and accessories requiring a supply signal, the host control circuit HCTRL is adapted to detect whether a device requiring a supply signal over the four-pole connector is connected. For example, this detection may be based on an identification signal received from the connected device, indicating the type of accessory. For example, the identification signal may be in the form of a digital identifier naming the type and/or requirements of the accessory. However, the identification signal may be formed by a signal having a predefined signal form and/or a predefined frequency spectrum that can be interpreted by the host control circuit HCTRL. The identification signal can also be a predefined signal sequence or the like.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0045" num="0045">If a device requiring the supply signal is detected, the first connector audio terminal CAT1 is connected to the supply terminal HST1, as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. If no device requiring the supply signal is detected, for example because no identification signal is received, such as from a conventional headphone, the host control circuit HCTRL is configured to pass the audio signals from the host audio terminal HAT1, HAT2 to the connector audio terminals CAT1, CAT2. For example, the switch HSW1 has a default setting connecting the first host audio terminal HAT1 to the first connector audio terminal CAT1.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">With the host interface according to the improved interface concept, a media device can use a single connector socket more flexibly compared to conventional solutions. Not only conventional headphones with or without microphones can be connected, but other kinds of accessory devices like sensors or other data-collecting can be connected.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> shows a further embodiment with a host interface and an accessory connected thereto, this embodiment being based on the one shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. Therefore, only the differences to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> will be discussed in more detail. The host interface of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is further adapted, not only to provide a single supply signal at the connector audio terminal CAT1, but also a further supply signal at the second connector audio terminal CAT2. This can be used by a connected accessory having a second accessory audio terminal AAT2 connected to the second pole RCH WIRE of the four-pole connector. To this end the host interface comprises a further supply terminal HST2, which may be used for providing a further supply signal or a dedicated reference potential or<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> ground potential, e.g. a power ground PGND. Accordingly, a further switch HSW2 is symbolized, indicating that either the second host audio terminal HAT2 or the further supply terminal HST2 is actively connected to the second connector audio terminal CAT2. For example, the switch HSW2 has a default setting connecting the second host audio terminal HAT2 to the second connector audio terminal CAT2.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In such implementations the host control circuit HCTRL is configured to detect whether a device is connected that requires the supply signal and further requires a further supply signal over the four-pole connector. The detection may be performed in the same way as described above for <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. The supply terminal HST1 and the further supply terminal HST2 may be connected to a supply rail of the host interface or of the media device comprising the host interface. Furthermore, the supply signal and/or the further supply signal may be provided by a voltage regulator or a current regulator of either the host interface or the media device comprising the host interface. The additional ground terminal PGND may be a dedicated reference potential terminal being separated from the conventional ground terminal GND in so far as potential distortions in the feedback of the accessory load are prevented from having influence on the conventional ground potential. Hence, the overall signal quality in the system may be improved.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In some implementations, the supply signal and the further supply signal being provided to the connector audio terminals CAT1, CAT2 may be one positive and one negative voltage with reference to the potential at the ground terminal GND.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The symbolic switch HSW1 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> and the symbolic switch HSW2 of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> may be implemented as low impedance switches, both from the connector audio terminals CAT1, CAT2 to the host supply terminals HST1, HST2 and to the host audio terminals HAT1, HAT2, for example realized by transistor switches. Hence, if a device requiring the supply signal and/or the further supply signal is detected, the first connector audio terminal CAT1 is electrically disconnected from the first host audio terminal HAT1, and the second connector audio terminal CAT2 is electrically disconnected from the second host audio terminal HAT2.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">However, in some implementations, if a device requiring the supply signal is detected the host control circuit HCTRL may be adapted to generate a deactivation signal for deactivating respective audio amplifiers providing the first and the analog audio signals, for example the headphone amplifiers shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>. For example, the output stage of the respective amplifiers may be deactivated in the amplifiers such that even if an electrical connection between the host audio terminals HAT1, HAT2 and the supply terminals HST1, HST2 is present, there is no current flowing to the amplifier output terminal. Hence, an adverse feedback onto the amplifiers can be avoided.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">A further, optional difference to the implementation of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is given in that the host data receiver may also be implemented as a transceiver being able to transmit data over the third pole MIC WIRE. In this case, it is expedient that the dongle data transmitter is also implemented as a transceiver being able to additionally receive data from the host data transceiver.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The parameters of the accessory may be stored in an accessory identifier and retrieved from the dongle data transmitter for transmitting the identification signal to the host interface. This may be done in response to an identification request of the host interface or in an initialization phase after a connection to the host interface has been detected by the accessory dongle. Such implementation may also be used with the arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> shows a first example application of the arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>. In particular, the accessory load comprises an oximeter with a high current LED, i.e. a sensor device for measuring the oxygen saturation and/or the heart rate of a person. To this end, for example a finger of the person is lit with the high current LED, and the resulting light is measured with a photodetector. The respective output signal is transmitted to the host interface via the dongle data transmitter as described above. Such an application requires about 100 mA to 200 mA for driving the LED.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> shows a further example application of the configuration shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>. In this example, the accessory load comprises a hand scanner for optical scanning. Such a scanner needs to illuminate the scan area. This may need a high supply current, which is provided over the host interface as described above. The scanned data can be sent to the host interface via the dongle data transmitter, as described above.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The example applications of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> have the advantage that no separate power supply, for example in the form of batteries or the like, is needed in the accessory.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> Instead, the supply can be provided by the host interface, respectively the media device comprising the host interface.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref> shows a further example implementation, respectively application, of the improved interface concept that is based on the embodiments shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>. In this application the accessory interface is designed for a headphone or hands-free kit. To this end, besides the features described above for <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, the accessory interface comprises an accessory data receiver adapted to receive an encoded digital audio signal from the accessory microcontroller terminal AMT, the accessory data receiver being configured for producing digital audio data for a class-D amplifier from the encoded digital audio signal. The encoded digital audio signal may be transmitted according to the I2S standard.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The class-D amplifier may be included in the accessory interface or within the headphone or hands-free kit. The accessory interface comprises a first and a second accessory loudspeaker terminal ALT1, ALT2, which are coupled to the first and the second accessory audio terminal AAT1, AAT2. Respective loudspeakers LS1, LS2 can be connected to the first and the second accessory loudspeaker terminal ALT1, ALT2. The loudspeakers LS1, LS2 usually are not part of the accessory interface.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The class-D amplifier comprises supply inputs that are also coupled to the first and the second accessory audio terminal AAT1, AAT2. Compared to the applications shown in the previous figures, the class-D amplifier represents the accessory load that can use the supply provided by host interface.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><p id="p0060" num="0060">With this configuration, the accessory interface of <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref> can be operated in two basic modes of operation. In the first mode of operation analog audio signals are passed from the accessory audio terminals AAT1, AAT2 to the accessory loudspeaker terminals ALT1, ALT2 directly, as in a conventional headphone. In the second mode of operation, the digital audio data are used by the class-D amplifier for producing respective loudspeaker signals which are then provided to the accessory loudspeaker terminals ALT1, ALT2. In this second mode of operation, the supply signals provided at the accessory audio terminals AAT1, AAT2 are used as supply for the class-D amplifier. To this end, the accessory control circuit controls respective accessory switches ASW1, ASW2 to assume the respective switching state associated with the mode of operation.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In order to determine the respective mode of operation, the accessory control circuit is adapted to detect whether a media device with a host interface is connected that is able to provide at least one supply signal and an encoded digital audio signal. If such a host interface is detected, the class-D amplifier is operated as described above. Otherwise, the accessory loudspeaker terminals ALT1, ALT2 are provided with the analog audio signals provided by an e.g. conventional media device.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">The detection of which kind of host interface or media device is connected to the accessory interface may be based on a host identification signal provided by the host interface, as described above. For example, such detection may also be based on an identification handshake process started after plug-in of the accessory.<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --></p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The accessory interface may optionally further include a terminal for connecting one or more microphones, providing analog or digital microphone signals. For example, such a microphone may be used as a speech microphone for a hands-free kit. However, the one or more microphones may also be microphones for recording noise signals, in particular ambient noise signals, which can be used for an active noise cancelling, ANC, algorithm. Depending on the type of signal, namely analog or digital microphone signal, the accessory control circuit may affect an accessory microphone switch ASWM to directly connect the analog microphone to the accessory microphone terminal AMT, or to connect the accessory microphone terminal AMT to the dongle data transceiver. In the latter case, the one or more digital microphone signals are encoded by the dongle data transceiver and transmitted over the MIC WIRE to the host data transceiver, which receives the encoded microphone signals and provides a decoded representation thereof to the host data terminal HDT for processing by the media device.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In some implementations, the one or more microphones may directly provide digital microphone signals to the dongle data transceiver, which does the encoding or a signal multiplexing for transmission over the single MIC WIRE. In other implementations, one or more anlaog microphone signals may be received by the dongle data transceiver and converted into the digital domain before transmittal to the host data transceiver.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Accordingly, in some applications, an ANC headset may be implemented which transmits digital microphone data to a media device over the MIC WIRE and receives digital audio<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> data over the MIC WIRE at the same time. For example, this effects that there is no need to convert a digital audio data to the analog domain for the whole ANC loop.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">In particular, in such an application, digital bit streams are sent down from the headset to the host device, respectively media device. Digital signal processing may be done on these bit streams to get ANC subtraction signals in the media device. Those ANC subtraction signals get added to the digital playback audio data. The digital audio signal of the sum of playback and ANC signal gets streamed up to the headset. In the headset, the digital audio signals for the left and right channels are directly fed to the class-D inputs. In other implementations, the ANC processing may also be performed in the headset, but directly on the digital audio signal received at the dongle data receiver. It is apparent for the skilled reader that the block depicting the class-D amplifier represents a dual channel amplifier outputting amplified signals for the two loudspeakers LS1, LS2.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90459146" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Host interface for a media device, the host interface comprising
