The central optical system and the circular optical system can improve quality of an image as compared with parallel type optical systems arranged with the optical axis being interposed therebetween.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the image pickup device according to another aspect of the invention, it is preferable that the directional sensor having directional characteristics depending on pupil shapes of the central optical system and the circular optical system at an image surface position is used. This is because the pupil shapes of the central optical system and the circular optical system vary depending on the image surface position.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the image pickup device according to still another aspect of the invention, it is preferable that the directional sensor has plural microlenses serving as pupil division means, and the number and/or positions of pixels allocated to one microlens of the plural microlenses is the number and/or positions depending on pupil positions and shapes of the central optical system and the circular optical system. Specifically, variation of the pupil shapes of the central optical system and the circular optical system depending on the image surface position is coped with by optimizing the number and/or position of pixels allocated to one microlens.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the image pickup device according to still another aspect of the invention, it is preferable that the directional sensor has a microlens serving as pupil division means, the microlens dividing a pupil image and each divided pupil image entering the pixel, and the number of the pixels allocated to one microlens decreases as an image height increases. If the number of the pixels per one microlens is fixed, pupil separation is performed to allow the light to be incident on each pixel at the central region, but, at the outer portion (at a position of higher image height), the pixel is brought about where the light is unlikely to be incident or no light is incident (useless pixel). According to still another aspect of the invention, the number of the pixels allocated to one microlens decreases as the image height increases, which allows the light to be incident on the all pixels and the pixels in the directional sensor to be effectively used.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In the image pickup device according to still another aspect of the invention, it is preferable that a size of each pixel in the directional sensor is identical, and a size of the microlens used decreases as the image height increases. In other words, as the image height increases, the size of the microlens decreases, which decreases the number of the pixels per one microlens as the image height increases.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the image pickup device according to still another aspect of the invention, it is preferable that a size of the microlens is identical, and a size of the pixel in the directional sensor increases as the image height increases. In other words, as the image height increases, the size of the pixel increases, which decreases the number of the pixels per one microlens as the image height increases.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the image pickup device according to still another aspect of the invention, it is preferable that the central optical system has larger image forming magnification at the central region and smaller image forming magnification at a periphery side. In other<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> words, the central optical system is made to have characteristics like a fisheye lens.

In the smartphone 500 shown in <figref idrefs="f0017">Figure 19</figref>, the camera unit 541 is mounted on the same face as the display and input unit 520, but, a mounted position of the camera unit 541 being not limited thereto, may be mounted on a rear face of the display and input unit 520, or a plurality of camera units 541 may be mounted. In the case where a plurality of camera units 541 are mounted, the camera unit 541 for imaging may be changed over<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> for singularly imaging, or a plurality of camera units 541 may be simultaneously used for imaging.</p><p id="p0130" num="0130">The camera unit 541 can be used for the various functions of the smartphone 500. For example, an image obtained by the camera unit 541 may be displayed on the display panel 521, or an image of the camera unit 541 may be used as one of operation input on the operation panel 522. When the GPS reception unit 570 detects a position, the position can be detected by referring an image from the camera unit 541. Further, by referring an image from the camera unit 541, without using the triaxial acceleration sensor or in combination with the triaxial acceleration sensor, an optical axis direction of the camera unit 541 of the smartphone 500 can be determined, and also a current usage environment can be determined. Of course, an image from the camera unit 541 may be used in the application software.</p><heading id="h0023">[Others]</heading><p id="p0131" num="0131">The reflective mirror in the reflective mirror type lens configuration in the first and second embodiments of the photographing optical system is not limited to a concave mirror and a convex mirror, but may be a planar mirror, and the number of the reflective mirrors is not limited to two, but three or more reflective mirrors may be provided.</p><p id="p0132" num="0132">In the photographing optical systems in the embodiments, the wide angle lens is used for one of the central optical system and the circular optical system and the telephoto lens is used for the other, but, not limited thereto, one of the wide angle lens and the telephoto lens may be a normal lens, and further, the central optical system and two circular optical systems having a diameter different from each other may be disposed to give the wide angle lens, the normal lens, and the telephoto lens to the respective optical systems.</p><p id="p0133" num="0133">As the pupil division means for making the directional sensor have pupil directivity, not limited to the pupil image separation method and light shielding mask method shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref>, but those using a pupil division polarization element and the like may be applied.</p><p id="p0134" num="0134">Further, a lens shared by the central optical system and the circular optical system or a movement mechanism for moving the directional sensor in the optical axis direction may be disposed to carry out focusing thereby.<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --></p><p id="p0135" num="0135">It goes without saying that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above and may be modified in the scope without departing from the spirit of the invention.</p><heading id="h0024">{Reference Signs List}</heading><p id="p0136" num="0136"><ul><li>10...image pickup device, 12, 112, 212...photographing optical system, 13, 113, 213...central optical system, 14, 114, 214...circular optical system, 16, 16a, 16b...directional sensor, 17a, 17b...microlens, 18...light receiving cell, 19, 19a, 19b...light shielding mask, 24...digital signal processor, 25...image processor, 32...sensor control unit, 38...operation unit, 40...central processing unit (CPU)</li></ul></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90459190" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An image pickup device comprising:
