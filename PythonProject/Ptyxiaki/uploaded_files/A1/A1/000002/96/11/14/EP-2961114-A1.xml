Moreover the invention relates to a requesting entity and a subnetwork / subnetwork controller designed for executing said method.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Art Background</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A method, a requesting entity and a subnetwork / subnetwork controller of the kind above are known in prior art in principle. Quite often (data) connections are switched over a number of adjacent networks, in particular if the end points of the data connection are far apart. Moreover, there is a number of different possibilities to switch such a connection. Different providers may switch different connections between the same end points offering different qualities of service for different prices. Based on contracts, which may cover commercial and/or technical interrelations, a provider can prefer particular subnetworks or avoid them. These contractual relations are normally kept confidential. However, routing information and/or address information of the connection travels through different subnetworks during allocation of the connection and can be evaluated there in principle, why said confidentiality is undermined.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Accordingly, there may be a need for an improved method of establishing a data connection in a network, an improved requesting entity and an improved subnetwork / subnetwork controller. In particular, the contractual relations between the requesting entity and the subnetworks shall be obscured.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">This need may be met by the subject matter according to the independent claims. Advantageous embodiments of the present invention are described by the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a method as disclosed in the opening paragraph, wherein<br/>
at least a part of the routing information, which identifies the subnetworks, via which the at least one data connection shall be switched, and/or at least some addresses of calculated/allocated subnetwork nodes of the at least one data connection are transmitted between the requesting entity and the subnetworks in encrypted form.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In particular, according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method, wherein the requesting entity sends routing information, which identifies the subnetworks, via which the at least one data connection shall be switched, and which is at least partly encrypted.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In particular, according to yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a method, wherein addresses of calculated/allocated subnetwork nodes of at least some of the paths are sent from a subnetwork to the requesting entity via at least a part of the paths in encrypted form.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a requesting entity as disclosed in the opening paragraph, comprising<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> -->
<ul><li>means for encrypting routing information, which identifies the subnetworks, via which at least one data connection shall be switched, and/or</li><li>means for decrypting at least some addresses of calculated/allocated subnetwork nodes of the at least one data connection.</li></ul></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a subnetwork / subnetwork controller as disclosed in the opening paragraph, comprising
<ul><li>means for decrypting routing information, which identifies the subnetworks, via which at least one data connection shall be switched, and/or</li><li>means for encrypting at least some addresses of calculated/allocated subnetwork nodes of the at least one data connection.</li></ul></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Based on the measures disclosed above, the contractual relations between the requesting entity and the subnetworks are kept confidential respectively are obscured. Routing information and/or address information of the connection travelling through different subnetworks cannot be evaluated there.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It should be noted at this point that "data connection" has a general meaning in the context of the invention. Hence "data" may be audio data, text data, video data, picture data and/or machine data (e.g. program code, parameters, etc.) for use by computers.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to a further aspect of the invention, the disclosed method may be used for computation simple data connections between two parties (point to point connection, P2P for short), path trees between a single party and a plurality of parties (point to multipoint connection, P2MP for short) and/or overlay networks between a plurality of parties (multipoint to multipoint connection, MP2MP for short). A<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> path tree and an overlay network can also be seen as a crowd of single paths or connections. In case of a path tree all paths start (respectively end) at one point, in case of an overlay network they crisscross.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">An "overlay network" or virtual network generally is a network which is built on the top of another network. Nodes in the overlay can be considered as being connected by virtual or logical links respectively paths. Each path may correspond to a number of physical links in the underlying network. The underlying physical network itself consists of connected subnetworks, which in particular are operated by different operators or providers.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">It should be noted that the term "path computation element" does not limit the computation entity to the computation of a path. A "path computation element" may also calculate trees and overlay networks.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It should also be noted that the invention is not limited to a single data connection, a single tree or a single overlay network to be computed. By contrast, also a plurality of data connections, trees and/or overlay networks may be computed by a path computation element.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Furthermore, it should be noted that the requesting entity is not necessarily part of the requested data connection. The requesting entity may also request the data connection on behalf of the communication partners or another third party.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to a further embodiment of the invention, a method of establishing at least one data connection in a network, in which the requesting entity requests the at least one data connection via the plurality of paths through connected subnetworks in said network, comprises the steps of a1) the requesting entity sending routing information identifying the subnetworks, via which the at least one data<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> connection shall be switched, to a receiving subnetwork controller, wherein identifiers of at least some subnetworks are encrypted,
<ul><li>b1) the receiving subnetwork controller allocating a path to a subsequent/neighbouring subnetwork through the receiving subnetwork, wherein an identifier of the subsequent/neighbouring subnetwork is extracted from the routing information in plain format or extracted in encrypted form and decrypted by means of a key associated with the receiving subnetwork,</li><li>c1) the receiving subnetwork controller passing the routing information, in particular the remaining routing information, to a subsequent/neighbouring subnetwork controller,</li><li>d1) recursively repeating steps b1) and c1) until the at least one requested data connection is calculated/allocated, wherein the subsequent/neighbouring subnetwork controller of step c1) becomes a receiving subnetwork controller in a following step b1).</li></ul></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Advantageously, because of recursively repeating a part of the method above, just a comparably small piece of software is needed to deploy the method steps. By the measures taken above, generally the chain of connected subnetworks providing the requesting connection may be obscured, thus keeping the (commercial) relations between the requesting entity and the subnetworks secret. If the identifier of a subsequent/neighbouring subnetwork is encrypted, just the receiving subnetwork can identify it. In other words, just the next neighbour is known to a subnetwork controller. However, complete encryption is not mandatory. Some relations may be visible, if obscuring a particular relation is not useful to the requesting entity or if a subnetwork simply does not support such a function.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to a further embodiment of the invention, an identifier of a subsequent/neighbouring subnetwork is encrypted by means of public key of the receiving subnetwork<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> and decrypted by means of an associated private key of said receiving subnetwork. Accordingly, by means of asymmetric ciphering, encryption can be done very easily as the requesting entity just has to gather (and store) the public keys of said subnetworks. For example, the PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption method may be used for the concerns above. However, instead of asymmetric ciphering, symmetric ciphering can be used as well.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Advantageously, every pair of a private key and a public key is different. In this way, obscuring the relations between the requesting entity and the subnetworks is particularly effective.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Advantageously, the "Path Computation Element Protocol", the "Resource Reservation Protocol", the "Label Distribution Protocol" and/or the "Border Gateway Protocol" is used for communication between the requesting entity and the subnetworks. In particular, a "PcRequest" message of the "Path Computation Element Protocol", a "Path" message of the "Resource Reservation Protocol", a "Label request" message of the "Label Distribution Protocol" or a "Update" message of the "Border Gateway Protocol" may be used for sending the routing information in step a1). Accordingly, the invention may be implemented with just low effort as existing protocols are used respectively extended.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to a further embodiment of the invention, some of the addresses are sent from a subnetwork directly to the requesting entity in plain form. As the addresses do not travel through "foreign" subnetworks, the technical effort for encrypting the same can be saved.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to yet other embodiment of the invention, some of the addresses are also sent from a subnetwork directly to the requesting entity in encrypted form. In this way, the address information cannot be evaluated to find out the relations<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> between the requesting entity and the subnetworks by any third party.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to a further advantageous embodiment of the invention, a method of establishing at least one data connection, in which the requesting entity requests the at least one data connection via a plurality of paths through connected subnetworks in said network, comprises the steps of
<ul><li>a2) the requesting entity sending routing information identifying the subnetworks, via which the at least one data connection shall be switched, to a receiving subnetwork controller,</li><li>b2) the receiving subnetwork controller allocating subnetwork nodes and paths via said nodes to a subsequent/neighbouring subnetwork through the receiving subnetwork,</li><li>c2) the receiving subnetwork controller passing the routing information, in particular the remaining routing information, to a subsequent/neighbouring subnetwork controller,</li><li>d2) the receiving subnetwork controller sending addresses of calculated/allocated subnetwork nodes of the path in the receiving subnetwork and if applicable addresses of calculated/allocated subnetwork nodes of a further path in a further subnetwork of the at least one data connection
<ul><li>in plain or encrypted form directly to the requesting entity,</li><li>in encrypted form to the requesting entity via at least a part of the preceding path or</li><li>in encrypted form to a subsequent/neighbouring subnetwork controller,</li></ul></li><li>e2) recursively repeating steps b2) to d2) until the at least one requested data connection is calculated/allocated, wherein the subsequent/neighbouring subnetwork controller of step c2) becomes a receiving subnetwork controller in a following step b2).</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Again, just a comparably small piece of software is needed to deploy the method above because a part of the steps is recursively repeated. By the measures taken above, generally the chain of connected subnetworks providing the requesting connection may be obscured, thus keeping the (commercial) relations between the requesting entity and the subnetworks secret. If addresses of calculated/allocated subnetwork nodes of the path are encrypted, just the requesting entity can identify them. Other "foreign" subnetworks cannot gather information about the path in said networks. However, complete encryption is not mandatory. Some relations may be visible, if obscuring a particular relation is not useful to the requesting entity or if a subnetwork simply does not support such a function.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to a further embodiment of the invention, addresses of calculated/allocated subnetwork nodes in the receiving subnetwork are encrypted by means of a public key of said requesting entity and decrypted by means of an associated private key of said requesting entity. Accordingly, by means of asymmetric ciphering, decryption can be done very easily as the subnetworks just have to gather (and store) the public key of said requesting entity. For example, the PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption method may be used for the concerns above.
