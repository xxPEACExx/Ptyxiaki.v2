One of application manners of network videos is videoconferencing. A videoconferencing technology is a technology in which corresponding compression processing is performed after site information of a party participating in communication is collected by using video and audio collection devices and digitized, and then a digital signal is transferred through an available communication channel/line to a remote end for decompression, restoration, and reproduction. That is, a video conference is a conference that integrates a video, audio, and data communication, and images and sounds of conference sites can be transmitted in real time so that the conference sites are in one conference logically but are not within one area physically. Compared with a conventional conference, a video conference is highly efficient and cost-effective, and has advantages such as an effect of simulating a real scenario, which not only can resolve an issue of long-distance communication, but also satisfies a requirement of users for face-to-face communication; therefore, video conferences are more widely applied in companies. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a videoconferencing system in the prior art. The videoconferencing system mainly includes an MCU (Multi-Point Control Unit, multi-point control unit) and a conference endpoint.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">At present, each conference site in a videoconferencing system has at least one conference endpoint. A specific structure of a videoconferencing system is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 1B</figref>. Each conference endpoint collects and encodes a sound and an image of a conference site of the conference endpoint and sends the encoded sound and image to an MCU; the MCU sends the processed sound and image and a conference material to other conference endpoints in a video conference; and each of the other conference endpoints decodes and outputs the sound and image of the remote conference site and the conference material, thereby implementing remote video communication. There are two manners for displaying a conference material:</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">One manner is that: There are multiple desktop material display screens in a videoconferencing system, a main display screen that displays conference participants is separated from the desktop material display screens that displays a conference material, and one or more conference participants share one desktop material display screen. For details, refer to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 1C</figref>. A main function of the desktop material display screen is to demonstrate various electronic materials in a remote conference.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The other manner is that: There is one material display screen in a videoconferencing system, a main display screen that displays conference participants is separated from the material display screen that displays a conference material, and all conference participants at one conference site share one material display screen. For details, refer to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 1D</figref>. A main function of the material display screen is to demonstrate various electronic materials in the conference.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">During the foregoing process of implementing a conventional video conference, a system for implementing the video conference requires one main display screen that displays conference participants and at least one material display screen that displays a conference material, and the main display screen is separated from the material display screen. During the implementation process, the two types of devices need to be operated separately. Because the two types of display screen devices are separated, the videoconferencing system cannot be moved easily and has relatively poor flexibility. In addition, the two types of display screen devices are usually placed at different positions of a conference site, and connection lines in and between the display screen devices are large in quantity and complex, so that arrangement of the conference site is restricted and a fault easily occurs in the connection lines; therefore, a high maintenance requirement is imposed. Further, a keynote speaker and the conference material are not on a same screen, another conference participant who needs to pay attention to the keynote speaker and the conference material at the same time needs to constantly shift a line of sight within a relatively wide range between the keynote speaker and the conference material. As a result, conference efficiency is relatively low, and user experience is affected.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">Embodiments of the present invention provide a method for displaying a conference material in a remote conference, which is used to resolve problems in the prior art that a videoconferencing system cannot be moved easily and has relatively poor flexibility and relatively high maintenance costs, and that conference efficiency is relatively low.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to a first aspect, a method for displaying a conference material in a video conference is provided, including:

Further, when paying attention to the conference material and the first specified user at the same time, a conference participant does not need to shift a line of sight between a display screen that displays the video image of the conference material and a display screen that displays the video image of the first specified user; therefore, efficiency of a video conference is improved, and<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> user experience is also improved.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Another method is: After a video image signal of a first specified user and a video data signal of a conference material that are sent from another conference site are received, synthesizing, into one channel of encoded video signal, the video image signal of the first specified user and the video data signal of the conference material that are received, decoding the synthesized channel of encoded video signal, and displaying the decoded video signal on a same display screen at a local conference site.

Further, when paying attention to a conference material and a first specified user at the same time, a conference participant does not need to shift a line of sight between a display screen that displays a video image of the conference material and a display screen that displays a video image of the first specified user; therefore, efficiency of a video conference is improved, and user experience is also improved.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The following describes in detail exemplary implementation manners of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 2A</figref>, in the embodiments of the present invention, a first detailed procedure for displaying a conference material in a video conference is as follows:</p><heading id="h0006"><b>Embodiment 1</b></heading><p id="p0056" num="0056">Step 20: Determine a position coordinate of a first specified user at a conference site.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In this embodiment of the present invention, there are multiple manners for determining the position coordinate of the first specified user at the conference site. Preferably, the position coordinate of the first specified user at the conference site are determined by means of a sound localization technology; for example, sound signals of the conference site are acquired by using sound signal collectors separately disposed at different positions of the conference site, and according to a collected sound signal having greatest strength, a spatial position of a signal source sending the sound signal is calculated. Alternatively, the position coordinate of the first specified user at the conference site are determined based on a locator. Positioning performed by using a locator is a relatively mature technology in the prior art, and details are not described herein again.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Step 21: Collect a video image signal of the conference site, segment the video image signal of the conference site according to the position coordinate to acquire a video image signal of the first specified user, and acquire a video data signal of a displayed conference material.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In this embodiment of the present invention, there are multiple manners for collecting the video image signal of the conference site and segmenting, according to the position<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> coordinate, the video image signal of the conference site to acquire the video image signal of the first specified user. Preferably, first, matching is performed between the position coordinate and spatial position coordinates of the video image signal to obtain a position of the video image signal of the first specified user in the video image signal of the conference site, and a video image of the first specified user is determined according to a video image signal at the position by means of a facial recognition technology, and then the video image signal of the conference site is segmented at a preset distance from the video image of the first specified user to acquire the video image signal of the first specified user.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">In this embodiment of the present invention, when the video image signal of the first specified user is sent to a display screen at another conference site for displaying, video image signals of multiple second specified users at the same conference site as the first specified user may also be sent to the display screen at the another conference site for displaying. For example, position coordinates of the multiple second specified users at the conference site are first determined; then the video image signal of the conference site is segmented separately according to the determined position coordinates of the multiple second specified users to acquire a video image signal of each second specified user; and finally, the video image signals of the first specified user and the second specified users are synthesized with the video data signal of the conference material into one channel of encoded video signal.

In this solution, the video image signal of the first specified user and the video data signal of the conference material that are acquired are synthesized into one channel of video signal and encoded, and then the encoded video signal is sent to the another conference site and is displayed on the same display screen at the another conference site, thereby achieving an effect of displaying a video image of the first specified user and a video image of the conference material on a same display screen at a same conference site. Because only one display screen is required to display the conference material and the first specified user at the same time, problems that a videoconferencing system cannot be moved easily and has relatively high costs and relatively poor flexibility are effectively avoided. Further, when paying attention to the conference material and the first specified user at the same time, a conference participant does not need to shift a line of sight between a display screen that displays the video image of the conference material and a display screen that displays the video image of the first specified user; therefore, efficiency of a video conference is improved, and user experience is also improved. Another method is: After a video image signal of a first specified user and a video data signal of a conference material that are sent from another conference site are received, synthesizing, into one channel of encoded video signal, the video image signal of the first specified user and the video data signal of the conference material that are received, decoding the synthesized channel of encoded video signal, and displaying the decoded video signal on a same display screen at a local conference site. In this solution, at a conference site, the video image signal of the first specified user and the video data signal of the conference material that are received are synthesized into one channel of video signal and encoded, and the encoded video signal is displayed on the same display screen at the local conference site, thereby achieving an effect of displaying a video image of the first specified user and a video image of the conference material on a same display screen at a same conference site. Because only one display screen is required to display the conference material and the first specified user at the same time, that is, the conference material and the first specified user do not need to be displayed separately on two display screens, problems that a videoconferencing<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> system cannot be moved easily and has relatively high costs and relatively poor flexibility due to many screens are effectively avoided. Further, when paying attention to the conference material and the first specified user at the same time, a conference participant does not need to shift a line of sight between a display screen that displays the video image of the conference material and a display screen that displays the video image of the first specified user; therefore, efficiency of a video conference is improved, and user experience is also improved. Still another method is: Obtaining one channel of encoded video signal into which a video image signal of a first specified user and a video data signal of a conference material are synthesized; decoding the obtained synthesized channel of encoded video signal, and virtually segmenting a display screen at a local conference site into a preset quantity of display subscreens; and displaying a video image, which is obtained through decoding, of the conference material on at least one display subscreen obtained through segmentation, and displaying a video image, which is obtained through decoding, of the first specified user on another at least one display subscreen obtained through segmentation. In this solution, at a conference site, after the channel of encoded video signal into which the video image signal of the first specified user and the video data signal of the conference material are synthesized is obtained, a display screen at the local conference site is virtually segmented into a preset quantity of display subscreens, the video image, which is obtained through decoding, of the conference material is displayed on at least one display subscreen obtained through segmentation, and the video image, which is obtained through decoding, of the first specified user is displayed on another at least one display subscreen obtained through segmentation, thereby achieving an effect of displaying a video image of the first specified user and a video image of the conference material on a same display screen at a same conference site. Because the conference material and the first specified user are displayed on different display subscreens of only one display screen, that is, the conference material and the first specified user do not need to be displayed separately on two display screens, problems that a videoconferencing system cannot be moved easily and has relatively high costs and relatively poor flexibility due to many screens are effectively avoided. Further, when paying attention to the conference material and the first specified user at the same time, a conference participant does not need to shift a line of sight between a display screen that displays the video image of the conference material and a display screen that displays the video image of the first specified user; therefore, efficiency of a video conference is improved, and user experience is also improved.</p><p id="p0125" num="0125">The present invention is described with reference to the flowcharts and/or block diagrams of the method, the device (system), and the computer program product according to the<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> embodiments of the present invention.
