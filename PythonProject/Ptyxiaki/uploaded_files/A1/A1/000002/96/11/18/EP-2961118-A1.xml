Particular embodiments relate to the field of wired communication, in particular equalization on the receiver side. More in particular, embodiments of the invention relate to methods, receivers, computer program products, digital data storage media and wired communication systems suited for power line communication.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Power Line Communication (PLC) has enabled convenient networking functions to mains-powered devices without any additional cable infrastructure. Multiple Input multiple output (MIMO) techniques have been used for wireless communication to improve and increase the performance and reliability of the system. Generally speaking, there are two types of MIMO: a diversity technique where the "same" symbols are sent from a transmitter and, a multiplexing technique where different symbols are sent from the transmitters. Spatial multiplexing schemes are very attractive due to much higher capacity, but they have a problem with complex precoding/decoding and equalization that is used to reduce or avoid interference among different data streams. One example of spatial multiplexing in wireless communications is VBLAST invented by Bell Labs. Two multiplexing MIMO-PLC schemes are known: a scheme with channel state information (CSI) at transmitter wherein singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to compute pre-coding/decoding vectors prior to transmission to orthogonalize the channels between the transmitter and receiver end; and a scheme without CSI at transmitter wherein the transmit symbol vector is estimated by different equalizers such as zero forcing (ZF) or minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizing.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A technique called lattice reduction (LR) is introduced in MIMO linear equalization to improve the performance of the conventional equalizers as ZF or MMSE to achieve a performance closer to the maximum likelihood (ML) detector but with much lower complexity. The idea behind LR is to improve the estimation of the received signal <b><i>y.</i></b> Conventionally, one tries to find the nearest point to <b><i>y</i></b> on the lattice spanned by the channel matrix <b><i>H.</i></b> Based on that idea, when <b><i>H</i></b> is orthogonal, the estimation of linear equalizers is the same as a maximum likelihood detector. However, in general the MIMO channel <b><i>H</i></b> is not orthogonal which results in performance degradation.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">To detect symbols in MIMO-PLC multiplexing schemes (without CSI at the transmitter) linear (ZF or MMSE) and complex lattice equalizers can be used to reduce the interference between different streams. If a complex lattice equalizer is used the computational complexity is high since each time<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the data is transmitted the equalizer (combination of ZF (or MMSE) and Lattice reduction (diagonalization) algorithm) has to be calculated. This may not be practically feasible. Each time data is transmitted, the equalizer processing is initiated which causes an expensive computational complexity.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Embodiments of the invention aim to enhance the practical feasibility of use of equalizers, especially when using lattice reduction, in particular in impulsive noise environments as found in power line communication systems. More in particular, embodiments of the invention aim to realize a suitable equalization for use in a data path at the receiver side of a wired communication while keeping the effort of determining such equalization low.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a method for determining an equalizer for use in a data path at a receiver side of a wired communication during a time period. The method comprising the steps of: determining channel conditions of the wired communication during the time period; determining whether the determined channel conditions have changed compared to channel conditions during a previous time period; making a selection between at least a first and a second determination method to determine an equalizer based on the determined change of the channel conditions; and determining the equalizer based on the selected method.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Embodiments of the invention are based <i>inter alia</i> on the insight that the effort of determining an updated equalizer, especially when using lattice reduction, for use in a data path at the receiver side of a wired communication in view of a change in channel conditions, is preferably balanced with the amount of change in such channel conditions, especially if one takes into account the characteristics of the wired communication, such as in power line communications.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to a an embodiment the selecting comprises: selecting the first determination method if the change of the channel conditions compared with the previous time period is below a first threshold; and selecting the second determination method if the change is above the first threshold. The determining of the equalizer comprises selecting an equalizer from one or more stored equalizers determined previously, if the first method is selected; and computing an equalizer based on the determined channel conditions, if the second method is selected.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to a preferred embodiment, if the second determination method is selected, the method further comprises selecting a first computation method, if the change of the channel conditions compared with this previous time period is below a second threshold, and selecting a second<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> equalizer computation method, if the change of the channel conditions is above the second threshold. The second computation method comprises computing a channel estimate based on a received signal, and performing a lattice reduction algorithm on said channel estimate; and the first computation method comprises computing a channel estimate based on a received signal without performing a lattice reduction algorithm. This embodiment is based on the insight that, even when the change of the channel conditions require a determining of a new equalizer, in many circumstances, especially for the wired communication considered, only a partial re-computing is necessary to obtain a good equalizer, which again contributes to the aim of the invention as described above.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to a preferred embodiment computing said channel estimate comprises performing any one of more of the following computations: performing a FFT, performing clipping, performing matrix diagonalization. Embodiments of the invention are based <i>inter alia</i> on the insight that especially for environments with unpredictable power line impulsive noise environment, like power line communication, prior to equalization and lattice diagonalization, the impulsive noise is preferably at least partially removed.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In an exemplary embodiment the two functions of equalizer processing and determining the MIMO channel are differently designed. In an embodiment recalculation of the entire transformation matrix (and equalizer) is avoided when possible.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to a preferred embodiment the determining of the equalizer is performed by obtaining one or more stored equalizer determined during a previous time period, if the change of the channel conditions compared with the corresponding previous time period is below a first threshold; or by computing at least partially the equalizer based on the determined channel conditions, if the change of the channel conditions compared with the corresponding previous time period is above a first threshold. According to a further developed embodiment if the change of the channel conditions compared with this previous time period is below a second threshold the equalizer is partially computed based on the determined channel conditions or otherwise entirely computed based on the determined channel conditions.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a method for determining data from signals received at the receiver of a wired communication, comprising the steps of: determining an equalizer in accordance with the first aspect of the invention; and use of the determined equalizer on the received signals.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to a further developed embodiment the equalizer is used without further descrambling the equalized received signals.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to a further developed embodiment the equalizer is used with further descrambling the equalized received signals.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a computer program product comprising computer-executable instructions for performing the method of the first or second aspect of the invention when the program is run on a computer.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a digital data storage medium encoding a machine-executable program of instructions to perform any one of the steps of the method of any one of the first or second aspect of the invention.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a receiver for wired communication comprising a processing engine for executing any of the computations of any one of the steps of the method of the first or second aspect of the invention.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to an aspect of the invention there is provided a receiver for use in a data path at a receiver side of a wired communication.

In a further embodiment thereof this approach is used in multiplexing multi-antenna PLC without knowledge of CSI at the transmitter.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The input to the linear equalizer is a pre-processed MIMO channel matrix by lattice reduction to reduce the impact of non-diagonal elements prior to the equalization (the channel updates will be necessary only during the pilot mode which is independent of the data mode). The iterative algorithm is considered to update the lattice transform matrix in order to allow efficient tracking of the channel variations, but only when significant channel variations occur, contrary to state of the art methods where, if the channel changes are not significant, also the entire transformation matrix (and equalizer) needs to be re-calculated.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In an embodiment of the invention linear ZF or MMSE equalizing is used in combination with pre-processing during the channel estimation (CE) mode, enabling determining whether the channel variations require computation of a new equalizer or not, and if so, whether this should be a complete recomputation or a partial one. This embodiment shows to be efficient when lattice reduction is to reduce the impact of non-diagonal elements prior to the equalization</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a generic receiver in which a method for determining an equalizer 330 is used, for use in a data path at the receiver side of a wired communication during a time period. The method comprises determining channel conditions 400 of the wired communication during the time period. In a second step the equalizer is determined with a method selected by using the change of the channel conditions 400 compared with a previous time period. The channel conditions 400 are used as input for the method. By either using the channel conditions 400 or any intermediate result obtained while performing steps toward determining the related equalizer 330, it can be decided to either continue the method of determining the related equalizer, or to use the equalizer as present in the equalizer block 330 or to obtain another equalizer stored in storage means 310. A comparator block 320 is configured to provide a signal 430 to stop equalizer determination 300, and a signal 440 to control a switch 340 in order to use the right equalizer, said signals 430, 440 being determined in function of the change of the channel conditions between the current time period and a previous time period.

Now each time the data is transmitted, the equalizer is using the same diagonalized MIMO channel matrix (as long as it does not change). In a straightforward approach each time the value of H (and consequently <b><i>H̃</i>)</b> changes, the lattice reduction algorithm is initiated (on a per block basis prior to equalization). In accordance with embodiments of the invention however, and especially in accordance with the present embodiment, prior to equalization the estimated value of <b>He</b> is compared with the previous (stored) value and if there are changes the switch 170 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is set to the upper position. On the other hand, if there are no changes the switch 170 is in the lower position. Note that in the case of large<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> channel changes (such as in wireless channels) it is preferred to do a re-computation. <b>H</b><sup>-1</sup> is known or stored from a previous channel estimation step. However, if in the present estimation interval, it is detected that there is a difference between current value of <b>H</b> and the previous value of <b>H</b>_<b>pre</b> (that generated the inverse matrix <b>H<sup>-1</sup></b>) an action is taken, since the difference simply represents the fact that some (at least one) entries of <b>H</b> have changed (for example a constant α is added to the ij-th element of <b>H).</b><br/>
Consider that c = e<sub>i</sub> and d = αe<sub>j</sub>, where e<sub>i</sub> and e<sub>j</sub> are the i-th and j-th unit columns. respectively. The matrix cd<sup>T</sup> has α in the ij-th element and zero's elsewhere so that the update <b>H</b> + cd<sup>T</sup> = <b>H</b> + αe<sub>i</sub>e<sup>T</sup><sub>j</sub>. The update is done as follows: (<b>H</b>+cd<i><sup>T</sup></i>)<sup>-1</sup> = <b>H</b><sup><b>-</b>1</sup>-<b>H</b><sup>-1</sup><b>c</b>(<b>I</b>+d<i><sup>T</sup></i><b>H</b><sup>-1</sup>c)<sup>-1</sup>d<i><sup>T</sup></i><b>H</b><sup>-1</sup>, where <b>H</b> is invertible (which is the case in PLC channels). This produces a simple update algorithm given by <b>H</b><sup>-1</sup>-α[<b>H</b><sup>-1</sup>]<sub>*i</sub>[<b>H</b><sup>-1</sup>]<sub>j</sub>*/{1+ α[<b>H</b><sup>-1</sup>]<sub>ji</sub>}. This shows how <b>H</b><sup>-1</sup> changes when <b>H</b> is changed, and it provides a useful algorithm for updating <b>H</b><sup>-1</sup>.<br/>
Depending on the channel estimation method (time or frequency domain) the channel matrix diagonalization through lattice reduction can be done in two ways: in the time domain - after the clipping 120 of the impulsive noise; and in the frequency domain - after the FFT 150 of <i><b>H<sub>e</sub></b>.</i> In both cases the calculated unimodular matrix <b><i>T</i></b> will have the same dimension due to the fact that the number of columns of the channel is not affected during the process, while the time domain scenario will have a smaller number of complex multiplications due to reduced channel matrix size.</li><li><b>Step 5:</b> Detection of signal is done by calculating the estimate of <b>s</b> as <b><i>ŝ</i></b> = <b>T <i>ŷ</i></b> = <b>s</b> + <b>H</b><sup>-1</sup>(<b>N</b> + <b>I</b>). The bit error rate (BER) performance improvement is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, where the performance with an embodiment of the proposed method is very close to the best achievable performance with a maximum likelihood (ML) detector.</li></ul></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Generally speaking the above particular embodiment illustrates the various aspects of the invention (which can be combined), such as (1) comparing the present channel matrix with a previous channel matric, and based on such comparison determining the course of action, (2) using of a previous equalizer or any other previously determined equalizer, (3) recomputing the equalizer and even determining the scope of such recomputation based on the comparison in that an entire or partial recalculation is performed.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> illustrates schematically a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of an equalizer determination system 20 (bottom part of <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>) as applied in a data path 10 on a receiver part 30 (top right part of <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>).
