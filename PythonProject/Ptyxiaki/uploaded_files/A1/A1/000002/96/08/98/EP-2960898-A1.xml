The PLC 3 is a control device which controls a target system to be controlled. The target system is made up of various devices arranged in a manufacturing line or the like (an output device such as a motor, and an input device such as a sensor). The PLC 3 is a control device which controls the target system in accordance with a logic program that defines an operation of the target system.

Note that images illustrated in the drawings below are illustrative only. The invention in accordance with the present embodiment is neither limited to the images nor to operation procedures illustrated in the drawings.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Upon receipt of an instruction operation, entered via the input device 10, of starting preparation of an image (creation of an image) which the programmable display device 2 displays, the<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> data preparation section 20 of the PC 1 controls the monitor 11 to display a GUI which accepts an operation related to the creation of an image. Note that the GUI is, hereinafter, referred to as an "image creation window."</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In accordance with a user's instruction operation to the image creation window, the PC 1 makes a determination of a size of a background image, cell setting, and component setting (component arrangement and address definition). The following description will explain on the premise that (i) the determination of the size of the background image, (ii) the cell setting, and (ii) the component setting are carried out in this order. Note, however, that the order in which these processes are carried out is not limited to a specific one. For example, it is possible to carry out the cell setting again after the component setting is carried out. Alternatively, it is possible to alter the size of the background image after the component setting and the cell setting are carried out. Note that the determination of the size of the background image, the cell setting, and the component setting can be repeatedly carried out.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> illustrates an example of an image<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> displayed in a case where the data preparation section 20 determines a size of a background image and the cell setting section 21 carries out the cell setting.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The data preparation section 20 determines a size of a background image 150 in accordance with a user's instruction operation. Specifically, in a case where a user selects a new creation icon 110 displayed on a side menu, the data preparation section 20 controls an image creation window 100 to display the background image 150. In this case, the data preparation section 20 can cause the user to enter or select a size of the background image (e.g., the number of pixels in each of a horizontal direction and a vertical direction).</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In a case where a user selects a cell setting icon 120 displayed on the side menu in a state where the background image 150 is being displayed on the image creation window 100, the cell setting section 21 controls the monitor 11 to display a cell setting window 200 on the image creation window 100. The cell setting window 200 is a sub-window via which a user can set values of various types of data related to the cell setting. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the number of rows of cells, a height of each<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> row, the number of columns of the cells, and a width of each column are displayed on the cell setting window 200 so that the user can set them. According to the example in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, all the rows have identical heights whereas all the columns have identical widths. Note, however, that a height of each row and a width of each column can be set for each row and each column, respectively.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In a case where a user defines, via the cell setting window 200, the number of rows of cells, a height of each row, the number of columns of the cells, a width of each column of the cell, the entire background image 150 displayed on the image creation window 100 is divided into cells in accordance with the number of rows of cells, the height of each row, the number of columns of the cells, the width of each column of the cell thus defined (see a part indicated by a dotted line in the background image 150). Note that, in a case where the cell setting section 21 starts the definition of the cell setting (in a case where the cell setting icon 120 is selected by the user), it is possible that the cell setting section 21 automatically carries out a cell setting as an initial setting in accordance with a size of the background image or the like and then<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> controls the initial setting to be displayed on the cell setting window 200 and the background image 150.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The data preparation section 20 then carries out component setting (a component arrangement and address definition) in accordance with a user's instruction operation. <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a view specifically illustrating an example in a case where the component setting section 22 carries out the component setting. (a) of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> illustrates an example of an image displayed in a case where the component arrangement is carried out. (b) of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> illustrates an example of an image in a case where the address definition is carried out with respect to a component which has been arranged.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In a case where a user selects a component setting icon 130 displayed on the side menu, the component setting section 22 of the data preparation section 20 controls the monitor 11 to display a component selection window 300 on the image creation window 100 (see (a) of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>).</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The component selection window 300 is a sub-window via which a user selects a type of a component (a component image) to be arranged in a cell in the background image 150. For example, a<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> thumbnail of a component image that is stored in the storage section 30, a name of the component image, and the like are displayed on the component selection window 300. The component setting section 22 causes a user to select one of the types of components displayed on the component selection window 300. The component setting section 22 then arranges the type of the component thus selected, which has been selected by the user by an operation of drag and drop or the like, in a cell specified by the pointing device in the background image 150. Note here that, as discussed in the description of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the entire background image 150 which has been subjected to the definition of the cell setting is divided into cells of which the number of rows and the number of columns have been defined. The component setting section 22 first determines in which cell in the background image 150 a component image of the component thus selected has been arranged. In doing so, the component setting section 22 determines that a cell including a point specified by a user's operation is the cell in which the component image is to be arranged. Examples of the point specified by the user's operation encompass a position where the user has<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> dropped the component image (a point specified by the pointing device when the user has dropped the component image). That is, the user is sure to arrange each component image in a corresponding one of the cells.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In a case where the cell in which the component is to be arranged is determined, the component setting section 22 associates the component thus arranged with a cell number of the cell (a row number and a column number of the cell) in which the component image has been arranged. For example, provided that a type of component "button" in the component selection window 300 is selected and the type of component thus selected is then arranged in a cell specified by a first row and a first column, the component setting section 22 carries out the following processing. That is, the component setting section 22 (i) generates a type of component "button" (generates new component setting data for the component), (ii) associates information specifying the component with a cell number (row number 1, column number 1), and then (iii) controls the monitor 61 to display an image of the component in the cell specified by the first row and the first column. In this case, the component<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> setting section 22 defines a display position and a display size of the component image in the cell so that the component image is displayed within the cell specified by the first row and the first column. Accordingly, the component image is displayed, within the cell, in the display position thus defined and with the display size thus defined. Specifically, the component setting section 22 defines an arrangement position of the component image in accordance with a size (a height and a width) of the cell in which the component image is to be arranged so that the component image is arranged in a center of the cell in which the component image is to be arranged. The component setting section 22 (i) defines a size of the component image in accordance with a size of the cell in which the component image is to be arranged so that the component image is displayed within the cell in which the component image is to be arranged and then (ii) displays the component image.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Note that, in accordance with a user's operation, the component setting section 22 can rearrange, in another cell, a component which has been arranged in a cell. In this case, the component setting section 22 alters an association of the<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> component with a cell number so that the component is associated with a cell number of the another cell in which the component image is to be rearranged. Note that the component setting section 22 can alter a color, a shape, a display size, and the like of an arranged component in accordance with a user's input operation. The component setting section 22 can set a label such as text and/or a symbol on the component in accordance with the user's input operation.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The component setting section 22 further carries out address definition with respect to an arranged component. In a case where a user selects a component A3 in a state where components A1, A2, and A3 are arranged, the component setting section 22 controls an address definition window 400 regarding the component A3 to be displayed on the image creation window 100 (see an example illustrated in (b) of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>).</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The address definition window 400 is a sub-window for defining an address to which is to be referred in a case where a selected component (the component A3 in the example in (b) of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>) is displayed or in a case where the selected component thus displayed is altered. For example, (i) a<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> component number of the selected component and (ii) an entry field for entering an address to which the selected component refers are displayed on the address definition window 400. The component setting section 22 defines, as an address of the selected component, an address that a user has entered via the entry field. According to the example illustrated in (b) of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, a component number of the component A3 is "0009" and an address to which the component A3 refers is "120A0020."</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The component setting section 22 finally controls the storage section 30 to store therein, as component setting data, a result of the component arrangement and the address definition as described above. The following description will discuss in detail a data structure of the component setting data with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a view illustrating a data structure of the component setting data.

There are provided a plurality of columns, i.e., (i) a "component number" column storing component numbers each of which uniquely indicates a corresponding component, (ii) a "component image" column indicating information<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> specifying an image of each component, (iii) a "size" column indicating each display size of a corresponding component image, (iv) a "row" column indicating each row number of a cell in which a corresponding component is arranged, (v) a "column" column indicating each column number of a cell in which a corresponding component is arranged, and (vi) an "address" column indicating each address to which a corresponding component refers. The component setting data has a data structure in which information in the "component number" column is associated with each of information in other columns.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In a case where (i) a type of component is selected via the component selection window 300 illustrated in (a) of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> and (ii) such a type of component is arranged in a cell in the background image 150, the component setting section 22 creates new component setting data (creates a new record) for the component and then assigns new component numbers in an order in which components are arranged in the respective cells. The component setting section 22 then associates, with the component number, (i) information specifying a component image which has been arranged, (ii) a<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> display size of the component image which has been defined in accordance with a size of a cell in which the component image is to be arranged, and (iii) a row number and a column number of the cell in which the component image is to be arranged. In a case where a reference address is entered via the address definition window 400 illustrated in (b) of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the component setting section 22 associates information indicative of the reference address with the component number.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Note that the information in the "address" column is not essential to the component setting data. Specifically, in a case where a component image is an image of a component, such as a text box, which always displays given text, a given symbol, or the like, component setting data of such a component does not need to have any information in the "address" column.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">As has been described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004">Figs. 2 through 4</figref>, the PC 1 causes a user to make a determination of a size of a background image, a cell setting, a component arrangement, and an address definition, so as to prepare cell setting data and component setting data which are related to image display to be carried out by the programmable<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> display device 2. In addition, in a case where a cell in which a component image is to be arranged is determined, the PC 1 can automatically defines a position and a size of the component image has been arranged so that the component image is displayed within the cell in which the component image has been arranged.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">That is, the PC 1 automatically carries out precise position setting and size definition of a component image during creation of an image to be displayed by the programmable display device 2, so as to facilitate the creation of an image.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Note that, in a case where the cell setting section 21 carries out the component setting and then carries out the cell setting again (in a case where the cell setting section 21 alters (redefines) the cell setting), the cell setting section 21 notifies the component setting section 22 of (i) the number of rows, (ii) a height of each row, (iii) the number of columns, and (iv) a width of each column each of which has been subjected to a corresponding alteration. Upon receipt of such a notification, the component setting section 22 alters an arrangement position or a display size of the component image in accordance with the cell setting thus altered. For<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> example, in a case where the cell setting section 21 alters a height of a row or a width of a column of a cell (i.e., a size of a cell) in which a component image is arranged, the component setting section 22 magnifies (or reduces) a size of the component image so that the component image is displayed within the cell which has been subjected to the alteration.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">For example, in a case where the number of rows or the number of columns are altered while a component is arranged in a cell, (i) a position of the cell with which the component image is associated (a position of the cell in the background image 150) and (ii) a size of the cell are to be altered. In this case, the component setting section 22 alters a position and a size of the component image in accordance with an altered position and an altered size of the cell.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">This allows the PC 1 to automatically alter an arrangement position and a size of the component image as appropriate in accordance with an alteration in cell setting which alteration is made by a user. In other words, in a case where a user alters the cell setting, the user does not need to carry out a precise position adjustment of and/or a size adjustment of the component image. Accordingly,<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> the PC 1 facilitates creation of an image.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Moreover, the PC 1 can cause, in a case where a component arrangement is altered, a user to select, as a target to be moved, not a component but a cell itself so that the cell thus selected is moved together with a component image arranged in the cell.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Specifically, in a case where (i) a specific cell is selected in the cell setting and (ii) a given operation is conducted for moving the cell thus selected to a position in which another cell exists (e.g., an operation is conducted for dragging and dropping the cell thus selected outside a region of the cell, etc.), the cell setting section 21 alters a cell number of the cell thus selected (a target cell to be moved) to a cell number indicated by the cell located in a position in which the cell selected has been dropped. Accordingly, a position of the target cell which has been moved is altered to a position in which the cell selected has been dropped. In this case, (i) the cell setting section 21 notifies the component setting section 22 of an alteration in position of the target cell which has been moved (e.g., a cell number of the cell which has not been subjected to an alteration and a cell number of the<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> cell which has been subjected to the alteration) and (ii) the cell setting section 21 alters, in accordance with the alteration in cell number of the target cell which has been moved, a cell number of a cell other than the target cell which has been moved. For example, the cell setting section 21 increments or decrements a row number and a column number of a cell other than the target cell which has been moved so that the cell is inserted in the position in which the target cell which has been moved has been dropped (in the position of a cell in which the cell to be moved has been dropped).</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Upon receipt of such a notification, the component setting section 22 determines whether or not components are arranged in respective of (i) the target cell which has been moved and (ii) the cell whose cell number has been incremented or decremented by a movement of the target cell which has been moved. In a case where it is determined that a component is arranged in at least one of the cells, the component setting section 22 alters component setting data of the component. More specifically, the component setting section 22 alters, to a cell number of each cell which has been subjected to a position alteration, a cell number<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> associated with a component number of the component thus arranged (a cell number of the cell which has not been subjected to the position alteration).</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">With the aforementioned processing, the component which has been arranged in a target cell which has been moved is continuously displayed in the target cell which has been moved even after the position of the target cell which has been moved is altered.

As with the vertical ratio, the control section 70 calculates, for example, a ratio of a horizontal length of the background image indicated by the data file to a horizontal length of the screen of the display panel 61 (a horizontal ratio), so as to determine a display magnification in a horizontal direction.
