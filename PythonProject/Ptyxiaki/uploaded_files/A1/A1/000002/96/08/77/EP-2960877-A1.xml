However, increasingly data recording and tracking requirements are required to assure accuracy of properly dispensing currency denominations from the dispenser.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Moreover, any error rate at all is an unacceptable situation to both the customers receiving currency from the ATM and to the enterprises that service and stock the ATM with the currency. Because, when currency loading errors occur someone is short funds, either the customer or the enterprise that stocks the ATM.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Fraud is also an issue because a service engineer may knowingly or unknowingly stock an ATM with counterfeit currency, such that whoever is eventually caught with the counterfeit currency may incur legal troubles and that individual may find it very difficult to trace back to where the counterfeit currency came from. Even assuming the counterfeit currency can be tracked back to an ATM, proving the ATM dispensed it may be even more problematic with lack of proper record keeping.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Essentially, currency dispensed from an ATM is not adequately tracked, recorded, or monitored. In response, some governments (particularly China with others to follow) are proposing laws and regulations to provide tracking and record keeping of the currency dispensed from ATMs.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The challenge is that the dispensers embedded in the ATM are largely mechanical with minimal processing capabilities.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In various embodiments, a valuable media dispenser and methods for tracking, monitoring, and recording valuable media dispensed from a valuable media dispenser are provided.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to an embodiment, a valuable media dispenser is provided. The valuable media dispenser includes at least one scanner and an image controller configured and adapted to: execute on the dispenser, obtain at least one image of media being dispensed from the dispenser, and extract from<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the at least one image one or more of: a denomination for the media and a serial number for the media.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a dispenser comprising: at least one scanner; and an image controller configured and arranged to: (i) obtain at least one image of media being dispensed from the dispenser; and (ii) extract from the at least one image one or more of: a denomination for the media and a serial number for the media.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The scanner may comprise an imager.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The image controller is optionally further configured and arranged to: (iii) send the image, the denomination, and the serial number to a controller.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The controller may be located within the dispenser or within a machine into which the dispenser is integrated.

It is to be noted that the valuable media dispenser is shown from two sides, with only those components relevant to understanding what has been added and modified to a conventional dispenser for purposes of providing novel tracking, monitoring, and recording of valuable media denominations and valuable media serial numbers imprinted on the valuable media denominations as the valuable media is dispensed from the valuable media dispenser.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As used herein, the phrase "valuable media" refers to media of value, such as currency, coupons, value tickets, and the like.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">For purposes of the discussions that follow with respect to the <figref idrefs="f0001 f0004">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>, "valuable media" is referred to as currency and the "valuable media dispenser" is referred to as "dispenser."</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">It is also noted that also some dimensions and measurements are illustrated with the discussions of the <figref idrefs="f0001 f0004">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>, these dimensions and measurements may be altered without departing from the novel teachings presented herein for tracking, monitoring, and recording currency denominations and currency serial numbers dispensed from the novel dispenser.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The dispenser's pick assembly 105 is depicted in the <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref> with the control panel removed so that various components are visible. The pick assembly 105 includes an integrated image processor 110, a tie bar, a SNR<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">(Single Note Reading) sub assembly 155, and a plurality of belts 130 (other components exists as well but for purposes of understanding the novel changes made to a conventional dispenser these components are discussed with reference to the <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref>).</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The image processor 110 is electrically coupled to image sensors or scanners that reside on both sides of the media feed path (discussed below with reference to the <figref idrefs="f0002 f0004">FIGS. 1B-1D</figref> and residing within the SNR sub assembly 155). The image processor 110 may be part of a control board (or controller) that controls the entire operation of the dispenser. In such embodiments, the controller is responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for (i) sending pick commands to a pick mechanism to pick currency notes from a cassette located within the dispenser, (ii) transporting the picked currency notes along a transport path from the cassette to a dispense port, (iii) altering the transport path to divert to a reject compartment any picked notes that are not deemed suitable for dispensing to a customer, and (iv) collating information about the operation of the dispenser.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The image processor 110 receives images captured by the image scanners (an image of the front of the currency as it passes through the media feed path and before it exits the dispenser and a second image of the back of the currency as it passes through the media feed path and before it exits the dispenser).</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The image processor 110 is also electrically coupled to the host machine that the dispenser is integrated into, such as an ATM (could also be any Self-Service Terminal (SST)). For purposes of the embodiments presented with the <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>, the host machine that has the dispenser integrated therein is an ATM.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The image processor 110 may also extract from the front and back images the currency denomination (for example, $1, $5, $20, $50, $100, etc.) and extracted serial numbers imprinted on the currency. The image processor 110 then communicates the images and/or the extracted denominations and serial numbers to a tracking, monitoring, and recording application (not shown). This tracking, monitoring, and recording application may be implemented on the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> control board (the controller) of the dispenser or on a pc core of the ATM into which the dispenser is integrated.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">This information (full images (front and back for the currency), currency denomination, and serial numbers) is used by the tracking, monitoring, and recording application to note (such as in a database, table, log, file, ledger, etc.) what was dispensed from the dispenser. This information can be useful should an issue of fraud arise and can also be used to demonstrate governmental compliance.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In an embodiment, the image processor 110 may also capture and send a variety of other information with the images, currency denominations, and serial numbers, such as time of day, ATM identifier, calendar day, transaction identifier, agent identifier that stocked the ATM with the currency, and customer identifier associated with the dispensed cash and the transaction.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In an embodiment, the image processor 110 (or a memory on the control board) may include a known list of bad serial numbers known to be counterfeit, such that the image processor 110 can cause the dispenser to move the currency being dispensed to a reject bin and not permit the counterfeit currency to be dispensed to the customer. So, when an extracted serial number matches a serial number in the list, the currency is rerouted to a reject bin within the dispenser. This prevents that currency note from being dispensed to a customer.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In another embodiment, the image processor 110 may keep track of serial numbers that it dispensed since being stocked with currency, such that should a same serial number appear a second time from the same stocked currency, the image processor 110 can send such currency to the reject bin within the dispenser.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The dispenser also includes a tie bar 120 that separates two sets of rollers. This provides added structural support.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The SNR sub assembly 155 (<figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">FIGS. 1B-1C</figref>) is inserted above and separated from the conventional drive belt arrangement of a conventional dispenser. The SNR sub assembly 155 includes the front and back scanners/sensors (discussed below) and is interfaced to the image processor<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 110. The drive belts 130 are shorter than conventional dispensers, which extend all the way to the top edge of pick assembly 105. The upper section of the transport (represented by the shorter belts) is replaced with the SNR sub module 155. The SNR sub module 155 ensures positive and consistent drive of the media past the scanners 150 and 160 to achieve image quality.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 1B</figref> is a diagram depicting an open media path of a SNR sub assembly 155 for the valuable media dispenser of the <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">FIG. 1</figref>, according to an example embodiment.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG 1B</figref> is the SNR sub assembly 155 that is inserted behind the tie bar 120 and above the drive belts 130 of the two-side view of the pick assembly 105 shown in the <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">When the currency is being imaged along the media path, the SNR sub assembly 155 is closed (<figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 1C</figref>) for purposes of obtaining a front and back image of the currency. The image of the SNR sub assembly 155 is opened (<figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 1B</figref>) to illustrate the placement and location of the dual opposing scanners 150 and 160. Moreover, the SNR sub assembly 155 may be opened for cleaning and or to clear currency jams that may occur (via a release handle or latch). When the SNR sub assembly 155 is closed (<figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 1C</figref>) the currency is imaged on both sides as it passes through the SNR sub assembly 155 and its two opposing scanners 150 and then the currency is free to move along the media path or in some cases a reject path. The SNR sub assembly 155 is by default closed (<figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 1C</figref>) for operation and held into place by two opposing magnetics that keep the scanners 150 and 160 in proximity to one another for imaging the front and back of the currency as it moves along the media path (transport path) toward dispensing from the dispenser. There is a gap of 1.8 mm maintained between the two scanners while in the closed and operation position (<figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 1C</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">1D</figref> (showing gap as item 170).</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The bottom half of the SNR sub assembly 155 includes rollers engaged by the drive belts 130 and those rollers engage other rollers 140 (top rollers 140) to drive the currency through the SNR sub assembly 155 along the media path on its way to exiting the dispenser. As the currency passes through the pluggable module it is forced through two opposing scanners or image<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> sensors 150 and 160, while the media path is closed (<figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 1C</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">1D</figref>). The scanners 150 and 160 are activated and images are acquired for the front and back of the currency as it passes through the SNR sub assembly 155 (closed state for the SNR sub assembly 155 shown in the <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 1C</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">1D</figref>). The images (front and back) are communicated to the image processor 110. The image processor 110 collects metadata, serial numbers, and a denomination for the currency and sends that to the ATM application for recordation. As mentioned above, the image processor 110 may also alter the media path, in some embodiments, to send the currency to a reject bin within the dispenser.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 1C</figref> is a diagram depicting a closed media path of a SNR sub assembly 155 for the valuable media dispenser of the <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">FIG. 1</figref>, according to an example embodiment, according to an example embodiment. This arrangement is how the SNR sub assembly 155 is configured during operation of the scanners 150 and 160 (when currency is between the scanners 150 and 160 along the media path) to capture front and back images of the currency, once the images are obtained, the currency continues along the media path to exit the dispenser to a customer or to be rerouted to a reject bin (as discussed above).</p><p id="p0054" num="0054"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 1D</figref> is a diagram depicting a cross section of the media path showing drive rollers, scanners, and media guides for the valuable media dispenser of the <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">FIG. 1</figref>, according to an example embodiment.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 1D</figref> shows the orientation of the SNR sub assembly 155 during operation of the scanners 150 and 160 from a side view.

This can be done by extracting image attributes, which are then compared against one or more thresholds for the obtained attributes. So, the dispenser is not only capable of tracking, monitoring, and recording currency denominations and serial numbers but can also be used as a quality control mechanism for the currency being dispensed from the dispenser.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In an embodiment, the novel dispenser is integrated into a SST.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">In an embodiment, the novel dispenser is integrated into a self-service checkout station.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In an embodiment, the novel dispenser is integrated into a kiosk.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">One now appreciates how a conventional dispenser can be modified to achieve a new and novel dispenser that provides improved fraud detection, quality enforcement, tracking, monitoring, and recording for currency being dispensed by a dispenser integrated into an ATM.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">These and other embodiments are now discussed with reference to the <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006 f0007">FIGS. 2-4</figref>.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram of a method 200 for monitoring, tracking, and recording valuable media when the valuable media is dispensed from a valuable media dispenser, according to an example embodiment.
