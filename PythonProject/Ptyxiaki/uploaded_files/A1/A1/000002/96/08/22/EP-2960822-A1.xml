Currently, there are various different kinds of recognition methods such as fingerprint recognition, iris recognition, facial recognition, palmprint recognition, voiceprint recognition, vein recognition, or brainwave recognition. The method and device for locking a file of the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> present invention use the biological feature recognition technology to realize the function of locking a first designated file, thereby protecting personal privacy of a user.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a flow chart showing a method for locking a file, according to an exemplary embodiment.

Therefore, the current user needs to lock the first designated file such as the picture or the video, to protect personal privacy of the current user.

When the first photographing shutter option 1 is clicked by the user through the touchscreen, the mobile terminal may receive the first photographing instruction input from the current user, and then photograph a picture or a video. Meanwhile, when the first photographing shutter option 1 is clicked by the user through the touchscreen, the mobile terminal may collect fingerprint information of the current user at the same time.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">It is to be explained that, in the implementation shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2a</figref>, receiving the first photographing instruction of the user and collecting the fingerprint information of the user may be performed at the same time, thereby operation steps of the user may be simplified, and user time may be saved.

After the first designated file is locked, the first designated file is in a locked state, and the locked state may include an invisible hidden state, a modification-forbidding state, a deletion-forbidding state or a viewing-forbidding state.
