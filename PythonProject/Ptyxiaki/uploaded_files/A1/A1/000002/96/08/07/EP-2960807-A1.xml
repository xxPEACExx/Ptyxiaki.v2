These approaches may include looking for keywords and "n-grams" (e.g., specific groupings of n-words) at the beginning or end of a sentence, using machine learning classifiers or full parsing to produce a hierarchical tree of the syntactic structure of the sentence, and so forth. While these approaches may be satisfactory under certain circumstances, there remains considerable room for improvement. For example, treating each sentence as a whole may render these approaches error-prone and/or impractical for a wide variety of applications. More particularly, the traditional n-gram approach may be unable to account for either intervening words that are not predefined as part of the n-gram or words located in the middle of the sentence, and the hierarchical tree approach may be computationally expensive, resource heavy and slow. As a result, neither approach may be suitable for real-time and/or low power applications such as, for example, personal assistant (PA) applications running on handheld devices.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">The various advantages of the embodiments will become apparent to one skilled in the art by reading the following specification and appended claims, and by referencing the following drawings, in which:

In the illustrated example, the sentence 10 is separated into a plurality of clauses 12 (12a, 12b) containing words corresponding to various parts of speech (POS) 14. For example, the sentence 10 might be "could she see the stage when she went to the concert". In such a case, "could she see the stage" may be identified as a first clause 12a in the sentence 10 and "when she went to the concert" may be identified as a second clause 12b in the sentence 10. As will be discussed in greater detail, a set of question detection rules 16 (16a-16c) may be applied to each of the clauses 12, wherein if the question detection rules 16 indicate that at least one of the clauses 12 is a question, the sentence 10 may be automatically designated as a question via, for example, a question designation 18. Analyzing the sentence 10 on a clause-by-clause basis may reduce errors as well as computational overhead.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">More particularly, each of the illustrated question detection rules 16 defines an order of the plurality of parts of speech 14, wherein the order permits intervening words that are not predefined. For example, a first question detection rule 16a might specify that when a "wh-word" (e.g., who, whom, what, where, when, why, how) is followed by a modal or auxiliary verb (e.g., can, must, should, would, could), followed by a noun followed by a verb, the entire sentence 10 may be automatically designated as a question. An auxiliary verb may be defined as a word that adds functional or grammatical meaning (e.g., tense, aspect, modality, voice, emphasis) to the clause in which it appears, whereas a modal verb may be defined as a class of auxiliary verbs used to express modality (e.g., possibility, obligation, ability, etc.). Of particular note is that, unlike in a typical n-gram solution, words positioned between the specified parts of speech 14 in the first question detection rule 16a would not prevent a given clause and its corresponding sentence from being identified as a question. Additionally, specifying the parts of speech 14 rather than particular keywords may increase the flexibility of the system and substantially improve accuracy.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Similarly, a second question detection rule 16b could specify that when a modal or auxiliary verb is followed by a noun, followed by a verb, the entire sentence 10 may be<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> automatically designated as a question, wherein intervening words would not prevent such a designation from being made. Thus, such a rule may identify a clause such as "So, may Susan and her boyfriend come with us" as a question (e.g., modal auxiliary "may", followed by noun "Susan", followed by verb "come"). In yet another example, a third question detection rule 16c might specify that when a clause begins with a BE (e.g., "to be") or HAVE (e.g., "to have") word, (e.g., is, have, has) followed by a noun, the entire sentence 10 may be automatically designated as a question, wherein intervening words would not prevent such a designation from being made. Such a rule may therefore identify a clause such as "Is the building the grey one" as a question (e.g., HAVE word "Is", followed by noun "building", with intervening word "the"). Moreover, relevant words such as, for example, the words at the beginning of the second clause 12b, positioned near the middle of sentence 10 are taken into consideration in the illustrated example. As a result, question detection accuracy may be further improved. The linguistic convention of small capitalization (e.g., BE, HAVE) is used herein to indicate lexemes (i.e., the set of all inflections of the word).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> demonstrates that the words of the sentence 10 may be tagged with the parts of speech 14. The parts of speech 14 may in turn be used to identify phrase chunks 20 and the clauses 12. For example, the word "could" is identified as a modal auxiliary part of speech, a verb phrase and part of the first clause 12a, in the illustrated example. The word "when", on the other hand, may be identified as a wh-adverb part of speech, an isolated conjunction and part of the second clause 12b, in the illustrated example.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Turning now to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 3</figref>, a method 22 of training a system to automatically separate sentences into clauses is shown. The method 22 may be implemented as a module or related component in a set of logic instructions stored in a machine- or computer-readable storage medium such as random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), programmable ROM (PROM), firmware, flash memory, etc., in configurable logic such as, for example, programmable logic arrays (PLAs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), in fixed-functionality hardware logic using circuit technology such as, for example, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) or transistor-transistor logic (TTL) technology, or any combination thereof. For example, computer program code to carry out operations shown in method 22 may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as Java, Smalltalk, C++ or the like and conventional procedural programming languages, such as the "C" programming language or similar programming languages.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Illustrated processing block 24 provides for separating a message, speech recognition output, document, etc., into a plurality of sentences. A first path may involve tagging the words of the sentence with the parts of speech at block 26 and using the parts of speech to create noun/verb phrase chunks at block 28. A second path may involve obtaining clause boundaries for the sentences from another natural language processing (NLP) parser or tagged text at block 30. Illustrated block 32 trains a clause identifier to automatically identify clause boundaries based on the parts of speech and noun/verb phrase chunks generated in the first path and the known clause boundaries from the second path. Other approaches such as, for example, "clausifiers", "Brill taggers", and so forth, may be used train the system, depending upon the circumstances.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> shows a method 34 of automatically detecting questions. The method 34 may also be implemented as a module or related component in a set of logic instructions stored in a machine- or computer-readable storage medium such as RAM, ROM, PROM, firmware, flash memory, etc., in configurable logic such as, for example, PLAs, FPGAs, CPLDs, in fixed-functionality hardware logic using circuit technology such as, for example, ASIC, CMOS or TTL technology, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Illustrated processing block 36 uses the parts of speech assigned to the words of a sentence to create noun/verb phrase chunks such as the chunks 20 (<figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>). A determination may be made at block 38 as to whether there are unprocessed clauses in the sentence in question. If so, block 40 may access a log/index of words that match lists of auxiliaries, modals, wh-words, nouns and verbs, wherein a determination may be made at block 42 as to whether the clause includes a wh-word followed by a modal or auxiliary verb followed by a noun followed by a verb (e.g., wh-word→modal or auxiliary→noun→verb). If so, the sentence containing the clause may be automatically designated as a question at block 44.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Otherwise, illustrated block 46 determines whether the clause includes a modal or auxiliary verb followed by a noun followed by a verb (e.g., modal or auxiliary→noun→verb), wherein a positive determination at block 46 enables block 44 to automatically designate the sentence containing the clause as a question. Block 44 may also involve assigning a confidence score to the sentence in order to indicate the level of confidence in the question designation. Additionally, if a question designation is not triggered by block 46, illustrated block 48 determines whether the clause includes a BE or HAVE word followed by a noun. If so, the sentence containing the clause may be automatically designated as a question at block 44. If none of blocks 42, 46 or 48 result in the sentence being designated as a question, the determination at block 38 may be repeated. If it is determined at block 38 that there are no<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> remaining unprocessed clauses, block 39 may designate the sentence as not containing a question and the illustrated method 34 may terminate. Block 39 may also involve assigning a confidence score to the sentence in order to indicate the level of confidence in the non-question designation.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Thus, with continuing reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">4</figref>, applying the method 34 to the sentence 10 would result in the first clause 12a being identified by block 46 as a sentence due to the occurrence of the modal auxiliary verb "could", followed by the pronoun "she", followed by the verb "see".

The logic architecture may generally implement one or more aspects of a method such as, for example, the method 34 (<figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>) of automatically detecting questions.

The clause identifier 56, which may be an off-the-shelf library or a component trained via a method such as, for example, the method 22 (<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 3</figref>), may separate each sentence into a plurality of clauses and return a corresponding list of clauses to the sentence classifier 54.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The illustrated sentence classifier 54 passes each clause to an analyzer 58, which may be configured to apply a set of question detection rules to each of the plurality of clauses.

The analyzer 58 may also return a confidence score for each clause, wherein the confidence score indicates the level of confidence as to whether the clause is a question. Alternatively, the confidence score may be replaced with a binary indication of the presence of question syntax.

sentence into its component clauses and then apply question detection rules to each clause separately. Accordingly, techniques do not require that question syntax be located at the beginning of the sentence. Moreover, techniques do not rely on an inflexible "bag of words" approach that may lead to false positives and/or false negatives. For example, the sentences "If you're going to be late, could you call me before you leave?" and "When will the meeting end?" may both be identified as questions despite the fact that the first sentence does not begin with a question-like structure. Furthermore, the sentence "I don't know what you should do?" may not be identified as a question even though it contains the word "what". Additionally, techniques do not rely on the use of question marks, which are often extraneously included (as in the previous example) or omitted in computer mediated communications such as emails, text messages, IMs, social networking posts, and so forth.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">The automated question detection techniques provide a computationally inexpensive (e.g., "lightweight") solution that may be used in settings such as personal assistant (PA) and/or low power scenarios in which messages are deciphered and prioritized in real-time to determine if the user should be interrupted.
