present invention relates to the field of controlling disseminating of information from a plurality of sources.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Information can be disseminated in a variety of ways. For example, newspapers may be used, signs may be erected along road-sides, mail or e-mail may be sent, or internet streaming may be employed to transmit information to one or more recipients, which may comprise processes or persons. In industrial processes, control information to modify the functioning of an industrial process, such as for example a plastic pellet manufacturing process, may be delivered using electrical leads.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A set of recipients of information may be pre-defined, as in the case of sending email, or the set of recipients may be open, as in the case of radio broadcasts. Electronic delivery of information can be directed to specific recipients or more generically. For example, cellular telephone calls can be switched to a specific mobile telephone number, whereas informational bulletins in computer operating systems may be directed to any user of the operating system.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Electronic communication offers the possibility to deliver information to a large group of persons or processes, wherein it may be preferable to not deliver exactly the same information to all recipients at the same time. For example, when manufacturing plastic pellets, it may be advantageous to, over a time period, deliver the same instructions to a plurality of process units, but in case all units receive identical instructions at exactly the same time, unwanted spikes in electricity usage may be caused.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Similarly, when communicating to people, in case all people receive the same message at the same time, their reactions may overload systems. Also simply delivering a large email simultaneously to thousands of people may overload an email distribution<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> system. Moreover, communication opportunities to all people, or all processes, may not be present at the same time, rather processes may poll a control aggregator, or people may view an information source, at random or pseudo-random times.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus comprising at least one processing core, at least one memory including computer program code, the at least one memory and the computer program code being configured to, with the at least one processing core, cause the apparatus at least to obtain, for each of a plurality of pacing units, a planned number of impressions associated with a current time, define, for each of the plurality of pacing units, a difference between the planned number of impressions associated with the current time and an actual number of impressions associated with the current time, adjust a score of at least one of the plurality of pacing units based at least in part on the difference, and select one of the plurality of pacing units based at least in part on scores of each of the plurality of pacing units.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Various embodiments of the first aspect may comprise at least one feature from the following bulleted list:

EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">By scoring information pacing units based on a difference between a planned delivery schedule and an achieved delivery amount, pacing units that are behind their delivery schedules can be given higher priority, increasing the chances of success in implementing an information dissemination plan. By decreasing scores of pacing units that are ahead of their delivery schedules, opportunities for the pacing units that are behind may be created.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref> illustrates an example system capable of supporting at least some embodiments of the present invention. Control unit 110 may comprise a computer, such as for example a laptop or desktop computer, configured to control, via connection 112, distribution system 120. Connection 112 may comprise a wire-line or an at least in part wireless connection. Connection 112 may traverse, at least in part, at least one communication network. Distribution system 120 may comprise a data aggregator, website, website generator, digital platform, server, gateway or other suitable apparatus or system. Control unit 110 may be controllable, at least in part, via connection 102. Such control may be remote from the physical location of control unit 110. In some embodiments, control unit 110 and distribution system 120 are comprised in the same physical unit. Control unit 110 and/or distribution system 120 may comprise a computing cluster.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Set 130 comprises units 132, 134, 136 and 138. Although four units are illustrated, it is to be understood set 130 may comprise another number of units as well, for<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> example in the range of tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands or even millions of units. Membership in set 130 may be fluid as a unit is understood to be comprised in set 130 in case it requests information from distribution system 120. In other words, any unit that requests information from distribution unit 120 is considered to be comprised in set 130. Units comprised in set 130 may communicate with distribution system 120 via at least one network, which is illustrated as connection 122. In some embodiments, not all units comprised in set 130 need to communicate with distribution system 120 via the same network or networks.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Information distribution system 120 may be configured to provide, for example responsive to requests, content with embedded media units, such that a provided content item may comprise one or more than one embedded media unit. Embedded media units may be associated with pacing units. In general a media unit may comprise, for example, an image or a video clip.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As a first example, set 130 may comprise users that access a web page hosted or controlled by distribution system 120. In this first example, the provided content item is the web page and media units embedded therein comprise images or videos. As a second example, set 130 comprises manufacturing units of a factory, which request instructions from distribution system 120. In this second example, the provided content item comprises a data entity wherein the media units are embedded. Such media units may comprise numerical or text-based process instructions, for example. Process instructions may comprise instructions concerning temperature, flow, ionization percentage or water content, for example. As a third example, set 130 comprises users of a computer program, the program being configured to request information periodically or non-periodically from distribution system 120. In this third example, the provided content item comprises a data entity, such as an XML page, wherein media units comprising program update instructions are embedded. As an example technical effect, in the last example, various versions, such as language versions, of the program may be caused to update in a controlled fashion without overloading an update server infrastructure.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Media units may be associated with pacing units. A pacing unit may comprise, in general, a start time, an end time, a target number of impressions and an association to at least one media unit. The start time may indicate when the pacing unit becomes active, and the end time may indicate, when the pacing unit is meant to cease to<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> be active. The target number of impressions indicates a number of times distribution system 120 is meant to provide a media unit associated with the pacing unit to a unit comprised in set 130. In general, a pacing unit may define a planned campaign to disseminate, between the start time and the end time, the target number of impressions of the at least one associated media unit. An impression may comprise a provision of a media unit associated with the pacing unit. Where a media unit comprises a video clip, an impression may be defined as one of the following: firstly, a provision of the video clip, secondly, a start of playback of the video clip, thirdly, that the video clip is played at least until a threshold, and finally, that the entire video clip is played. Feedback may be required for some definitions of video clip impression to be registered.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Providing a media unit may comprise providing information defining the contents of a media unit, such as providing a digital image, or providing link information that enables retrieval of the media unit.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2A</figref> illustrates an example usage profile. In the figure, time advances from left to right and usage intensity increases from the bottom toward the top. Use fluctuates according to times of day, during the day use is more intensive than during the night. For example, units comprised in set 130 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref> may request information from distribution system 120 in a time-varying way such that an average number of information requests per unit of time is higher during the day and lower during the night. In such a scenario, distribution system 120 has more frequent opportunities to provide media units during daytime.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2B</figref> illustrated an example pacing schedule. The schedule may be designed, or obtained, at least in part based on history data, such as for example the usage profile of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2A</figref>. A pacing unit may be assigned a pacing schedule, wherein it is anticipated that in peak usage times more impressions per unit of time occur than in non-peak usage times. In <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2A</figref>, the cumulative number of impressions increases from bottom toward the top, and one can see from the figure that most of the increase occurs during peak times, when the angle of ascent of the curve is higher than during non-peak times.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2C</figref> illustrates an example difference in implementation of a pacing schedule. The curve underlying <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2C</figref> is the same pacing schedule as that illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2B</figref>. The "x" in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2C</figref> denotes an actual number of impressions, I<sub>act</sub>, of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the pacing unit the schedule of which is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2C</figref>, at the current time, which is indicated on the horizontal axis as T<sub>current</sub>. As can be seen, the actual number of impressions is above the pacing schedule for T<sub>current</sub>, indicating that more impressions have occurred than planned for, in other words the pacing unit is running ahead of its schedule, by a margin, or difference, denoted by "d" in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2C</figref>. To more accurately follow the pacing schedule, a priority, or score, of this pacing unit may be reduced as will be described hereinbelow.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIGURE 3</figref> illustrates an example apparatus capable of supporting at least some embodiments of the present invention.

The horizontal axis, extending from -100% to 100%, represents a difference between an actual number of impressions and a planned number of impressions, as a percentage of the planned number of impressions. Therefore, 100% on this axis represents a case where all planned impressions have been conducted when no time has passed and -100% represents a case where no impressions have been conducted and the entire time has passed. The vertical axis, perpendicular to the horizontal axis, represents a score assigned to the pacing unit.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Examining first the section of the horizontal axis which lies between -100% and 0%, this area corresponds to situations where the actual number of impressions is behind schedule, that is, fewer impressions have been conducted than was planned for the current time. The curve 430 increases from 0% deficit to 100% deficit, which is denoted as -100%. In other words, the more the pacing unit is behind schedule, the higher is the score assigned to it. This has the effect that pacing units that are most behind have the highest score, which causes them to be assigned more resources, which will cause them to catch up with their schedule.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Examining then the section of the horizontal axis which lies between 0% and 100%, this area corresponds to situations where the actual number of impressions is ahead of schedule, that is, more impressions have been conducted than was planned for the current time. This situation is illustrated also in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2C</figref>. The curve 450 decreases from 0% surplus onward, causing a score assigned to the pacing unit to be lower the more the more the pacing unit is ahead of schedule, with the effect that the pacing unit is assigned fewer resources, and consequently the pacing unit may fall back toward the schedule.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The slope angles of curves 430 and 450 need not be the same, indeed in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGURE 4</figref> the slope of curve 450 is steeper than that of curve 430. This arrangement will have the effect that the pacing unit will not be given the opportunity to get very much ahead of schedule, since its assigned score will decline rapidly the further it gets ahead.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The dotted horizontal line 420, below score 0.0, corresponds to an empty content threshold. An empty content threshold may be configured to denote a lowest score that will cause a pacing unit to be given an impression. In case a score of a pacing unit declines below the empty content threshold, that pacing unit will be excluded from impressions. In other words, an empty content item may be provided, or even no content item, rather than a content item providing a media unit associated with a pacing unit with a score that is below the empty content threshold.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Point 410 along the vertical axis denotes a base value for a pacing unit. This reflects a score given to the pacing unit when it is exactly on schedule, meaning that the number of impressions is neither ahead nor behind schedule.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Space 440 indicated along the empty content threshold indicates a maximum overshoot of impressions. This is so since should the number of impressions be ahead of schedule by an amount larger than space 440, the score of the pacing unit would be below the empty content threshold and consequently it would be excluded from impressions. If a pacing unit ends up below the empty content threshold, it will not be given resources, that is impressions, until the schedule advances so that the number of actual impressions is ahead by less than percentage 440, and the score of the pacing unit once more exceeds the empty content threshold. Since a number of planned impressions tends to increase with time in dependence of the schedule, in case no impressions are give to a pacing unit it<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> correspondingly tends to drift toward the left along the horizontal axis. Therefore a pacing unit isn't left permanently with a score below the empty content threshold.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">When configuring the pacing unit, the difference between empty content threshold 420 and base value 410 can assume a central importance in guaranteeing that the target number of impressions is achieved by the end time.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Overall, since the score of a pacing unit declines when it runs ahead of schedule, and increases when it falls behind, the effect of the scoring system illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGURE 4</figref> is that pacing units are maintained more or less at the scheduled rate of impressions. Pacing units that are ahead are assigned fewer impressions, giving more opportunity to pacing units that are behind, these latter pacing units also receiving higher scores than the former ones.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In addition to pacing units assigned scores dynamically along the lines described in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGURE 4</figref>, filler campaigns may be configured that have constant scores. These scores may lie between score zero and the empty content threshold, for example. Filler campaigns, unlike pacing units, may be associated with no particular target impression count.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Priorities of pacing units may be used to configure the slope angles of curves 430 and 450. For example, in case curve 430 is configured to ascend steeply as the pacing unit falls further and further behind, it is rendered less unlikely this pacing unit will fall much behind since its score, and thus impression rate, will rise to overcome any falling behind.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">To select a pacing unit for an impression, control unit 110 or distribution system 120 may determine scores of all active pacing units and select the highest-scoring pacing unit for impression, that is, distribution system 120 would provide at least one content item that comprises a media unit associated with this selected pacing unit. Scoring of pacing units may be performed responsive to each incoming request for information, or alternatively periodically, such as for example every second, every minute or every hour.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In case scoring is performed periodically, the highest-scoring pacing unit may be given all impressions until the next scoring is performed. Alternatively, between periodic scorings, impressions may be allocated in a proportional way between active<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> pacing units, such that the highest-scoring pacing unit is given most impressions and the second-highest scoring pacing unit is given second-most impressions, and so on.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In some embodiments, requests for information are associated with different opportunities for media units, for example, an image size restriction may limit the choice of pacing units to use. In such cases, the pacing unit may be chosen along the lines described above, from among pacing units associated with a suitable media unit. In other words, the set of active pacing units is considered to be the set of active pacing units associated with at least one suitable media unit.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In addition to scores, secondary criteria may be employed when deciding which pacing unit to give an impression to. For example, a pacing unit may be configured so that it may not receive consecutive impressions. As another example, a pacing unit may be configured to only receive impressions at night-time, or only at day-time.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Taking the pacing unit illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGURE 4</figref> as an example, in case the actual number of impressions at the current time is 14.000 and the planned number of impressions is 15.500, the pacing unit is running behind by about 9,7%. The score of this pacing unit would then be the base score, indicated by 410, incremented by an increment indicated by curve 430 at point -9,7% along the horizontal axis. To obtain the increment, 9,7% is multiplied by a positive first constant, the first constant reflecting the slope angle of curve 430. Alternatively, if the number of actual impressions is 15.800, the pacing unit is running ahead by about 1,9%. To obtain its score, the base score indicated by 410 is incremented by an increment, which is in this case negative, obtained by multiplying 1,9% by a negative second constant that reflects the slope angle of curve 450. The skilled person will understand that variations along the same idea are easy to come by, for example by using positive constants with the sign of the percentage varying in dependence of whether the pacing unit is ahead or behind, or by using absolute numbers of impressions instead of percentages. In general a difference between planned and actual impression numbers may be expressed in terms of absolute numbers or percentages without departing from the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIGURE 5</figref> is a flow chart illustrating an example method in accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention.

In detail, below 0%, that is, when the pacing units are behind their schedule, the score of pacing unit 620 increases slower than that of pacing unit 630. On the other hand, when the pacing units are ahead of their schedule, that is above 0% on the horizontal axis, the score of pacing unit 620 declines faster than that of pacing unit 630. The base score of pacing unit 630 is higher than the base score of pacing unit 620, which can be seen from the fact that pacing unit 630 is higher on the vertical axis at 0%, that is, when the pacing units are exactly on schedule in delivering impressions.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In general there is provided an apparatus, such as for example a control unit, distribution system or a control device for inclusion in a control unit or distribution system, to control the functioning thereof.
