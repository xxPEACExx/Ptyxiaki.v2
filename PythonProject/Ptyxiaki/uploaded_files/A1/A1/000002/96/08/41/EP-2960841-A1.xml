Automated machines commonly control the handling of components, sub-components, and raw materials, perform fabrication processes, testing, and product handling, packaging, and shipping. Industrial automation enables precise control of industrial processes, achievement of smaller tolerances and better quality products, higher production outputs, and increased worker safety and productivity.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Industrial automation installations comprise multiple computerized devices that control industrial machines and industrial processes. The components of an industrial automation installation must work together in a coordinated fashion, performing operations such as exchanging data, controlling the timing and scheduling of processes, providing information to operators or technicians, and receiving operator inputs.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Because of the large number of system variables that must be monitored and controlled, industrial automation systems often generate vast amounts of data. In addition to production statistics, data relating to machine health, alarm status, operator feedback, electrical or mechanical load, and the like are often monitored. The data is generated by the many industrial devices that can make up a given automation system, including industrial controllers and associated I/O, telemetry devices, motion control devices, valves, conveyors, raw material handling systems, product handling systems, visualization applications, traceability systems, and the like. Moreover, such industrial facilities can operate on a twenty-four hour basis, wherein automation systems can generate a vast amount of data.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In addition, industrial automation monitoring has evolved from monitoring devices in an industrial plant to include monitoring devices at remote sites, such as mobile or temporary facilities. Industrial automation monitoring can be used for drilling, mining, and other resource extraction operations. Industrial automation monitoring can be used in monitoring water treatment facilities or in monitoring of environmental conditions. Industrial automation monitoring can be used to monitor the health and operation of industrial automation devices including field equipment.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Industrial automation devices can generate industrial automation data at multiple, geographically disparate locations.

In addition, the cloud automation facility 160 stores and provides configuration information to the industrial automation node 120. The cloud automation facility 160 includes a configuration library 163 that stores configuration information for one or more industrial automation nodes 120. The configuration library 163 is used to configure industrial automation nodes 120. The configuration library 163 can be used to configure a large variety of industrial automation devices 125.

However, if the gateway 140 determines that communications are not possible, or if the gateway 140 determines that it is not time for an industrial automation data upload, the gateway 140 can transfer bulk industrial automation data to the cloud 180. In such a situation, the gateway 140 enters a store-and-forward mode, wherein the industrial automation node 120 accumulates industrial automation data and transfers the accumulated industrial automation data to the cloud 180 at predetermined time periods.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The gateway 140 in some examples includes multiple communication ports.

The data plug-ins comprises plug-ins for receiving industrial automation data from the one or more industrial automation devices 125. The gateway 140 may acquire a data plug-in or plug-ins for each industrial automation device 125.

The data conditioner 133 performs data conditioning operations on the industrial automation data, such as data aggregation, data filtering, data event detection, and/or data transformation, for example. The data conditioner 133 then transfers the conditioned industrial automation data to the buffer 136. The buffer 136 can subsequently transfer the industrial automation data to either the local storage 137 or the connection manager 132, depending on whether the gateway 140 is in a store-and-forward mode. The connection manager 132 determines if the gateway 140 is or is not in a store-and-forward mode. The gateway 140 can be in a store-and-forward mode if communication is currently not possible with the cloud 180, if the gateway 140 is programmed to only transfer data to the cloud 180 at predetermined time periods, or depending on other or additional conditions or rules.

If the gateway 140 is not in a store-and-forward mode, the connection manager 132 either obtains industrial automation data from the buffer 136 or from the local storage 137 via the buffer 136.
