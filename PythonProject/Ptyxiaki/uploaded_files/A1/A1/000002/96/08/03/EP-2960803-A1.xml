In an epidemic method, when a communication terminal in a network detects another communication terminal, the communication terminal and the other communication terminal exchange a holding list (also referred to as "summary vector") that lists information about data (content) held by each terminal, so that the communication terminal acquires the content of the holding list held in another communication terminal. The communication terminal checks for data that the own terminal does not hold, based on the received holding list, and attempts to acquire the data. For example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 15</figref>, a terminal T1 and a terminal T2 that have approached each other exchange holding lists with each other, and the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> terminal T2 checks for difference data by comparing the holding list of the own terminal and the holding list of the terminal T1 to determine whether there are any data that the own terminal does not hold. In the example illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 15</figref>, the terminal T2 does not hold data B, therefore transmits an acquisition request for the data B to the terminal T1, and acquires the data B. All terminals within the network match information held in each terminal by repeating the operation.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Further, in order to solve a problem that frequent transmission of holding lists in information sharing by the epidemic method mentioned above leads to heavy bandwidth load, suppression of transmission of duplicating holding lists has been proposed as a second related technology related to the present invention (refer to, for example, PTL 1). More specifically, in the second related technology, a plurality of communication terminals are wirelessly connected to and communicating with one another without using an access point, so that data are shared between the plurality of communication terminals. Each communication terminal in the second related technology includes an internal deduction unit, a duplication determination unit, and an information exchange unit. The internal deduction unit deduces data that are presently held by another communication terminal by using a reception history of a holding list received from the other communication terminal. The duplication determination unit determines whether or not the data presently held by another communication terminal which has been deduced by the internal deduction unit match the data held by the own terminal. In case of the duplication determination unit determines that the data do not match, the information exchange unit transmits a holding list that contains the data held by the own terminal.</p><heading id="h0003">[Citation List]</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><heading id="h0004">[Patent Literature]</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">[PTL 1] <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2011071045A"><text>WO2011/071045</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">[Non Patent Literature]</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">[NPL 1]A. <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Vahdat, D.

Therefore, there is no unnecessary operation that data already held by another communication terminal or data not needed by the own communication terminal are transmitted or received between communication terminals. However, there is a problem that frequent transmission of holding lists causes heavier bandwidth load on a wireless link and impedes other communications. The second related technology is a technology that solves such a problem. However, since the second related technology is based on suppressing transmission of duplicating holding lists, it is difficult to suppress transmission of holding lists in a situation where there is no duplication between holding lists held by a plurality of communication terminals.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a data sharing system that solves the above-mentioned problem, in other words, the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> problem that it is difficult to suppress increase in bandwidth load on a wireless link caused by frequent transmission of holding lists.</p><heading id="h0008">[Solution to Problem]</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">A data sharing system according to a first aspect of the present invention is a data sharing system in which data are shared between a plurality of communication terminals capable of wirelessly transmitting and receiving a communication message to and from one another, wherein each of the communication terminals includes: a communication unit that transmits and receives the communication message to and from another of the communication terminals;
