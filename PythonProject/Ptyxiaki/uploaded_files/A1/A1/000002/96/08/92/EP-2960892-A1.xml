Here, the "luminance of the one-frame image" means luminance that represents the image. Specifically, for example, average luminance of the one-frame image or the like corresponds to the "luminance of the one-frame image".</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> If the luminance of the one-frame image is reduced, as described in the aforementioned Background Art, the output of the light source is reduced according to the reduction width in many cases. Then, due to the light output characteristic of the light source, the flickering possibly occurs in a relatively low luminance region in the drawn image.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In the embodiment, however, as described above, the light source is controlled by the controlling device to change the irradiation period of the light beam with respect to the pixel drawing period, on the basis of the luminance of the one-frame image to be displayed. Specifically, for example, if the luminance of the one-frame image is halved, the controlling device controls the light source to change the irradiation period of the light beam to the pixel drawing period to half. Then, in view of one pixel drawing period, a light amount of the light beam irradiated is halved. It is thus possible to halve the luminance of the one-frame image without reducing the light amount of the light beam.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In addition, since the irradiation period may be changed, there is no need to separately install a special element. Therefore, according to the image display apparatus in the embodiment, the image flickering can be relatively easily suppressed.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">If the irradiation period of the light beam with respect to the pixel drawing period is changed in order to change the luminance of the one-frame image, it is desirable to make different starting times of the irradiation period in the pixel drawing period, in two continuous frame periods. Such a configuration makes it possible to suppress uneven luminance in one pixel, which is extremely useful in<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> practice.</p><heading id="h0011">&lt;Second Embodiment&gt;</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">An image display apparatus according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be explained.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the image display apparatus according to the second embodiment, a controlling device, which is provided with, for example, a memory, a processor, and the like, controls the light source to make an irradiation period of the light beam to a pixel drawing period, which is a period for drawing one of a plurality of pixel data corresponding to the image to be displayed, 1/n of the pixel drawing period, if the one pixel data has 1/n (wherein n is a positive real number) of maximum luminance, wherein n is a positive real number. Here, the "one pixel data" means luminance in the corresponding pixel drawing period, i.e. luminance associated with the pixel data.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The aforementioned Background Art describes the technical problems that can occur if the luminance of the one-frame image is reduced. The same technical problem caused by the light output characteristic of the light source possibly occurs even when pixels with relatively low luminance are drawn, which has been found from the study of the present inventors.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Thus, in the embodiment, as described above, the light source is controlled by the controlling device to make the irradiation period of the light beam to the pixel drawing period for drawing the one pixel data 1/n of the pixel drawing period, if the luminance associated with the one pixel data is 1/n of the maximum luminance. Specifically, for example, if the luminance associated with the pixel data is half the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> maximum luminance, the controlling device controls the light source to make the irradiation period of the light beam to the pixel drawing period half. Then, in view of one pixel drawing period, the light amount of the light beam irradiated is halved. It is thus possible to set the luminance of the pixel to half the maximum luminance without reducing the light amount of the light beam.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Therefore, according to the image display apparatus in the embodiment, the image flickering caused by the drawing of the pixels with relatively low luminance can be relatively easily suppressed.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">By the way, the light amount of the light beam outputted from the light source is determined according to each of the pixel data corresponding to the image to be displayed, in many cases. Thus, if the luminance associated with one pixel data is 1/n of the maximum luminance, the controlling device controls the light source to change the irradiation period of the light beam to the pixel drawing period associated with the one pixel data to 1/n, and to irradiate the light beam with the light amount that is n times the light amount of the light beam corresponding to the luminance associated with the one pixel data.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">More specifically, for example, the controlling device may multiply, by n, the luminance associated with the pixel data used to determine the light amount of the light beam, thereby irradiating the light beam with the light amount that is n times the original light amount. Alternatively, the controlling device may multiply, by n, a gain associated with an amplifier, which is electrically connected between a light source and a power supply configured to supply electric power to the light source, thereby irradiating the light beam with the light amount that is n times the original<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> light amount.</p><heading id="h0012">Example</heading><p id="p0026" num="0026">Hereinafter, an image display apparatus according to an example of the present invention will be explained with reference to the drawings.</p><heading id="h0013">&lt;First Example&gt;</heading><p id="p0027" num="0027">An image display apparatus according to a first example of the present invention will be explained with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">FIG. 1 to FIG. 4</figref>.</p><heading id="h0014">(Configuration of Image Display Apparatus)</heading><p id="p0028" num="0028">Firstly, a configuration of the image display apparatus according to the example will be explained with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1. FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of the image display apparatus according to the first example.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, an image display apparatus 1 is provided with a deflector 11, a deflector controller 12, a video processor 13, a current output D/A converter (DAC) 14, a laser source 15, and an illuminance sensor 16.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The deflector 11 is provided with a MEMS mirror (hereinafter referred to a "mirror" as occasion demands) and a drive apparatus configured to drive the mirror. The drive apparatus of the deflector 11 drives the mirror according to a horizontal drive signal and a vertical drive signal, which are outputted from the deflector controller 12. More specifically, the drive apparatus applies an electric field to a<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> piezoelectric thin film formed on a substrate of the mirror, according to the horizontal drive signal and the vertical drive signal, thereby driving the mirror. Since various known aspects can be applied to a method of driving the mirror, an explanation of the details of the method will be omitted.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the example, the horizontal drive signal is a sinusoidal signal, and the vertical drive signal is a sawtooth signal. The deflector 11 is thus driven by resonant vibration in a sinusoidal manner in a horizontal direction, and is driven in a sawtooth manner in a vertical direction. With regard to a scanning trajectory resulting from the drive of the mirror, a scanning direction associated with the horizontal direction is reversed for each line. This results in acquisition of a relatively high-resolution projection image even if horizontal resonance frequency associated with the horizontal drive signal is relatively low. The "projection image" is an image displayed in a period other than a vertical blanking period in an optical scanning range.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The video processor 13 is inputted with a plurality of pixel data (hereinafter referred to as "input pixel data" as occasion demands) corresponding to an image to be displayed. The video processor 13 is also inputted with an illuminance signal indicating an illuminance or degree of illumination detected by the illuminance sensor 16. The video processor 13 generates pixel data to be outputted (hereinafter referred to as "output pixel data" as occasion demands) to the current output DAC 14.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The current output DAC 14 supplies a drive current, which is proportional to the output pixel data, to the laser source 15. As a result, laser light with a light amount corresponding to the output pixel data is irradiated from the laser source 25<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> to the mirror. The current output DAC 14 is provided with a power supply configured to supply the drive current to the laser source 15, and an amplifier configured to amplify the drive current outputted from the power supply.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Here, in particular, the video processor 13 changes average luminance of a one-frame image to be displayed, on the basis of the illuminance indicated by the illuminance signal. The change in the average luminance of the one-frame image may be realized, specifically, for example, by reducing the average luminance of the one-frame image to predetermined luminance, on condition that the illuminance becomes lower than a predetermined threshold value.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">As described above, the average luminance of the one-frame image to be displayed is changed on the basis of the illuminance, which makes it possible to display an image with luminance suitable for a place in which the image display apparatus 1 is located. It is extremely useful in practice.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In the example, a value of the drive current supplied to the laser source 15 is in a range of a region in which the linearity of a light output characteristic associated with the laser source 15 is maintained (i.e. a linear region).</p><heading id="h0015">(Method of Controlling Laser Source)</heading><p id="p0037" num="0037">Next, a method of controlling the laser source 15 will be explained.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">If the average luminance of the one-frame image to be displayed is set to be lower than average luminance corresponding to the input pixel data, in the conventional technology, the input pixel data is reduced according to the reduction<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> width to generate the output pixel data in many cases. As described above, the drive current, which is proportional to the output pixel data, is outputted from the current output DAC 14. Thus, the laser source 15 is supplied with a current that is smaller than a current corresponding to the input pixel data, and the average luminance of the one-frame image to be displayed can be reduced.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Depending on the type of the laser source, however, the light output characteristic is not linear, and the linearity is possibly deteriorated as the drive current is reduced. Specifically, for example, some green semiconductor laser has a light output characteristic as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>. As is clear from <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, the green semiconductor laser has significantly deteriorated linearity if the drive current is less than or equal to one quarter of the maximum value. In <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, there is drawn a ratio of a measured value to an ideal value (i.e. a value based on the assumption that the light output characteristic is linear).</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Then, in the conventional technology, for example, if an image with luminance slightly varying with time is displayed, the change in luminance of the displayed image increases more than expected, and the flickering possibly occurs in the relatively low luminance region in the displayed image.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In the example, however, if the average luminance of the one-frame image to be displayed is reduced, an irradiation period of the laser light with respect to a pixel period, which is a period for drawing one output pixel data, is reduced according to the reduction width.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Specifically, for example, if the average luminance of the one-frame image to<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> be displayed is set to be half the average luminance corresponding to the input pixel data, the video processor 13 outputs one input pixel data as the output pixel data without change, from the start of one pixel period corresponding to the one input pixel data to a lapse of half the one pixel period. The video processor 13 then outputs zero data (i.e. luminance=0) as the output pixel data, from the lapse of half the one pixel period to the end of the one pixel period.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Then, the laser light is emitted from the laser source 15 from the start of the one pixel period to the lapse of half the one pixel period. The laser light is not emitted (i.e. lights-off) from the lapse of half the one pixel period to the end of the one pixel period (refer to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>). Thus, the average luminance of the one pixel period is half the luminance of the corresponding one input pixel data. As a result, according to the image display apparatus 1 in the example, even if the average luminance of the one-frame image to be displayed is reduced, the flickering of the displayed image can be suppressed.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In the example, moreover, if the irradiation period of the laser light with respect to the pixel period is changed, a horizontal diameter of a beam spot of the laser light irradiated is changed according to the irradiation period of the laser light (refer to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>). Such a configuration makes it possible to reduce the overlap of adjacent pixels, thereby improving resolution of the displayed image.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">By the way, in the case where the average luminance of the one-frame image to be displayed is reduced, if the laser light is repeatedly turned on or off at the same timing every time, an output intensity distribution of the laser light becomes uneven, which produces lines with gradations in the displayed image.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The video processor 13 thus makes different starting times of laser-light-irradiation in the pixel period, in two continuous frame periods, for example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>. Such a configuration makes it possible to average luminance distributions in the two continuous frame periods.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The "video processor 13" and the "pixel period" according to the example are respectively one example of the "controlling device" and the "pixel drawing period" according to the present invention. The "current output DAC 14" and the "laser source 15" according to the example are one example of the "light source" according to the present invention.</p><heading id="h0016">&lt;Second Example&gt;</heading><p id="p0048" num="0048">An image display apparatus according to a second example of the present invention will be explained. The second example is configured in the same manner as in the first example, except that the video processor 13 performs a different process. Thus, in the second example, the same explanation as that in the first example will be omitted, and basically, only a different point will be explained.</p><heading id="h0017">(Method of Controlling Laser Source)</heading><p id="p0049" num="0049">In the example, if one input pixel data has 1/n (wherein n is a positive real number) of the maximum luminance, the video processor 13 controls the current output DAC 14 to change the irradiation period of the laser light to the pixel period to 1/n, and to irradiate the laser light with a light amount that is n times a laser amount corresponding to the one input pixel data.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050"><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> Here, as a method of controlling the current output DAC 14 to irradiate the laser light with the light amount that is n times the light amount corresponding to the one input pixel data, for example, pixel data obtained by multiplying the one input pixel data by n may be outputted to the current output DAC 14, as the output pixel data. Alternatively, a gain associated with an amplifier provided for the current output DAC 14 may be multiplied by n.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Specifically, for example, if one input pixel data has half the maximum luminance, the video processor 13 outputs image data with luminance that is twice the luminance of the one input pixel data, as the output pixel data, from the start of one pixel period corresponding to the one input pixel data to a lapse of half the one pixel period. The video processor 13 then outputs zero data as the output pixel data, from the lapse of half the one pixel period to the end of the one pixel period.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Then, the laser light with a light amount that is twice the laser amount corresponding to the one input pixel data is emitted from the laser source 15, from the start of the one pixel period to the lapse of half the one pixel period. The laser light is not emitted (i.e. lights-off) from the lapse of half the one pixel period to the end of the one pixel period. Thus, the average luminance of the one pixel period is equal to the luminance of the corresponding one input pixel data.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">By virtue of such a configuration, it is possible to suppress a reduction in the drive current when drawing input pixel data with relatively low luminance. In other words, a low drive current region in which the light output characteristic of the laser source 15 has significant nonlinearity can be avoided. To put it differently, the laser source 15 can be driven in a drive current region in which the light output<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> characteristic of the laser source 15 has good linearity.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiments and examples, but various changes may be made, if desired, without departing from the essence or spirit of the invention which can be read from the claims and the entire specification.
