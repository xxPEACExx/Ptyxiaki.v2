Failure mode and effect analysis, also named FMEA analysis or just FMEA, examines the consequences of potential failures on the functionality of a technical system. FMEA can be varied for different applications, e.g. for software or processes and can be either qualitative or quantitative. All variations have in common that they analyze failure modes of elements and their effects on the analyzed technical system.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">A generic quantified FMEA is described for a domain independent application of electrical or electronic programmable electronic systems in "<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Failure Modes, Effects and Diagnostics Analysis", available at http://www.2.emersonprocess.com/ siteadmincenter/PM%20Rosemount%20Documents/8732E_V11_FMEDA.pdf dated March 30, 2014</text></nplcit>. Without the quantifications, the FMEA described therein is also generic for the qualitative variation of the analysis. The variation of FMEA described therein is referred to as Failure Mode Effects and Diagnostic Analysis, or Failure Mode Effects and Diagnostic Coverage Analysis FMEDA.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The FMEA or FMEDA as described in the above-referenced publication is typically developed using a manually maintained table with the support of a spreadsheet processing computer system. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> shows an example of a table from such a processing computer system.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In column C1 of the illustrated table, the analyzed parts are numerated. The parts of a technical system S can be for instance formed by components or electronic devices. In column C2, the type of the analyzed part is indicated, e.g. a capacitor or a resistor. In column C3 of the table as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the electronic type of the part is indicated, e.g.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the capacitor is a 10nF/120V capacitor. In column C4, the identifier is used to identify the part of the specific technical system as indicated, such as an indication number of the electric circuit plan, e.g. C101 for the capacitor. In column C5 of the illustrated table, the function of the part is textually described. In column C6 of the table, the failure rate lambda λ is indicated, e.g. 10FIT (failure in time, 1*10<sup>-9</sup> per hour) for the exemplary capacitor. Column C7 of the illustrated table represents the failure modes of the respective part, such as two metal connectors of the capacitor may either short circuit or be damaged and in an open circuit state. Column C8 of the table is used to describe a failure effect that corresponds to the failure mode. For example, if the capacitor is in an open circuit state, the failure has no consequences. Column C9 of the illustrated table is used to allocate, e.g. split, the failure rate lambda λ (as indicated in column C6) to the individual failure modes. For example, the failure rate of 10FIT of the capacitor is equally split for the two failure modes of the capacitor. Columns C10 to C12 of the illustrated table are used to categorize the failure effect into different categories, i.e. "safe", "dangerous", and "disregard" (or "don't care"). Columns C13 to C15 of the illustrated table are used to calculate the residual failure rate for the specific failure effect and category (safe λ<sub>s</sub>, dangerous λ<sub>d</sub> and disregard λ∗). For example, the failure rate λ<sub>d</sub> for the failure mode "short circuit" is 5FIT since 10FIT (column C6) *50% (columnC9)*1 (columnC11)=5FIT.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The other columns are calculated accordingly. Column C16 is used to describe a possible diagnostic measure capable of detecting or mitigating a dangerous failure effect. For example, the failure effect corresponding to the failure mode "short circuit" of the capacitor is detected by a pulsed test signal. Column C17 indicates the effectiveness of this measure. For example, the pulsed signals that detect the dangerous failure effect of the open circuit failure mode of the capacitor may only detect or mitigate a fraction of 90% of the occurrences of that failure effect. Column C18 of the illustrated<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> table is used to calculate the residual failure rate that a dangerous failure effect goes undetected (λ<sub>du</sub>). Column C19 is used to calculate the failure rate for the case that the dangerous failure effect is detected by diagnostic measure (λ<sub>dd</sub>).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The manually maintained table as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> may contain automation of an instant when implemented in a spreadsheet application. The automation may calculate the values for different failure rates.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Because modern safety critical technical systems tend to comprise an increased complexity, automations and tool support have a long history in research and industry. Whereas compact embedded systems may be analyzed using FMEA in a manually maintained table such as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> more complex systems may result in unmanageably long tables, in particular when larger or different development teams are involved.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Furthermore, each failure mode in such a conventional table corresponds to a single effect in a technical system and its diagnostic measure. For documentary reasons, this fact is typically described textually and has a local character referring to the effect on the analyzed subsystem.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">With a conventional FMEA analysis using a textually described local effect the following fundamental problems occur.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The local effects prevent a global effect analysis. Since effects are described in a local manner or with a local reference to the failure mode of a subsystem of the technical system, the manual table cannot be analyzed for all impacts of global effects within the table. Especially for larger technical systems, effects are described differently for each column of the FMEA table, but may refer to one global effect. Typically, FMEA tables are long and can contain thousands of lines for a complex technical system. Also, the tables are not filled by a single person but by a team of engineers and<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> designers. It is highly probable that two different failure effects have different local consequences, however, the effect on a global scale can be the same. For example, the effects "amplification factor exceeds limitations" and "output cannot be regulated" might result in the same global effect as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, e.g. "system causes environmental damage". To cluster all local effects with a manual maintained textual global effect would be theoretically possible in a manual table, but utilizing manually maintained clusters is a source for mistakes and inconsistencies. Accordingly, a manual FMEA table cannot solve the problems of utilizing local effects for a global analysis.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Further, in a conventional FMEA analysis, local measures cannot be utilized for global effects. Measures document preventive functions that are capable to manage typically a fraction of a failure mode and thus can omit or prevent an effect. A manual FMEA only aims at the sum of all effects and measures, however, the quantitative or qualitative analysis for every single effect on a global level needs to utilize all measures. It is likely that two measures are described differently, but prevent the same global effect. As a result they cannot be utilized for a global analysis of the system. For example, the afore-mentioned effect "amplification factor exceeds limitation" (A) and "output cannot be regulated" (B) describes the same global effect C, e.g.: "system causes environmental damage". The first effect A is based on the failure modes "short circuit" for part number 1 and "open circuit" for part number 2. Those effects are prevented by the measure "pulsed test will detect this failure". The second effect B "output cannot be regulated" has the same global effect C "system cause environmental damage", but has no measure preventing the (local and global) effect. Information which fraction of failure modes contribute to the global effect cannot be analyzed in a conventional FMEA analysis, because it is unclear how local measures can be identified within the locally maintained table, but correspond to the same global effect.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The scope of the present invention is defined solely by the appended claims and is not affected to any degree by the statements within this summary.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to a first aspect of the present invention, a method for supporting a global effect analysis of a technical system is provided, the method comprising:

The meta-model MM illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2</figref> is stored in a computer-readable storage medium. The meta-model MM illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2</figref> can be used for global effect analysis of a technical system S, in particular a complex technical system S comprising a plurality of subsystems, parts such as an industrial plant or a vehicle. The technical system S can comprise multiple assemblies AS. Each assembly AS is a set of analyzable elements of the technical system S that build a logic unit. Each element of an assembly AS consists of a various number of parts (1..1) forms a part P such as an electronic device. Each part P has an associated set of failure modes F. The failure mode F describes a specific kind of failure that a part P can have. Since a part P has a quantified behavior to fail, referred to as FIT, a failure mode F has a percentage to assign a percentage part of the quantified failure behavior of the part P to the specific failure mode F. Each failure mode F has an associated local effect element LE which holds in a possible embodiment the information "local description" about the local effect of the failure mode instance on the technical system S. The local effect LE is classified and quantified in a category, e.g. in a safety category. In a possible<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> exemplary embodiment, the local effect is categorized to different safety categories comprising the categories "safe", "dangerous" and "do not care" to mark an effect as not harmful (safe) with no effects on the outcome of the analysis (do not care), or as harmful (dangerous). Furthermore, a local effect LE comprises an associated so-called local measure LM. The local measure element LM prevents the local effect to occur, e.g. if a local effect LE is detected during the runtime of the analyzed technical system S, the technical system S is set into a shutdown state (safe state) to prevent the local effect LE. Since mechanisms detecting failure mode instances during the runtime of the technical system are not 100% effective, the local effect LE can have an associated effectiveness, e.g. a quantified percentage value (diagnostic coverage).</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">To allow the clustering of local effects LE programmatically, e.g. within a database like MySQl or ACCESS, all elements of the meta-model MM as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2</figref> have in a possible embodiment identifiers that allow to explicitly identify them. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2</figref>, a global effect GE has related local effects LE. The global effect element GE clusters specific local effects within one global effect to allow an automated analysis for global effects on the system S.

Each generated global effect tree GET comprises the global effect elements GE which are connected via logic gate elements to local effect LE elements and associated local measure elements LM.

The global effect element GE of the meta-model MM clusters specific local effects LE within one global effect GE to allow an automated analysis of the technical system S for global effects. The global effect element GE can also hold a global description of the respective global effect used by the analysis.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">To allow a global analysis, all global effects GE are contained within the global effect tree GET. With the elements GET "global effect tree", global effect disjunction gate GEDG and local measure effect conjunction gate LMECG, a data structure is constructed which can be used for quantitative or qualitative analysis of the technical system. In a possible first step, the FMEA is performed using the required afore-mentioned elements of the meta-model MM, i.e. FMEDA, assembly AS, part P, failure mode F, local measure LM and local effect LE, in a data structure that allows relations like MySQL or ACCESS. In a further step during the FMEA development process, local effects can be related to global effects. With this information, the global effect tree GET can be generated automatically. The generated data structure can be analyzed for all global effects. These global effects are related to the global effect tree elements.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In a possible embodiment, for each global effect element GE, a new logic gate element can be created, e.g. the "global effect disjunction gate" GEDG as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2</figref>. This logic gate element GEDG represents the disjunction of all possible local effects and local measure combinations for performing the global effect analysis. For example, if a Boolean tree is selected as the desired structure for analysis,<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> this logic gate element is represented as an OR gate in the respective tree. Each global effect disjunction gate element GEDG gets related multiple local measure effect conjunction gate elements LMECG.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Each local measure effect conjunction gate element LMECG represents one pair of a local effect LE and a local measure LM one for each local effect that is related to the global effect element that belongs to the global effect disjunction gate element GEDG. For example, if a Boolean tree is selected as the desired structure for analysis, this conjunction gate element is represented as an AND gate in the tree and is related as an input to the OR gate represented by the global effect disjunction gate element GEDG in a Boolean tree. The local measure effect conjunction gate element LMECG represents the residual effect after a measure has been applied. To represent this, the data structure is utilized to identify and relate the corresponding failure mode element FM, part element P and local measure element LM to the local measure effect conjunction gate element LMECG. This can be done, since the local measure effect conjunction gate LMECG is related to the global effect disjunction gate element GEDG which is related to a global effect element GE, which is related to a local effect element LE which is related to the required failure mode F, local measure element LM and part elements P. The element global measure GM in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2</figref> can be used to cluster also measures in a global manner with a global textual description of the respective measure. This can support the user to better understand a specific measure within the global analysis, since local measures would describe a measure specific to a local effect which might be hard to understand within a global analysis.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">One FMEA of the meta-model MM covers analytically all system instances or products in the real world. To allow diagnosis, effects of failure modes of real world technical systems can be recorded. Each technical system can have various failure modes F and therefore different effects are recordable during<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> runtime of the technical system. These recorded effects RE are associated to the effects documented in the FMEA to monitor the actual or current failure rates during runtime of the technical system.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The direction of the associations of the meta-model MM illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2</figref> documents a correlation.

The quantifications connected to the associations are only exemplary and may change for different domains or different types of FMEA. For example, the association between the elements recorded event RE and system S documents that a recorded event RE belongs to a system S and that every recorded effect RE belongs to exactly one system but that every system can have zero or any arbitrary number of recorded events RE.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">To illustrate the use of the meta-model MM as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2</figref> and the generation of a global effect tree GET, an abstract simple example for a FMEA and a resulting global effect tree GET is described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 3 and 4. Fig. 3</figref> shows a FMEA table of a simple technical system. Each row documents a failure mode F of a specific part P, its effect and a corresponding measure.

For each global effect A, B, one global effect disjunction gate GEDG, represented by an element labeled with OR, is associated to the global effect.

The computer system LS can be used having access to the FMEA database as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>. The computer system LS is connected via a wired or wireless connection C to one or several system implementations. In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, the computer system LS is connected via the wired or wireless connection C to two different system implementations or technical systems S1, S2, e.g. using event logging mechanisms. In a possible embodiment, generic failure modes and generic parts that may be used to build systems such as systems S1, S2 can be connected in a component database not shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>. The roles R, e.g. analysts, designers and/or engineers, can use the component database to generate and/or perform a FMEA analysis of a specific technical system stored in the FMEA database DB. Field data can be associated with certain technical effects using the wired or wireless connection C to the system implementations S1, S2. Because all elements of the meta-model MM described in the context of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2</figref> use a unique identifier, the relations and associations of elements can be used in a database system to avoid inconsistencies. If the number of<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> failure modes of a part is to be increased, a new failure mode can be incorporated, e.g. inserted as a generic failure mode with an association to the corresponding generic part into the component database. Because all part instances refer to the unique identification number ID of a generic part missing failure mode instances may be automatically inserted for every part instance in a specific FMEA analysis. Roles R of the analysis, design and/or engineering team can then be assured that all failure modes are listed for each part instance and that the model is consistent. Based on these consistent failure modes, effect elements can be selected from the FMEA database for a specific system. In this way, an effect element, in particular a local effect element LE and/or a global effect element GE, can be used many times. On the other hand, an effect element may be used by associating the effect element with many failure mode instances. On the other hand, an effect element may be used for the analysis of several specific systems. The computer system LS may analyze automatically where the effect element is used in the analysis. This analysis also becomes more detailed, because a failure rate may be calculated separately for every effect element. Using the consistent FMEA database with reused effect elements and consistent failure modes, failure effects measure for each implementation of the technical system can be traced for the corresponding failure modes of involved parts. The tracing helps to identify components and electronic devices that exceed the assumed failure rates and that may be repaired or replaced to maintain the implementations of the technical system in the desired failure rate limitations of the analysis.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In a possible embodiment, the method comprises instantiating with a processor of the computer system LS, the generic parts and the generic failure modes to generate part instances and failure mode instances, respectively, wherein the part instances and the failure mode instances specify the technical system.
