Field of the Invention:</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to coin detecting technology and more particularly, to an in-coin passage coin sensing system for coin acceptor for use in an automatic vending machine or consumer service system, which uses sensing coils to work with a resonant circuit for enabling the circuit module to calculate the quantity of the metal coins in the respective coin tube by measuring the energy loss and change in resonance frequency in the resonant circuit subject to an equivalent parallel resonance impedance between the metal coins in the respective coin tube and the respective sensing coil.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>2</b>. <b>Description of the Related Art:</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Following fast development of social civilization and technology, people accelerate their pace of life and require a better quality of life. In consequence, various automatic vending machines are used everywhere to sell different products without serviceman, bringing convenience to people and helping suppliers save much labor cost. Following increasing of selling items, new automatic vending machines with added functions are created.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Further, regular automatic vending machines and game machines commonly use a coin acceptor for receiving coins so that<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> a consumer can insert coins into the automatic vending machine or game machine to purchase commodities or to play games. The coin acceptor of a coin-operated machine generally comprises a recognition module for recognizing the authenticity and value of every inserted coin. Because different coins or tokens are used in different countries or different amusement parks, and because different coins/tokens have different sizes and values, a recognition module must be able to recognize the authenticity and values of different coins/tokens. A coin acceptor further comprises a coin dispenser adapted for sorting coins of different values into different coin tubes, a sensing device adapted for sensing the quantity of coins in each coin tube, and a coin hopper located at the bottom side of the coin tubes for outputting coins. When the quantity of coins in one coin tube reaches a predetermined high level, the sensing device gives a corresponding signal to the control circuit, prohibiting the coin dispenser from sorting any coin into this coin tube. On the contrary, when the quantity of coins in one coin tube reaches a predetermined low level, the sensing device gives a corresponding signal to the control circuit, prohibiting the hopper from outputting coins, ensuring the normal operation of the machine.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Conventional coin acceptors commonly use a non-contact displacement sensor to sense metal coins/tokens. Many different<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> types of non-contact displacement sensors, such as ultrasonic sensors, optical sensors and electromagnetic sensors are commercially available. An ultrasonic sensor uses an ultrasonic transmitter to transmit an ultrasonic wave. When a metal coin passes across the ultrasonic wave, the metal coin absorbs the energy, causing an attenuation of the energy. Thus, the control circuit can calculate the location of the coin subject to the change in the energy. However, an ultrasonic sensor of this design has a large size and high cost. Further, the reflection signal intensity of the ultrasonic sensor is inversely proportional to the distance of the coin. For sensing coins in a relatively longer coin tube, the problems of scattering attenuation, excitation energy insufficiency and signal recognition difficulty can occur.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An optical sensor uses an optical transmitter to transmit light across the coin tube and an optical receiver to receive light that passes across the coin tubes. When coins are accumulated in the coin tube, they block a part of the light that falls upon the coin tubes. Subject to this shading effect, the control circuit can calculate the location of the coins in the coin tubes. An optical sensor has the advantage of low signal attenuation and is free from the interference of electronic noises or variation of coin tube sizes. However, an optical sensor can easily be contaminated by dust, affecting sensing accuracy. Further, the optical components wear<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> quickly with use, lowering its performance and leading to recognition error.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Among conventional non-contact displacement sensors, an electromagnetic sensor is most popularly used for measuring coins in coin tubes in a close distance for the advantages of small size and operability under a high temperature environment or an environment having a high concentration of dust or pollutants. When a metal coin passes over a sensing coil of the electromagnetic sensor, the alternating magnetic field generated by the sensing coil induces an eddy current in the metal coil. Subject to the induced amount of the eddy current, the control circuit can calculate the location of the metal coin. However, the distance between the sensing coil and the metal coin, the geometric shape and magnetic permeability of the metal coin will cause a change in the eddy current and a change in the oscillation frequency of the resonant circuit. Thus, the sensing coil must be kept in close proximity to the periphery of the coin tube. However, the sensing coil is normally installed in a circuit board. The installation of the sensing coil is restricted to the thickness and configuration of the circuit board, and unable to be smoothly attached to the smoothly curved periphery of the coin tube to shorten its distance relative to the metal coin in the coin tube, and thereby affecting the sensing accuracy. If the excitation frequency of the sensing coil is<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> increased for effectively sensing metal coins in the coin tube, the follow-up signal processing will be complicated, increasing the cost.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Therefore, it is desirable to provide a coin acceptor, which is inexpensive to manufacture and can greatly improve the coin detection reliability and accuracy.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention has been accomplished under the circumstances in view. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an in-coin passage coin sensing system, which has the advantages of ease of installation, low cost and high detection accuracy.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">To achieve these and other objects of the present invention, an in-coin passage coin sensing system of the present invention comprises a main body, one or multiple coin tubes, and a sensing device. The main body comprises a body shell, and a coin dispenser mounted in the body shell. The coin tubes are mounted in the main body and disposed at the bottom side of the coin dispenser. The sensing device comprises a circuit module having a resonant circuit, sensing coils electrically connected to the resonant circuit, and an insulation film sealing the sensing coils and bonded to the periphery of the coin tubes to hold each sensing coil in the periphery of one respective coin tube in such a manner that when<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> one or multiple metal coins are dispensed by the coin dispenser into one coin tube, an alternating magnetic field generated by one respective sensing coil induces eddy currents in the metal coins in the respective coin tube, enabling the circuit module to calculate the quantity of the metal coins in the respective coin tube by measuring the energy loss and change in resonance frequency in the resonant circuit subject to an equivalent parallel resonance impedance between the metal coins in the respective coin tube and the respective sensing coil. Because the insulation film has the characteristic of thin thickness, high toughness, low cost, excellent insulation effect and interference prevention, and facilitates smooth bonding of the sensing coils to the periphery of the coin tubes to keep the respective sensing coils in proximity to the metal coins in the respective coin tubes, enhancing metal coin sensing accuracy. Thus, the in-coin passage coin sensing system of the invention has the advantages of low cost and high detection accuracy.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Further, the sensing coils can be sealed with one common insulation film. Alternatively, each sensing coil can be sealed with one respective insulation film. Further, the insulation film is bonded to the smoothly curved periphery of each coin tube to hold the sensing coils in such a manner that each sensing coil extends along the length direction of the respective coin tube over a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> distance corresponding to the stacked thickness of the maximum quantity of metal coins storable in the respective coin tube.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is an elevational view of an in-coin passage coin sensing system in accordance with the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is an exploded view of the in-coin passage coin sensing system in accordance with the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic perspective view of a part of the present invention, illustrating the sensing coils sealed with an insulation film and bonded to the periphery of the coin tubes.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a front view of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic drawing illustrating the structure of the sensing device of the in-coin passage coin sensing system in accordance with the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a circuit diagram of the sensing device of the in-coin passage coin sensing system in accordance with the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> is a waveform graph illustrating the relationship between the resonant impedance response and the quantity of metal coins in accordance with the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> is a waveform graph illustrating the relationship between the inductance frequency response and the quantity of metal coins in accordance with the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic perspective view of a part of an alternate form of the present invention, illustrating the sensing coils individually sealed with a respective insulation film before bonding.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref> corresponds to <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>, illustrating the sensing coils bonded with respective insulation films to the periphery of the respective coin tubes.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0006"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, an in-coin passage coin sensing system in accordance with the present invention is shown.

Subject to the equivalent parallel resonance impedance (Rs) between the metal coins <b>4</b> in each coin tube 2 and the respective sensing coil <b>32,</b> the inductance [L(d)] of the energy loss and change in oscillation frequency in the resonant circuit <b>311</b> can be measured.

Further, the insulation film <b>321</b> has the characteristic of thin thickness, high toughness, low cost, excellent insulation effect and interference prevention, and facilitates smooth bonding of the sensing coils 32 to the periphery of the coin tubes <b>2.</b> Thus, the in-coin passage coin sensing system of the invention has the advantages of low cost and high detection accuracy.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0007">FIGS. 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">8</figref>, waveform graphs respectively illustrating the relationship between the resonant impedance response and the quantity of metal coins and the relationship between the inductance response and the quantity of metal coins are shown.
