As shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 18</figref>, a front face of an inlet 3 is covered with a protective sheet 1a via a first adhesive layer 2a, and a reverse face of the inlet 3 is covered with a protective sheet 1b via a second adhesive layer 2b. The inlet 3 includes an antenna 5 that transmits and receives electromagnetic waves, an IC chip 4 connected to the antenna 5, and a substrate 6 on which the antenna 5 and the IC chip 4 are aligned. When the protective sheets 1a and 2b cover the inlet 3, the first adhesive layer 2a and the second adhesive layer 2b are laminated in a direction indicated by arrows in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 18</figref>. Frequency bands that can communicate with small antennas, such as 900MHz band, 2.45GHz band, and 5.8GHz band, are used for a communication frequency of the antenna, and a communicable distance is about from some tens of centimeters to one meter. Further, since energy for driving the IC chip is radiated as electromagnetic waves from a reader close to the antenna 5, a battery that functions as an energy source is not built in the inlet. Therefore, the RFID tag is used semipermanently as long as the inlet 3 is not destroyed.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> The RFID tag is incorporated in a card for managing room entry and exit, for example, or stuck to various articles or cases to be distributed in the market as an IC tag label for the purpose of shoplifting prevention, authenticity determination, history management, distribution management, inventory management, or the like. The IC tag label is, for example, attached to a sealing sticker that is stuck to a fold or a closed part of a cardboard or a sealed bag, or to a sealing sticker that is stuck to a closed part of a housing of electronic equipment. Further, the IC tag label is, for example, attached to a periphery of a lid or a stopper of a container which is a bottle or a plastic container that accommodates liquor, wine, jam, dressing, sauce, spices or the like. In order to indicate that the stopper is unopened or the lid is unopened in these containers, a technology where a part or whole of a lid or stopper and sides of the container are covered by a shrink film is used. As a technology for combining a shrink film and an IC tag label, a technology in which an IC tag label is incorporated into a top sheet that is placed on an opening formed to a container, and a periphery of the top sheet is fixed by shrink film that is formed in a frame shape is disclosed (Refer to Patent Document 1, for example).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">On the other hand, the IC tag label finishes serving as a label when an article to which the IC tag label is attached is delivered to a user. In this case, since the function of the RFID tag is still maintained, there is a possibility that the IC tag label may be peeled off and diverted, information that the IC chip has is read, or information that the IC chip has is tampered with. Therefore, it is preferable that the IC tag label has constant strength and rigidity during a period being<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> attached to an article, and the function of the RFID tag is lost when being removed from the article (Refer to Patent Documents 2 and 3, for example).</p><heading id="h0003">[Prior art]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Patent Document]</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005"><ul><li>[Patent Document 1] <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP4220184B"><text>Japanese Patent No. 4220184</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 2] <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2009075712A"><text>Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2009-75712</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 3] <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP5035041B"><text>Japanese Patent No. 5035041</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">[Disclosure of the Invention]</heading><heading id="h0006">[Problems to be solved by the Invention]</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The technology of the present disclosure has its object to provide a container with an inlet including an antenna which communication function is easily lost by an external force.</p><heading id="h0007">[Means for Solving the Problems]</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">In one aspect of a container in a technology of the present disclosure includes a container main body, an inlet having an substrate, an IC chip supported by the substrate and an antenna supported by the substrate, and a covering film that covers a part of an outer surface of the container main body and has a brittle part, the brittle part being a part more easily torn by external force than parts other than the brittle part in the covering film, at least a part of the inlet being positioned between the covering film and the outer surface of the container main body and adhered to the covering film, and the brittle part covers at least a part of the antenna.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> According to the above configuration, when the covering film receives an external force for tearing the covering film, the covering film is torn along the brittle part, and the inlet is destroyed with the covering film. At this time, since the brittle part of the covering film covers at least a part of the antenna, the antenna is destroyed when the inlet is destroyed with the covering film. Accordingly, since the external force that tries to peel off the covering film is effectively used for destroying the antenna, the communication function of the antenna can be easily destroyed.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In another aspect of the container in the technology of the present disclosure, it is preferable that the container includes a lid for closing an opening formed in the container main body, and the inlet and the covering film are positioned extending over the outer surface of the container main body and the lid.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to the above configuration,

the brittle part is a first brittle part, the substrate includes a second brittle<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> part and the second brittle part being a part more easily torn by external force than parts other than the second brittle part in the substrate, and the first brittle part covers at least a part of the second brittle part.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to the above configuration, since the part of the covering film and the part of the inlet that are easily torn by the external force overlap, the inlet becomes easily destroyed with the covering film.</p><p id="p0015"

has an overhanging portion overhanging from the outer surface of the container main body along a direction intersecting the outer surface of the container main body, and includes the overhanging portion as a portion for supporting the antenna.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the above configuration, since a part of the antenna is positioned at a position apart from the outer surface

The synthetic paper is a sheet having porosity with holes finely dispersed in synthetic resin, and a solid and a gas are unevenly dispersed. The synthetic resin contained in the synthetic paper is, for example, a PET or polypropylene (PP), such as foaming PET. The thickness of the substrate 6 is about 50 µm, for example.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Plasticizers such as kaolin or calcium carbonate may be further dispersed in the above-mentioned film or paper for the purpose of increasing brittleness in the material constituting the substrate 6. Paper has a high brittleness compared to the film because paper is easily torn. Therefore, it is preferable that the material constituting the substrate 6 is a paper in the respect that a high brittleness can be obtained. Meanwhile, in a case where a use of paper is difficult in an environment where the inlet is used 3, it is preferable that the material constituting the substrate 6 is a film, or a synthetic paper having porosity.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The size of the IC chip 4 is, for example, 0.05 mm square - 0.5 mm square, and the thickness of the IC chip 4 is, for example, 0.1 mm.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Incidentally, the IC chip 4 may be, for example, a chip main body, or may be a module including the chip main body and a printed circuit board having a wiring that connects the chip main body and an outside.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Although it is preferable that communication frequency is a 900MHz (UHF), it is not limited to this band, and may be a VHF band and GHz band, for example, depending on the use of the inlet 3.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, the IC chip 4 is connected to the antenna 5. The antenna 5 includes, for example, a single conductor line having a width of about 10 µm as a transmission line, and the conductor line has a loop shape that is drawn a plurality of times on a surface of the substrate 6, for example. When the conductor line has a portion that intersects three-dimensionally to each other, the portion that intersects three-dimensionally is composed of a through-hole and a jumper wire 11 positioned on a reverse face of the substrate 6, for example. Two ends that the single conductor line has are respectively led to a front face of the substrate 6. The two ends that the single conductor line has are connected separately to two pads located on the front face of the substrate 6, and two terminals that the IC chip 4 has are also connected separately to the two pads. Between the IC chip 4 and the pads, and between the antenna 5 and the pads may be connected by solder, or may be connected by a binder containing metal particles such as an anisotropic conductive paste (ACP) or anisotropic conductive film (ACF).</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">A method of forming the conductor line provided in the antenna 5 varies depending on the material constituting the substrate 6. When the substrate 6 is a film, for example, the conductor line provided in the antenna 5 may be formed by first laminating conductive foils such as aluminum foil or copper foil having a thickness of several µm on a front face of the film, and by then etching the conductive foils. When the substrate 6 is a paper, for example, the method of forming the conductor line provided in the antenna 5 uses a printing method using a conductive paste instead of etching described above. That is, the binder resin, a solvent, and a conductive<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> paste containing a conductive powder are first printed along a shape of the conductor line, and the conductor line provided in the antenna 5 is obtained after the print dries. The conductive powder contained in the conductive paste is a powder composed of a metal such as silver, copper, nickel, gold, platinum, etc., or a powder made of a conductive material such as conductive carbon. It should be noted that it is preferable that the conductive material contained in the conductive paste is a silver based material in the respect that a high conductivity may be obtained. A printing method is, for example, screen printing, flexographic printing, gravure printing, offset printing or the like.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">It is preferable that second brittle parts 12 each having a linear shape extending from an end of the front face of the substrate 6 toward a center are formed in portions where a formation of the antenna 5 and the IC chip 4 on the front face of the substrate 6 is not inhibited. The second brittle parts 12 are parts more easily broken by external force than parts other than the second brittle parts 12 in the substrate 6. The second brittle parts 12 may include a slit that is a hole extending along one direction, or may include a perforation that is a plurality of holes disposed intermittently along one direction, for example. Further, the second brittle parts 12 may have a structure that a portion of the substrate 6 thinner than a portion other than the second brittle part 12 is continuous or intermittently aligned along one direction, and it may be a part having a structure with partially lower strength against the external force in the substrate 6.

Moreover, the second brittle part 12 may have a linear shape, or may have a curved shape, or a shape that the second brittle part 12 has may be a combination of a linear shape and a curved shape.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">When the external force acts on the substrate 6, the second brittle part 12 exerts a function of inducing a location where the substrate 6 is tornat the second brittle part 12. Then, when the external force acts on the substrate 6, the substrate 6 can be easily torn from where the second brittle part 12 is provided in the substrate 6 along a direction that the second brittle part 12 extends.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Incidentally, the conductor line provided in the antenna 5 may have the following shapes, and a transmission method in the antenna 5 may be the following method.

The position of the second brittle part 12 in the front face of the substrate 6 may be a site where at least one of the radiating element 5a, the matching circuit 5b, and the gap between the radiating element 5a and the matching circuit 5b is positioned on the extended line of the second brittle part 12.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040"><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> Next, the configuration of the container will be described wit reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGs. 7 and 8</figref>.

The inlet 3 and the covering film 7 are attached to an edge portion surrounding the opening and a vicinity of the edge portion in the container main body 8, for example. The covering film 7 is a shrink film that shrinks by heat, for example, and is in close contact with an outer surface of the container main body 8 to covers the edge portion and the vicinity of the edge portion. Incidentally, the covering film 7 is not limited to a shrink film, but may be a non-conductive film that covers a part of the outer surface of the container main body 8. The shape of the container main body 8, the size of the container main body 8, and the contents accommodated in the container main body 8 are not particularly limited.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The inlet 3 is positioned between the outer surface of the container main body 8 and the covering film 7, and is adhered to a reverse face that is one of faces that the covering film 7 has and faces the outer surface of the container main body 8 via a first adhesive layer 2a.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Incidentally, the inlet 3 is also adhered to the outer surface of the container main body 8 via a second adhesive layer 2b.

In addition, the second adhesive layer 2b may be omitted depending on the use of the inlet 3 and the container. Since the inlet 3 is adhered to the covering film 7, it is possible to support the inlet 3 between the outer surface of the container main body 8 and the covering film 7 even if it is configured that the second adhesive layer 2b is omitted. It should be noted that glue contained in the second adhesive layer 2b is suppressed from remaining on the outer surface of the container main body 8 when the covering film 7 and the inlet 3 are removed from the container main body 8 if it is configured that the second adhesive layer 2b is omitted.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Further, a substrate for glue such as a paper or a film may be sandwiched between the second adhesive layer 2b and the inlet 3, for example.

It is preferable that the adhesive force of each adhesive layer 2a, 2b has strength of about 2.66N/10mm to 3.42N/10mm at the measuring method conforming to JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) standard (Z0237). It should be noted that a portion overlapping with the second brittle part 12 in each adhesive layer 2a, 2b may have a structure that partially weakens each adhesive layer 2a, 2b with respect to an external force such as slits or perforations.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 8</figref>, first brittle parts 13 are formed in the covering film 7 for facilitating a tearing of the covering film 7 when removing the covering film 7 from the container<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> main body 8.

The first brittle parts 13 may, for example, include linear perforations, or may have a structure that thin portions, which have the thickness of the film thinner than portions other than the first brittle part 13, are disposed continuously, or intermittently. The number of the first brittle parts 13 or the extending directions of the first brittle parts 13 are not particularly limited. For example, the first brittle parts 13 may have linear shapes, or may have curved shapes, or shapes that the first brittle parts 13 have may be a combination of the linear shapes and the curved shapes. The first brittle part 13 is formed in the covering film 7 downwardly from a portion overlapping with the opening formed partially in the container main body 8, for example.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In a condition where the covering film 7 and the inlet 3 are attached to the container main body 8, the first brittle parts 13 cover at least a part of the antenna 5.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Furthermore, the first brittle parts 13 cover at least a part of the second brittle parts 12 in the inlet 3.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 6</figref>, when the antenna 5 includes the radiating element 5a, the matching circuit 5b, and, a gap between the radiating element 5a and the matching circuit 5b, the first brittle part 13 may cover at least one of the radiating element 5a, the matching circuit 5b, or the gap between the radiating element 5a and the matching circuit 5b.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In a configuration that at least a part of the first brittle parts 13 cover at least a part of the second brittle parts 12, the extending direction of the first brittle parts 13 and the<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> extending direction of the second brittle parts 12 may be parallel to each other or may be intersected to each other, for example.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">With such a configuration, when the covering film 7 is removed from the container main body 8, the covering film 7 receives an external force of peeling off the covering film 7, and is torn along the first brittle parts 13. At this time, the inlet 3 is also torn with the covering film 7. Since the first brittle parts 13 cover at least a part of the antenna 5, the antenna 5 is destroyed when the inlet 3 is torn with the covering film 7. Therefore, since the external force that peeling off the covering film 7 is effectively used for destroying the antenna 5, the communication function of the antenna 5 can be easily destroyed. As a result, the inlet 3 is suppressed from being used for other than its intended purpose. Further, since the inlet 3 is covered with the covering film 7, it is also difficult to take out or replace only the inlet 3.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Moreover, since the first brittle parts 13 cover at least a part of the second brittle parts 12, the substrate 6 is also torn along the second brittle parts 12 when the covering film 7 is torn along the first brittle parts 13.
