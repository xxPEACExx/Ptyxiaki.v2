The instructing data may be specific to a user and may without limitation alter the look and feel of the mobile device, alter the functionality of the mobile device, be in an XML format, be in a database format, and/or be in a text file format. An alert, which may relate to an item on a list, may be triggered in response to the instructing data.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The first identification data may be a user name and optionally a password, and/or an identification number of the mobile device itself. It is obvious for those skilled in the art that the first identification data may not be limited to a user name, password and/or identification number but may be any information available to identify a certain user and/or a certain mobile device. Based on the identification data, a certain mobile device and/or a certain user may be identified</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The representation related to the instructing data may involve audio, video, a picture related to a location, fax, email, instant message, text message, SMS, internet protocol, voice, voicemail, vibration, stimulation at least one of the five senses or an alert. The alert may involve fax, email, instant message, text message, SMS, internet protocol, voice, voicemail, vibration or stimulation of at least one of the five senses.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">An acceptance answer may comprise the information that an information has been recognized and/or that a task has been completed. A partly acceptance answer may be representative for partly completing a task, while a denial answer may be representative either for a not recognizing of an information or a denial of performance of task.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A location tracking may be provided by the present disclosure, wherein a location of a portable electronic facility may be transmitted, stored in a file, stored with other information<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> in the mobile device, and reported along with an indication of the movement of the mobile device. The information itself may be displayed on a map and may comprise an indication of speed and/or direction, and the time being at a certain location.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The instructing data may relate to the accuracy of the location information. The instructing data, the location profile and/or the user profile may refresh continuously, in accordance with set preferences or in response to a request. The frequency of the requests, in particular the sending of location data and the user identification to the server, may be varied in response to speed, location, specified preferences, proximity to a point of interest, or changes in a geofence.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The present disclosure may comprises methods of increasing the quality of location based information for a mobile device involving obtaining multiple data points for a given item of information or a location. This may comprise the use of GPS, GPRS triangulation, WIFI triangulation, Bluetooth, indoor location as disclosed e.g. in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP2597423A1"><text>EP2597423 A1</text></patcit>, which is herewith incorporated by reference, and other methods and devices.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The server my analyze information related to at least one mobile device involving transmitting information from the at least one mobile device and analyzing such information using an analysis engine. The information from one or more mobile devices may be stored or aggregated. The analysis engine may provide the ability to view location history or analyze location history as well as instructing data history. The analysis engine may also request additional information or send alerts to a user of the mobile device or to further users. The analysis engine may perform analytics on location information such as predictive analysis and descriptive analysis.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The information provided by the analysis engine may include date and time of acceptance, partly acceptance or denial answers in response to received instructing data from a user, evaluation data of further users, and other parameters. The analysis engine may tailor information to the behavior of a user, such as observing the behavior of a user and communicating information to the user by the mobile device, such as information based on the observed behavior of a user, in particular a score value.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The surprising finding of the present disclosure is that with the disclosed method it is possible to provide individual information at a certain location to individual users, wherein said information may be based on a location profile that may be updated depending on inputs of the user itself or other users.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Therefore, in a first step, the user profile and at least one location profile associated with a certain location may be provided. A mobile device being at a certain location may therefore send its location data and/or first identification data to a first server. With the help of the location data, the server is enabled to identify the location profile associated with said certain location. Based on the identification of the mobile device and/or the user, it may be possible to appoint to a certain mobile device and/or a certain user individual information. As well, the information presented to the user is depending on a certain date and time.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">For example, it may be possible to inform a user at a certain location to complete a specific task, wherein another user at the same location at the same time may be informed about another task or may be provided with other information. As well, it may be possible to determine that no specific task has to be performed by the user at a certain date and time a certain location based on the location profile and the user identification and/or the certain mobile device, wherein the user may be informed to move to another location, wherein the server determines based on the location profile and the date and time that a task will have to be performed at said location by the specific user.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">It may therefore be possible as one example of the present disclosure to present a cleaning worker being at a building or another location the respective cleaning tasks he is in charge of depending on location he or she stays and current the date and time dynamically. As well, further information may be provided in combination with said task, like cleaning instructions how to clean a specific object.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">After receiving said information, the user may decide to accept, partly accept or denial an information and/or a task, while the location profile may be updated automatically depending on said reply.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">For example, if the cleaning worker accepts a task, the location profile is updated in a way that said task may not shown to the cleaning worker anymore, nor in particular to other cleaning workers being at the same location, until e.g. a repeat cycle is due, in particular at another date and time.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In the alternative, the cleaning worker may partly accept the task. This may for example be the case that it is not possible to clean a surface completely, but only partly.
