One common system is provided by attaching a detergent container in the toilet bowl, e.g. under the rim or to the interior of the toilet tank by suction cups or similar. With every flush these systems will release detergent solution into the bowl, since flushing water will be allowed to enter at least a part of the container during flushing and upon exit draw detergent into the trap of the WC suit. Although such systems results in a fresh appearance in the toilet bowl, there is a risk that the containers come loose and thus falls into the bowl creating an obstacle in the toilet. In addition, the dosing volume varies over time with a higher dose of detergent solution when the container is full and a lower dose when the container starts to run empty. Furthermore, these kinds of systems require the user to arrange the container in and out of the toilet bowl when re-filling. This may be considered as a hygienic hazard, especially at public toilets.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Another system, as described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1756372A"><text>EP1756372</text></patcit> by the same inventor, operates by allowing a solid state chemical to partly dissolve during flushing.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Other systems have been proposed for which liquid detergents are used to clean the WC suits. One such system is described in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP2696003A"><text>EP2696003</text></patcit>, wherein a feed tank has an inner chamber that contains service liquid. A siphon system connects the chamber to a branch opening that communicates with a drain hole. The described system is extremely complex, and requires the use of tanks with inner chambers in order to provide the desired functionality. Further to this, since dosing is provided by a suction force the system is not suitable for high viscous liquids. Hence, there is a need for an improved<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> dosing unit that has a less complex construction, although providing full functionality also for high viscous liquids.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Accordingly, the present invention preferably seeks to mitigate or eliminate one or more of the above-identified deficiencies in the art singly or in any combination and solves at least the above mentioned problems by providing liquid dosing unit for providing detergent to a water trap of a WC suit.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">An idea of the present invention is therefore to provide an efficient liquid dosing unit for providing detergent to a WC suit in a safe manner, and using a simple and robust construction.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A WC suit should in this context be interpreted broadly as any flush toilet, either standing on the floor or wall-hung.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to a first aspect, a liquid dosing unit for providing detergent to a WC suit is provided.

The WC suit may be any kind of flush toilet, such as a floor-standing flush toilet or a wall-hung flush toilet.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In an embodiment according to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a flushing system 10 of a WC suit is shown. The flushing system 10 is constructed to allow a user of an associated WC suit to flush the toilet after use, and for this purpose the flushing system 10 comprises a water cistern 20 and a flushing mechanism 30. The water cistern 20 is in fluid communication with the WC suit by means of an outlet being controlled to open by means of the flushing mechanism 30.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The flushing mechanism 30 is constructed to open and close the outlet when the user operates a flush initiation means, such as a push button 32. Hence the outlet will be open and the water enclosed within the water cistern 20 will drain out from the outlet and into the WC suit.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The water cistern 20 and the flushing mechanism 30 are well known and will not be described in further detail herein.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A liquid dosing unit 100 is provided in cooperation with the flushing mechanism 30. The liquid dosing unit 100 comprises a dosing reservoir 190 for enclosing detergent. The dosing reservoir 190 is connected to a filling funnel 170, via a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> filling piping 180, which is used to fill the dosing reservoir 190 with detergent. By removing the flush button 32 the user, such as an attendant or a cleaner, can fill the dosing reservoir 190 with detergent by filling the funnel 170 and allowing liquid to pour down into the reservoir 190.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The dosing reservoir 190 is further connected to a fluid channel 150 that connects the reservoir 190 to a dosing piping 120. The dosing reservoir 190 may contain various kinds of liquid having different viscosities, such as for example liquid detergent, cleanser and/or any other liquid cleaning agent.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The dosing reservoir 190 may be a flexible bag which is compressible by the surrounding water pressure. For this the dosing reservoir 190 has an outer shell of which at least a part is formed by a flexible material, such as a thin sheet of plastic. The hydrostatic pressure of the water cistern in the WC suit will consequently compress the dosing reservoir 190, thus allowing the enclosed detergent to be pressed up through the fluid channel 150 into the dosing piping 120.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Now turning to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, an embodiment of a liquid dosing unit 100 is shown. An outlet valve 130 is arranged at the lower part of the flushing system 10 and is connected to the dosing piping 120, as will be described more in detail in conjunction with <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">When pressing the flush button 32 (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>), the outlet valve 130 is opened to allow the water to flush out into the WC bowl (not shown). In practice, the outlet valve 130 may form part of the flushing mechanism 30, e.g. by means of an overflow pipe which is raised upon flushing for opening the valve 130.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Now turning to <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, a more detailed view of the liquid dosing unit 100 is shown where the dosing reservoir 190 is hidden to facilitate understanding. The dosing piping 120 has two open ends 140a, 140b that connects to the outlet valve 130 of the flushing system 10, at a position being subject to the water flow only when the outlet valve 130 is open.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In a further embodiment the two open ends (140a, 140b) are connected to a flushing pipe downstream the outlet valve 130. The two open ends (140a, 140b) should be connected to a piping which is dry and filled with air between flushing, and which is wet and filled with water upon flushing.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">During operation of the liquid dosing unit 100 shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, detergent arranged in the dosing piping 120 will flow into the outlet valve 130 upon flushing. This will be further described below.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> another embodiment of a liquid dosing unit 100 is shown, in which only one end 140a is connecting to the outlet valve 130, while the other open end 140b opens to the volume inside the cistern 20. Hence, detergent arranged in the dosing piping 120 will flow into the cistern 20 upon flushing.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Now turning to <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, a detailed view of a part of the dosing piping 120 will be described. The dosing piping 120 comprises a water trap 110, a first hose 121 and a second hose 122. The water trap 110 is arranged at a position vertically above the open ends 140a, 140b, and forms a U-bend, or an M-shaped structure. The water trap 110 has two open ends which are connectable to one of the open ends 140a by means of the first hose 121 and to the other open end 140b by means of the second hose 122. Hence, the first hose 121 is connected to a first end of the water trap 110, and the second hose 121 is connected to a second end of the water trap 110.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In addition, the water trap 110 has a third open end located in between the two opens ends which is connectable to the fluid channel 150. The first hose 121, the second hose 122 and the fluid channel 150 may all be formed by fluid transporting devices, e.g. flexible hoses.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The water trap 110 further comprises a vent device 160 arranged to act as an equalizer of the air pressure, as will be described more in detail in conjunction to <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7</figref>. In a first embodiment the vent device 160 is arranged as an interface between the water trap 110 and the first hose 121.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The function of the dosing piping 120 will now be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">Fig. 6 to 8</figref>. The neutral position, i.e. before a flush has been initiated, of the dosing piping 120 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>. The water trap 110 is filled with detergent up to a level corresponding to the surrounding water level in the cistern, as is schematically shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>. This is achieved due to the flexible shell of the dosing reservoir 190, pressing enclosed liquid to the same vertical level as the water level of the cistern 20. Thus, the replenishment of detergent into the water trap 110 occurs after every WC flush when the cistern (not shown) in the flushing system 10 is filling up with water. In this state, for<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> the first hose 121 and the second hose 122 are filled with air since the connections are made to a dry environment downstream a sealing gasket of the outlet valve 130. For the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, the first hose 121 will be filled with water up to the water level of the cistern 20, while the second hose 122 will be filled with air since its connection is to the dry environment inside the outlet valve 130.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7</figref> shows a schematic view of the dosing piping 120 after a flush has been initiated, i.e. when a user has initiated a flush. When flushing the WC suit the outlet valve 130 is opened whereby water is starting to drain from the water cistern 20 out through the outlet valve 130. For the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the first and second hose 121, 122 will thus be exposed to the water flow via the open ends 140a, 140b, and the hoses 121, 122 will be filled with water up to approximately the same vertical level as the water level inside the cistern 20. As the water level is rising in the first and second hose 121, 122, the remaining air is pressed upwards through the first and second hose 121, 122. Air entrapped in the first hose 121 of the dosing piping 120 will consequently flow out through the vent device 160.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">On the other hand, air entrapped in the second hose 122 of the dosing piping 120 will expose the dose of detergent arranged in the water trap 110 to a pushing force towards the vent device 160, and into the first hose 121 being already filled with water. Hence, the detergent will form an upper layer of the water column inside the first hose 121. This is shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 8</figref>. The dose of detergent that was pushed down from the water trap 110 into the first hose 121 of the dosing piping 120, will now mix with the flushing water.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">As the flushing continues, leading to a decreased water level inside the cistern 20, the height of the water column inside the hoses 121, 122 will be reduced accordingly until they are reaching an empty state. As the flush is being finalized the water in the first hose 121 and the second hose 122 flows out, through the open ends 140a, 140b, into the outlet valve 130. As a result the last water flushed into the toilet bowl is the water mixed with detergent, thus creating a fresh finish of the water that will stay in the WC suit until a next flush. Liquid detergent is in fact never dosed in the water while enclosed in the water cistern 20, and liquid detergent, which may be<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> corrosive/abrasive, may consequently never be allowed to damage critical components inside the water cistern 20 such as gaskets etc. Further to this, since the dosing will occur at the end of the flushing sequence, a reduced volume of dosing will be required in order to clean the WC suit.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">However, for the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> the detergent will be pushed out from the first hose 121 and the associated open end 140b, into the water cistern 20. The detergent will reach the water of the cistern 20 rather immediately after initiating the flush, which means that the entire flushing will provide a cleaning action. Especially during the initial phase of the flushing the flushing water will expose the entire WC bowl to detergents, which means that the entire WC bowl will be cleaned.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">A second embodiment of a dosing pipe is shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 9 and 10</figref>. The dosing piping 220 comprises a water trap 210, a first hose 221 and a second hose 222. The water trap 210 is arranged at a position vertically above the open ends 140a, 140b. The water trap 210 has two open ends which are connectable to the first hose 221 and the second hose 222. In addition, the water trap 210 has a third open end located in between the two opens ends which is connectable to the tube 250.
