The elements of the platinum group include platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, osmium, and the like. Rhenium, which is usually not categorized as a precious metal but is an industrially valuable metal as well, is also a scarce and expensive metal.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, gold is used in bonding wires for semiconductor integrated circuits and in contact materials for electronic substrates. Silver is used in photography films and conductive paste. Platinum, palladium, and rhodium are used in catalysts, electrode materials, temperature sensors, medical equipment, and electronic materials. Rhenium is used as thermocouple, catalysts, and the like.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Being scarce and expensive, gold, silver, the elements of the platinum group, and rhenium (hereinafter in the present invention, these are collectively called "precious metals") are obtained by collecting and recycling used products, defective products yielded during manufacturing processes, and the like. Employed as a method of recycling precious metals are a dry process of melting and separating in a furnace at a high temperature and a wet process of melting in acid and the like and then separating by a method such as neutralization, solvent extraction, crystallization, and electrowinning. The dry process has advantages of having excellent productivity to treat a large quantity in a single process and requiring no additional separation step, but it also has a problem in the retrieval rate in retrieving precious metals, namely, loss of precious metals. On the other hand, the wet process has an advantage in terms of its capability of retrieving with little loss of precious metals, but it also has a problem that retrieval of precious metals at high purity is accompanied by challenging separation from other coexisting components. Because of these, retrieval is carried out by considering the advantages of both processes and adopting either the dry process or the wet process, or both of these in combination.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As the wet process, various techniques are developed. For example, Patent Document 1 describes a method of retrieving platinum group metals at high purity from raw<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> material containing the platinum group metals. Specifically, elements of the platinum group are sequentially separated and retrieved according to the following procedure. By the method described in Patent Document 1, the metal Pd having purity of 99.95% can be retrieved at a percent yield of 99%.
<ol><li>(1) A smelting residue is subjected to chlorination with hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide, to give 3 L of a chlorination solution (A). The amount of hydrochloric acid added is determined so as to achieve a concentration of free hydrochloric acid in this solution of 4 mol/L or higher.</li><li>(2) The solution containing the elements of the platinum group (the chlorination solution A) is mixed with 1 L of DBC (dibutyl carbitol) for 30 minutes to extract gold.</li><li>(3) Caustic soda is added to the residual solution after gold extraction, followed by neutralization until the concentration of free hydrochloric acid reaches 2 mol/L. The resultant neutralized solution (the residual solution after Au extraction) at a volume of 3 L and 3 L of DHS (dihexyl sulphide) are mixed for 3 hours to extract palladium (Pd).</li><li>(4) The Pd-containing DHS resulting from the above step (3) is washed with 3 L of hydrochloric acid (concentration: 1 mol/L) and, thereto, 3 L of an aqueous solution of ammonia and ammonium chloride (NH<sub>3</sub> concentration: 3 mol/L, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl concentration: 1 mol/L) is added for back extraction of Pd. To the aqueous solution containing Pd as a result of back<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> extraction, hydrochloric acid is added to achieve a pH of lower than 1, so that Pd yellow is retrieved. The resultant Pd yellow is dissolved in an aqueous ammonia solution, and to the resultant solution, hydrazine is added for reduction.</li></ol>
Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2012167367A"><text>Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. 2012-167367</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0003">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0004">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">When recycling from scrap, smelting ore, and the like, the content of impurities is usually higher than the content of precious metals and accordingly the precious metals alone need to be separated from a solution containing various impurities at a high proportion. Similarly in Patent Document 1, precious metals are separated from an acid solution of hydrochloric acid in which a smelting residue is dissolved (a chlorination solution A). On the other hand, precious metals are expensive, and therefore the burden of interest generated during the process spanning from the delivery of raw material until the products are sent out is too high to neglect compared to when retrieving other metals. For this reason, retrieval of precious metals from a solution containing various impurities at a high proportion needs to be achieved with high efficiency in a short period of time.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the technique described in Patent Document 1, however,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the gold extraction solution is prepared from the chlorination solution using the first extraction solvent (DBC: dibutyl carbitol) (step (2) above) and then the palladium extraction solution is prepared from the residual solution after gold extraction by using the second extraction solvent (DHS: dihexyl sulphide) (step (3) above). Therefore, in this technique, a process of precious metal extraction needs to be repeated as many times as the number of different kinds of precious metals to be retrieved. Also, in this technique, the yield of extraction solution is substantially the same as the amount of a crude solution (a chlorination solution), after being multiplied by the number of different kinds of precious metals to be retrieved. Furthermore, actual operation of the technique described in Patent Document 1 requires many production facilities and a corresponding capital investment, and therefore development of a technique to retrieve precious metals with even higher efficiency in an even shorter period of time is demanded.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide an extraction agent that allows early and highly efficient extraction of precious metals from an acid solution containing the precious metals and an extraction method for precious metals using the extraction agent.</p><heading id="h0005">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --><p id="p0009" num="0009">As a result of repeated intensive investigation to solve the above problem, the present inventors found that provision of a precious metal extraction agent that contains an amide derivative represented by the following general formula (I) makes it possible to retrieve a plurality of kinds of precious metals in a single process from a solution containing various impurities at a high proportion, thereby completing the present invention.

The objective precious metal ions can be further retrieved from the organic solvent in an aqueous solution by back extraction of the objective precious metal ions. As a solution for back extraction, for example, an aqueous solution in which nitric acid, hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid is diluted is suitably used.

In addition, the equilibrium arrival time varies depending on the types and concentrations of precious metals and the amounts of extraction agent to be added, and thus the stirring time and extraction temperature can be suitably set depending on the conditions of an acid aqueous solution of precious metal ions and an organic solution of the extraction agent. The pH of an acid aqueous solution comprising metal ions can be also suitably adjusted depending on the types of precious metal.</p><heading id="h0011">[Extraction of precious metals]</heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">In order to efficiently extract precious metals from an acid aqueous solution containing the precious metals, any of the amide derivatives above may be used as an extraction agent.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">At the time of extraction, the pH can be within a wide range from a highly acidic region of about 0.8 to a weakly acidic region of 3.5 or higher. When the acid aqueous solution containing precious metals also contains impurities, the organic solution of the extraction agent is preferably added with the pH adjusted to a pH range where little impurities are extracted.
