The fixture frame may be installed directly on the installation box. By means of threads on the fixture frame and the box, or alternatively by means of buckles, the fixture frame and the pre-mounted installation box can be connected tightly.

The fixture plank has buckles in its inner side, which can match to the other joints on the outer wall of the installation box. Additionally, the fixture plank has plug on one end and socket on the other end. The fixture frame may be formed by connecting both fixture planks by plugging the plugs to the sockets on each other, yet the strength is reduced significantly and the connection is weakened. Due to the fixture frame is separable, when the fixture planks are under strong external force, the connection may be broken and the installation box may become unstable.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Contents of the design patent</u></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">This design patent introduces a pre-mounted installation box for faucets.
