As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref>, the excavator includes a crawler-type lower traveling body 1, an upper slewing body 2 mounted on the lower traveling body 1 so as to be slewable about an axis extending perpendicular to the ground surface, and a working attachment AT. The upper slewing body 2 has an upper frame 3 serving as the base thereof and various facilities and equipment units including a cabin 4 mounted on the upper frame 3. The working attachment AT is attached to the front part of the upper frame 3, including a boom 5, an arm 6, a bucket 7, and a plurality of hydraulic cylinders, namely, a boom cylinder 8, an arm cylinder 9, and a bucket cylinder 10<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> for operating the boom 5, the arm 6, and the bucket 7, respectively. The upper frame 3 has a front-rear direction and the cabin 4 is supported on a left-front part of the upper frame 3.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><figref idrefs="f0004 f0005">Figs. 8 to 10</figref> show the upper frame 3 and a plurality of equipment units placed on the upper frame 3.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The upper frame 3 includes a center section CS, a left side deck D1, and a right side deck D2. The center section CS includes a main body and a pair of right and left vertical plates 11, 11 vertically standing on the main body. Each of the vertical plates 11, 11 serves as a reinforcement member and an attachment-mounting member. The left and right side decks D1 and D2 are beam structures provided on the left and right sides of the center section CS, respectively.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The plurality of equipment units includes: a not-graphically-shown power equipment unit provided on the rear part of the center section CS, the cabin 4 shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref> mounted on the left side deck D1, and an equipment unit 12 and a tank 13 which are mounted on the right side deck D2. The equipment unit 12 includes a control unit constituting a hybrid facility and including a electric storage device and an inverter. The tank 13 is, for example, a fuel tank, aligned with the equipment unit 12 in the front-rear direction.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The right side deck D2 includes a plurality of beam members spaced in the front-rear direction: namely, a right frame 17, a first lateral beam 14, a second lateral beam 15, and a third lateral beam, the lateral beams 14, 15, and 16 being aligned in this order from the front side. Each of the first to third lateral beams 14 to 16 extends laterally, i.e., in the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> right-left direction. The equipment unit 12 is placed on the first and second lateral beams 14 and 15 so as to be placed across the lateral beams 14 and 15. The tank 13 is placed on and across the second and third lateral beams 15 and 16. The right frame 17 extends in the front-rear direction. The lateral beams 14 to 16 are placed between the right vertical plate 11 and the right frame 17, having respective opposite ends which are welded to be fixed to the vertical plate 11 and the right frame 17, respectively. The first to third lateral beams 14 to 16 are depicted by bold lines in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 9</figref>.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Each of the first and second lateral beams 14 and 15 is formed with a pair of right and left mount-member attachment holes 18 shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 8</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">9</figref>. Into the mount-member attachment holes 18 are fitted respective mount members 19 made of rubber shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 10</figref>, the equipment unit 12 being placed on the mount members 19. Each of the second and third lateral beams 15 and 16 is formed with a pair of right and left bolt passing holes 20 shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 8</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">9</figref>. The tank 13 has a bottom part, which is fixed to the second and third lateral beams 15 and 16 by bolts passing through the bolt passing holes 20 while the tank 13 is placed on the second and third lateral beams 15 and 16.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Each of the vertical plates 11, 11 of the center section CS has a boom-foot-pin hole 21 penetrating through the front ends thereof, allowing a boom foot pin 22 shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref> to be inserted into the boom-foot-pin holes 21 and a hole formed in a boom foot which is the base end of the boom 5. The vertical plates 11, 11 and the boom foot pin 22 support the boom 5 so as to allow the entire working attachment AT<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> including the boom 5 to make rotational movement about the boom foot pin 22, that is, so as to allow the working attachment AT to be raised and lowered.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Placing the equipment units on the beam members as the comparative example can involve problems in relation to other surrounding structures, depending on the position and height of the equipment unit. For example, the equipment unit 12 placed on the right side deck D2 to be located on the right side of the boom-foot-pin hole 21 may allow the upper end of the equipment unit 12 to overlap a portion or an entire portion of the boom-foot-pin hole 21 in a side view as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 10</figref>, if having a large height dimension, to thereby cover at least a part of the boom-foot-pin hole 21 on the right side thereof. This disables the boom foot pin 22 from being inserted into and removed from the boom-foot-pin hole 21 for exchanging the attachment or the like, that is, disables the boom 5 from attachment and detachment. The equipment unit 12, therefore, has to be detached from the right side deck D2 for every attachment and detachment of the boom 5.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In order to avoid such a situation, the height dimension of the equipment unit 12 has to be restricted. There may be other countermeasure for lowering the placement surface of the equipment unit 12, that is, locating the entire right side deck D2 or the lateral beams 14 to 16 at a lower position or decreasing the height dimensions thereof these members; however, these may decrease the strength of the right side deck D2 itself or may have an adverse influence on placement of the other equipment units, for example, the tank 13.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The embodiment according to the invention includes structure which eliminates the above inconveniences.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">There will be described a first embodiment of the present invention with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figs. 1 to 6</figref>.

The equipment unit 12 has such a height dimension that, if the equipment unit 12 was placed directly on and across the upper surfaces of the first and second lateral beams 33 and 34, the upper end of the equipment unit 12 would overlap a part of or all of the boom-foot-pin hole 21 in a side view, that is, would cover at least a part of the boom-foot-pin hole 21 on the right side.</li></ol><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In order to prevent the upper end of the equipment unit 12 from overlapping the boom-foot-pin hole 21, the upper frame 30 according to the first embodiment further includes a second beam member for supporting the equipment unit 12. The second beam member is constructed by utilization of the first and second lateral beams 33 and 34 as a front lateral beam and a rear lateral beam, respectively, further including a front auxiliary beam 36, a rear auxiliary beam 37, and a plurality of equipment-unit attachment members 39.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The front and rear auxiliary beams 36 and 37 are located rearward of the first lateral beam 33 and frontward of the second lateral beam 34 in the right side deck 30R, and are arranged in parallel while spaced from the lateral beams 33 and 34 in the front-rear direction. Each of the front and rear auxiliary beams 36 and 37 has a plate-like shape extending in the right-left direction, disposed in a horizontal attitude making a thickness direction thereof be parallel to the front-rear direction of the upper frame 30. Each of the auxiliary beams 36 and 37, thus, has a modulus of section smaller than that of each of the first and second lateral beams 33 and 34 which are the original constituent elements of the right side deck 30R. Each of the auxiliary beams 36 and 37 has right and left ends which are welded to be fixed to the right side surface of the right vertical plate 31 and the right frame 38, respectively, similarly to the lateral beams 33 to 35. In other words, the first to third lateral beams 33 to 35 and the front and rear auxiliary beams 36 and 37 have respective inner ends which are joined to a common vertical plate 31 of the two vertical plates 31 (in this embodiment, the right vertical plate 31).<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The plurality of equipment-unit attachment members 39 is disposed at respective positions aligned in the right-left direction between the first lateral beam 33 and the front auxiliary beam 36 and respective positions aligned in the right-left direction between the second lateral beam 34 and the rear auxiliary beam 37.

The mounting plates 41 surround respective mount-member attachment holes 42 into which respective mount members 43 shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref> are fitted. The mount members 43 are made of, for example, rubber. The equipment unit 12 is placed on the mount members 43.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The equipment unit 12 according to the first embodiment is, thus, not disposed on the first and second lateral beams 33 and 34 differently from the comparative example but is placed on the mount member 43 and the equipment-unit attachment member 39 located in a region between the first lateral beam 33 and the front auxiliary beam 36 and a region between the second lateral beam 34 and the rear auxiliary beam 37. Each of the front and rear auxiliary beams 36 and 37 and the equipment-unit attachment members 39 serves as a second beam member having a second placement surface, on which, specifically, on the upper surface of the mounting plate 41, the equipment unit 12 which is the second equipment unit is placed.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The "first placement surface" and the "second placement surface"<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> according to the present invention are respective surfaces which closely face the first and second equipment units, respectively.

This allows the upper surface of the equipment unit 12 to be located at a lower position than the boom-foot-pin hole 32 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref> to thereby prevent the equipment unit 12 from obstructing attachment and detachment of the boom foot pin, with no considerable restriction on the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> height dimension of the equipment unit 12.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Furthermore, since the equipment-unit attachment members 39 forming the second beam member are disposed across the first and second lateral beams 33 and 34 which are original constituent elements of the right side deck 30R and the added auxiliary beams 36 and 37, the first and second lateral beams 33 and 34 can be utilized as a part of the second beam member, that is, as a supporting member for supporting the equipment unit 12.
