Also, it is known that various kinds of pathogenic bacteria, for example salmonellas, colon bacillus, Shigell, clostridium botulinum or the like, tend to breed well, and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">particularly, it has been reported that staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, monococcus, streptococcus or the like breed at a portion which contacts the human body.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, the pathogenic bacteria may harm a user depending on his physical condition, and the pathogenic bacteria may cause various skin ailments or respiratory ailments and may also give serious displeasure in use.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In this regard, many techniques have been disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="KR20040103432"><text>Korean Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2004-0103432</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="KR20100049464"><text>Korean Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2010-0049464</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="KR20100106892"><text>Korean Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2010-0106892</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="KR0568252"><text>Korean Patent Registration No. 0568252</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="KR0393220"><text>Korean Utility Model Registration No. 0393220</text></patcit> or the like.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However the techniques disclosed above mostly adopts chemicals, ultraviolet treatment or ultrasonic washing as a deodorizing, sterilizing, pasteurizing or antibacterial means for removing bad smell or pathogenic bacteria, which requires a complicated structure but does not give a great effect in comparison to costs.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">For this reason, most users prevents pathogenic bacteria from propagating to the entire toilet by manipulating a lever to discharge excretion after closing a toilet bowl cover after defecation. In fact, it has been reported in various papers and mass media that when the toilet bowl cover is closed, the propagation of pathogenic bacteria is reduced in half in comparison to the caser when the toilet bowl cover is not closed.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">However, since it is inconvenient to close a toilet bowl cover each time, users frequently do not close the toilet bowl cover due to cumbersomeness and<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> troublesomeness. Also, even though it is required to pay an attention to close the toilet bowl cover, users may easily forget this, and thus it is practically not easy to close the toilet bowl cover.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Meanwhile, as a technique for removing gas generated during defecation, <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="KR0451717"><text>Korean Utility Model Registration No. 0451717</text></patcit> discloses that a suction hole and a suction line are formed in a toilet bowl sheet, namely in a toilet bowl pedestal, and a circulation tube for sucking and discharging water into/from a water tank is formed, so that when the circulating water circulates through the circulation tube, the gas generated during defecation is absorbed by means of a kind of Venturi effect and thus bad smell is removed.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">However, in this technique, since a water circulating instrument is installed at an outer portion of the water tank, there are some disadvantageous such as complicated structure and bad appearance. In addition, since a circulation hose should be installed through the water tank, it is not easy to give a watertight structure. For this reason, in spite of excellent technical features, the above technique may not be easily commercialized and may be easily neglected by consumers, which results in bad utilization.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In particular, since sucking channels for removing smell are formed in the toilet bowl sheet, there is a structural limit in that the circulating instrument is inevitably provided out of the water tank.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Moreover, an aspirator provided to give Venturi effect must have a check valve in order to prevent the circulating water from flowing backward.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In addition, at the toilet bowl sheet, namely at the toilet bowl pedestal, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(a)</figref>, a protrusion 12 is formed to protrude thereon in order to<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> keep a gap when a lower surface of the toilet bowl pedestal 10 is closed in a parallel state. Also, if there is a groove 14 in state where the lower surface of the toilet bowl pedestal 10 is opened as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(b)</figref>, the protrusion 12 is provided to protrude slightly further to the rim of the toilet bowl pedestal 10 inside the groove 14. For this reason, the existing toilet bowl pedestal 10 inevitably has a gap between the upper surface of the toilet bowl body and the toilet bowl pedestal 10.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Therefore, even though the toilet is flushed to discharge defecation after the toilet bowl cover is closed, bad smell or pathogenic bacteria in the toilet bowl leak through the gap, and thus it is substantially not meaningful to close the toilet bowl cover.</p><heading id="h0003">[Disclosure]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Technical Problem]</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">This disclosure is directed to providing a toilet bowl pedestal for a sanitary toilet bowl, which may have a simple structure to ensure easy installation and use and low manufacture costs, effectively remove bad smell and pathogenic bacteria to protect a human body, and give a pleasant environment to a toilet.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Moreover, the present disclosure is also directed to providing a toilet bowl pedestal, which may greatly contribute to environmental improvement of a toilet by ensuring great sealing, when being installed to a general toilet bowl as well as a sanitary toilet bowl, in spite of its simple structure.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0005">[Technical Solution]</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">In one general aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a sanitary toilet bowl, which includes a toilet bowl body 100, a water tank T for supplying water to the toilet bowl body 100, a main supply tube 300 for connecting the water tank T to the toilet bowl body 100, and an overflow tube 200 connected to one side of the main supply tube 300 and installed in the water tank T to allow water over a predetermined level to overflow to the main supply tube 300, the sanitary toilet bowl comprising: a valve unit 400 mounted to open or close a top of the overflow tube 200 according to a water level in the water tank T;

If the water level reaches a certain level, the supply of water is stopped, and the stopper 310 closes the top of the main supply tube 300 due to its weight.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">At this time, the main supply tube 300 is vacant at ordinary time but allows water to flow only when discharging excretion, and the overflow tube 200 is also filled with water only at overflowing. Therefore, there is no problem in inhaling or exhausting gas through these tubes at ordinary time.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">In this consideration, in the sanitary toilet bowl according to the third embodiment of the present disclosure, the valve unit 400 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3(a)</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref> may be mounted to the top of the overflow tube 200, an air exhaust pipe 900 may be connected to an exhaust port 450 of the valve unit 400 and drawn out of the water tank T, and then the air exhaust pipe 900 may be connected to an air blower 136 at the exterior and drawn out of the toilet through a ventilation hole installed at the toilet.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">At this time, the air blower 136 may be included in the toilet bowl body 100, or may be installed out of the toilet bowl body 100 as depicted in the figure.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">In this case, the air exhaust pipe 900 may be prepared to have a thin and flat shape so as to cause no problem when being drawn out through a gap (within a processing error range) created when a lid of the water tank T is coupled. In addition, in case of a toilet newly built, the air exhaust pipe 900 may be buried in a wall and connected to a ventilation hole. Also, in case of an existing toilet, the air exhaust pipe 900 may be fixed along a wall or ceiling and connected to a ventilation hole through a pipe.</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">As another example, the air exhaust pipe 900 may be drawn into the<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> water tank T, which stores a service water for discharging excretion, instead of a ventilation hole and connected to an air blower 136' in the water, and then a bubble generator AIR may be installed at an end of the air exhaust pipe 900 so that a sucked air containing bad smell and pathogenic bacteria, which has been sucked during defecation, is diluted in the water tank T together with bubbling and then discharged to a septic tank together with excrement.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">If bad smell and pathogenic bacteria are drawn into the water tank T and discharged as described above, bad smell and pathogenic bacteria are not directly discharged to the air, but are discharged to a septic tank together with excrement after staying in the water tank T. For this reason, the possibility that bad smell or pathogenic bacteria is introduced into the toilet is extremely low, which gives better effects in aspect of environment and harmlessness to a human body.</p><heading id="h0012">[Fourth Embodiment]</heading><p id="p0105" num="0105">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10</figref>, a sanitary toilet bowl according to the fourth embodiment of the present disclosure is modified to further include at least one ultraviolet lamp UVL provided at a part of a lower surface of the toilet bowl pedestal employed in the former embodiment, namely the pedestal body 800.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">At this time, the ultraviolet lamp UVL is a lamp for irradiating sterilizing rays of 185.7 nm, and the ultraviolet lamp UVL receives a power to irradiate sterilizing rays for a certain time so that a small amount of residual bad smell and pathogenic bacteria not sucked or discharged but remaining in the toilet bowl body 100 is sterilized, decomposed and removed.<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --></p><p id="p0107" num="0107">For this, the ultraviolet lamp UVL may be controlled to turn on only when bad smell and pathogenic bacteria in the toilet bowl body 100 are sucked and discharged.</p><p id="p0108" num="0108">In other words, the ultraviolet lamp UVL may be designed to irradiate ultraviolet rays within a relatively short time in a state where a user does not seat on the toilet bowl, in consideration of harmfulness of ultraviolet rays to a human, and just operate only when a toilet bowl cover (not shown) provided above the pedestal body 800 is closed. In addition, control logic may be designed to eject water once again into the toilet bowl after irradiating ultraviolet rays. These configurations may be selectively designed depending on specifications of the toilet bowl.</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">Moreover, the ultraviolet lamp UVL may be installed on the air suction chamber 132 to sterilize the inside of the air suction chamber 132 as well as the inside of the toilet bowl body 100, when performing a sterilizing action.</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">In addition, if the bubble generator AIR is installed in the water tank T as shown in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 11</figref>, an ultrasonic generator UT may be installed at one outer side of the water tank T, and when the bubble generator AIR operates, namely when the air blower 136 operates, the ultrasonic generator UT may operate simultaneously. In this case, bad smell and pathogenic bacteria may be dissolved more efficiently.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111">This uses a cavitation phenomenon caused by the generation of ultrasonic waves. The cavitation phenomenon means that, if a strong ultrasonic wave is irradiated into liquid, the ultrasonic wave forms a pressure wave and enhances solvency by promoting generation and extinction of<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> bubbles while repeatedly exhibiting a compression force (positive pressure) and an expansion force (negative pressure) as shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 12</figref>.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">In other words, during a negative pressure period, bubbles are generated around fine impurities in the liquid, and these bubbles become extinct at a next compression period. Such bubbles are repeatedly generated and extinct tens of thousands of times per one second, during which diameters of the bubbles gradually increase.</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">If this phenomenon is shared with the bubble generator AIR, the effect increases several times. In this case, bad smell and pathogenic bacteria sucked and discharged by the toilet bowl of the present disclosure may be perfectly dissolved and removed in the water tank T, and newly generated bubbles have no bad smell and no pathogenic bacteria.</p><p id="p0114" num="0114">Moreover, a sucking and discharging structure may be configured to extend to an outdoor place along a toilet air exhaust pipe, instead of the water tank T, and this is just another modification.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">In other words, a sanitary toilet bowl according to the fourth embodiment of the present disclosure includes an air blower 136 connected to the air suction chamber 132 and installed at a rear end of the pedestal body 800, a ultraviolet lamp UVL designed to irradiate ultraviolet rays only for a certain time after the air blower 136 stops operation, and an air exhaust pipe 900 extending from a discharge end of the air blower 136 and connected into the water tank T, wherein a bubble generator AIR disposed to be soaked in the water tank T is installed at an end of the air exhaust pipe 900.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">As described above, in the present disclosure, bad smell and<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> pathogenic bacteria are discharged to the water tank T, perfectly dissolved therein, and then discharged to a septic tank together with excretion. Therefore, the possibility that bad smell or pathogenic bacteria is introduced into the toilet is extremely low, which gives better effects in aspect of environment and harmlessness to a human body.</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">Further, since a sterilizing function by irradiation of ultraviolet rays is added to the toilet bowl body 100, the toilet culture becomes more sanitary and cleaner, and it is also possible to prevent skin diseases, skin allergies or the like, caused by pathogenic bacteria.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90459803" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A sanitary toilet bowl, which includes a toilet bowl body (100), a water tank (T) for supplying water to the toilet bowl body (100), a main supply tube (300) for connecting the water tank (T) to the toilet bowl body (100), and an overflow tube (200) connected to one side of the main supply tube (300) and installed in the water tank (T) to allow water over a predetermined level to overflow to the main supply tube (300), the sanitary toilet bowl comprising:
