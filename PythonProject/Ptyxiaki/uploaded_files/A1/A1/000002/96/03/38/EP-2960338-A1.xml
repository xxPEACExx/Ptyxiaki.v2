In addition to cellulose and hemicellulose composed of sugars, the cellulose-containing biomass contains a lignin which is aromatic polymer or the like.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> The hydrolysis efficiency by cellulase can thus be improved by pretreating the cellulose-containing biomass.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Examples of the pretreatment method for the cellulose-containing biomass include an acid treatment with sulfuric acid or the like, an alkali treatment with caustic soda, ammonia or the like, a hydrothermal treatment, a subcritical water treatment, a pulverization treatment, and a steam treatment. Preferred for use in the sugar solution production method in the present invention is a dilute sulfuric acid treatment because materials treated with dilute sulfuric acid best improve the reusability of a filamentous fungus-derived cellulase.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The cellulose-containing biomass pretreated material contains a solid component derived from the cellulose-containing biomass, and a solution component that contains xylose generated by the partial hydrolysis of the hemicellulose contained in the cellulose-containing biomass. In the present invention, the pretreated material may directly be used in subsequent steps, or may be used after removing the xylose-containing solution component by solid-liquid separation.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Inactivated cellulase is a cellulase which has lost enzymatic activity. As used herein, inactivated cellulase refers to cellulases with less than 10% remaining enzyme activity (β-glucosidase activity) after treatments that are performed to destabilize the protein structure such as a heat treatment, an alkali treatment, or an acid treatment. The method used to prepare the inactivated cellulase is not particularly limited, and the foregoing exemplary treatments may be used either alone or in combination. In the present invention, it is preferable to use an inactivated cellulase prepared by an alkali treatment. The deactivating temperature and pH of the cellulase depend on the kind of cellulase, and the denaturation conditions may be appropriately set according to the kind of the cellulase to be used.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The kind of the inactivated cellulase to be used in the present invention is not particularly limited. It is, however, preferable that the inactivated cellulase is a filamentous fungus-derived cellulase in order to prevent adsorption of the filamentous<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> fungus-derived cellulase to the pretreated material in the step (2) described below. Among the filamentous fungi-derived inactivated cellulase, β-glucosidase is highly effective in the present invention, and the inactivated cellulase preferably contains at least an inactivated β-glucosidase.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The present invention is intended to reduce the manufacturing cost of a sugar solution, and a low-cost method is preferably used for the preparation of the inactivated cellulase. Specifically, it is preferable to prepare the inactivated cellulase by dipping the hydrolysis residue obtained in the below described step (3) in an alkaline aqueous solution having a pH 11 or more. This is preferable because the filamentous fungus-derived cellulase used for the cellulose hydrolysis is partially adsorbed to the hydrolysis residue from the step (3), and can be reused as the inactivated cellulase.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The temperature of dipping the hydrolysis residue into the alkaline aqueous solution is not particularly limited, as long as the filamentous fungus-derived cellulase adsorbed to the hydrolysis residue is desorbed and inactivated. However, the effects of the present invention may not be fully obtained when the dipping temperature is excessively high because the inactivated cellulase desorbed from the hydrolysis residue undergoes heat decomposition. Thus, the dipping temperature is preferably less than 65°C.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The dipping time of the hydrolysis residue is not particularly limited. It is, however, preferable to dip the hydrolysis residue for 10 minutes to 6 hours, more preferably 30 minutes to 3 hours because the recovery of the inactivated cellulase may become insufficient when the dipping time is too short, and the inactivated cellulase may undergo heat decomposition when the dipping time is excessively long.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The dipping of the hydrolysis residue may be performed by using conventional methods. For example, the hydrolysis residue may be recovered to a dipping tank, and stirred after adding an alkaline aqueous solution. Alternatively, the hydrolysis residue may be dipped by passing an alkaline aqueous solution through a pressure filtration device after solid-liquid separation, as described in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO2011115039A"><text>WO2011/115039</text></patcit>.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The solid concentration of the slurry containing the cellulose-containing biomass pretreated material and the inactivated cellulase is not particularly limited, however, is preferably 1 to 30 weight%. When the concentration of the solid matter is low, the concentration of sugar generated by the hydrolysis is low, and thus, such a case may not be suitable to provide a raw fermentation material. On the other hand, when the concentration is excessively high, handling may be difficult.</p><heading id="h0013">Step (2): Step of hydrolyzing the slurry in the step (1) by adding a filamentous fungus-derived cellulase to the slurry</heading><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the present invention, a filamentous fungus-derived cellulase is used for the hydrolysis of the cellulose-containing biomass. Examples of the filamentous fungus include microorganisms of the genera <i>Trichoderma, Aspergillus, Cellulomonas, Chlostridium, Streptomyces, Humicola, Acremonium, Irpex, Mucor,</i> and <i>Talaromyces.</i> The cellulase may be of mutant strains of improved cellulase productivity obtained by treating these microorganisms with a mutagen or by UV irradiation.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Preferred for use as the filamentous fungus in the present invention is the genus <i>Trichoderma</i> for its ability to produce large quantities of an enzyme component of high specific activity in a culture for cellulose hydrolysis. Specific examples of the genus <i>Trichoderma</i>-derived cellulases include cellulases derived from <i>Trichoderma reesei</i> QM 9414, <i>Trichoderma reesei</i> QM 9123, <i>Trichoderma reesei</i> Rut C-30, <i>Trichoderma reesei</i> PC 3-7, <i>Trichoderma reesei</i> CL-847, <i>Trichoderma reesei</i> MCG 77, <i>Trichoderma reesei</i> MCG 80, and <i>Trichoderma viride</i> QM 9123. Particularly preferred are cellulases derived from <i>Trickoderma reesei.</i></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The filamentous fungus-derived cellulase is an enzyme composition having an activity to produce monosaccharides such as glucose and xylose through hydrolysis of cellulose and/or hemicellulose, and preferably contains at least one enzyme component selected from the group consisting of cellobiohydrolase, endoglucanase, β-glucosidase, xylanase, and β-xylosidase. Examples of such enzyme components of Trichoderma reesei-derived cellulase include cellobiohydrolase I, cellobiohydrolase II,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> endoglucanase I, endoglucanase III, β-glucosidase, xylanase, and β-xylosidase.
