In outdoor shoes, an outer sole made of synthetic resin and the like is attached to the sole cover section of the shoe upper. In recent years, attempts have been made to form the instep cover section, of the instep cover section and the sole cover section configuring the shoe upper, with one knitted fabric to manufacture the shoe with high productivity. For example, in Patent Document 1, the instep cover section in a planar developed state is manufactured with one knitted fabric, and such instep cover section is joined to the outer sole made of synthetic resin and the like along with the sole cover section to complete the shoe.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The shoe upper is configured with a knitting yarn containing a thermal adhesive yarn and a non-thermal adhesive yarn, and is molded by thermal treatment after the knitting. As a result, the shape of the stitches configuring the shoe upper, that is, the shape of the shoe upper is less likely to lose shape. Such shoe upper has a few areas where strength is particularly desired. For example, in Patent Document 1, an inlay knitting yarn (reinforcement knitting yarn) is interwoven at a portion from the vicinity of an eyelet for passing a shoelace to a side surface of the instep cover section so that the relevant portion is reinforced.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0003">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT DOCUMENT</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">[Patent Document 1] International Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2012125473A"><text>2012/125473</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">When reinforcing a part of the shoe upper using the inlay knitting yarn, a high-tension yarn is generally used for the inlay knitting yarn. A pulling force that acts on the shoe upper is received by the high-tension inlay knitting yarn to suppress the stretching of the shoe upper. However, in such reinforcement method, a plurality of inlay knitting yarns having different tensions needs to be used when changing the reinforcement degree of each reinforcing area in the shoe upper which has a plurality of reinforcement areas, or when partially changing the reinforcement degree of one reinforcement area. Since the number of yarn feeders that can be arranged in a flat knitting machine is limited, when knitting a colorful shoe upper, for example, the number of yarn feeders for reinforcement may become insufficient if the number of yarn feeders for color is increased, and the number of yarn feeders for color may become insufficient if the number of yarn feeders for reinforcement is increased.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention has been made in light of the above circumstances and an object of the present invention is to provide a method for knitting a shoe upper that can allow the reinforcement degree of the shoe upper to be changed with a small number of yarn feeders.</p><heading id="h0007">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007"><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> An aspect of the present invention relates to a method for knitting a shoe upper for knitting a shoe upper including an instep cover section that covers a portion on an instep side of a wearer and a sole cover section that covers a sole of the wearer. In the method for knitting the shoe upper of the present invention, the instep cover section and the sole cover section are three-dimensionally knitted in a seamless manner; and in the knitting process, at least one base section configuring a part of the shoe upper is knitted using a base knitting yarn containing a non-thermal adhesive yarn and a thermal adhesive yarn, and a reinforcement knitting yarn containing a thermal adhesive yarn is interwoven in the base section to carry out at least one of a reinforcement operation I and a reinforcement operation II, described below, for reinforcing the base section.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">[Reinforcement operation I] reinforcement operation of partially changing a reinforcement degree of the base section by making the number of knitting with the reinforcement knitting yarn with respect to at least some stitch rows, of a plurality of stitch rows configuring the base section, different from the number of knitting with the reinforcement knitting yarn with respect to the other stitch rows.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">[Reinforcement operation II] reinforcement operation of, when knitting a plurality of base sections in the shoe upper, changing a reinforcement degree of each base section by making the number of knitting with the reinforcement knitting yarn with respect to some base sections different from the number of knitting with the reinforcement knitting yarn with respect to the other base sections.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to one aspect of the method for knitting the shoe upper of the present invention, the base section, in which the reinforcement knitting yarn is interwoven, is knitted across the instep cover section and the sole cover section.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to another aspect of the method for knitting the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> shoe upper of the present invention, the reinforcement knitting yarn contains a non-thermal adhesive yarn.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to another aspect of the method for knitting the shoe upper according to the present invention, the reinforcement knitting yarn is interwoven in the base section by tuck knitting. For example, when carrying out the reinforcement operation I using the tuck knitting, the tuck knitting for two courses (number of knitting = 2) of reciprocating the yarn feeder with respect to the n<sup>th</sup> stitch row of the base section is carried out, and then the tuck knitting for three courses (number of knitting = 3) is carried out with respect to the n + 1<sup>th</sup> stitch row.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to another aspect of the method for knitting the shoe upper of the present invention, the reinforcement knitting yarn is interwoven in the base section by inlay knitting. For example, when carrying out the reinforcement operation I using the inlay knitting, the inlay knitting for two courses (number of knitting = 2) is carried out with respect to the n<sup>th</sup> stitch row of the base section, and then the inlay knitting for three courses (number of knitting = 3) is carried out with respect to the n + 1<sup>th</sup> stitch row.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The tuck knitting and the inlay knitting can be carried out in combination. For example, both the tuck knitting and the inlay knitting may be carried out with respect to a specific stitch row configuring the base section.</p><heading id="h0008">EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to the method for knitting the shoe upper of the present invention, the reinforcement degree of the shoe upper can be changed with a small number of yarn feeders. This is because the reinforcement degree of the base section can be changed by the number of knitting of interweaving the reinforcement knitting yarn<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> in the base section, whereby the number of reinforcement knitting yarns corresponding to the number of changes in the reinforcement degree does not need to be prepared. For example, if the shoe upper includes four base sections and the reinforcement degree of each base section is to be changed, the number of reinforcement knitting yarns to be prepared (i.e., number of yarn feeders to be prepared for reinforcement) can be three or less, or ultimately even one.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In the method for knitting the shoe upper of the present invention, the base knitting yarn for configuring the base section and the reinforcement knitting yarn for reinforcing the base section both contain the thermal adhesive yarn, which greatly contributes to changing the reinforcement degree of the base section. When the shoe upper knitted through the method for knitting the shoe upper according to the present invention is subjected to thermal treatment, the thermal adhesive yarn contained in the base knitting yarn melts, so that the shape and the arrangement state of the stitches of the base section formed with the non-thermal adhesive yarn contained in the base knitting yarn are fixed. At the same time, the thermal adhesive yarn contained in the reinforcement knitting yarn also melts, so that the shape and the arrangement state of the stitches of the base section are reinforced. In this case, the amount of thermal adhesive yarn that melts when the thermal treatment is carried out increases and the reinforcement effect increases by increasing the number of knitting with the reinforcement knitting yarn. That is, higher reinforcement effect can be obtained by increasing the number of knitting with the reinforcement knitting yarn containing the thermal adhesive yarn than by simply increasing the number of knitting with the reinforcement knitting yarn that does not contain the thermal adhesive yarn.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As opposed to the method for knitting the shoe upper of the present invention, if the reinforcement knitting yarn does not<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> contain the thermal adhesive yarn, and the proportion of the thermal adhesive yarn in the base knitting yarn is increased without changing the thickness of the base knitting yarn (i.e., proportion of the non-thermal adhesive yarn is reduced), the stitches of the base section formed with the non-thermal adhesive yarn become narrow and the reinforcement of the base section lowers. If the absolute amount of the thermal adhesive yarn in the base knitting yarn is increased, the base knitting yarn becomes thick and the knitting of the base section may become difficult to carry out. Such problems do not arise in the method for knitting the shoe upper of the present invention in which the reinforcement knitting yarn contains the thermal adhesive yarn.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the method for knitting the shoe upper of the present invention in which the base section is knitted across the instep cover section and the sole cover section, the pulling force that acts on the base section can be dispersed, and the shape and the arrangement of the stitches of the base section are less likely to lose shape.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to the method for knitting the shoe upper of the present invention in which the reinforcement knitting yarn contains the non-thermal adhesive yarn, the pulling force that acts on the base section can be received by the non-thermal adhesive yarn of the reinforcement knitting yarn, and the shape and the arrangement of the stitches of the base section are less likely to lose shape.</p><heading id="h0009">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0020" num="0020"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a schematic top perspective view of a shoe upper shown in a first embodiment.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a knitting process image view schematically showing a knitting process of the shoe upper of the first embodiment.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a knitting process view of when an inlay knitting<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> is carried out to knit a reinforcement section of the shoe upper.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">Hereinafter, an embodiment of a method for knitting a shoe upper of the present invention will be described based on the drawings. A two-bed flat knitting machine including at least a pair of a front and a back needle bed and in which stitches can be transferred between the front and back needle beds is used in the method for knitting the shoe upper. Of course, the flat knitting machine to be used is not limited to the two-bed flat knitting machine, and may be, for example, a four-bed flat knitting machine.</p><heading id="h0011">&lt;First embodiment&gt;</heading><heading id="h0012">&lt;&lt;Overall configuration&gt;&gt;</heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">A shoe upper 1 of the present embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> includes an instep cover section 3 that covers a portion on an instep side of a wearer, and a sole cover section 2 that covers a portion of a sole of the wearer. The shoe upper 1 differs from the conventional shoe upper in the following two points.
<ol><li>[1] The instep cover section 3 and the sole cover section 2 are three-dimensionally knitted in a seamless manner.</li><li>[2] A base section 10 reinforced by interweaving a reinforcement knitting yarn containing a thermal adhesive yarn exists in plurals in the shoe upper 1, where a reinforcement degree of each base section 10 is different.</li></ol></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The shoe upper 1 of the first embodiment is three-dimensionally knitted in a seamless manner because a heel cover portion 3H extending from an upper end to a lower end of the instep cover section 3 is formed at a position corresponding to a region from an Achilles tendon to the heel of the wearer in the instep cover section 3 of the shoe upper 1. A portion excluding the heel cover portion 3H is a body portion 3B. The heel cover<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> portion 3H has a knitting width of a predetermined width, for example, three or more stitches, and the direction of the stitches of a knitting structure configuring the heel cover portion 3H is directed in a height direction (downward) of the shoe upper (see circled enlarged view on upper side).</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">At an edge L1, which is a boundary of the heel cover portion 3H and the sole cover section 2, a starting end in a wale direction of the sole cover section 2 is connected in continuation to a terminating end in a wale direction of the heel cover portion 3H. At edges L2, L3, which are boundaries of the heel cover portion 3H and the body portion 3B, a starting end in the wale direction of the body portion 3B is connected in continuation to an end (side end) in a knitting width direction of the heel cover portion 3H. Thus, the direction of the stitches of the heel cover portion 3H is directed in the height direction of the shoe upper 1, whereas the direction of the stitches of the body portion 3B is directed in a length direction (forward) of the shoe upper 1 (see circled enlarged view on lower side).

The second area is a portion that surrounds a portion slightly heel side of the root of the toe of the wearer. This portion serves to fix the shoe upper 1 to the foot so that the foot of the wearer does not shift forward or backward inside the shoe upper 1, where the shoe upper 1 cannot be fixed to the foot if the relevant portion is stretched. The base section 10 is reinforced using the reinforcement knitting yarn containing the thermal adhesive yarn so that the base section 10 in the two areas does not easily stretch.

In reinforcement, the base section 10 is knitted using a base knitting yarn containing the thermal adhesive yarn and the non-thermal adhesive yarn, and the base section 10 is reinforced by interweaving the reinforcement knitting yarn containing the thermal adhesive yarn in the base section 10.

The non-thermal adhesive yarn may be a yarn that does not soften at the softening temperature of the thermal adhesive yarn, for example, a yarn that is less likely to stretch such as polyester yarn and the like, and an elastic yarn such as a polyurethane yarn. The thermal adhesive yarn and the non-thermal adhesive yarn may be appropriately combined to obtain the base knitting yarn and the reinforcement knitting yarn. The thickness and the number of the thermal adhesive yarn and the non-thermal adhesive yarn also can be appropriately selected.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">When reinforcing the base section 10 using the reinforcement knitting yarn containing at least the thermal adhesive yarn, tuck knitting or inlay knitting is representatively carried out to interweave the reinforcement knitting yarn in the base section 10.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In the reinforcement using the tuck knitting, the reinforcement knitting yarn is tucked to at least some stitches<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> (may be all stitches) of the base section 10 held on the knitting needles of the needle beds. For example, after knitting the base section 10 made of only the base knitting yarn, the tuck knitting is carried out on the base section 10. Alternatively, after knitting the base section 10 in which the reinforcement knitting yarn is interwoven in the base knitting yarn by plating knitting, the tuck knitting may be further carried out using only the reinforcement knitting yarn on the base section 10. The plating knitting is a known knitting method of simultaneously moving the yarn feeder of the base knitting yarn and the yarn feeder of the reinforcement knitting yarn to knit the knitted fabric. Reference is to be made to International Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2008139710A"><text>2008/139710</text></patcit>, for example, for the plating knitting. The number of knitting (number of courses) with the reinforcement knitting yarn with respect to the stitch rows configuring the base section 10 may be changed in order to change the reinforcement degree of the base section 10.

According to such knitting, the sole cover section 2 is knitted following the edge L1 of the heel cover portion 3H, the body portion 3B is knitted following the edges L2, L3, and the g-h of the main body back part region γ of the body section 3 is joined to the c-d of the insert section 4, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.
