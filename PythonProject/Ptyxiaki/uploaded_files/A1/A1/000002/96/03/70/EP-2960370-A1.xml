In many cases, the jacket has two purposes: first, it is intended to electrically isolate the rail relative to the ground material in the vicinity, and second, it is intended to mitigate transmission of vibrations from the rail to the ground material.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As is well known in the art, when a train wheel rolls over the rail, the train wheel causes the rail to vibrate. Typically, the vibrations are transmitted through the rail, and generally (but not entirely) propagated or transmitted through the jacket or boot to the ground material. In the prior art, such vibrations (or portions thereof, as the case may be) are then transmitted or propagated through the ground material. The vibrations may be significant enough to disturb those located a short distance away from the prior art rail. For example, where a streetcar or LRT travels on a city street, e.g., past a hospital or a school, the vibrations generated by the rolling engagement of the train wheels with the rail may be generally transmitted through the ground material, to potentially disturb people located in the hospital or in the school.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">There have been attempts to partially isolate, or attenuate, vibrations by modifying the jacket or boot. However, there are some disadvantages to the conventional jackets or boots. For example, the conventional boots used in North America generally do not attenuate vibrations well, particularly at lower ambient temperatures. This is because the materials that the boots are typically made of are materials that are relatively easily extrudable, but such materials tend to become rigid and brittle in cold weather. It has been found that, in these conditions, the typical boot does not attenuate vibrations well. Also, certain of the conventional boots generally do not, seamlessly and without any interruption or<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> break thereof, isolate the rail from the ground material. Interruptions in the conventional boots undermine their effectiveness. In summary, the conventional boots provide generally inadequate or inconsistent attenuation of vibrations.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">There is a need for a rail system that overcomes or mitigates one or more of the disadvantages or defects of the prior art. Such disadvantages or defects are not necessarily included in those described above.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In its broad aspect, the invention provides a rail assembly including one or more rail bodies formed for supporting rolling engagement of a train wheel thereover, the rolling engagement generating vibrations in the rail body. The rail assembly also includes one or more boots formed for attachment to the rail body to substantially electrically isolate the rail body relative to ground material. The boot includes a chamber wall for at least partially defining a chamber between the rail body and the chamber wall when the boot is attached to the rail body. In addition, the rail assembly includes one or more inserts positionable in the chamber, at least a part of the vibrations being transmittable to the insert when the insert is positioned in the chamber, for dissipation of at least a proportion of the part of the vibrations in the insert.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In another aspect, the invention provides a rail assembly including one or more rail bodies at least partially supportable by ground material, the rail body being formed for supporting rolling engagement of a train wheel thereover, and the rolling engagement generating vibrations in the rail body. The rail assembly also includes one or more boots formed for attachment with the rail body to substantially electrically isolate the rail body relative to the ground material. The boot includes a foot portion at least partially engageable with the rail body when the boot is attached to the rail body.

In addition, the rail assembly includes one or more inserts positionable in the chamber. Each insert includes one or more fluids positioned in one or more cavities in the insert, and one or more engagement elements formed for engagement with the rail body for transmission of a part of the vibrations to the fluid, in which at least a proportion of the part of the vibrations are dissipatable.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In yet another of its aspects, the invention provides a rail system including one or more rail assemblies extending along a predetermined path between a first end and a second end thereof.

Reference is made to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">Figs. 1-2C</figref> to describe an embodiment of a rail assembly in accordance with the invention indicated generally by the numeral 20 (<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2B</figref>). In one embodiment, the rail assembly 20 preferably includes one or more rail bodies 22. The<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> rail body 22 preferably is formed for supporting rolling engagement of a train wheel 32 thereover, the rolling engagement generating vibrations in the rail body 22. It is also preferred that the rail assembly 20 includes one or more boots 34 formed for attachment to the rail body 22 to substantially electrically isolate the rail body 22 relative to ground material 21. Each boot 34 preferably includes a chamber wall 38 to at least partially define a chamber 40 between the foot 28 and the chamber wall 38 when the boot 34 is attached to the rail body 22 (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref>). The rail assembly 20 preferably also includes one or more inserts 42 positionable in the chamber 40. At least a part of the vibrations is transmittable to the insert 42 when it is positioned in the chamber 40, for dissipation of at least a proportion of the part of the vibrations in the insert 42.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In one embodiment, the insert 42 preferably includes one or more engagement elements 44 formed for engagement with the rail body 22 when the insert 42 is positioned in the chamber 40, for transmission of the part of the vibrations thereto. As will be described, the boot 34 preferably includes a first material that is formulated for extrusion. It is also preferred that the engagement elements 44 preferably include a second material that is formulated for at least partial dissipation of vibrations transmitted thereto.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is also preferred that the insert 42 additionally includes one or more cavities 46 having one or more fluids 48 therein engaged with the engagement element 44, for transmission thereto of the proportion of the part of the vibrations and dissipation of the proportion of said part of the vibrations in the fluid 48.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Preferably, the rail body 22 is at least partially supportable by the ground material 21. In another embodiment, the rail assembly 20 of the invention preferably includes the boot 34, formed for attachment to the rail body 22. Preferably, the boot 34 includes a foot portion 36 that is at least partially engageable with the rail body 22, when the boot 34 is attached to the rail body 22. It is also preferred that the chamber wall 38 is included in the foot portion 36. Preferably, the insert 42 includes one or more fluids 48 positioned in the cavities 46 in the insert 42. It is also preferred that the engagement element 44 is engageable with the rail body 22, for transmission of the part of the vibrations to the fluid 48, in which at least the proportion of the part of the vibrations are dissipatable, as will be described. As noted above, in one embodiment, the boot 34 preferably is at least partially made of a first material that is formulated for extrusion, and the engagement elements 44<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> preferably are at least partially made of a second material that is formulated for at least partial dissipation of vibrations transmitted thereto.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Those skilled in the art would appreciate that the rail body 22 may have any suitable configuration. As an example, in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref>, the rail body 22 illustrated preferably has a head 26 and a foot 28 connected by a web 30.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">Figs. 1-2C</figref>, it is preferred that the boot 34 is engaged with the rail body 22. Those skilled in the art would appreciate that the boot 34 preferably is made of any suitably resilient and flexible material. Preferably, the boot 34 is formed so that it will securely attach to the rail body 22, due to the resilient nature of the material and the shape and size of the boot 34. In particular, the boot 34 preferably is formed to fit securely onto a rail having a particular rail profile. It has been found to be advantageous if the material forming the boot is relatively easily extrudable. For example, thermoplastic vulcanizate may be suitable. This may be advantageous, for example, if the boot 34 is relatively long. For instance, depending on the application, the boot may be approximately 300 feet long. Those skilled in the art would appreciate that the boot may have any suitable length.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The boot 34 may be attached to the rail body 22 by positioning the insert 42 on the chamber wall 38, and opening the boot 34 to the widest extent possible. (It will be understood that the insert may be positioned on the chamber wall 38 before the boot 34 is opened.) The opened boot 34, with the insert 42 located on the chamber wall 38, preferably is moved upwardly (i.e., in the direction indicated by arrow "A" in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) until the boot 34 is in position on the rail body 22, and attached to the rail body 22, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref>. It will be understood that, in one embodiment, the boot 34 preferably is "attached" or positioned on to the rail body 22 by the boot 34 fitting the rail body 22 in a relatively tight friction fit. That is, the boot 34 preferably is held against the rail body 22 or positioned thereon due to the shape and resilience of the boot 34 and friction, as the boot 34 is formed to securely engage the rail body 22. It will be understood that, as the boot 34 is positioned on the rail body 22, the insert 42 is securely engaged with the rail body 22. This engagement takes place because, as the boot 34 is pulled onto the rail body 22, the insert 42 is pushed against the rail body 22 by the chamber wall 38. As will be described further below, it is preferred that the insert 42 remains securely engaged with the rail body 22, in order that part of the vibrations may be transmitted or propagated to the insert 42.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The insert 42 preferably is made of any suitable material, e.g., any suitably resilient and flexible material. In particular, it is preferred that at least the engagement elements 44 are made of any suitable material with good vibration-attenuating characteristics over a wide range of temperatures, e.g., natural rubber. Those skilled in the art would be aware of suitable materials. For instance, instead of natural rubber, a suitable synthetic rubber or polyurethane may be used. It is preferred that the material has excellent vibration attenuation characteristics over a wide range of temperatures that may be encountered in use. The insert 42 preferably is formed so that, when it is in the chamber 40, the insert 42 is securely engaged with the rail body 22. It will be understood that, once the boot 34 is on the rail body 22, the insert 42 preferably is positioned in the chamber 40 so that the engagement elements 44 are securely engaged with the rail body 22.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The insert may have any desired length. Accordingly, unlike the boot, in practice, the insert does not necessarily have to be relatively easily extrudable. This difference is significant because it means that the insert may be made of a variety of materials selected for their flexibility over a wide temperature range, and regardless of their extrudability. However, the material(s) selected to be included in the engagement elements 44 also are required to be sufficiently rigid and strong to support the rail body 22.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">For these reasons, it is preferred that the insert is made of natural rubber, or a suitable synthetic rubber or polyurethane. These materials tend to vibrate well, even in cold weather, and they are therefore preferred for use in the insert.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In summary, in one embodiment, the first material preferably is thermoplastic vulcanizate, and the second material is selected from the group consisting of natural rubber, synthetic rubber, and polyurethane. Typically, the thermoplastic vulcanizate has a tensile strength of about 1,150 psi, and a tear strength of about 140 pli (pounds per linear inch). The hardness of the thermoplastic vulcanizate is approximately 73 Shore A.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">It will be understood that, in selecting the material out of which the engagement elements 44 of the insert 42 are to be made, a number of competing factors are to be considered. As noted above, the boot 34 preferably is made of a relatively easily extrudable material, e.g., thermoplastic vulcanizate. Those skilled in the art would be aware that the thermoplastic vulcanizate is relatively strong and tough, however, it is not particularly resilient or flexible at lower temperatures, e.g., at about 0° C or lower. In<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> particular, and as described above, the boot material generally becomes relatively stiff at lower temperatures. As also noted above, the material selected for use in the engagement elements 44 of the insert 42 preferably are adapted to vibrate (i.e., to a limited extent) when the vibrations are transmitted thereto, even in cold weather. However, because the insert 42 is also required to support the rail body 22, the material selected for the engagement elements 44 is also required to be sufficiently rigid that the engagement elements 44 can support the rail body 22 so that the rail body 22 only moves a limited extent vertically, when a train wheel passes thereover.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As noted above, the insert may be made of various materials, or combinations of materials. It is believed that a suitable second material preferably has a tensile strength of approximately 1,500 psi, a tear strength of approximately 150 pli (pounds per linear inch), and a hardness between approximately 60 and approximately 70 Shore A.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Those skilled in the art would appreciate that the tooling that is needed in order to extrude the boot is relatively expensive. As is known, such tooling is used to form the first material into the boot. Because of the relatively high cost of the tooling for the boot, it is preferred that changes in the design of the boot are kept to a minimum.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">However, in contrast to the relatively high cost of the tooling for the boot, the tooling for the insert is relatively inexpensive. As a practical matter, this means that the design of the boot preferably is generally unchanged (i.e., unless necessary), but various designs of the insert may be used, depending on the vibration isolation requirements of a particular installation. In short, changes in the insert design are more economically feasible than changes in the boot design.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In an alternative embodiment, the boot and the insert preferably are made of the same material(s). From the foregoing, it can be seen that this may be advantageous where, for instance, it may be acceptable to make the boot and the insert of thermoplastic vulcanizate. For example, where the rail system is to be installed in an area with a relatively warm climate, but the vibration isolation (or vibration attenuation) requirements are relatively low (i.e., a relatively low proportion of the vibrations are required to be dissipated), then the insert and the boot may be made of the same material, i.e., thermoplastic vulcanizate. This may be cost-effective, but as noted above, it is unlikely to be feasible in an installation where<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> temperatures are likely to be below 0° C for extended periods. However, the insert may have various configurations, depending on the extent to which the vibrations are to be attenuated.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As noted above, the tooling for the boot is much more expensive than the tooling for the insert. Accordingly, even where the insert and the boot are made of the same material(s), it is advantageous to form them separately because, in this embodiment, the insert's design can be changed (to provide different levels of vibration attenuation) at lower cost.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">As indicated above, the rail assembly 20 is supportable by the ground material 21. Those skilled in the art would appreciate that the rail assembly 20 may be directly or indirectly supported by the ground material 21. It would also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the insert 42 and the boot 34 of the invention preferably are installed with, or as part of, "embedded" track, i.e., where the rail body 22, with the boot 34 thereon and the insert 42 in the chamber 40, are substantially surrounded on the bottom and on two sides thereof by concrete or a similar material that supports the rail body 22, with the boot 34 thereon. (Those skilled in the art would appreciate that the upper surfaces of the rail body 22 are exposed.) Those skilled in the art would appreciate that this construction is preferably utilized in an urban environment, because the need to attenuate the vibrations typically arises in connection with track located in an urban setting. In this arrangement, the boot (with the insert therein, attached to the rail body) preferably is installed in its design position before the concrete (i.e., the ground material) that is to surround it on two, or possibly three sides, is poured. The pressure of the freshly poured concrete (i.e., before it has cured and hardened) tends to assist in holding the boot on the rail body shortly after installation. However, the rail assembly 20 may be only indirectly supported by the ground material 21.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">For the purposes hereof, a "train wheel" means any wheel on any vehicle that moves over the rail body and is guided by the rail body, e.g., a railway car, a light rail vehicle, a tram car, or a streetcar. It will be understood that the train wheel 32 may have any suitable form, and that the train wheel 32 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2B</figref>, and the rail body 22, are exemplary only.

As will be described, the insert 42 is formed to at least partially isolate the ground material 21 from the vibrations produced in the rail body 22 by rolling engagement of the train wheel 32 with the rail body 22. This is achieved by providing the boot 34 and the insert 42 to which part of the vibrations are transmitted, and dissipating at least a proportion of the transmitted part of the vibrations in the insert 42. (Those skilled in the art would appreciate that, in practice, only a part of the vibrations is transmitted or propagated to the insert, and also that, of the part transmitted, only a proportion thereof is dissipated in the insert.) Accordingly, and as can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 2B</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">2C</figref>, it is preferred that the insert 42 is securely engaged with the foot 28, to permit transmission of at least part of the vibrations to the engagement element(s) 44 of the insert 42.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">It is believed that, because the engagement element 44 is securely engaged with the foot 28, the part of the vibrations that is transmitted from the foot 28 to the engagement element 44 represents a substantial portion of the vibrations.

For the purposes hereof, it will be understood that references to "a" fluid or "the" fluid will be understood to include references to a mixture of a plurality of fluids (gases), e.g., air.

That is, because the engagement elements 44 preferably are a resilient elastomer (e.g., a suitable rubber), such elements vibrate (i.e., more than the rail body) when the vibrations propagate through them, thereby dissipating some of the energy of the vibrations. Once the part of the vibrations is transmitted to the fluid, such part is propagated through the fluid, and because it is a fluid, at least a substantial segment of the remaining energy of the vibration is dissipated in the fluid.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Accordingly, and as schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 2C</figref>, the proportion of the part of the vibrations preferably are dissipated in the fluid 48. That is, the part of the vibrations is propagated or transmitted to the engagement element 44, and because the fluid 48 is positioned adjacent to and engaged with the engagement element 44, the proportion of the part of the vibrations is also propagated or transmitted to the fluid 48, where the fluid 48 is readily shaken by the proportion of the part of the vibrations transmitted thereto, so that such proportion is thereby dissipated in the fluid 48.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Those skilled in the art would appreciate that a number of alternative arrangements regarding the cavities in the inserts are possible. For example, instead of the engagement elements being positioned adjacent to cavities, the insert may comprise engagement elements positioned adjacent to pockets of softer or less rigid material, corresponding to the cavities. In this embodiment, the pockets of softer material would serve the function of dissipating, to an extent, the part of the vibrations transmitted or propagated to them.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In another alternative embodiment, the cavities preferably are not open to the atmosphere, but instead are sealed off from the atmosphere, and include one or more fluids therein selected for dissipating such part of the vibrations as are transmitted thereto.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">For example, in one embodiment, the softer material in the pockets preferably is a suitable foam rubber, i.e., a natural latex or polyurethane having small, generally closed cells therein due to its processing, as is known.
