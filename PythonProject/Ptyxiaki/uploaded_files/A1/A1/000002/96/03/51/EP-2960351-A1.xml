In order to make it easy to process brass, brass usually contains 2-3% lead to enhance strength and processability. Lead-containing brass has excellent moldability (making it easy to fabricate products of various shapes), cutting performance, and abrasion resistance, so that it is widely applied to mechanical part with various shapes, accounts for a large proportion in the copper industry, and is well known as one of the most important basic material in the world. However, during the production or use of lead-containing brass, lead tends to dissolve in the solid or gas state. Medical studies have shown that lead can bring about substantial damage to the human hematopoietic and nervous systems, especially children's kidneys and other organs. Many countries in the world take the pollution and hazard caused by lead very seriously. The National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) sets a tolerance of lead element of 0.25% or less. Organizations like the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) of European Union successively stipulate, restrict and prohibit the usage of brass with a high lead content.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Furthermore, when the zinc content in brass exceeds 20 wt%, the corrosion phenomenon of dezincification is prone to occur. Especially when brass is exposed to the chloride rich environment, e.g. marine environment, the occurrence of corrosion phenomenon of dezincification may be accelerated. Dezincification may severely destroy the structure of brass alloy, so that the surface strength of brass products is reduced and the brass tube even perforates. This greatly reduces the lifetime of brass products and causes problems in application.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Therefore, there is a need to provide an alloy formula for solving the above problems, which can replace the brass with a high lead content, is dezincification corrosion resistant, and further has excellent casting performance, forgeability, cutting performance, corrosion resistance and mechanical properties.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>SU MMARY OF INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">As known in the prior art, silicon may appear in the alloy metallographic structure as γ phase (sometimes as κ phase). In this case, silicon may replace the function of lead in the alloy to an extent, and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> improve cutting performance of the alloy. Cutting performance of the alloy increases with the content of silicon. However, silicon has a high melting point and a low specific gravity and is prone to be oxidized. As a result, after silicon monomer is added into the furnace in the alloy melting process, silicon floats on the surface of alloy. When the alloy is melt, silicon will be oxidized into silicon oxides or other oxides, making it difficult to produce silicon-containing copper alloy. In case silicon is added in the form of Cu-Si alloy, the economic cost is increased.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Bismuth can be added to replace lead for forming cutting breakpoints in the alloy structure to improve cutting performance. However, thermal cracking is prone to occur during forging in case of a high bismuth content, which is not conducive for producing.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Thus, it is an object of the invention to provide a brass alloy which exhibits excellent performance like tensile strength, elongation rate, dezincification resistance and cutting performance, which is suitable for cutting processed products that require high strength and wear resistance, and which is suitable for constituent materials for forged products and cast products. The brass alloy of the invention can securely replace the alloy copper with a high lead content, and can completely meet the demands about restrictions on lead-containing products in the development of human society.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">To achieve the above object, the inventors have proposed the following low-lead bismuth-free silicon-free brass alloys.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A low-lead bismuth-free silicon-free brass alloy with excellent cutting performance (hereinafter referred to as the inventive product 1) comprises, by the total weight of the brass alloy, 60-65 wt% copper, 0.1-0.25 wt% lead, 0.1-0.7 wt% aluminum, 0.05-0.5 wt% tin, and a balance of zinc.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the inventive product 1, the content of lead is reduced to 0.1-0.25 wt%, the content of copper is controlled at 60-65 wt%, and a small quantity of aluminum and tin is added to improve cutting performance of the alloy. The metallographic structure of the alloy mainly comprises α phase, β phase, γ phase, and soft and brittle intermetallic compounds which are distributed in grain boundaries or grains. Copper and zinc make main constituents of the brass alloy.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Adding tin into the alloy can form γ phase, thus increasing cutting performance of the alloy. In addition, the addition of tin obviously increases strength, plasticity, and corrosion resistance of the alloy. However, since adding tin may increase cost, aluminum is added along with tin. As a result, not only cutting performance of the alloy can be improved, but also strength, wear resistance, cast flowability, and high temperature oxidation resistance of the alloy can be increased. In order to make a better use of the above effects, the content of tin and aluminum is 0.05-0.5 wt% and 0.1-0.7 wt%, respectively.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A low-lead bismuth-free silicon-free brass alloy with excellent cutting performance (hereinafter referred to as the inventive product 2) comprises, by the total weight of the brass alloy, 60-65 wt% copper, 0.1-0.25 wt% lead, 0.1-0.7 wt% aluminum, 0.05-0.5 wt% tin, and further comprises 0.05-0.5 wt%<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> manganese and/or 0.05-0.3 wt% phosphorus, and a balance of zinc.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">As compared with the inventive product 1, the inventive product 2 is further added with 0.05-0.3 wt% phosphorus and/or 0.05-0.5 wt% manganese. Although phosphorus can't form γ phase, phosphorus has a function of facilitating a good distribution of γ phase, thus increasing cutting performance of the alloy. Meanwhile, in case phosphorus is added, γ phase will disperse crystal grains of the primary α phase, thus increasing casting performance and corrosion resistance of the alloy. When the content of phosphorus is lower than 0.05 wt%, phosphorus can not play its role effectively. While when the content of phosphorus is higher than 0.3 wt%, casting performance and corrosion resistance will be affected adversely. Adding manganese helps to improve dezincification resistance and cast flowability. When the content of manganese is lower than 0.05 wt%, manganese can not play its role effectively. While when the content of manganese is 0.5 wt%, manganese can play its role to the saturation value.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A low-lead bismuth-free silicon-free brass alloy with excellent cutting performance (hereinafter referred to as the inventive product 3) comprises, by the total weight of the brass alloy, 60-65 wt% copper, 0.1-0.25 wt% lead, 0.1-0.7 wt% aluminum, 0.05-0.5 wt% tin, and further comprises one or more element selected from the group consisting of 0.05-0.3 wt% phosphorus, 0.05-0.5 wt% manganese and 0.001-0.01 wt% boron by the total weight of the brass alloy, and a balance of zinc.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As compared with the inventive product 2, the inventive product 3 is further added with trace boron, so as to better suppress alloy dezincification, increase the mechanical strength, and alter defect structure of cuprous oxide film on the surface of copper alloy, thus forming a cuprous oxide film which is more uniform, dense, and stain resistant. When the content of boron is lower than 0.001 wt%, boron can't play its role as mentioned above. While when the content of boron is higher than 0.01 wt%, the above performance can't be further increased. Thus, the optimum content of boron is 0.001-0.01 wt%.

<ul><li>Step S100: providing copper and manganese. In this step, a copper-manganese alloy can be provided as the precursor of copper and manganese elements.</li><li>Step S102: heating the copper-manganese precursor alloy to 1000-1050 °C to form a copper-manganese alloy melt. In this step, the copper-manganese alloy can be added into the high-frequency melting furnace, and heated to melt in the melting furnace. The temperature can be elevated to 1000-1050 °C, and even up to 1100 °C, for 5-10 minutes, so that the copper-manganese alloy is melt into a copper-manganese alloy melt. With these actions, it is possible to prevent the melt copper manganese from absorbing a lot of external gases (due to a too high temperature), which may otherwise result in cracking in the molded alloy.</li><li>Step S104: decreasing the temperature of the copper-manganese alloy melt to 950-1000 °C. In this step, when the temperature in the melting furnace is elevated to 1000-1050 °C for a durationi of 5-10 minutes, the power supply of the high-frequency melting furnace is turned off, so that the temperature in the melting furnace is reduced to 950-1000 °C, while the copper-manganese alloy melt is maintained in<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the melt state.</li><li>Step S106: covering the surface of copper-manganese alloy melt with a glass slagging agent. In this step, the surface of copper-manganese alloy melt is covered with the glass slagging agent at 950-1000 °C. This step can effectively prevent the melt from contacting the air, and prevent zinc to be added in the next step from boiling and evaporating due to melting at a high temperature of 950-1000 °C.</li><li>Step S108: adding zinc to the copper-manganese alloy melt to form a copper-manganese-zinc melt. In this step, zinc is added to the melting furnace, and is immersed into the copper-manganese alloy melt, so that zinc is sufficiently melt in the copper-manganese alloy melt to form a copper-manganese-zinc melt.</li><li>Step S110: deslagging the copper-manganese-zinc melt. In this step, the copper-manganese-zinc melt can be stirred and mixed under the action high-frequency induction, and then the slagging agent can be removed. Then, the copper-manganese-zinc melt is deslagged with a deslagging agent.</li><li>Step S112: adding lead, aluminum, and tin to the copper-manganese-zinc melt to form a metal melt. In this step, copper lead precursor alloy, copper aluminum precursor alloy, and copper tin precursor alloy can be added to the copper-manganese-zinc melt.</li><li>Step S114: elevating the temperature of the metal melt to 1000-1050 °C, and adding copper boron alloy and phosphorus copper alloy to form a low-lead bismuth-free silicon-free brass alloy melt.</li><li>Step S116: discharging the brass alloy melt for casting to form the brass alloy. In this step, the brass alloy melt is stirred evenly, the discharging temperature is controlled at 1000-1050 °C, and finally the brass alloy melt is discharged to casting a low-lead bismuth-free silicon-free brass alloy which exhibits good processability, dezincification resistance, and mechanical performance.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0006">Embodiment 1</heading><p id="p0048" num="0048"><br/>
