Particular embodiments are set out in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A laundry drying apparatus - in the following description also denoted in brief "apparatus" - that is to be used for the invention comprises a cabinet and a drum adapted to receive laundry to be dried. The drum is rotatable supported in the cabinet. Furthermore, the apparatus comprises a drying air channel arrangement designed to guide drying air such that it passes through the drum for drying the laundry within the drum. A heating element is arranged in the channel arrangement for heating the drying air and a blower arranged in the channel arrangement is adapted to convey the drying air. A drum motor is adapted to rotate the drum selectively in a main rotation direction and in a counter rotation direction.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The method of the invention, when run un such apparatus, provides controlling a drying cycle for drying delicate laundry comprising a predefined drying phase sequence having at least the following phases:
<ul><li>a first drying phase in which the drum is rotated alternately in the main and the counter rotation direction while the drying air is conveyed at a first average flow rate through the drum, and subsequently</li><li>a second drying phase in which the drum is rotated or mainly rotated in the main rotation direction while the drying air is conveyed at a second average flow rate through the drum.</li></ul></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Within this predefined drying phase sequence the first average flow rate is lower than the second average flow rate.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The drying phase sequence contributes to a smooth and gentle mechanical treatment of delicate laundry. The aforementioned rotation of the drum is able to control movements of the treated laundry such that delicate laundry will be dried gently and simultaneously creases can be avoided or at least reduced to a minimum.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">During the second drying phase, the drum rotation is preferably such that the drum is rotating only or mainly in the main rotation direction.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Preferably, the drying cycle or drying program (which can be also denoted as "drying process") includes the drying phase sequence, i.e. the first and second drying phases, at least one time. Preferably, the whole drying phase sequence is executed at least five, ten, twenty or thirty times during the drying process.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The desired lower first average flow rate is preferably realized by a blower designed to have a conveying capacity which is reduced when the drum is rotated in counter rotation direction with a same rotation speed as in the main rotation direction and/or which is designed to convey less air in the forward blower conveyance direction than when operated with the same rotation speed in the rearward blower conveyance direction. In particular, a drum motor may simultaneously be the motor for driving the blower.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In reverse, the mechanical treatment or agitation of the delicate laundry is higher during the second drying phase due to the higher second average flow rate during the second drying phase. This succession of the different drum rotations and average flow rates supports avoiding creases in delicate laundry.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In an embodiment the heating element for heating the drying air is constituted for example as an electrical resistance heater or as a refrigerant cooling element (condenser) of a heat pump system in a heat pump laundry treatment apparatus.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A heat pump laundry treatment apparatus is particularly suitable or adapted to carry out the drying phase sequence for drying gently delicate laundry since this apparatus provides drying air with low temperature which supports smooth and gentle treatment of delicate laundry during the anti-crease phase.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The apparatus may be a vented dryer, however preferably the apparatus is a condensation dryer. Preferably the apparatus is a tumble dryer. The rotation axis of the drum is preferably a horizontal or essentially horizontal drum axis. Alternatively, the rotation axis of the drum is inclined relative to the horizontal plane by 5°-50°, preferably 10°-40°, particularly 20°-35°.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The aforementioned drying process is particularly suitable for gently treating all kind of delicate laundry, particularly silk. The delicate laundry can be defined in general as laundry requiring to be dried by lower or more delicate mechanical agitation than laundry in a usual drying process.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In a preferred embodiment, the drying cycle in general or the first drying phase or the second drying phase is ended, when one or more predetermined conditions is/are detected which indicate(s) the laundry status. The one or more predetermined conditions are preferably at least one of the following conditions:
<ul><li>the laundry humidity is below a predetermined threshold,</li><li>a parameter indicating laundry humidity is lower or equal to a set value,</li><li>the temperature of the air exhausted out of the drum is higher than a set value,</li><li>a temperature gradient of the air exhausted out of the drum is higher than a set value, and</li><li>any other suitable physical parameter.</li></ul></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Preferably, a cooling phase is started when the one or more predetermined conditions is/are detected.

The specific number of turns during a rotation period depends on the drum speed (rpm, rounds or turns per minute) and the defined time period. For example, one rotation period corresponds to a duration of 4 or 5 seconds. A preferred drum speed during the rotation period is 12 rpm. In another example, the duration of a rotation period is 2 seconds and the drum rotation speed during this rotation period is 54 rpm. This results in number of turns less than 2 turns, i.e. approximately 1.8 turns.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Defining rotation periods and/or the first drying phase by the aforementioned parameters allows shorter drum rotation times at lower drum rotation speed in both rotation directions (main and counter) thus providing a more delicate treatment of the laundry while enhancing its mechanical agitation and redistribution in the drum. This offers delicate laundry to be dried very gently in a shorter time.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In embodiments the first drying phase exhibits at least one of the following (alternative or additional) features:
<ul><li>the total duration of drum rotation in the main or the counter rotation direction is longer than the total duration of drum rotation in the other rotation direction,</li><li>the duration of all or at least most of the periods of drum rotation in the main or the counter rotation direction is longer than the duration of all or at least most of the periods of drum rotation in the other rotation direction, and</li><li>the number of periods of drum rotation in the main or the counter rotation direction is higher than the number of periods of drum rotation in the other direction.</li></ul></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">This asymmetric or unequal drum rotation in one of both rotation directions (main and counter) supports improved laundry distribution in the drum.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Preferably the maximum drum rotation speed during the second drying phase is higher than the maximum drum rotation speed during the first drying phase.

Preferably such arrangement is used in a condenser-type and/or heat-pump system dryer.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Preferably, a cooling phase for cooling the delicate laundry during a final portion of the drying cycle is provided and/or an anti-crease phase after the drying cycle is provided.

Applying such a third phase supports the aim of a drying cycle to dry the laundry according to a predetermined condition, e.g. according to a predetermined humidity level like cupboard dry, ironing dry or damp.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The cooling phase may be considered as part of the drying cycle, whereas the anti-crease phase may be considered as an additional cycle. This additional cycle is executed preferably automatically if the laundry is detected as not being removed by the user.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Preferably, the third phase is or is essentially like or similar to the first drying phase.

The drying phase sequence can be regarded as a part of an anti-crease phase. In particular, an anti-crease phase is constituted by the drying phase sequence.

Due to such control of the heating element, potential overheating of the temperature sensitive delicate laundry<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> (particularly silk) is prevented in a facile technical manner. Such control is especially beneficial in case of an electric heater because the state of switch off or reduced power is able to be achieved very fast even if the generated temperature for heating the drying air was relative high. In case the apparatus contains a heat pump system having a compressor, controlling of the compressor would preferably continuously operate as the temperature of the drying air entering the drum is relative low (e.g. 50-55°C).

The tumble dryer 2 comprises a partly and schematically depicted cabinet 3 which supports or encloses several components and parts described hereinafter. The cabinet 3 encloses a heat pump system 4, including a closed refrigerant loop 6 which comprises in the following order of refrigerant flow B: a first heat exchanger 10 acting as evaporator for evaporating the refrigerant and cooling drying air, a compressor 14, a second heat exchanger 12 acting as condenser for cooling the refrigerant and heating the drying air, and an expansion device 16 from where the refrigerant is returned to the first heat exchanger 10. Together with the refrigerant pipes connecting the components of the heat pump system 4 in series, the heat pump system 4 forms the refrigerant loop 6 through which the refrigerant is circulated by the compressor 14 as indicated by arrow B.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The drying air flow within the apparatus 2 is guided through a compartment 18, e.g. a laundry drum, of the home appliance 2, i.e. through a compartment for receiving articles to be treated. The articles to be treated are textiles, particularly delicate laundry 19, or the like. The drying air flow is indicated by arrows A in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> and is driven by a drying air blower 8. A drying air channel 20 guides the drying air flow A outside the drum 18 and includes different sections, including the section forming a battery channel 20a in which the first and second heat exchangers 10, 12 are arranged. The drying air exiting the second heat exchanger 12 flows into a rear channel 20b in which the drying air blower 8 is arranged. The air conveyed by the blower 8 is guided upward in a rising channel 20c to the backside (which has a kind of drum inlet 26) of the drum 18. The air exiting the drum 18 through the drum outlet (which is the loading opening 21 of the drum and which is covered<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> by a door 24) is filtered by a fluff filter 22 arranged close to the drum outlet in or at the channel 20. The optional fluff filter 22 is arranged in a front channel 20d forming another section of channel 20 which is arranged behind and adjacent the front cover of the apparatus 2. The condensate formed at the first heat exchanger 10 is collected and guided to a condensate collector 30 which is connected to an extractable condensate drawer 40 via a drain pipe 46, a drain pump 36 and a drawer pipe 50. The collected condensate can be pumped from the collector 30 to the drawer 40 which is arranged at an upper portion of the apparatus 2 from where it can be comfortably withdrawn and emptied by a user.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a control unit 52 is disposed in the cabinet 3 of the apparatus 2 to control the execution of specific drying cycles. In this regard, the control unit 52 is adapted to control a drum motor 54.

In a first portion 56 of this drying cycle, the drum 18 is rotated in the main rotation direction 58 at the drum rotation speed s_drum = 40 rpm (rounds per minute). In this example, the first portion 56 has a duration of 76 seconds. This first portion 56 is followed by a drying phase sequence 60 which is divided in a first drying phase 62 and a subsequent second drying phase 64. During the first drying phase 62 the drum 18 is rotated alternately in the main rotation direction 58 and in the counter rotation direction 66.

Due to driving the blower 8 with the drum motor<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> 54 and due to a higher conveyance capacity of the blower in the forward direction (when the drum is rotating in main rotation direction), when the ratio of drum rotation in the main rotation direction is lower, the blower conveyance capacity is also lower. In other embodiments the blower may be driven independently of the drum and the control unit 52 may control the blower operation such that there is a lower average air flow in the first drying phase. In another embodiment the blower may have same or similar conveyance capacity in forward and backward direction and may be driven by the drum motor, however by alternating in the main and counter rotation direction, the repeatedly reverting air flow direction is at least partially mutually extinguishing due to respective counter-inertia.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The first drying phase 62 and/or the second drying phase 64 may be ended when one or more predetermined conditions is/are detected.
