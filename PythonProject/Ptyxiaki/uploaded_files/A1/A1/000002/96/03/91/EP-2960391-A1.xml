The invention can be applied with the use of modular units having formats other than those of the embodiments described below. It should also be understood that the phraseology and terminology are used purely for descriptive purposes and are not to be interpreted as limiting. The use of "include", "comprise", or variations thereof are to be understood as incorporating the elements listed after them and their equivalents, together with additional elements and equivalents thereof.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">With initial reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, the number 10 indicates the whole of a prefabricated modular unit for the construction of buildings, in particular, but not exclusively, for the construction of buildings for residential use. The unit 10 has the general shape of a parallelepipedal box with a rectangular base, open on two opposed vertical sides along the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> long sides of the base rectangle, in a closed-loop structural configuration when viewed in a vertical section plane parallel to the long sides of the rectangle.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The modular unit 10 is composed of a floor 11, rectangular in plan and horizontal when in use, joined securely to a rectangular ceiling 12 by a pair of opposed vertical walls 13, 14 which link the short sides of the floor 11 and the ceiling 12.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The modular unit 10 is made of wood, as specified below.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The floor 11 comprises a flat floor panel 11 a and a series of wooden floor beams 11 c, integral with the panel 11 a.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to a preferred embodiment, the floor panel 11a is a multi-layer wooden panel made of cross-laminated layers of dried timber glued together, known by the trade name XLAM or CLT. Flat panels similar to those indicated by 11a <i>per se</i> are known, being used for eco-friendly wood construction. According to an alternative embodiment, the floor panel 11a may be selected from chipboard panels, such as oriented strand panels (or OSB panels), particle board panels, particle board panels bonded with cement, and laminated wood fibre (LSL or Intrallam, Laminated Strand Lumber) panels.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The floor panel 11 a has a lower horizontal surface 11b from which the floor beams 11c protrude downwards; these beams extend parallel to the long sides of the floor rectangle 11.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The floor beams 11c are spaced apart transversely, that is to say perpendicularly to the direction of the long sides of the floor. Preferably, the floor beams 11c are distributed at regular, or equally spaced, intervals on the floor panel 11a along the whole of its shorter dimension.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the example illustrated here, five rectangular section floor beams 11c are provided, two of these beams extending along the long sides of the floor 11, with three intermediate beams.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The ceiling 12 advantageously has a structure which substantially mirrors that of the floor 11, with a flat ceiling panel 12a and a series of wooden ceiling beams 12c, integral with the panel 12a, and protruding downwards from a lower surface 12b of the ceiling panel 12a.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the floor 11 and in the ceiling 12, the panels 11a, 12a are firmly joined to the respective beams 11c, 12c by a structural adhesive and/or by mechanical connection elements, such as screws, distributed along the length of the beams.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In all the embodiments described herein, the number, shape, dimensions and density of distribution of the beams and panels are not to be considered limiting, but may vary according to design requirements.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Each of the vertical walls 13, 14 comprises at least one wooden vertical panel 13a, 14a and a respective series of struts or vertical wooden load-bearing elements 13c, 14c, integral with the vertical panels 13a, 14a. In the preferred embodiment, each of the vertical walls 13, 14 is formed by a pair of parallel facing flat vertical panels 13a, 13b and 14a, 14b, joined together by respective struts or intermediate vertical load-bearing elements 13c, 14c. The struts are spaced apart laterally or in a horizontal direction, and are distributed at regular intervals over the whole of the vertical wall 13 or 14. The vertical panels 13a, 13b, 14a, 14b and the intermediate struts 13c, 14c are all made of wood.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to one embodiment, the vertical panels 13a, 13b, 14a, 14b are multi-layer wooden panels with cross-laminated layers of dried timber glued together (e.g. XLAM or CLT), similar to the panels 11 a, 12a of the floor and the ceiling.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to an alternative embodiment, the vertical panels 13a, 13b, 14a, 14b may be chipboard panels, such as oriented strand panels (or OSB panels), particle board panels, particle board panels bonded with cement, or laminated wood fibre (LSL or Intrallam, Laminated Strand Lumber) panels.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In each vertical wall, the pair of facing panels defines a cavity divided by the struts 13c, 14c into a plurality of empty chambers 16 which preferably extend along the whole vertical<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> dimension of the vertical wall. The empty chambers 16 can conveniently be used to contain thermally and/or acoustically insulating materials and for the passage of cables and conduits of various systems (e.g. the plumbing or heating system).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In each vertical wall, the flat panels 13a, 13b are firmly joined to the struts 14a, 14c, for example by a structural adhesive and/or by mechanical connection elements, such as screws or bolts, distributed along the length of the struts.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The pairs of vertical panels, joined by the struts, give the vertical walls a high carrying capacity for vertical loads, as well an adequate thickness for effective attachment to the floor assemblies.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In each modular unit 10, the floor 11 and the ceiling 12 are rigidly joined to the two vertical walls 13, 14 by mechanical joining elements 15.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In an exemplary embodiment, as illustrated schematically in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>, the mechanical joining elements can comprise a plurality of L-shaped brackets 15 which help to ensure perpendicularity between each vertical wall and the floor or the ceiling.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Additionally or alternatively, the joints or nodes between the vertical walls and the ceiling or floor can be reinforced by other mechanical connecting elements other than the brackets, such as screw attachments or bolts which can be used to adjust the tensile force between the floor or ceiling and the vertical wall. The node created in this way provides good rigidity and robustness, highly appropriate for the movement of the modular unit. In the example of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref>, the mechanical connecting elements are made in the form of screws 15a which pass through the respective floor 11a and ceiling 12a panels, respectively, and are fixed in lower and upper edge areas, respectively, of the vertical panel 13b.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The parallelepipedal box configuration, open on two opposed vertical sides, in a closed-loop structural system, makes the modular unit particularly strong, thereby facilitating its transport in a prefabricated condition. It will be appreciated that this enables the modular units to be constructed in an industrial plant with high constructional precision, thus<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> optimizing the manufacturing times and costs.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Preferably, but not necessarily, the modular unit 10 has the following maximum dimensions, in order to fall within the load size limits for road transport in ordinary conditions: width: 2.55 m; height: 3.2 m; length: 10 m.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> shows schematically a step in the construction of a building with the superimposition of two modular units 10.
