Laundry washing machines generally comprise an external casing provided with a washing tub which contains a rotatable perforated drum where the laundry is placed.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A loading/unloading door ensures access to the drum.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Laundry washing machines typically comprise a water inlet circuit and a products supply unit for the introduction of water and washing/rinsing products (i.e. detergent, softener, etc.) into the tub.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Known laundry washing machines are also provided with water draining devices comprising a drain pump that may operate both during the initial phases of the washing program and at the end of the same to drain the dirty water.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the known technique, a complete washing program typically includes different phases during which the laundry to be washed is subjected to adequate treatments.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A washing cycle usually comprises a laundry wetting phase with addition of a washing detergent and a main washing phase during which the drum is rotated and the water contained therein is typically heated to a predetermined temperature based on the washing program selected by the user. During the main washing phase the drum is rotated so as to apply also a mechanical cleaning action on the laundry. Immediately after the main washing phase, in an<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> intermediate draining phase the drum is typically rotated at high rotation speed, in such a way that dirty washing liquid (i.e. water mixed with detergent) is extracted from the laundry, and this dirty washing liquid is drained by the water draining devices.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">After the intermediated drain phase, the washing cycle typically comprises a rinsing phase which usually comprises one or more rinsing cycles. In the rinsing cycle, clean rinse water is first added to the laundry, so as to be absorbed by the laundry and remove from the latter detergent and/or dirty particles not previously removed by washing liquid, and then the drum is rotated at high speed to extract water and dirty particles/detergent from the laundry: the dirty water extracted is drained from the tub to the outside by the water draining devices.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">After the rinsing phase, a final spinning phase allows the extraction of the residual water contained in the wet laundry.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The water extracted during the final spinning phase is drained towards the outside by means of the water draining devices (during or after the spinning phase).</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Each time the drum is rotated at high speed, and in particular in the intermediated drain phase following the main wash phase, it can happen that an excessive foam formation inside the washing tub occurs, due to the high mechanical action exerted by the high speed rotating drum on the water mixed with detergent present inside the tub.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">An excessive amount of foam in the washing tub can compromise the correct functioning of the drain pump (and in some cased it can also damage the latter) and it can also reduce the rinsing performances of the washing machine, with the risk that an excessive amount of detergent particles remains in the clothes at the end of the washing cycle.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In addition, an excessive amount of foam can reach the detergent box passing through the tub water inlet, and can overflow.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Several actions to be activated when an excessive foam formation has been detected have been proposed in the art. For example, the International Patent application published as <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2007074037A"><text>WO 2007/074037</text></patcit> discloses a washing machine and a control method wherein a sensor detects an excessive foam formation level during the washing process; according to the foam level detected by the sensor, the control method provides the foam to be mixed with water, by varying accordingly the speed and the runtime of the washing cycle, and by activating a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> draining pump as the drum starts moving so as to drain the water-foam mixture. In other cases, known in the art traditional machines provide different solutions to reduce an excessive amount of foam formation when the detected foam amount exceeds a pre-determined threshold value, such as, for example, by decreasing the drum rotation speed, by increasing the temperature of the washing cycling and/or by spraying water onto the foam.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">However, the laundry washing machines of the known art pose some drawbacks. In fact, in particular when using a detergent with high foaming properties, and if the drum is accelerated quickly in order to reach the spin speed, the known methods for removing the foam when an excessive foam amount is detected can be not so effective, with the result that an excessive amount of foam can remain in the washing tub, creating the above mentioned drawbacks.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Therefore the object of the invention is providing a laundry washing machine with a washing system which reduces the risk that an excessive foam amount present in the washing tub negatively affects one or more phases of the washing cycle, and in particular the phases in which washing liquid is drained by the drain pump.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">It is another object of the invention to provide a laundry washing machine that makes it possible to improve the washing efficiency of the machine itself.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">The applicant has found that by adding, immediately after the main washing phase end before the intermediate draining phase, a foam prevention phase during which the formation of foam is hindered, wherein said foam prevention phase is performed even if foam is not present in the washing tub, the risk of formation of an excessive foam amount in the washing tub in the following spinning phase is highly reduced.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The foam prevention phase is a phase to be performed, immediately after the main wash, independently on the actual presence or detection of foam in the tub; in other words, while the known methods are "active methods", that performs some corrective actions only if and after that the foam is detected (which can be too late, in particular when using a detergent having a high foam formation activity), the claimed method is a sort of "passive method", which directly intervenes on the causes of the foam formation (e.g. the water dilution, the rotation speed of the washing drum), in order to create conditions which are<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> unfavourable to foam formation. Therefore the claimed method does not aim to intervene on the foam when already formed, but it tries to avoid foam formation from the beginning, independently of the fact that foam is already present or not. Therefore the claimed method is much more effective than known "active methods" in protecting the correct functioning of the washing cycle, since the risk of having in the washing tub a foam amount so high that it is no more possible to reduce it by standard methods (e.g. reducing drum rotation or increasing the solution dilution) is highly reduced.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In a first aspect, in compliance with the above aim, according to the present invention there is provided a method for washing laundry in a laundry washing machine as claimed in Claim 1 and preferably, though not necessarily, in any one of the dependent Claims.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Such a washing machine used in the method of the present invention is of the type comprising:
