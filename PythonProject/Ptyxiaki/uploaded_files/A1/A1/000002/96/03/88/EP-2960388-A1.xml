Each wall assembly consists of a number of identically sized load-bearing wall panels, which are joined by non-load bearing bridging members.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5528871A"><text>US 5,528,871</text></patcit> relates to a kit to be used in the construction of a building. More specifically, there is described a kit to be used in the construction of a building, comprising a series of modular box-shaped units of particle board to be assembled together into a given plane to form a wall. These modular units comprising respective border portions and elongate aligning member.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The object of the present invention is to provide a modular building system which is easy to assemble and which has no thermal bridging.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">This object is achieved by a modular building system comprising a plurality of elongated building elements, which are structurally assembled to form a building section, such as a wall, a floor and/or a ceiling or the like, wherein said building<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> elements comprise an elongated insulation panel having a first side and an opposite second side with two oppositely positioned end sides and two oppositely positioned panel contact sides therebetween, and at least one of said first and second sides are provided with a cover profile, which covers the width of the first side and/or the second side, wherein said cover profile has a base portion at which the cover profile is attached to the first or second side of the insulation panel, and first and second side flange portions on each side of the base portion; said first side flange portion having a tongue at the side edge, and said second side flange portion having a groove complementary to the tongue to receiving and interlocking the tongue of a neighbouring building element and thereby assemble the two neighbouring building elements.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The elongated building elements in the modular building system according to the invention are preferably made up by an insulation panel with a cover profile on each side. Hereby no thermal bridging occurs since there's no direct connection between the two cover profiles other than the insulation panel. The building elements can easily be assembled by the interlocking tongue and groove connection between said profiles.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The structural strength of the tongue and groove connection between building elements provides structurally assembled building elements in a modular building system according to the invention. This is advantageous as this structural assembly also provides the insulation panels with load-bearing capabilities without a traditional framework and also because no additional connecting parts except for connections between sections are needed.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In a modular building system according to the invention, the cover profiles of the building elements will be on the exterior surface of the building and/or on the interior side of the walls, floor and roof of the building. Besides, the thermal and acoustic insulation properties of the insulation panels are not compromised by any thermal bridges and the tongue and groove assembly between each of the cover profiles making up the exterior surface, and also the cover profiles making up the interior surface, ensures a water and vapour tight barrier on the building.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the preferred embodiment of the invention, each of the flange portions of the cover profile comprises an inclined inner flange portion extending from the base portion to an intermediate portion parallel to the base portion, and from which an outermost side<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> flange is provided which is perpendicular to the base portion, and that in said outermost side flange the tongue or groove, respectively, is formed. This provides a spring-like effect on the side flange portions and thereby on the tongue and the groove, so that this spring-like flexibility will bias the tongue of one profile into the groove of a neighbouring profile. The flexibility of the side flange portions also provides for easy disassembly of the cover profiles as will be discussed later on in the description.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Preferably, said cover profile is made of one piece of sheet metal which is folded into shape, said sheet preferably having a thickness of 0.5-1.5 mm, more preferably approx. 1.0 mm. Hereby, the profile can be produced in a cost-effective manner.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Preferably, a central ridge is provided on the base portion, said ridge preferably having a trapezoid cross-sectional shape. This provides extra stiffness to the profile and thereby to the building element. Furthermore, the assembly of side flange portions of two neighbouring building elements when assembled have the same shape as the ridge. This provides a regular exterior (or interior) surface made up by the cover profiles, which is advantageous as this facilitates easy mounting of brackets for building components or outer building façade cladding, for instance brackets of the type disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="DK2014050148W"><text>PCT/DK2014/050148</text></patcit>, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The interlocking between the tongues and grooves preferably provides a wind and water-tight barrier. However, by the invention it is realised that the water-tightness of the interlocking assembly may be further improved by providing the tongue and/or the groove with a suitable coating or a sealant, such as a resilient deformable sealant, e.g. a silicone coating or sealant.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The insulation panel of the elongated building element is advantageously made of bound fibrous material, such as bound mineral wool fibres, preferably bound stone wool fibres. Furthermore, the insulation panel made of such fibrous material having a density of 60-100 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, preferably 70-80 kg/m<sup>3</sup> and a compression strength perpendicular to the cover profiles surface of &gt;15 kN/m<sup>2</sup> measured according to European Standard EN 826. This is advantageous since the insulation panel thereby resists high loads as they commonly appear within building construction. Such loads may vary depending on the different building sections, respectively the location of the sections within a building. In an embodiment where the modular building system is<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> made as a wall of building elements which are 250 in width, 350 mm in height and 3000 mm in length, with a cover profile of 1 mm thickness attached to one surface of the insulation panel and with ridges of 26 mm height, it is found that the vertical load which can be carried exceeds 5000 kg. A building element made for constructing a floor section was also tested for its resistance to bending. The building element is made of a cover profile of 1 mm thickness and fibrous insulation material of 70 kg/m<sup>3</sup> and with the dimensions 250 x 450 x 6000 mm and was subjected to a load of 3000 kg. The deflections were minor and with a spot load on the middle of the building element a deflection of max. 28 mm was measured. In relation to enforce the bending resistance of a building element, when used as a roof or deck element, it is found advantageous to provide a plate between the contact sides of two abutting building elements. This plate is clamped between the building elements and fixed when the flanges of the cover profiles are assembled. The plate is preferably made of a high-density fibrous insulation material, such as a mineral fibrous material having a density of approx. 450-500 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In an embodiment of the invention, at least one of the building sections is a horizontally positioned floor subassembly of the building elements and wherein at least one second building section is a wall subassembly of building elements which is mounted on said floor subassembly via an assembly profile element. The assembly profile element preferably comprises an exterior first side profile with a receiving groove, an interior second side profile with a receiving groove, and with a central profile panel of insulation material mounted between said side profiles and mounted in the receiving grooves. Hereby, the assembly of a wall and floor section or a wall and ceiling/roof section may be provided without introducing any thermal bridges so that the thermal and acoustic properties of the modular building system according to the invention is not compromised. Accordingly, said central profile panel is made of a mineral fibrous material, more preferably said mineral fibrous material having a density of approx. 450-500 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Advantageously, the interior second side profile also comprises an internal volume for the accommodation of building components. This allows for fitting electrical cables, sanitary tubing, etc. to be provided without penetrating the vapour-tight screen.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of assembling building elements in a modular building system comprising a plurality of building elements, wherein the building elements each comprises<br/>
an elongated insulation panel having a first side and an opposite second side with two oppositely positioned end sides and two oppositely positioned panel contact sides therebetween, and at least one of said first and second sides are provided with a cover profile, which covers the width of the first side and/or the second side, wherein<br/>
said cover profile has a base portion at which the cover profile is attached to the first or second side of the insulation panel, and first and second side flange portions on each side of the base portion;<br/>

In <figref idrefs="f0006">fig. 6A</figref>, the groove 36 is formed by bending the sheet metal into shape so that the intermediate portion 34 is followed by the side edge portion 35 in which the groove 36 is formed. The groove 36 is generally trapezoid in cross-sectional shape having a smaller distance dg at the entrance to the groove 36 compared to the bottom of the groove 36, where the distance is D<sub>g</sub>.

In the support portions 61, 62 there are provided press rollers 64 which may be brought into an active position by activating the handle 63. By pulling the handle 63 along the assembly line, i.e. the side flanges 32, 32', the press rollers 64 will then push the tongue 37 into the groove 36 and thereby snap-lock the two cover profiles 3, 3' together. The tool 6 is also provided with an off-set central disk 65, which is placed above the assembly line between the two profiles, but off-set relative to the pivot axis of the handle 63 (see <figref idrefs="f0010">fig. 10</figref>). The handle 63 can then be brought into a second active position where the disk is rotated into the assembly line, i.e. forced in between the two side flanges 32, 32' of two assembled cover profiles 3, 3'. The press rollers 64 may at the same time be pressed outwards, i.e. towards the ridges 38, 38' of<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the profiles 3, 3'.
