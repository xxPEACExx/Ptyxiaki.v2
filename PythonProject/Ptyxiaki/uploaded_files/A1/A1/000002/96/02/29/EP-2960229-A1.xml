In general formula (1), 1 represents 0 or 1.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the hydrazone derivative of triphenylamine represented by general formula (1) shown above, two hydrazone parts are located symmetrically relative to a nitrogen atom of a triphenylamine part. A double bond is present between the triphenylamine part and each of the hydrazone parts. The hydrazone derivative of triphenylamine having the structure described above tends to have excellent properties in terms of solvent solubility and resin compatibility. When the hydrazone derivative of triphenylamine having the structure described above is contained in a photosensitive member, the photosensitive member tends to have excellent surface appearance. The above effect is thought to be due to the fact that crystallization of the hydrazone derivative of triphenylamine in the photosensitive layer can be inhibited during formation of a film of the photosensitive layer. Furthermore, the hydrazone derivative of triphenylamine represented by general formula (1) can be easily dispersed in the photosensitive layer in a uniform manner. Uniform dispersion of the hydrazone derivative of triphenylamine in the photosensitive layer increases the likelihood of the photosensitive layer exhibiting excellent electrical properties. By using a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> photosensitive member having excellent electrical properties and surface appearance in image formation, high quality image formation can be achieved over an extended period of time.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In order to provide a photosensitive member having excellent electrical properties and surface appearance, in the hydrazone derivative of triphenylamine represented by general formula (1), it is particularly preferable that R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> each represent, independently of one another, an alkyl group having a carbon number of at least 1 and no greater than 6 or an alkoxy group having a carbon number of at least 1 and no greater than 6.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In order to provide a photosensitive member with excellent electrical properties and surface appearance, in the hydrazone derivative of triphenylamine represented by general formula (1), it is particularly preferable that m and n each represent, independently of one another, an integer of at least 0 and no greater than 2.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In order to provide a photosensitive member having excellent electrical properties and surface appearance, it is particularly preferable that a halogen atom in general formula (1) is a fluorine atom, a chlorine atom, or a bromine atom.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In order to provide a photosensitive member having excellent electrical properties and surface appearance, it is particularly preferable that the alkyl group having a carbon number of at least 1 and no greater than 6 in general formula (1) is a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl, an isopropyl group, an n-butyl group, a t-butyl group, a pentyl group, an isopentyl group, a neopentyl group, or a hexyl group.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In order to provide a photosensitive member having excellent electrical properties and surface appearance, it is particularly preferable that the alkoxy group having a carbon number of at least 1 and no greater than 6 in general formula (1) is an ethoxy group, an n-propoxy group, an isopropoxy group, an n-butoxy group, an s-butoxy group, a t-butoxy group, a pentyloxy group, an isopentyloxy group, a neopentyloxy group, or a hexyloxy group.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In order to provide a photosensitive member having excellent electrical<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> properties and surface appearance, it is particularly preferable that the aryl group having a carbon number of at least 6 and no greater than 12 in general formula (1) is a phenyl group, a tolyl group, a xylyl group, a mesityl group, a naphthyl group, an anthryl group, or a phenanthryl group.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">One or more of the alkyl group, the alkoxy group, and the aryl group in general formula (1) may have a substituent.
