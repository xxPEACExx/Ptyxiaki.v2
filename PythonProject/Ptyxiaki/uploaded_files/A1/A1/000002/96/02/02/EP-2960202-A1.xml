In addition, the present invention relates to a vehicle seat using the trim cover fixing structure.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background Art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Forming the shape of a seat outline with a cushion body made of foam molding and/or the like and then forming a vehicle seat by covering the surface of the cushion body with a trim cover made of fur, synthetic leather, cloth and/or the like have been known from before. (For example, see Patent Literature 1, Patent Literature 2 and Patent Literature 3).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Patent Literature 1 discloses art in which the cushion body is mounted on the frame, an insert wire is provided within the cushion body, a locking plate is provided on the end of the skin (that is to say, the trim cover), and the trim cover is fixed to the frame by inserting the locking plate between the cushion body and the frame.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In this known art, an engagement structure of three members, namely the insert wire, the locking plate and the frame, was utilized, so there were problems such as costs being high, the structure being complex and the stretch condition of the skin (that is to say, the trim cover) being weak, and/or the like.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent Literature 2 discloses art in which the skin is fixed by an arm rest retainer having a special structure equipped with multiple protrusions being attached to the seat back frame, a hook member with a special structure having a trimming wire and/or the like being provided at the tip of the trim cover, and the hook member being hooked on the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> protrusions of the arm rest retainer.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In this known art, members having special structures must be used, so there were problems such as costs being high and the structure being complex. In addition, the structure consisted of only the tip of the trim cover being hooked on the arm rest retainer, so there were problems such as the stretch condition of the skin (that is to say, the trim cover) being weak.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Patent Literature 3 discloses art in which the skin material is fixed by a bag-shaped member being integrally formed on the inside of the pad (that is to say, the cushion body), the end of the skin material (that is to say, trim cover) being adhered to a terminal plate, and the terminal plate being inserted into the bag-shaped member.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In this known art, the bag-shaped member inside the pad (that is to say, the cushion body) must be formed with an integral form, so there are problems such as costs becoming high. In addition, the bag-shaped member and the terminal plate must be precisely formed, so there are problems such as costs becoming higher. Furthermore, the fixing structure consists of simply inserting the terminal plate into the bag-shaped member, so there were problems such as the stretch condition of the skin (that is to say, the trim cover) being weak.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Patent Literature 4 discloses a vehicle seat with a split rear seat structure. Specifically, a storage cavity for storing the arm rest is formed roughly in the center of the seat back and an opening is formed in one of the walls separating the passenger space from the cargo space, out of the walls forming that storage cavity, so that it is possible to store long objects such as skis and/or the like in both the cargo space and the passenger space by passing through this opening.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In Patent Literature 4, a vehicle seat equipped with a split rear seat structure as described above is disclosed, but no mention is made regarding an fixing structure for the trim cover.

In this manner, the trim cover can be anchored through the action of simply pressing the engagement member by the fixing member, so it is possible to build the trim cover fixing structure extremely simply.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In addition, with the above-described first trim cover fixing structure, it is not necessary to provide an insert wire inside the cushion body and moreover the members used are only the engagement member and the fixing member, so it is possible to hold costs down.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In addition, with the above-described first trim cover fixing structure, the trim cover is fixed to the cushion body in a state with desirable tension applied to the trim cover, so it is possible to securely fix the trim cover.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Furthermore, with the above-described first trim cover fixing structure, the trim cover is fixed by the engagement member mounted near the edge of the trim cover used in a vehicle seat being pressed by an fixing member like a board (that is to say, a plate-shaped member), so when applied to a vehicle seat provided with a split rear seat structure, it is possible to easily apply the trim cover fixing structure to the split rear seat structure.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the above-described first trim cover fixing structure, the fixing member may be a plate-shaped member that spreads out in a planar manner and at least the periphery of which is plate-shaped. Furthermore, the periphery of the plate-shaped member may engage with the engagement member.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The plate-shaped member may be formed by press processing metal or molding synthetic resin. By having a composition in which the fixing member is formed by a plate-shaped member and the engagement member is pressed by the periphery of that plate-shaped member, it is possible to fix the trim cover that is integral with the engagement member in a state with suitable tension applied.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the above-described first trim cover fixing structure, it is possible for the periphery of the fixing member to engage with the engagement member in a state of being inserted between the engagement member and the trim cover. Through this composition, it is possible to prevent the engagement between the fixing member and the engagement member from coming apart, and it is possible to stably fix the trim cover over a lengthy time.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the above-described first trim cover fixing structure, the fixing member may have a step in a section inserted between the engagement member and the trim cover. Furthermore, the engagement member may be inserted into this step. When the fixing member is inserted between the engagement member and the trim cover, the engagement member sticks out on the fixing member. As the amount of this sticking out becomes large, there may be cases in which a passenger feels uncomfortable when touching this section via a back surface carpet and/or the like, or for this to have a negative influence on quality as a vehicle seat. Regarding this, if the engagement member is housed by a step provided in the fixing member as in the present disclosure, it is possible to reduce the amount of sticking out of the engagement member on the fixing member, and as a result it is possible to enhance quality as a vehicle seat.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the above-described first trim cover fixing structure, the step may be formed by a step indentation provided on the periphery of the fixing member. Furthermore, a wall section of the fixing member formed<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> by the step indentation to restrict movement of the engagement member relative to the fixing member. With this composition, it is possible to prevent the engagement member from moving, by means of this wall section, and as a result, it is possible to prevent wrinkles from occurring in the trim cover.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the above-described first trim cover fixing structure, the engagement member may be fixed to the trim cover by being sewn to the trim cover. This fixing structure does not require special fixing fixtures, fixing materials and/or the like, and thus is extremely economical.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the above-described first trim cover fixing structure, the engagement member may be a narrow band-shaped member having a long side and a short side. Furthermore, the fixing member may engage with the long side of the band-shaped member. Through this composition, it is possible to effectively utilize a compactly shaped engagement member.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the above-described first trim cover fixing structure, the engagement member may be made of felt, press felt or non-woven cloth. These materials can realize a good engagement state with a fixing member formed of metal or synthetic resin.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The above-described first trim cover fixing structure may further comprise a storage cavity that is a storage cavity formed with the trim cover covering the cushion body as a wall and is provided with an opening connecting the front region of the cushion body with the rear region of the cushion body, and a moving member movable between a position stored in the storage cavity and a position extending to the outside of the storage cavity. Furthermore, the trim cover may be provided so as to reach to the rear region of the cushion body from the front region of the cushion body through the storage cavity and the opening. Furthermore, the engagement member may be fixed on the trim cover in the section that reaches to the rear region of the cushion body.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> The fixing member may comprise a cover board configured to cover the opening of the storage cavity from the rear side of the cushion body. And the periphery of the cover board may engage with the engagement member when the cover board is placed at a position covering the opening of the storage cavity.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The above configuration is a vehicle seat having a so-called split rear seat structure to which the present invention is applied. The split rear seat structure is a structure in which an opening is formed in the vehicle seat provided between the cargo compartment and the passenger compartment, making it possible for long objects (for example, skis) to ride in both the cargo compartment and the passenger compartment through that opening.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">According to this aspect of the present invention, it is possible to cause member (for example, the cover board) that covers the opening used for passing cargo in the split rear seat structure to function as the above fixing member, so it is basically possible for the vehicle seat that is a split rear seat structure to be put to use as a standard-type vehicle seat without a split rear seat structure extremely easily. In addition, conversely by using the frame member (the member the center section of which becomes the opening) in place of the member (for example, the cover board) covering the opening for passing cargo, it is possible to manufacture a vehicle seat with a split rear seat structure extremely easily.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In the trim cover fixing structure according to this invention used in a vehicle seat with a split rear seat structure, the engagement member may be fixed on the trim cover at the section that reaches to the rear region of the cushion body at least on both left and right sides of the opening provided in the storage cavity. Furthermore, the cover board that is a fixing member may engage with the engagement member in the periphery on both right and left sides, thereby applying tension to the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> trim cover.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">With this construction, the cover board that is the fixing member presses reciprocally in both directions on the trim cover at positions on both sides of the opening used for the split rear seat, so it is possible to securely fix the trim cover at the perimeter of the opening used in the split rear seat structure.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In the trim cover fixing structure according to this invention used in a vehicle seat with a split rear seat structure, the moving member may be an arm rest and/or a side table. With this construction, it is possible to load long objects into the vehicle, passing through the opening formed in the storage cavity for storing the arm rest and/or the like.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Next, the second trim cover fixing structure according to the present invention is a trim cover fixing structure, comprising a cushion body with elasticity, a trim cover configured to cover the cushion body, and an opening configured to connect a front region of the cushion body with a rear region of the cushion body; wherein the trim cover is provided so as to reach to the rear region of the cushion body from the front region of the cushion body through the opening; an engagement member is provided near an edge of the trim cover reaching to the rear region of the cushion body; a cover board configured to cover the opening from the rear side of the cushion body is provided; an engaging member is provided in the cover board; tension is applied to the trim cover covering the cushion body by the engaging member engaging with the engagement member when the cover board is placed at a position covering the opening, and in the state with the tension applied, the trim cover is fixed to the surface of the cushion body; and the section of the trim cover that reaches to the rear region of the cushion body through the opening is a single frame shape surrounding the opening.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">With the second trim cover fixing structure, the section of the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> trim cover reaching the rear region of the cushion body through the opening is a single frame shape surrounding the opening, so it is possible for the trim cover stretched to the rear region (that is to say, the back side region) of the opening to maintain a constant shape in a natural state, so that the shape does not collapse. Consequently, after the trim cover is stretched to the rear region of the opening, the work of mounting the cover board on the opening via the trim cover is accomplished extremely easily.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In the above configuration, the combination of the "engagement member of trim cover" and the "engaging member of cover board " may for example be realized through a combination of "an engagement member sewn into the trim cover" and "the periphery of the cover board", a combination of "a hook or clip anchored to the trim cover" and "a hole provided in the cover board", a combination of "a hole provided in the trim cover" and "a protrusion provided in the cover board", and/or the like. The above "hook or clip" is a component of arbitrary shape capable of engaging with the cover board.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In the second trim cover fixing structure, the section of the trim cover that reaches to the rear region of the cushion body through the opening may be mutually sewn together and form a single frame shape surrounding the opening. The method of sewing is a reliable method with regard to not collapsing the shape of the trim cover while being simple.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In the second trim cover fixing structure, the cushion body may be supported by a frame, and a connecting member may be provided at the section of the trim cover that reaches to the rear section of the cushion body through the opening. Moreover, the connecting member may be connected to the frame. Through this configuration, it is possible for the trim cover to be provisionally attached to the frame, so that it is easy to accomplish processes accomplished on the trim cover thereafter.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In the second trim cover fixing structure, an opening hole may<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> be provided in a section to the outside of the engagement member, at the section of the trim cover that reaches to the rear section of the cushion body through the opening. With this configuration, it is possible to easily accomplish the work of causing the cover board to engage with the engagement member by hooking the hook member of an opening tool equipped with a hook member into the opening hole and opening the trim cover by means of the opening tool.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Next, the vehicle seat according to the present invention is a vehicle seat comprising a cushion body having elasticity, a trim cover for covering the cushion body, and a trim cover fixing structure configured to fix the trim cover to the cushion body, wherein the trim fixing structure is the above-described first or second trim cover fixing structure. With this vehicle seat, it is possible to similarly obtain the effects obtained with the trim cover fixing structure according to the present invention.</p><heading id="h0008"><b>Advantageous Effects of Invention</b></heading><p id="p0040" num="0040">With the above-described first and second trim cover fixing structures and the vehicle seats using such according to the present invention, the following effects (1) through (4) can be obtained.
<ol><li>(1) By pressing the engaging section of an fixing member (for example, a cover board) onto the engagement member provided near the end of the trim cover, and also pressing the engagement member by means of the fixing member to stretch the trim cover, it is possible to fix the trim cover to the cushion body. In this manner, it is possible to fix the trim cover through the action of simply pressing the engagement member with the fixing member, so it is possible to make the trim cover fixing structure extremely simple.</li><li>(2) Because it is not necessary to provide a special member such as an insert wire and/or the like inside the cushion body using insert technology and moreover because the members used are only the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> engagement member and the fixing member (for example, a cover board), it is possible to keep costs low.</li><li>(3) Because the trim cover is fixed to the cushion body in a state with the preferable tension applied to the trim cover, it is possible to securely fix the trim cover.</li><li>(4) Because the trim cover is fixed by pressing on the engagement member provided near the end of the trim cover used in the vehicle seat with an fixing member such as a board (that is to say, a plate-shaped member) or the engaging member of the cover board, when an apparatus provided with a split rear seat structure is utilized as the vehicle seat, it becomes possible to easily apply the fixing structure of the trim cover to the split rear seat structure.</li><li>(5) Furthermore, with the second trim cover fixing structure, a section that reaches to the back region of the cushion body through an opening of the trim cover has an integral frame shape surrounding that opening, so it is possible for the trim cover stretched to the back region (that is to say, the rear-side region) of the opening to maintain a fixed shape in a natural state, so that shape does not collapse. Consequently, the work of mounting the cover board on the opening via the trim cover after pulling the trim cover to the back region of the opening becomes very easy.</li></ol></p><heading id="h0009"><b>Brief Description of Drawings</b></heading><p id="p0041" num="0041"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view showing an embodiment of a vehicle seat and trim cover fixing structure according to the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view showing the state with an arm rest pulled out in the vehicle seat of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view showing the structure of the back side of the vehicle seat of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a plan view showing a frame provided inside the vehicle<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> seat shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a sectional view along line A-A in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a sectional longitudinal view of the seat back along line B-B in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> shows an enlargement of the section indicated by arrow C in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> shows an enlargement of the section indicated by arrow D in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> is a sectional plan view along line E-E in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref> is a plan view showing a frame in accordance with arrow F in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11</figref> is a sectional view showing the state when the cushion body is adhered to a frame, being the primary section of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref> is a sectional view showing the state with the trim cover placed on the cushion body of <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 13</figref> is a plan view showing a frame in accordance with arrow K of <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 14</figref> is a sectional view showing the state when the cover board is mounted on the back surface of the seat back according to <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 15A</figref> is a perspective view showing the entirety of the embodiment of the cover board;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0016">FIG. 15B</figref> is a sectional view along line H-H in <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 15A</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 16A</figref> is a plan view showing the entirety of an embodiment of a removable frame on the back surface of the seat back of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0018">FIG. 16B</figref> is a sectional view along line M-M of <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 16A</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 16C</figref> is a sectional view along line N-N in <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 16A</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0020">FIG. 16D</figref> show an enlargement of the section indicated by arrow P in <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 16A</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0021">FIG. 17A</figref> is a plan view showing the entirety of the lid supported at the location of arrow P in <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 16A</figref>;<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0022">FIG. 17B</figref> is a partial enlargement in accordance with arrow Q in <figref idrefs="f0021">FIG. 17A</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0023">FIG. 18</figref> is a sectional view showing the necessary components of another embodiment of the vehicle seat and trim cover fixing structure according to the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0024">FIG. 19</figref> is a plan view of the entirety of a frame provided inside the seat back of <figref idrefs="f0023">FIG. 18</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0025">FIG. 20</figref> is a plan view of a frame that is a necessary component of still another embodiment of the vehicle seat and trim cover fixing structure according to the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0026">FIG. 21</figref> is a plan view showing a modification example of the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0027">FIG. 22</figref> is a view showing a method of applying the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0026">FIG. 21</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0028">FIG. 23</figref> is a plan view showing a modification example of the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0024">FIG. 19</figref>;
