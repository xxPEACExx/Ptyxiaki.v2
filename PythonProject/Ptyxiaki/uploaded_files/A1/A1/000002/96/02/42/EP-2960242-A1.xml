hydrogenated sugar to anhydrosugar alcohol by dehydration reaction in a reactor, wherein while the dehydration reaction is conducted, the hydrogenated sugar is continuously fed into the reactor and the produced anhydrosugar alcohol is continuously discharged out of the reactor, and the reaction mixture is not circulated in and out of the reactor during the conduction of the dehydration reaction. As compared with conventional processes employing a batch-type or semi-batch-type dehydration reaction, the present method can remarkably improve the production efficiency and, in particular, it can be suitably applied in a large-scale process for producing anhydrosugar alcohol.</p><heading id="h0002">[BACKGROUND ART]</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Hydrogenated sugar (also referred to as "sugar alcohol") means a compound obtained by adding hydrogen to the reductive end group in sugar, and generally has a chemical formula of HOCH<sub>2</sub>(CHOH)<sub>n</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH wherein n is an integer of 2 to 5. According to the carbon number, hydrogenated sugar is classified into tetritol, pentitol, hexitol and heptitol (4, 5, 6 and 7 carbons, respectively). Among them, hexitol having 6 carbons includes sorbitol, mannitol, iditol, galactitol, etc. and in particular, sorbitol and mannitol are very useful materials.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Anhydrosugar alcohol has a diol form with two hydroxyl groups in the molecule, and can be produced by using hexitol derived from starch (for example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="KR101079518"><text>Korean Patent No. 10-1079518</text></patcit><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> and <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="KR1020120066904"><text>Korean Laid-open Patent Publication No. 10-2012-0066904</text></patcit>). Because anhydrosugar alcohol is an environmentally friendly material derived from recyclable natural resources, it has received much interest for a long time and researches on its production continue to proceed. Among such anhydrosugar alcohols, isosorbide produced from sorbitol has the widest industrial applicability at present.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Anhydrosugar alcohol can be used in various fields including treatment of heart and blood vessel diseases, medicaments such as patch adhesive, mouthwash, etc., solvents for compositions in the cosmetics industry, emulsifiers in the food industry, etc. In addition, it can increase the glass transition temperature of polymer materials like polyester, PET, polycarbonate, polyurethane, epoxy resin, etc., and improve the strength of such materials. Furthermore, because anhydrosugar alcohol is an environmentally friendly material derived from natural resources, it is very useful in the plastics industry such as bioplastics and the like. It is also known that anhydrosugar alcohol can be used as an adhesive, environmentally friendly plasticizer, biodegradable polymer, and environmentally friendly solvent for watersoluble lacquer.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As such, anhydrosugar alcohol is receiving much interest because of its wide applicability, and the level of practical industrial application thereof is increasing. However, the conventional methods of producing anhydrosugar alcohol have limitations of high cost for the catalyst used in the dehydration reaction, low conversion rate, and low yields of distillation and purification, etc.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In particular, conventional processes have mainly used a method for converting hydrogenated sugar to anhydrosugar alcohol through batch-type reaction. However, such a method has the problems of difficulty in working, increase of working time, and excessive enlargement of reactor size for production with industrial capacity. As an alternative, there is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> a semi-batch-type method wherein plural batch-type reactors are connected and operated in a continuous manner. However, this method also has the problems of difficulty in working, increase of working time, difficulty in temperature setting for each step, and more complicated facilities.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need to develop a method for producing anhydrosugar alcohol which can improve the production efficiency through a new manner of operation and can be utilized suitably in a large-scale, commercial production process.</p><heading id="h0003">[CONTENTS OF THE INVENTION]</heading><heading id="h0004">[PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED]</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">To resolve the problems of the prior arts as explained above, the present invention has an object of providing a method for producing anhydrosugar alcohol, employing a new manner of operation different from conventional batch-type or semi-batch-type dehydration reaction when conducting the step of converting hydrogenated sugar to anhydrosugar alcohol by dehydration reaction, which can remarkably improve the production efficiency and provide a reaction product having a quality that is the same as or better than those of conventional processes, and thus in particular, can be suitably applied in a large-scale process for producing anhydrosugar alcohol.</p><heading id="h0005">[TECHNICAL MEANS]</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">To achieve the above-stated object, the present invention provides a method for producing anhydrosugar alcohol comprising the step of converting hydrogenated sugar to anhydrosugar alcohol by dehydration reaction in a reactor, wherein while the dehydration reaction is conducted, the hydrogenated sugar is continuously fed into the reactor and the produced anhydrosugar alcohol is continuously discharged out of the reactor, and the reaction<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> mixture is not circulated in and out of the reactor during the conduction of the dehydration reaction.</p><heading id="h0006">[EFFECT OF THE INVENTION]</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">If hydrogenated sugar is converted to anhydrosugar alcohol through the continuous dehydration reaction according to the present invention, it is possible to improve the production efficiency remarkably as compared with conventional batch-type or semi-batch-type processes, provide a reaction product having a quality that is the same as or better than those of conventional processes, and decrease the time required for connecting to the subsequent procedures. Therefore, in particular, the method for producing anhydrosugar alcohol of the present invention can be suitably applied in a large-scale process for producing anhydrosugar alcohol.</p><heading id="h0007">[CONCRETE EXPLANATION TO CARRY OUT THE INVENTION]</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention is explained in more detail below.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the method for producing anhydrosugar alcohol of the present invention, while the dehydration reaction is conducted, the hydrogenated sugar is continuously fed into the reactor and the produced anhydrosugar alcohol is continuously discharged out of the reactor. That is, while the dehydration reaction in the present invention is conducted, a continuous flow by the reaction mixture is formed within the reactor.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The flow rate of the reaction mixture forming a continuous flow within the reactor during the dehydration reaction can be selected properly according to the concrete specifications of the reactor and other conditions for operation. Therefore, although a flow rate of 2 to 4 mL/minute was applied when using a reactor of 1L size in the present working examples, it is not limited thereto, and a skilled artisan could easily select a suitable flow rate according to an enlargement of facilities and/or a change in other conditions for operation.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The continuous flow formed within the reactor during the dehydration reaction, may preferably be steady state flow. As used herein, "steady state flow" corresponds to a state in which no substantial change in the reaction system is observed by an outside observer-i.e., a state in which the feeding rate of material into the reactor and discharge rate of material out of the reactor are substantially the same. As used herein, "substantially the same" means that the feeding rate of material into the reactor is, for example, 0.95 to 1.05 times, more preferably 0.99 to 1.01 times the discharge rate of material out of the reactor, and most preferably they are the same.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the present invention, the reaction mixture is not circulated in and out of the reactor while the dehydration reaction is conducted. Some conventional prior arts employ a process wherein a dehydration reactor is line-connected with a separate outer device(s) (e.g., heat exchanger, etc.) and while the dehydration reaction is conducted, a part of the material in the reactor is discharged out of the reactor, passed through the outer device and reintroduced into the reactor. Such a circulation process of the reaction mixture has advantages of supplying additional heat source into the reactor and conducting the additional function of agitation, etc. However, it has disadvantages of difficulty in overall control of the flow amount of material which is continuously fed into the reactor, and disturbance of formation of uniform continuous flow within the reactor due to the irregularity generated by the circulation of liquid. Accordingly, the present invention does not circulate the reaction mixture in and out of the reactor while the dehydration reaction is conducted, thereby the continuous feeding of material into the reactor can be easily controlled and the uniform continuous flow can be formed within the reactor.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The continuous dehydration reaction of the present invention can be conducted in a single reactor, or by using a facility wherein two or more reactors are serially connected, if<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> necessary. In the case of using two or more serially connected reactors, they are recognized as one reactor as a whole, and the continuous flow formed during the dehydration reaction is maintained throughout the whole reactors.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The inside of the reactor where the continuous dehydration reaction of the present invention is conducted may be divided into two or more sections, if necessary, and the operation conditions such as temperature, pressure, etc. for each section may be controlled independently. In the case of operation with two or more serially connected reactors, each reactor may correspond to each of the above-mentioned sections. In this case, the feeding/discharge rates of material for each section (or each reactor) may be set differently according to necessity, but the overall continuous flow is maintained.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the present invention, the continuous dehydration reaction of hydrogenated sugar can be conducted, for example, under a temperature condition of from 105 to 200°C (more preferably, 110 to 150°C) and a pressure condition of from 1 to 100 mmHg (more preferably, 1 to 50 mmHg) for 1 to 10 hours (more preferably, 2 to 5 hours), but it is not limited thereto. As stated earlier, in the case of dividing the inside of the reactor-where the continuous dehydration reaction is conducted-into two or more sections, the operation conditions such as temperature, pressure, etc. for each section may be controlled independently within the above ranges. According to an embodiment of the present invention, in the case of dividing the inside of the reactor into two or more sections, based on the reaction mixture flow, it is preferable to set the reaction temperature of the latter section lower than that of the former section since it is possible thereby to reduce byproducts which may be generated drastically due to overheating in the latter part of the reaction.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Hydrogenated sugar, also generally referred to as sugar alcohol, means a compound obtained by adding hydrogen to the reductive end group in sugar. According to the carbon<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> number, hydrogenated sugar is classified into tetritol, pentitol, hexitol and heptitol (4, 5, 6 and 7 carbons, respectively).
