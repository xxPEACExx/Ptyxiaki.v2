In particular, it is strictly necessary<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> that the label is applied in a correct way on the respective container; in order to obtain this, the label requires to be received on a surface container having a well-defined geometry as well as a sufficient rigidity. This requirement of the receiving surface is particularly important for self-stick labels or pressure-sensitive labels.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As known, plastic containers present on the market have thinner and thinner lateral walls, which are therefore easily deformable and very difficult to be labelled.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In addition, if a label is not correctly applied on the relative container, there are high risks that such label may detach from the container itself during production, with consequent possible hampering of downstream operations.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Furthermore, in the beverage or liquid packing industry, there is a general demand to reduce, or at least to avoid increasing, the number of machines present in container handling apparatuses as well as complexity thereof.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is therefore an object of the present invention to find a straightforward and cost-effective solution to solve the above-described problem (correct application of labels on the respective containers) as well as to meet the above<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> demand.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">This object is achieved by a capping machine as claimed in claim 1.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">A preferred embodiment is hereinafter disclosed for a better understanding of the present invention, by mere way of non-limitative example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:

Carousel 18 receives a sequence of filled and open bottles 2 in the vertical positions from<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> conveyor 17, which cooperates with the carousel 18 itself at a first transfer station 19; carousel 18 releases a sequence of capped bottles 2 in the vertical positions to an outlet conveyor 20, which cooperates with the carousel 18 itself at a second transfer station 21; carousel 18 also receives a sequence of caps 3 from a cap feeding device 22 (known per se and only partially shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>), which cooperates with the carousel 18 itself at a third transfer station 23.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Carousel 18 comprises a plurality of operative units 24 (only one of which shown in detail in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005">Figures 3 to 7</figref>), which are uniformly distributed about axis B and are mounted at a peripheral portion of carousel 18.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Operative units 24 are displaced by carousel 18 along a circular processing path P which extends about axis B and through transfer sections 19, 21 and 23.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">More specifically, by considering processing path P, transfer station 23 is preferably located upstream of transfer station 19, which is in turn arranged upstream of transfer station 21; in practice, transfer station 23 is arranged between transfer stations 19 and 21 with respect to processing path P.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As may be seen in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005">Figures 3 to 7</figref>, each operative unit 24 has an axis C parallel to axis B and orthogonal to path P; each operative unit 24 basically comprises support means<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> 25, carried by a rotating structure 26 of carousel 18 and adapted to support one bottle 2, and a capping head 27 also carried by the rotating structure 26 and selectively activated for applying one cap 3 onto the open end 11 of the relative bottle 2.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Since operative units 24 are identical to one another, only one will be disclosed in detail hereinafter for clarity and simplicity; it is evident that the features that will hereinafter disclosed are common to all operative units 24.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In particular, support means 25 of operative unit 24 are adapted to receive a relative bottle 2 in the vertical position and with its base 10 in the first configuration (<figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>); support means 25 are also able to retain the bottle 2 in the above said position along path P from transfer station 19 to transfer station 21.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Capping head 27 is in use located above bottle 2 and is movable to, and away from, the open end 11 of the bottle 2 to apply one cap 3 onto the open end 11 itself.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In particular, capping head 27 has a top end portion 27a directly fixed to a bottom end 28a of a spindle 28, carried by rotating structure 26 of carousel 18 in a rotatable and translational manner with respect to axis C.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In greater details, spindle 28 is coaxial with axis C and is in use actuated with a movement of rotation about<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> axis C and with a simultaneous movement of translation along the same axis C. The movements of rotation and translation are directly transmitted to capping head 27 and are coordinated with respect to one another so as to obtain a helical movement of spindle 28. The way in which such helical movement of spindle 28 is generated can be considered conventional and lies outside the scope of protection of the present invention.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Capping head 27 also has a bottom end portion 30 provided with a seat 31 to house a relative cap 3 prior to applying it onto the relative bottle 2.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In particular, in the example shown, seat 31 is defined by an axial threaded hole formed in bottom end portion 30 of capping head 27 and adapted to receive threaded cap 3.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">During its helical movement about axis C, capping head 27 is displaced between a rest position (<figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 7</figref>), in which it is detached from bottle 2, and a final application position (<figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref>), in which it has completed application of cap 3 onto open end 11 of bottle 11.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005">Figures 3 to 7</figref>, support means 25 comprise a support plate 32 fixed to a horizontal table 33 of rotating structure 26 of carousel 18 and adapted to define a horizontal support for base 10 of a relative bottle 2. In particular, in the example shown, support<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> plate 32 is arranged above horizontal table 33, extends orthogonally to axis C and has, on top, a horizontal resting surface 34 for supporting base 10 of relative bottle 2. In practice, annular area 15 is the only part of bottle 2 contacting resting surface 34, being central area 16 retracted along axis A with respect to annular area 15.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In greater details, support plate 32 has a central through opening 35, arranged coaxial with axis C and with a respective through-hole 36 of table 33.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Support means 25 also comprise gripping means 38 designed to act on the neck 12 of the relative bottle 2 so as to retain the bottle 2 itself in the vertical position on the support plate 32 during application of the relative cap 3.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Operative unit 24 advantageously comprises a plunger 40 borne by table 33 of carousel 18 on the opposite side of support plate 32 with respect to bottle 2 and which is selectively displaceable along axis C, with respect to support plate 32, to act, through hole 36 and opening 35, on base 10 of relative bottle 2 and to deform it from the first configuration to a second configuration (<figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 6</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">7</figref>) further-inwardly-retracted than the first configuration.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In particular, in the second configuration, central area 16 is more recessed with respect to annular area 15<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> than in the first configuration. In other words, in the second configuration, base 10 of bottle 2 is in part further retracted inwardly of the bottle 2 itself with respect to the first configuration.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In practice, the first configuration corresponds to a maximum internal volume of bottle 2, whilst the second configuration defines an internal volume of the bottle 2 itself smaller than that in the first configuration and an inner pressure higher than in the first configuration.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In particular, plunger 40 is coaxial with axis A of the bottle 2 borne by support plate 32 and is selectively displaceable between a retracted position (<figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">Figures 3 to 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">7</figref>), in which it is detached or spaced from base 10 of the bottle 2, and an advanced position (<figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref>), in which it extends through hole 36 of table 33 as well as opening 35 of support plate 32 and has completed deformation of base 10 of the bottle 2 itself.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">More specifically, movement of plunger 40 from the retracted position to the advanced position produces a deformation of base 10 of bottle 2 from the first configuration to the second configuration.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, plunger 40 is moved from the retracted position to the advanced position after capping head 27 has reached the final application position. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref>, capping<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> head 27 is maintained in the final application position while plunger 40 is moved from the retracted position to the advanced position.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">According to a possible alternative, plunger 40 may be moved from the retracted position to the advanced position while capping head 27 is moved from the rest position to the final application position.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Preferably, plunger 40 is axially actuated by a fluidic actuator (known per se and not shown), for example of pneumatic type, carried by table 33. According to other possible variants (not shown), plunger 40 may be coupled to, or be defined, by a linear motion mobile member or may be driven by an electric motor coupled with a worm screw.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Bottles 2 exiting from carousel 18 of capping machine 6 are then transferred to labelling machine 7 directly by conveyor 20 only or by conveyor 20 in conjunction with a further linear conveyor 41, able to change the spacing between bottles 2, and with a final starwheel conveyor 42 directly cooperating with the labelling machine 7.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Labelled bottles 2 exiting from labelling machine 7 are then transferred, by a starwheel conveyor 43, to a next processing machine (not shown).</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In use, bottles 2 are filled on filling machine 5 with a pourable product at ambient temperature, for example a liquid food product at about 20°C. In practice, empty<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> bottles 2 are fed to filling machine 5 by conveyor 13 and, after being filled, exit filling machine 5 through conveyor 17. From here bottles 2 reach capping machine 6 to be closed with respective caps 3.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In particular, bottles 2 are directly transferred to carousel 18 and reach in a sequence the different operative units 24 of the carousel 18 itself.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Each bottle 2 is transferred to a relative operative unit 24 with its base 10 in the first configuration. Each bottle 2 is arranged resting on support plate 32 of the relative operating unit 24 and is retained on top by gripping means 38. In particular, bottles 2 are fed to carousel 18 in a vertical position, with their axes A parallel to central axis B and coaxial to axes C of respective operating units 24.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Prior to reaching transfer station 19, each operative unit 24 receives a relative cap 3 at transfer station 23 by cap feeding device 22 (<figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>); in particular, the cap 3 is housed within seat 31 of bottom end portion 30 of a relative capping head 27.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">During the movement of bottles 2 from transfer station 19 to transfer section 21, each capping head 27 is moved by the relative spindle 28 from the rest position to the final application position. In particular, the helical movement impressed by spindle 28 to capping head 27 produces<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> screwing of cap 3 on neck 12 of bottle 2 (<figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">5</figref>).</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">After completion of this operation, capping head 27 is maintained in its final application position (<figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref>) and the relative plunger 40 is activated to bring base 10 of bottle 2 from the first to the second configuration.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">As above-mentioned, the deforming operation on base 10 of each bottle 2 may be also performed simultaneously with the application of the cap 3 on the same bottle 2. In this latter case, by considering one single operative unit 24, movement of capping head 27 from the rest position to the final application position occurs at the same time with movement of the respective plunger 40 from the retracted position to the advanced position.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Due to this further deforming operation carried out on capping machine 6, each bottle 2 exiting therefrom has a reduced internal volume and an increased inner pressure. This produces a consequent "stiffening" of the lateral walls of bottles 2, which can therefore be more easily labelled than usual bottles.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In particular, bottles 2 exiting from capping machine 6 and destined to be fed to labelling machine 7 by conveyors 41 and 42 have well-defined geometries and sufficiently rigid lateral surfaces to allow a correct application of labels 4.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">This greatly reduces the risks that the labels 4 may<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> detach from the respective bottles 2 during subsequent operations carried out on the bottles 2 themselves after labelling.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Furthermore, thanks to the fact that the deforming operation made by plungers 40 is carried out on capping machine 6, apparatus 1 has the same footprint as known apparatuses not performing deformation of the bottle bases.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Clearly, changes may be made to capping machine 6 as described and illustrated herein without, however, departing from the scope of protection as defined in the accompanying claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90459970" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A capping machine (6) for applying caps (3) on respective open ends (11) of containers (2) made of a deformable material and filled with a pourable product, said machine (6) comprising:
