Most of on-exchange stabilising resins applied in the technology are sulfonic connections of different kind, dissolved in strongly concentrated sulphuric acid. Essentially, resins differ in a basic element type, that usually are single associations or their mixtures. The self-ionizing ability of the ion-exchange resin provides permanent hydrogen cation refurbish and anions of the basic element, that can dissolve structural bonds , e.g. of clay and mineral salts found in a soil.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Ion-exchange resin most often consists of oxidant, solvent and the dispersant. An interaction among these elements activates mineral cements naturally occurring in the soil and ties soil molecules altogether creating material showing similarity to most of sedimentary rocks. The resulting material has a higher density and hardness compared with hard rock formations. Filling of internal vacua is encapsulating material what increases its resistance to the water permeation.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Two groups of materials with similar properties are being used in technology.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The first group is protected by US patent No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4941924A"><text>US4941924</text></patcit> Road stabilizer FR-1 (D-limonene sulfonic acid dissolved in sulphuric acid). The material is produced as liquid ion-exchange concentrated resin with 1.7 g / cm3 density and a pH of 1.0. The<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> material is used for stabilisation as a dilution in water in a ratio of about 1: 200 to 1: 600. The main applicability limitation of this preparation is the presence need of significant quantities of aluminosilicate in the ground mixture.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to use the resin EN-1 in sandy soils of low plasticity, it should be enriched with at least 20% admixture of clay, that is a major impediment to the use of this material.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Beside the stabilizer EN-1, similar products using solutions had been developed by the University of Wroclaw.

The most characteristic feature of the resin is that it is obtained by reaction of a multistage sulphonation in concentrated sulphuric acid and / or fuming sulphuric acid (oleum) derivatives of aromatic hydrocarbons containing acidic groups. Characteristic feature of a process of deriving the preparation for soil stabilization is that the concentrated sulphuric acid and / or fuming sulfuric acid (oleum) is proportionally added in the proper amount of granulated derivatives of aromatic hydrocarbons containing acidic groups, simultaneously vigorously stirring and conducting first reaction stage at a temperature between 50 ° C to 60 ° C for about 6 hours, and then raising the temperature and conducting the second reaction stage at a temperature of 100 ° C to 125 ° C.
