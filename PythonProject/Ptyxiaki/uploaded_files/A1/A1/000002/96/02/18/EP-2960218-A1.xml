Patent Literatures 1 and 2). In the rod-in-collapse method, first, a glass body of a nearly circular cylinder shape is perforated to form a plurality of holes extending along a central axis of the glass body, thereby producing a glass pipe. Subsequently, a plurality of core rods each including a core portion are inserted into the respective holes of the glass pipe and the glass pipe is heated with the plurality of core rods being inserted in the respective holes, thereby to implement integration of the plurality of core rods and the glass pipe. The multicore optical fiber preform is manufactured through the above rod-in-collapse method.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A multicore optical fiber can be manufactured by drawing the multicore optical fiber preform manufactured as described above.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Citation List</b></heading><heading id="h0004"><b>Patent Literatures</b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004"><ul><li>Patent Literature 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPS61201633A"><text>Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Publication No. S61-201633</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Literature 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2011168464A"><text>Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2011-168464</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b>Summary of Invention</b></heading><heading id="h0006"><b>Technical Problem</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The Inventors conducted research on the conventional preform manufacturing method and found the problem as described below. Namely, for manufacturing an optical fiber preform having one core portion, a core rod is inserted into a hole located at the central axis of the glass pipe (which will be referred to hereinafter as pipe central axis) and, heating in axial symmetry is carried out while rotating the glass pipe around the pipe central axis. This process results in implementing integration of the glass pipe and the core rod. Deformation of the glass pipe during this heating integration step occurs in symmetry about the pipe central axis. As a result, glass in the vicinity of the core rod deforms toward the pipe central axis, thereby to implement the integration of the core rod and the glass pipe. Therefore, in the case of the optical fiber preform having one core portion, the core portion can be accurately arranged at the position of the central axis of the optical fiber preform.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In contrast to it, for making optical connection of cores in a multicore optical fiber with a light emitting device or with a light receiving device or optical connection of cores in a certain multicore optical fiber with cores in another multicore optical fiber, it is important to make a connection loss as small as possible. For realizing it, the positions of the respective core portions in a cross section of the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> multicore optical fiber preform need to be precisely controlled. In the multicore optical fiber preform, however, the deformation of glass in the vicinity of the core rods during the heating integration step is not symmetrical as to the core portions located off the central axis of the multicore optical fiber preform (which will be referred to hereinafter as preform central axis) out of the plurality of core portions. As a result, the centers of the holes do not coincide with the centers of the core portions after the integration. For this reason, it is difficult to arrange the core portions located off the preform central axis, accurately at as-designed positions.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">When a clearance is too large between an inner wall surface of each hole of the glass pipe and an outer peripheral surface of the core rod, it will tend to increase a positional deviation of the core portion in the multicore optical fiber preform. As long as the clearance is small, the positional deviation of the core portion after the integration can be kept small. However, when the clearance is too small, it becomes difficult to insert the core rod into the hole of the glass pipe. In addition, the inner wall surface of the hole of the glass pipe or the outer peripheral surface of the core rod is likely to be scratched during insertion of the core rod, and this scratch will be a cause to generate bubbles or the like at an interface.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Furthermore, relationship between core diameter and inter-core pitch in the multicore optical fiber is determined in a single rod-in-collapse step and cannot be corrected in a subsequent step. In addition, it is difficult to acquire information of the positions of the core portions in a cross section from the multicore optical fiber preform by<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> nondestructive means such as a preform analyzer and also difficult to finely adjust them. Therefore, it is desirable to highly accurately achieve the desired core pitch or the like in the rod-in-collapse step.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention has been accomplished in order to solve the problem as described above, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a preform manufacturing method allowing easy manufacture of a multicore optical fiber preform in which a plurality of core portions are accurately arranged at as-designed positions.</p><heading id="h0007"><b>Solution to Problem</b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">A preform manufacturing method according to the present invention is a method for manufacturing a multicore optical fiber preform comprising a plurality of core portions each extending in a predetermined axial direction, and a common cladding portion covering each of the plurality of core portions.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As a first aspect of the present invention, the preform manufacturing method comprises a hole forming step and a heating integration step.

Since in this formula (6) the value of the right-hand side has to be not less than the value of the left-hand side, the diameter reduction ratio φ needs to be smaller than 0.0033. For example, when the outer diameter of the multicore optical fiber is 125 µm, the outer diameter of the multicore optical fiber preform is not less than 37.5 mm. When the outer diameter of the multicore optical fiber is 150 µm, the outer diameter of the multicore optical fiber preform is not less than 45 mm.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> <maths id="math0010" num="(6)"><math display="block"><mrow><mn>0.15</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>m</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>m</mi><mo>≦</mo><mi>R</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>≦</mo><mn>0.5</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>μ</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>m</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>φ</mi></mrow></math><img id="ib0010" file="imgb0010.tif" wi="81" he="5" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><heading id="h0011"><b>Reference Signs List</b></heading><p id="p0050" num="0050">1, 4 multicore optical fiber; 3, 6 multicore optical fiber preform; 10 glass body (before formation of holes); 11<sub>0</sub>-11<sub>6</sub>, 41<sub>1</sub>-41<sub>8</sub> cores; 12, 42 cladding; 21<sub>0</sub>-21<sub>6</sub>, 51<sub>1</sub>-51<sub>8</sub> core rods; 22, 52 glass pipe; 23 clearance; 31<sub>0</sub>-31<sub>6</sub>, 61<sub>1</sub>-61<sub>8</sub> core portions; 32,62 cladding portion.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90460439" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A preform manufacturing method for manufacturing a multicore optical fiber preform comprising a plurality of core portions each extending in a predetermined axial direction, and a common cladding portion covering each of the plurality of core portions, the preform manufacturing method comprising:
