However, many known contact adhesives are based on polychloroprene that, due to its high solvent contents, is usually not a very sustainable product. In fact, most of the solvents used for such adhesives are not in compliance with existing volatile organic compounds (VOC) regulations (e.g. South Coasts Air Quality Management District, SCAQMD, Rule 1168). Although water-based chloroprene rubbers (CR) have been developed, their performance is lacking and they require longer drying times. In addition, they still contain chlorine that is for environmental and toxicological reasons undesirable.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Other alternatives that have been reported include styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) rubbers. However, such systems still need non-sustainable solvents such as toluene or hexane, as their performance is insufficient for highly demanding bonding processes.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">While polyurethane dispersions are known to provide for good alternatives, their use is limited to certain applications, in particular the shoe industry on an industrial scale.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Thus, there remains need in the art, for alternative adhesives that can overcome the known drawbacks and provide for sustainable adhesive systems with a good performance.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention is based on the inventors' finding that the above need can be met by an adhesive system that comprises certain vinyl acetate polymers or vinyl acetate acrylic copolymers in oxygenated organic solvents. Such an adhesive system is less toxic than existing systems in that VOC emissions can be reduced, it exhibits a very good performance on most materials, can be produced with high solid contents and on the basis of renewable raw materials. As the adhesive itself contains higher amounts of solids, less solvent is for its production is needed.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In a first aspect, the present invention is thus directed to a method for the production of vinyl acetate polymers or vinyl acetate acrylic copolymers comprising polymerizing a mixture of<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> monomers in an oxygenated organic solvent and in the presence of a catalyst to form a vinyl acetate polymer or vinyl acetate acrylic copolymer, the raction mixture comprising based on the total weight of the mixture
