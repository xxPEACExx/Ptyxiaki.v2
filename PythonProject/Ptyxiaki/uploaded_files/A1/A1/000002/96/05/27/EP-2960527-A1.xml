The present disclosure especially relates to an intake-pipe configuration for supplying a fluid to a fluid machine.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In a turbocharger mounted to a vehicle, a ship, and an industrial engine, used is a compressor which includes an impeller that rotates at a high speed and increases a pressure of a fluid taking advantageous of a centrifugal force. For such a compressor of a turbocharger, it is desirable to achieve a wide flow-rate operation range in terms of the performance of an engine, for example, to improve the engine torque performance or to increase the engine output.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As a measure to expand the flow-rate operation range of such a compressor, there is a pre-swirl generation device in which a variable mechanism such as guide vanes is disposed at the upstream side of the compressor, and the variable mechanism is controlled to generate a swirl flow in the fluid, so as to expand the flow-rate operation range (Patent Document 1).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Further, an application previously filed by the present applicant and not published yet (Patent Document 2) discloses a technique to expand the flow-rate operation range by modifying the shape of an intake pipe at the upstream side of a compressor and generating a swirl flow in a fluid flowing through the intake pipe.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP4464661B"><text>JP4464661B</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2012044103A"><text>JP2012-044103A</text></patcit></li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h0006">Problems to be Solved</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, the pre-swirl generation device of Patent Document 1 is to operate a variable mechanism with a mechanical unit such as an actuator, and thus there are several problems, such as the increased size of the device, the complicated structure, and the increased cost. Especially in a turbocharger for an automobile, there is a strong need for reduction of the device size, a simplified structure, and cost cut. Thus, it is difficult to adopt the above mechanical unit in a turbocharger for an automobile.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In this regard, the above technique of Patent Document 2 is advantageous in that the flow-rate operation range can be widened without using a mechanical unit. However, the intake pipe has a complicated three-dimensional shape. Thus, if it possible to generate a swirl flow in a fluid with an intake pipe having a more simplified shape, an increase in versatility upon mounting of an engine or the like can be expected.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">At least one embodiment of the present invention was made in view of the above technical background. An object is to provide a fluid machine whereby it is possible to enhance the performance, for example, to expand the flow-rate operation range, with a simplified shape of an intake pipe.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to the Problems</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">A fluid machine according to at least one embodiment of the present invention includes: an impeller mounted to a rotation shaft; a housing which houses the impeller rotatably; and an intake pipe for supplying a fluid to the housing. The intake pipe includes at least: a first bend portion disposed on a first plane; and a second bend portion disposed at a downstream side of the first bend portion and on a second plane which is different from the first plane, the second bend portion including an upstream section having a center axis oriented along a center axis of a downstream section of the first bend portion and a downstream section having a center axis oriented along an axial direction of the impeller at a front of the impeller. The intake pipe has a constant cross-sectional shape from an upstream end of the first bend portion to a downstream end of the second bend portion.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The above fluid machine includes the intake pipe including two bend portions including the first bend portion disposed on the first plane and the second bend portion disposed on the second plane, which is different from the first plane, and at the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> downstream side of the first bend portion. The intake pipe has a constant cross section from the upstream end of the first bend portion to the downstream end of the second bend portion. According to the present embodiment, twin swirls are generated in the fluid when the fluid flows through the first bend portion, and the twin swirls in the fluid turn into a swirl flow when the fluid flows through the second bend portion. Thus, it is possible to generate a unidirectional swirl flow in the fluid flowing through the intake pipe. As described above, it is possible to generate a swirl flow in the fluid flowing through the intake pipe with a simplified shape of the intake pipe having a constant cross section, which makes it possible to expand the flow-rate operation range of the fluid machine.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In some embodiments, a bending angle of the first bend portion is in a range of not less than 30° and not more than 150°, and a bending angle of the second bend portion is in a range of not less than 45° and not more than 100°. Further, in the above embodiment, preferably, the bending angle of the first bend portion is in a range of not less than 45° and not more than 90°, and the bending angle of the second bend portion is in a range of not less than 45° and not more than 90°.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to the above embodiment, it is possible to generate a swirl flow effectively in the fluid flowing through the intake pipe.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In some embodiments, an intersection angle between the first plane and the second plane is in a range of not less than 45° and not more than 135°.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to the above embodiment, it is possible to generate a unidirectional swirl flow effectively in the fluid flowing through the intake pipe.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In some embodiments, a distance between: an intersection between the center axes of the upstream section and the downstream section of the second bend portion; and a front end of vanes of the impeller is not more than five times a pipe diameter of the intake pipe.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the above embodiment, the swirl flow generated in the fluid at the second bend portion is supplied to the impeller in the housing without being damped greatly.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In some embodiments, a distance between: an intersection between the center axes of the upstream section and the downstream section of the first bend portion; and the intersection between the center axes of the upstream section and the downstream section of the second bend portion is not more than three times the pipe diameter of the intake pipe.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the above embodiment, the twin swirls generated in the fluid at the first bend portion reach the second bend portion without disappearing, so that a swirl flow is generated in the fluid flowing through the second bend portion.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In one embodiment, in a front view of the impeller, a right or left rotational direction of the impeller is the same direction as a right or left bending direction of the first bend portion from an upstream side to a downstream side.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to the above embodiment, a swirl flow in a forward direction that swirls in the same direction as the rotational direction of the impeller is generated in the fluid flowing through the downstream section of the second bend portion. In this way, the detachment phenomenon of the fluid is restricted by the reduced attack angle of the impeller, which is effective in widening the flow-rate operation range especially in a range with a small flow rate.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In another embodiment, in a front view of the impeller, a right or left rotational direction of the impeller is opposite to a right or left bending direction of the first bend portion from an upstream side to a downstream side.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to the above embodiment, a reverse swirl flow swirling in a direction opposite to the rotational direction of the impeller is generated in the fluid flowing through the downstream section of the second bend portion. In this way, the vane load is increased by the increased attack angle of the impeller, which makes it possible to improve the pressure ratio, and thus it is advantageous especially in a region with a large flow rate.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The fluid machine of the above embodiment with the above configuration can be suitably used in particular as a compressor of a turbocharger for an automobile, which is subject to a strong need for size reduction of a device and cost cutting.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Further, at least one embodiment of the present invention is a hydraulic machine system, including: a first hydraulic machine and a second hydraulic machine each of which is the hydraulic machine according to any one of claims 1 to 8; and a collecting pipe for collecting a compressed fluid supplied from the first hydraulic machine and the second hydraulic machine and causing the compressed fluid to flow downstream.
