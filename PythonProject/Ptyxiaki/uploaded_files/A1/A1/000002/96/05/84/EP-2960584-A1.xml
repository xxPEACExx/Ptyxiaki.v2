Such an oven generally includes a cabinet defining an external appearance of the oven and a chamber defined in the cabinet to receive an object to be cooked (hereinafter referred to as cooking object).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The interior space of the chamber may be heated to an extremely high temperature. The cooking object within the chamber is cooked using the high temperature. There are a variety of ovens including ovens that use fossil fuel, ovens that use electricity, ovens that use steam, and the like. Of course, these heat sources may be used in combination.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The cabinet may be provided with a rotatable door. The door serves to open or close the chamber. More specifically, the door closes the chamber to isolate the interior space of the chamber from the outside during cooking and then, upon completion of cooking, opens the chamber to communicate the interior space of the chamber with the outside.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In many cases, a rack on which the cooking object is seated may be placed within the chamber. The rack may function to assist the cooking object in being positioned in the interior space of the chamber such that high temperature atmosphere within the chamber is transferred to the cooking object. That is, the rack may function to cause the cooking object to be indirectly cooked via the high temperature atmosphere without direct contact between the cooking object and the heat source.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">To cook the cooking object, a user will first open the door and seat the cooking object on the rack placed within the chamber. In this case, the user must extend their hand deep into the chamber. Since the cooking object is generally placed on the rack after the interior of the chamber is preheated to a high temperature, the user has to wear oven mitts when placing the cooking object. Of course, removing the cooking object immediately after completion of cooking or removing the cooking object during cooking to check progress of cooking may inconvenience the user. That is, the user may suffer from great inconvenience when placing or removing the cooking object in or from the high temperature chamber. In particular, a process of placing or removing a heavy cooking object in or from the chamber by hand may be troublesome to the user and cause strain to the user's body. These problems may be further worsened when the rack is fixed in the chamber so as not to be removed outward.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">To solve the aforementioned problems, as exemplarily shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGs. 1 and 2</figref>, there are provided ovens in which a rack may be removed out of a chamber.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the oven, designated by reference numeral 10, includes a cabinet 20, a chamber 25 defined in the cabinet 20 to receive a cooking object, and a door 30 pivotally rotatably connected to the cabinet 20. When a user, designated by reference character "a", grips a handle 40 of the door 30 and opens the door 30, the chamber 25 may communicate with the outside. The door 30 is generally a pull-down type door that is opened as the user grips the handle 40 installed near an upper end of the door 30 and pivotally rotates the door 30 downward.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> shows the interior of the chamber 25 in a completely opened state of the door 20 provided in the oven 10 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. Generally, the door 20 may be rotated 90 degrees to be opened.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As exemplarily shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, a rack 50 is slidably supported by rack supporters 60.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The rack 50 is a component on which a cooking object c is seated. Cooking may be performed after the cooking object c is seated on the rack 50. Of course, the cooking object c may be seated on the rack 50 while being placed on or received in a cooking utensil b.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> shows a configuration in which the rack 50 may be removed from the chamber 25 as the user pulls the rack 25 and the rack 50 may be introduced into the chamber 25 as the user pushes the rack 25. However, in the case of the oven having the above-described configuration, the user has to directly grip and operate the rack 50. In<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> addition, this operation must be continued until the rack 50 is completely removed or introduced by a predetermined distance. Therefore, the rack 50 is inconvenient to use and removal and introduction of the rack 50 may not be smoothly performed due to friction between the rack 50 and the rack supporters 60. Of course, the slidable rack 50 inevitably causes the user's hand to be exposed to a high temperature environment for a long time, in the same manner as in use of a fixed rack.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, the cabinet 20 is provided with a chamber opening 26 and a gasket 70 mounted around the chamber opening 26. When the door 30 is closed, an inner surface of the door 30 comes into close contact with the gasket 70, thus allowing the interior of the chamber 25 to be sealed.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> shows an oven having an improved configuration as compared to the oven shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>. More particularly, the oven is configured to achieve smoother removal and introduction of the rack 50 via sliding rails 80.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In this configuration, each sliding rail 80 is interposed between a support bracket 60 fixed inside the chamber 25 and a rack bracket 51 fixed to the rack 50. That is, the rack bracket 51 is movable relative to the support bracket 60 via the sliding rail 80.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">However, the sliding rack structure basically causes the same problems as the oven shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, although it provides smoother removal and introduction of the rack 50. For example, the user may still have to grip and operate the high temperature rack until removal or introduction of the rack is completed.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">For this reason, there is a need to provide an oven that may provide easy removal and introduction of a rack and allow a user to operate the rack with minimum motion and time. In addition, there is a need to provide an oven that may minimize the frequency and time of the user's hand being exposed to a high temperature environment and to allow a user to operate a rack from the outside of a chamber.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to an oven that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In one embodiment, an object of the present invention is to provide an oven which may allow a user to remove or introduce a rack by operating a door rather than the rack. In this way, one embodiment of the present invention is to provide an oven which may allow a user to easily remove or introduce a rack without gripping and operating the high temperature rack.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In one embodiment, an object of the present invention is to provide an oven which may allow a rack to be automatically removed even when a user does not apply force to remove the rack.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In one embodiment, an object of the present invention is to provide an oven which may allow manual removal and automatic removal of a rack to be selectively performed when a door is opened.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In one embodiment, an object of the present invention is to provide an oven which may allow a user to introduce a rack without gripping the rack.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In one embodiment, an object of the present invention is to provide an oven which may allow a user to remove a rack by operating the rack for a short time in an open state of a door.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In one embodiment, an object of the present invention is to provide an oven which includes a spring device to enable automatic removal of a rack, the spring device being installed so as not to come into contact with a cooking object and hidden so as not to be viewed by a user, thus having enhanced reliability.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In one embodiment, an object of the present invention is to provide an oven which may achieve the above-described objects without considerable changes in conventional rack structures.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In one embodiment, an object of the present invention is to provide an oven which may allow automatic removal or semi-automatic removal of a rack to be selectively performed when a door is opened.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In one embodiment, an object of the present invention is to provide an oven which may prevent rapid removal of a rack.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In one embodiment, an object of the present invention is to provide an oven which includes a variety of components to enable automatic removal or semi-automatic removal of a rack, these components being arranged at positions not to be viewed by a user, thereby achieving enhanced reliability and convenience in use. In addition, an object of the present invention is to provide an oven which may prevent these components from being contaminated by a cooking object.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Additional advantages, objects, and features will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice. The objectives and other advantages may be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, an oven includes a cabinet having a chamber configured to receive a cooking object therein, a door configured to open or close the cabinet, a rack assembly including an operating member configured to support the cooking object seated thereon and to be removable outward from the interior of the chamber, and a support member fixed inside the chamber to support the operating member disposed thereon, and a spring device including a first fixing piece located at the operating member, a second fixing piece located at the support member, and an elastic member having one side connected to the first fixing piece and the other side connected to the second fixing piece, the elastic member being elastically restored by a distance between the first fixing piece and the second fixing piece to remove the operating member from the chamber.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Accordingly, the operating member may be introduced into the chamber via elastic deformation of the spring device and may be removed from the chamber via elastic restoration of the spring device.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In addition, as a result of the spring device / elastic member being located in the vertical gap between the operating member and the support member, it is possible to prevent increase in the height of the entire rack assembly. In addition, it is possible to prevent interference between the spring device and the cooking object. Of course, the spring device is out of the user's view, which may increase satisfaction of a user.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Removal and introduction of the operating member may be automatically performed as the user opens or closes the door. For example, the operating member may be introduced by the door, i.e. by closing the door. In this case, the spring device, more particularly, the elastic member may be elastically deformed. Then, the operating member may be removed by opening the door. In this case, the spring device, more particularly, the elastic member may be elastically restored. In other words, as the door that keeps the elastic member in an elastically deformed state is moved away from the operating member, the elastic member may be elastically restored. As such, removal of the operating member may be automatically performed as the door is opened.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The oven may further include a coupling device configured to selectively couple the support member and the operating member to each other so as to selectively cause movement of the operating member relative to the support member. The coupling device functions to keep the elastic member in an elastically deformed state. That is, once the support member and the operating member are coupled to each other by the coupling<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> device, the elastic member may be kept elastically deformed even if the door is opened. In this case, removal of the operating member does not occur even if the door is opened.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">To remove the operating member, the user may apply force to the operating member in an introduction direction of the operating member for a short time. In this case, coupling between the operating member and the support member by the coupling device may be released due to a gap between the door and the operating member. That is, the coupling by the coupling device is released when the force applied to the operating member is removed, causing elastic restoration of the operating member. Thereby, the operating member may be removed. In this way, the operating member may be semi-automatically removed as the door is opened and coupling by the coupling device is released.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The coupling device may include a latch assembly and a latch striker configured to be selectively coupled to the latch assembly. The latch assembly may be configured to receive at least a portion of the latch striker.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">When the latch striker is continuously received in the latch assembly, this may be referred to as a coupling state by the coupling device. Then, when the latch striker is separated from the latch assembly, this may be referred to as a coupling-release state by the coupling device.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Accordingly, a distance between the latch assembly and the latch striker may vary. This distance may correspond to a movement distance of the operating member from an introduced state to a removed state.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The latch assembly may be located at the operating member or the support member, and the latch striker may be located at the support member or the operating member so as to face the latch assembly.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Meanwhile, coupling by the coupling device may be released by force applied to the operating member as well as force applied to the door. For example, when force is applied to the closed door to further move the door in a door closing direction, the moved door may apply pressure to the operating member.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">As such, when the user rotates the door to open the door, the operating member may not be removed from the chamber. Conversely, the user may open the door after rotating the door in a door closing direction. Here, when the closed door is rotated in a door closing direction, coupling by the coupling device is released. Thereafter, when the door is opened, the operating member may be automatically removed.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In this way, the user may selectively utilize automatic removal or semi-automatic removal of the operating member. Of course, the user may select whether to remove or introduce the operating member by selecting any one door operating manner.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">To operate the operating member via the door, the operating member may come into contact with an inner surface of the door in a closed state of the door. In addition, in such a contact state, the operating member may remain coupled to the support member by the coupling device.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The coupling between the operating member and the support member by the coupling device may be released as the operating member is further moved in a coupling direction of the coupling device.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The spring device may be arranged at one side or both sides of the rack assembly. For example, the spring device may be located at one side or both sides of the rack assembly rather than being located at the center of the rack assembly. This is because the center of the rack assembly is a location where the cooking object is seated and has a risk of contamination of the spring device by the cooking object. In addition, providing the spring device at the center of the rack assembly may cause a complicated configuration of the center of the rack assembly. In this case, transfer of high temperature atmosphere to the cooking object may be difficult. Of course, this is because the spring device may interfere with the cooking object in the course of placing or removing the cooking object on or from the rack assembly.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The coupling device may be arranged at one side or both sides of the rack assembly. Similarly, the coupling device may be located at one side or both sides of the rack assembly rather than being located at the center of the rack assembly.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The spring device may be arranged at one side of the rack assembly, and the coupling device may be arranged at the same side as the spring device. That is, providing the spring device and the coupling device at the same location may enhance reliability.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The elastic member may include a leaf-spring configured to be elastically deformed such that the number of windings thereof around the first fixing piece or the second fixing piece is reduced as a distance between the first fixing piece and the second fixing piece increases. That is, the elastic member is greatly elastically deformed as the number of windings thereof decreases. This means that potential elastic restoration force of the elastic member increases.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">One end of the elastic member is fixedly wound around one of the first fixing piece and the second fixing piece, and the other end of the elastic member is secured<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> to the other one of the first fixing piece and the second fixing piece. For example, one end of the elastic member may be fixedly wound around the second fixing piece and the other end of the elastic member may be secured to the first fixing piece. As such, when the first fixing piece is moved away from the second fixing piece, the number of windings of the elastic member decreases as a distance between the first fixing piece and the second fixing piece increases. That is, greater elastic deformation occurs as the distance between the first fixing piece and the second fixing piece increases, which results in greater potential elastic restoration force.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Thereafter, once force to cause elastic deformation disappears, the elastic member is elastically restored such that the number of windings thereof increases. In this case, the first fixing piece is moved toward the second fixing piece.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Accordingly, the operating member may be wholly received in the chamber when the elastic member is elastically deformed, and the operating member may be partially removed from the chamber when the elastic member is elastically restored.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Meanwhile, to introduce the operating member, it is necessary to directly or indirectly apply force to the operating member. However, the operating member may be rapidly removed by elastic restoration of the elastic member. Accordingly, the oven may further include a damper configured to come into contact with the operating member to prevent rapid removal of the operating member.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The damper may generally generate repulsive force in proportion to a movement speed of the operating member rather than a distance between the operating member and the door. Accordingly, the damper may prevent rapid removal of the operating member.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The door may be a pull-down type door to allow a user to grip a door handle and open the door downward. Accordingly, the user may easily view the operating member, which is horizontally arranged within the chamber so as to be introduced into and removed from the chamber, when opening or closing the door.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The oven may further include a shock-absorbing member configured to come into contact with the inner surface of the door when the door is closed in a removed state of the operating member, the shock-absorbing member converting closing force of the door into force to introduce the operating member into the chamber. The shock-absorbing member may be located at a contact region between the door and the operating member. That is, one or all of the door and the operating member may be provided with the shock-absorbing member.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The shock-absorbing member may include a roller configured to be rotated about a rotating shaft parallel to a rotating shaft of the door.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the operating member from scratching or sliding on the inner surface of the door upon opening or closing of the door. That is, the operating member may perform rolling on the inner surface of the door. In other words, rolling contact between the door and the operating member rather than sliding contact may be performed, which may achieve various effects, such as reduction of friction, smooth operation, reduction of damage to the door or the operating member, and the like.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Meanwhile, it is necessary to limit a removal distance of the operating member. This is because an excessive removal distance may cause the operating member to be insufficiently supported by the support member. Therefore, a stopper may be provided to achieve an appropriate removal distance. The stopper may be located between the operating member and the support member to selectively come into contact with one of the operating member and the support member. That is, further removal of the operating member does not occur once the operating member comes into contact with the stopper.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The support member may include support member brackets fixed at both sides of the chamber, a support member rail installed to an inner surface of each of the support member brackets, and a support member frame connecting both the support member brackets to each other.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">The operating member may include operating member brackets fixed at both sides of the chamber, an operating member rail installed to an outer surface of each of the operating member brackets, the operating member rail being connected to the support member rail, and an operating member frame connecting both the operating member brackets to each other.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Here, the inner surface of the bracket may be a surface facing the center of the chamber and the outer surface of the bracket may be a face facing a sidewall of the chamber.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The support member rail and the operating member rail are located between the support member bracket and the operating member bracket. The operating member bracket may move relative to the support member bracket as the operating member rail slides relative to the support member rail.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">The support member bracket and the operating member bracket may be shaped to surround at least a portion of each of the support member rail and the operating<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> member rail.

Accordingly, there is no interference between the operating member frame and the support member frame.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The operating member may be removed by sliding relative to the support member as the operating member rail moves relative to the support member rail upon elastic restoration of the elastic member.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, an oven includes a cabinet having a chamber configured to receive a cooking object therein, a door configured to open or close the cabinet, a rack assembly including an operating member configured to support the cooking object seated thereon and to be removable outward from the interior of the chamber, and a support member fixed inside the chamber to support the operating member disposed thereon, and a spring device configured to remove the operating member from the chamber by being elastically restored as the door is opened, and to introduce the operating member into the chamber by being elastically deformed as the door is closed.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">The support member may include a support member frame extending from one side to the other side of the chamber, and the operating member may include an operating member frame extending from one side to the other side of the chamber to support the cooking object seated thereon, the operating member frame being upwardly spaced apart from the support member frame by a prescribed distance.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">The support member may include support member brackets fixed at both sides of the chamber and a support member rail installed to an inner surface of each of the support member brackets, and the operating member may include operating member brackets fixed at both sides of the chamber and an operating member rail installed to an outer surface of each of the operating member brackets, the operating member rail being connected to the support member rail.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Each of the support member frame and the operating member frame may include a plurality of transversal frames extending in a left-and-right direction and a plurality of longitudinal frames extending in a front-and-rear direction.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">The spring device may be located in a vertical gap between the bottom of the operating member bracket and a corresponding one of the transversal frames of the support member frame.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0072" num="0072">The spring device may include a first fixing piece located at the bottom of the operating member bracket, a second fixing piece located at the corresponding transversal frame of the support member frame, and an elastic member having one side connected to the first fixing piece and the other side connected to the second fixing piece, the elastic member being elastically restored by a distance between the first fixing piece and the second fixing piece to remove the operating member from the chamber.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">The elastic member may extend from the first fixing piece to the second fixing piece along a lower surface of the operating member bracket.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">The first fixing piece may protrude downward of the operating member bracket by a prescribed distance so as to be caught by the second fixing piece, thereby serving to limit a removal distance of the operating member.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">One of the operating member brackets provided with the first fixing piece may have a rearwardly protruding extension differently from the other operating member bracket to achieve a distance between the first fixing piece and the second fixing piece, and the first fixing piece may be located at the extension. The extension may provide a sufficient magnitude of elastic restoration force and may also provide continuous and uniform elastic restoration force within an elastic restoration distance range.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">The transversal frames of the support member frame and the operating member frame may be respectively connected to the support member brackets and the operating member brackets. The respective transversal frames may be connected to the longitudinal frames.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">The number of the longitudinal frames of the operating member frame may be greater than the number of the longitudinal frames of the support member frame.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Basically, the transversal frames function to connect both the brackets to each other. Thus, the number of the transversal frames may be determined to simply provide structural stability, and may be within a range of two to four.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">However, the number of the longitudinal frames of the operating member frame may be greater than the number of the other frames. This is because it is necessary to place various shapes of cooking appliances on the operating member frame. The transversal frames and the longitudinal frames of the operating member frame are connected to each other to construct a mesh structure. Thus, increase in the number of the longitudinal frames may provide a dense mesh structure. However, an excessively dense mesh structure may block passage of hot air directed from the bottom of the chamber. Hence, the number of the longitudinal frames must be appropriately selected.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0080" num="0080">The longitudinal frames of the operating member frame may have a greater front-and-rear length than a front-and-rear length of the longitudinal frames of the support member frame.

FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic view for brief description of the technical idea related to one embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">The oven, designated by reference numeral 100, according to the present embodiment may include a cabinet 200, a chamber 250, a door 300 and a rack 400, in the same manner as the conventional ovens shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">FIGs. 1 to 3</figref>. However, note that the present embodiment may eliminate removal or introduction of the rack 400 caused when a user continuously applies force to the rack 400. For example, the present embodiment may allow the rack 400 to be removed as the user grips a door handle 310 and opens the door 300. In addition, the present embodiment may allow the rack 400 to be introduced as the user grips the door handle 310 and closes the door 300.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">Accordingly, the present embodiment may minimize the time and frequency of the user gripping the rack 400 heated to a high temperature and, similarly, may minimize the time and frequency of the user putting their hand into the chamber 250 heated to a high temperature.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">More specifically, the door 300 is opened as the user grips the door handle 310 and pivotally rotates the door 300 downward. In this case, the door 300 is rotated about a door rotating shaft 320 that is installed to a lower end of the door 300 corresponding to a lower portion of the cabinet 200. For example, as exemplarily shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>, the door 300 may be opened by being rotated counterclockwise about the door rotating shaft 320.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">As the door 300 is opened, a distance between the door 300 and a chamber opening 260 gradually increases. This may be understood as the door 300 blocked the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> chamber opening 260 being removed and thus an obstacle in front of the rack 400 being removed. Of course, this may also be understood as a position of the obstacle gradually becoming distant from the chamber opening 260.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">Through removal or farther movement of the door 300, i.e. the obstacle, the rack 400 may protrude out of the chamber opening 260.

Force required to remove the rack 400 may be elastic restoration force as will be described below.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">Conversely, when the door 300 is closed, the door 300 interferes with the removed rack 400. In this case, the closed door 300 comes into contact with the rack 400, thereby introducing the rack 400.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">In this way, opening and closing of the door 300 may create a space for removal of the rack 400 and provide force required to introduce the rack 400.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">Hereinafter, one embodiment of the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005">FIGs. 5 to 7</figref>.</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">As described above, the oven according to one embodiment of the present invention has a feature related to the rack that may be easily removed and introduced.

Accordingly, the stopper 950 may be provided separately from the spring device 700.<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --></p><p id="p0168" num="0168">The stopper 950 may be located between the operating member 500 and the support member 600 to selectively come into contact with the operating member 500 or the support member 600.</p><p id="p0169" num="0169">The operating member 500 may be provided with a first protrusion 951. The first protrusion 951 may be formed so as not to interfere with the support member 600 during sliding of the operating member 500. In addition, the support member 600 may be provided with a second protrusion 952. The second protrusion 952 may be formed so as not to come into contact with the other portion of the operating member 500 during sliding of the operating member 500. As the first protrusion 951 is moved during sliding of the operating member 500, the first protrusion 951 and the second protrusion 952 may come into contact with each other in the maximally removed state of the operating member 500. That is, the first protrusion 951 may be caught by the second protrusion 952 so as not to be further moved.</p><p id="p0170" num="0170">The first protrusion 951 may be formed at the operating member bracket 510, and the second protrusion 952 may be formed at the support member frame 610 of the support member 600. In particular, the second protrusion 952 may be formed at one of the transversal frames 631.</p><p id="p0171" num="0171">At the maximum removal distance of the operating member 500, the second protrusion 952 of the support member 600 interferes with the first protrusion 951, thereby preventing further movement of the first protrusion 951.</p><p id="p0172" num="0172">As described above, a vertical gap is defined between the support member 600 and the operating member 500. Thus, the first protrusion 951 and/or the second protrusion 952 may protrude toward each other for reduction in the vertical gap.</p><p id="p0173" num="0173"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> shows the first protrusion 951 as being formed at the operating member bracket 510. In particular, the first protrusion 951 is shown as being formed at an inner surface of the operating member bracket 510. Thus, the operating member bracket 510 may be moved until the first protrusion 951 collides with the second protrusion 952 formed at the support member 600. Here, the first protrusion 951 may be formed at the lower surface of the operating member bracket 510. However, the reason why the first protrusion 951 is formed at the inner surface of the operating member bracket 510 is that the above-described spring device 700 is formed at the lower surface of the operating member bracket 510. Of course, the first protrusion 951 may be formed at each of the operating member brackets 510, or may be formed at only one of the operating member brackets 510.<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --></p><p id="p0174" num="0174">However, preferably, the stopper 950 and the spring device 700 as described above are formed only at one of the operating member brackets 510. This is because providing all additive components of basic components, i.e. the support member 600 and the operating member 500 at only one operating member bracket 510 may facilitate easy manufacture and installation. That is, these additive components may be easily added to the basic components.</p><p id="p0175" num="0175">In one embodiment of the present invention, a damper 960 may be provided.</p><p id="p0176" num="0176">The damper 960 may be configured to come into contact with the operating member 500 and serve to prevent the operating member 500 from being rapidly removed by elastic restoration force of the spring device 700. That is, a greater removal speed of the operating member 500 may cause greater repulsive force applied to the operating member 500 by the damper 960. Based on this principle, the damper 960 may ensure removal of the operating member 500 at an appropriate speed.</p><p id="p0177" num="0177">Specifically, the damper 960 may include a spur gear 961. A rotating shaft 962 of the spur gear 961 may be arranged perpendicular to a movement direction of the operating member 500. In addition, a rack gear 963 to be engaged with the spur gear 961 may be provided. The rack gear 963 may be installed to the operating member 500. In particular, the rack gear 963 may be installed to the operating member bracket 510.</p><p id="p0178" num="0178">More specifically, the rack gear 963 may be located at the lower surface of the operating member bracket 510. That is, the rack gear 963 may be located at a front end of the lower surface of the operating member bracket 510. In this case, the above-described spring device 700 may be located at a rear end of the lower surface of the operating member bracket 510. This arrangement may prevent interference between the damper 960 and the spring device 700. In addition, the spur gear 961 may be filled with oil, thereby generating damping force upon rotation thereof. In addition, the spur gear 961 may be secured to the support member bracket 610.</p><p id="p0179" num="0179">In one embodiment of the present invention, at least one of the coupling device 800, the shock-absorbing member 900, the stopper 950 and the damper 960 as described above may be included.</p><p id="p0180" num="0180">Meanwhile, in the above-described embodiment, the spring device 700 may be located at one side of the rack assembly 400.
