In the air spring of Patent Document 1, an upper plate (1), a lower plate (2), and a tubular flexible membrane (3) correspond to the upper support, lower support, and diaphragm, respectively.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In railroad cars of the recent years, use of trucks configured without bolsters, i.e., bolsterless trucks, has become the mainstream, and air springs, namely diaphragms, are frequently subjected to torsional stress. A lower bead of the diaphragm, which is a part supported by the lower support, is smaller in diameter than an upper bead that is supported by the upper support, and therefore the lower bead is mainly strained<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> by the torsional stress resulting from the twist in the diaphragm.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Accordingly, the lower bead receiver, which is a part of the lower support fitted with the lower bead, and the lower bead would shift from each other due to frequent application of torsional stress, which could shorten diaphragm lifetime because of the tendencies to wear and to leak the air. The lower bead could even be detached from the lower bead receiver if large torsional stress was applied.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">There was another design, as disclosed in Patent Document 2, provided with lateral shift means (Y1) that support an annular interposed part (17) corresponding to the lower bead receiver that supports the lower bead (11) fitted thereto, such as to be slidable in horizontal direction relative to a second member (2S). By adopting this configuration, the torsional stress could be dispersed by the deformation of the diaphragm (3) and the movements of the lateral shift means (Y1) to minimize shifting movements of the lower bead and lower bead receiver.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</b></heading><heading id="h0004"><b>PATENT DOCUMENTS</b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP5196082A"><text>Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 5-196082</text></patcit><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></li><li>Patent Document 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2002187548A"><text>Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2002-187548</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><heading id="h0006"><b>PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">While the lateral shift means of Patent Document 2 have exhibited the effect of reducing shifting movements of the lower bead and lower bead receiver to some extent, it has been pointed out that there still is some scope of improvement.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">That is, the lateral shift means for allowing the annular interposed part (17) to slide radially within a range have a complex structure, which evidently caused an increase in the number of components and raised the cost, as well as required regular maintenance of sliding parts.

The stress resulting from the torsional deformation of the diaphragm is therefore dispersed by the elasticity of the diaphragm and of the lower bead receiver, so that the stress between the lower bead and the bead receiver body is reduced as compared to that in a conventional counterpart, and the shifting movements of the lower bead and lower bead receiver can be minimized, without the risk of reducing the operating life.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">This is all achieved only by the lower bead receiver having the bead receiver body and the elastic layer, and therefore there is hardly any increase in the number of components, or in the complexity of the structure, so that it is favorable for mass-production.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Accordingly, an air spring that can clearly reduce or prevent shifting movements of a lower bead and a lower bead receiver to function favorably, even when large torsional stress is applied to the diaphragm of a railroad car or the like that uses bolsterless trucks, is provided.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">It is advantageous if, as in the invention set forth in claim 2, the bead receiver body of the lower bead receiver is<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> formed as an annular member having a substantially L-shaped cross section, with a vertically oriented peripheral side wall internally contacting the lower bead, and a horizontally oriented peripheral bottom wall on which the lower bead is placed, since the lower bead can then be firmly retained both on the underside and on the radially inner side.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">It is advantageous if, as in the invention set forth in claim 3, the elastic layer is formed as an annular member having an L-shaped cross section, with a vertical ring part internally contacting the peripheral side wall, and a horizontal ring part contacting a lower surface of the peripheral bottom wall, since the bead receiver body can then be firmly retained both on the underside and on the radially inner side.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to the invention set forth in claim 4, the lower support is configured to include an annular structure having an L-shaped cross section, with a vertical tubular part internally contacting the vertical ring part, and a circular disc part contacting a lower surface of the horizontal ring part. As compared to the lower support having an annular structure with an L-shaped cross section integrally formed with the lower support, the annular structure can be produced easily and the lower support is prevented from having a more complex shape. Dividing the part in two separate components is therefore advantageous in this regard, since the air spring can<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> be provided in a more readily producible design.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">An air spring excellent in function and producibility can be realized if the elastic layer is made of rubber, as in the invention set forth in claim 5, and an air spring suitable for railroad cars can be provided, as in the invention set forth in claim 6.</p><heading id="h0009"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0023" num="0023"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating the structure of an air spring in Embodiment 1;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view illustrating a lower bead receiver;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is an operation diagram illustrating an example of a condition in which the air spring of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is twisted;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view illustrating essential parts in the structure of a lower bead;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> is a graph showing the relationship between the stress and the displacement in a portion from the bead core to 3P;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> is a graph showing the relationship between the stress and the displacement in a portion from 3P to 4P;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> is a graph showing the relationship between the torsional angle and the displacement of the lower bead;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> structure of an air spring in Embodiment 2; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a conventional air spring.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010"><b>EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0024" num="0024">Hereinafter, embodiments of an air spring according to the present invention as those for railroad cars will be described as one example with reference to the drawings.

Therefore, the diaphragm 3 is desired to have the flexibility and durability<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> to withstand frequent torsional displacements, and the upper and lower beads 3a and 3b, and in particular the engaging parts of the lower bead 3b that has a smaller diameter and thus is subjected to larger stress, and the lower support 2, are desired to be hardly disengageable and highly friction resistant.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> shows an example of how much the diaphragm 3 may be twisted such as when the car runs in a curve.
