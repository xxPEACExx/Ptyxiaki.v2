compounds is generated in the inner portion of the crude oil tank.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the related art, the VOC gas generated inside the crude oil tank is discharged to the atmosphere via a vent. However, since the VOC gas causes air pollution due to suspended particulate matter, photochemical oxidants, or the like, in recent years, a technology which detoxifies the VOC gas without discharging the VOC to the atmosphere is suggested (for example, refer to PTL 1).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">PTL 1 discloses a technology, in which VOC gas<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> containing inert gas inside the crude oil tank is supplied to a burner included in a boiler, and the VOC gas is combusted along with a main fuel such as hydrocarbon gas which does not contain VOC gas.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">[PTL 1] International Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2011092450A"><text>WO2011/092450</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is known that volume concentration of VOC gas contained in inert gas inside a crude oil tank varies over a wide range from 100 ppm or less to 50% according to storage conditions of crude oil. When the concentration of the VOC gas is lower than a predetermined concentration (for example, 10 to 20%), since a heating value of the VOC gas is lower, it is not possible to maintain combustion of the burner using only the VOC gas. As described in PTL 1, when the VOC gas of low concentration is combusted along with a sufficient amount of a main fuel, since the combustion is maintained by the main fuel, it is possible to combust and detoxify the VOC gas.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, in order to reliably combust the VOC gas of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> low concentration, it is necessary to supply a sufficient amount of main fuel to the burner to maintain the combustion. For example, when a steam output needed in the boiler is small or zero, that is, when a demand for steam is low, the main fuel supplied to the burner may be not necessary or may be a minute amount in order to satisfy the demand. However, in order to reliably combust the VOC gas of low concentration, it is necessary to supply a sufficient amount of main fuel to the burner, and thus, a fuel consumption increases.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention is made in consideration of the above-described circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide a marine boiler capable of reliably performing oxidation treatment on volatile gas containing volatile organic compounds of low concentration while decreasing consumption of a main fuel, and a method for operating the marine boiler.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">In order to achieve the above-described object, a marine boiler of the present invention adopts the following means.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to the present invention, there is provided a marine boiler including a furnace, a burner<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> which combusts a fuel for combustion and a combustion air in the furnace, a volatile gas supply portion which supplies volatile gas containing volatile organic compounds generated in a crude oil tank to the furnace, a discharging portion which discharges combustion gas generated due to combustion by the burner, and a control portion which adjusts an amount of the fuel for combustion applied to the burner and an amount of the combustion air supplied to the burner, and controls an operation to be within a predetermined load range, in which the control portion includes a limited operation mode in which an operation is performed within a limited load range which is limited further than the predetermined load range so that the volatile gas, which flows from the volatile gas supply portion into the furnace and is introduced into the discharging portion, is maintained at a predetermined temperature or more, and stays in the furnace for a predetermined time or more.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the marine boiler of the present invention, the volatile gas containing the volatile organic compounds generated in the crude oil tank is supplied into the furnace which is heated by the combustion of the burner.

Accordingly, the marine boiler 1 of the present embodiment can operate a VOC processing mode (limited operation mode) for performing oxidation treatment on VOC gas of low concentration. In the VOC processing mode, the control device 50 adjusts an amount of a main fuel of the boiler supplied to the burner 3 so that the VOC gas, which flows from the VOC gas supply portion 60 into the furnace 2 and is introduced into a flue gas outlet 8, is maintained at a predetermined temperature or more (for example, approximately 800°C or more), and stays in the furnace 2 of the marine boiler 1 for a predetermined time or more (for example, approximately 0.5 seconds or more), and operates the marine boiler 1 at a limited load range (for example,<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> approximately 20% to 50%).</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In addition, in the present embodiment, combustion performed by the burner 3 is an oxidation phenomenon with a high-speed exothermal reaction.

The reason why the residence time in the furnace indicates the time until the VOC gas reaches to the inlet of the heat exchange group including the front bank tube 4, the superheater 5, and the evaporator pipe group 6 from the burner 3 is because the heat is removed by the heat exchange group in the region in which the heat exchanger bundle is present, and the oxidation treatment of the VOC gas is not likely to be promoted.<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> The oxidation treatment performed in the VOC processing mode of the present embodiment is performed within a region from the inlet of the furnace 2 to the outlet thereof.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In Step S301, the control device 50 determines a target value of the load of the boiler in the marine boiler 1.

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, the residence time in the furnace is decreases as the load of the boiler increases, and the residence time the furnace is increases as the load of the boiler decreases. This is because the flow rates of the main fuel of the boiler and the combustion air increase as the load of the boiler increases, and as a result, the flow velocities of the combustion gas and the VOC gas passing through the furnace 2 of the marine boiler 1 increase.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In addition, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, the outlet<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> temperature of the furnace is increases as the load of the boiler increases, and the outlet temperature of the furnace is decreases as the load of the boiler decreases.

For example, when the target value determined in Step S301 is 70%, since the limited load range is not within the range of 20% or more and 50% or less, the control device 50 determines NO in Step S303. For example, when the target value determined in Step S301 is 30%, since the limited load range is within the range of 20% or more and 50% or less, the control device 50 determines YES in Step S303.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">In Step 304 (first operation step), since the VOC processing mode is not set (NO in Step S302) or the target value is within the limited load range (YES in Step S303), the control device 50 operates the marine boiler 1 at the target value determined in Step S301.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Meanwhile, in Step S305 (second operation step), since the VOC processing mode is set (YES in Step S302) and the target value is out of the limited load range (NO<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> in Step S303), the control device 50 operates the marine boiler 1 within the limited load range.
