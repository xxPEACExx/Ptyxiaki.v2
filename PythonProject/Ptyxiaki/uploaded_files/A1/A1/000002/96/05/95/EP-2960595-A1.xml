Heating up can be caused by means of one or more heating systems. To that extent, a medium circuit can be provided, a pump arranged in the circuit causing circulation of the medium in the circuit.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Basic aspects of such heating systems are that, like all other components of the medium circuit, the system is to take up only a small amount of space and is to be inexpensive to produce. Furthermore, the heating system shall be simple to assemble. Reliable safeguarding of the heating system must be guaranteed upon the occurrence of a critical operating condition which can result in plastic<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> components within the domestic appliance melting or catching fire. In case of some domestic appliances, it may further be necessary to prevent the medium to be heated from exceeding a predetermined temperature. For example in the case of a dishwashing machine, it may be necessary to prevent the washing water from exceeding its boiling temperature.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20060236999A1"><text>US patent application 2006/0236999 A1</text></patcit> discloses a heating system for heating fluid media, in particular for domestic appliances, including a carrier unit, a heating unit arranged on the carrier unit and a heat transfer element which is arranged on the carrier unit and comprising a material which is a good conductor of heat. On the heat transfer element, temperature safety devices are mounted by fixing elements via corresponding through apertures.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">When using conventional temperature monitoring and/or control elements (such as, e.g., thermal fuses) with continuous-flow water heaters, there is a problem when the temperature monitoring and/or control elements are fixed with, e.g., one or more screws, to a mounting plate. That is, when the mounting plate is soldered to the heating unit, it may curve. Further, when fastening respective fixing screws on a temperature monitoring and/or control element, the temperature monitoring and/or control element may be lifted from the fixing plate and remain in the air above the hot location. As a consequence, the largest amount of heat in the center of the heating unit cannot be released directly to the temperature monitoring and/or control element, but has to be released via, e.g., the mounting plate, screws, and/or the base plate flange. These effects result in an unacceptable (i.e., too slow) response time of the temperature monitoring and/or control element.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a heating system component, a heating system, and a method for producing a heating system component, which avoid the slow response times of prior-art arrangements.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a heating system component comprising: a temperature monitoring and/or control unit comprising a lower surface; a carrier unit comprising an upper surface; wherein at least a part of said lower surface of said temperature monitoring and/or control unit is in thermal contact with at least a part of said upper surface of said carrier unit; wherein said lower surface of said temperature monitoring and/or control unit and said upper surface of said carrier unit are attached to each other by means of a welded seam, preferably by means of a laser-welded seam.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention proposes to fix the temperature monitoring and/or control element onto the heating unit, preferably in the direct vicinity of the hottest spot thereof, by means of a welded seam. Preferably, the fixing is carried out by welding, in particular by laser welding. In general, employing laser welding for attaching temperature monitoring and/or control elements in heating systems involves the advantage of higher functionality and security as compared to prior art mounting approaches using, e.g., curved spring washers. In particular, fixing the temperature monitoring and/or control element onto the heating unit by welding significantly improves (i.e., reduces) the temperature monitoring and/or control element's response time.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to a preferred embodiment, said temperature monitoring and/or control unit comprises a lower part having a beveled edge; wherein said beveled edge is adjacent to said lower surface; wherein said beveled edge comprises a bevel angle of less than 90°; wherein said welded seam is located essentially along said beveled edge. By employing a beveled edge having a bevel angle of less than 90°, it is easier to reach the contact area between the temperature monitoring and/or control unit's lower surface and the carrier unit's upper surface with a laser beam. As a consequence, less laser power is needed, while still achieving the desired strength of attachment between the temperature monitoring and/or control unit's lower surface and the carrier unit's upper surface.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">During the use of a heating system, it is possible that scale or calcium is deposited on the side of the carrier unit being in contact with the fluid medium to be heated, like water, in particular in the area of the carrier unit when the heating unit is arranged on the other side of the carrier unit. Due to this calcium deposit, the transfer of the heat generated by the heating unit, can be impaired. Thus, the temperature monitoring and/or control element can detect a temperature being higher than a temperature without such a calcium deposit. In some cases, the temperature monitoring and/or control element can then cut-off the electricity supply to the heating unit although the medium is still present, i.e. the temperature monitoring and/or control unit detects a safety relevant situation, like a dry run. In order to avoid this, it could be of advantage to provide a connection to the thermal monitoring and/or control element such that the connection is in contact with an area of carrier unit being spaced to the heating unit. Through this, the temperature monitoring and/or control unit can be cooled by the medium so that the temperature detection is not impaired by the calcium deposit on the carrier unit in the area of the heating unit. This connection can also be laser-welded to the carrier unit wherein the connection can also be provided with a beveled edge. The dimensions of that connection can be chosen in accordance with the need to cool the temperature monitoring and/or control unit.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Moreover, it is also possible to attach the temperature monitoring and/or control unit directly on the top surface of the heating unit.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to a further preferred embodiment, said bevel angle ranges between 5° and 55°, preferably between 15° and 45°, and even more preferably between 25° and 35°. By choosing a bevel angle as described, reaching the contact area between the temperature monitoring and/or control unit's lower surface and the carrier unit's upper surface with a laser beam is made even easier and thus improved. Further, by increasing the respective melting zone, a complete material connection can be achieved. Providing a beveled edge of a certain length in addition compensates for a potential mispositioning during automatic production. When aiming for a laser entrance angle on the material surface of 90°, a bevel angle of preferably 30° may be chosen so that the laser beam can be directed at an angle of 120° with respect to the carrier unit's upper surface. The laser beam<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> can thus be prevented from getting too close to the sensitive parts of the temperature monitoring and/or control unit.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to a further preferred embodiment, said temperature monitoring and/or control unit is configured to measure a temperature, to compare said temperature to a predefined temperature limit, and to output a control signal based on said comparison.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to a further preferred embodiment, said control signal comprises information on a desired switching state of a heating unit.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to a further preferred embodiment, said lower surface of said temperature monitoring and/or control unit comprises at least one first protrusion and/or recess. Said upper surface of said carrier unit comprises at least one second recess and/or protrusion. Said first protrusion and/or recess corresponds to said second recess and/or protrusion. By designing the temperature monitoring and/or control unit's lower surface and the carrier unit's upper surface in the described manner, the total contact area can be increased, thus providing for an improved heat transport between carrier unit and temperature monitoring and/or control unit. The design further enables an easier manufacture given the preferred matching of protrusions and recesses.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to a further preferred embodiment, said lower surface of said temperature monitoring and/or control unit comprises AlMg<sub>3</sub>. However, any other weldable aluminum alloys or aluminum-steel compond material can be used.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to a further preferred embodiment, said upper surface of said carrier unit comprises AlMg<sub>3</sub>. However, aluminum alloys Al<sub>99,5</sub> and AlMg<sub>1</sub> are suitable as well.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to a further preferred embodiment, said temperature monitoring and/or control unit comprises at least one temperature monitoring and/or control element having a lower surface which is smaller than said lower surface of said temperature monitoring and/or control unit. By designing the temperature<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> monitoring and/or control element such that it comprises a lower surface which is smaller than said lower surface of said temperature monitoring and/or control unit, it is possible to have the lower surface of said temperature monitoring and/or control unit extending beyond the lower surface of said temperature monitoring and/or control element. The temperature monitoring and/or control unit's lower surface can thus be reached in an easier manner in order to attach the temperature monitoring and/or control unit to the carrier unit.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a heating system for heating fluid media, in particular for domestic appliances, comprising: a heating system component as described herein, a heating unit arranged on said carrier unit, and wherein said temperature monitoring and/or control unit is configured to measure the temperature of said heating unit.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to a preferred embodiment, the heating system comprises a casing portion, wherein the heating unit is mounted to said casing portion, and wherein the casing portion comprises aluminum. Even more preferably, the entire heating system is composed of aluminum. Whereas conventional heating systems typically provide a recess in a carrier unit, where the heating unit is arranged within the recess, the preferred embodiment described herein advantageously makes it possible to mount (e.g., by soldering) a heating unit directly to a casing portion of the carrier unit. The carrier unit is thus structurally simplified, because a recess is no longer necessary. Further, the inner side of the casing portion is preferably coated with a nonstick coating. The nonstick coating is preferably composed of a ceramics-based material. By employing a ceramics-based nonstick coating, the aluminum surfaces may be rendered dishwasher-safe.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to a preferred embodiment, the heating unit comprises a heat transfer element, wherein said heat transfer element is an elongate flat element. According to a further preferred embodiment, the carrier unit comprises a disc. According to a further preferred embodiment, the carrier unit has a recess which is open at one side and which is preferably at least approximately C-shaped in cross-section for receiving the heating unit. According to a further preferred embodiment, the heating unit is formed by at least one tubular heater. According<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> to a further preferred embodiment, the cross-sectional shape of the heating unit is at least approximately adapted to the cross-sectional shape of the recess of the carrier unit.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for producing a heating system component as described herein.

Typically, protection against overheating is achieved by employing temperature monitoring and/or control elements, such as, e.g., thermostats and/or thermal links. Temperature monitoring and/or control elements tend to be used in applications where a fixed temperature needs to be monitored or controlled and a maximum temperature must not be exceeded. Example applications include, but are not limited to, household appliances such as dishwashers and washing<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> machines, small electrical appliances such as coffeemakers, steam generators etc. or electrically monitored water heaters.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As a temperature sensing element, e.g., a vaulted bimetal disc may be used. The vaulted bimetal disc is preferably placed in direct contact with a mounting plate therefore reacting quickly to temperature. Having reached a predetermined temperature the bimetal disc operates and opens an electrical circuit. Once the temperature has fallen again under the predetermined temperature, the disc returns into its original position thereby closing the circuit again. Additionally and/or alternatively, a solder insert in the mounting plate may be in direct thermal contact with the surface that is to be monitored. When the preset temperature is reached, the solder melts causing a pin to move which results in the electrical contacts opening. For a two-component system combining temperature monitoring and temperature control, the two components temperature monitor and temperature control may have a common mounting plate, which is responsible for thermal conduction. This ensures that the thermal information for thermostat and thermal link always comes from the same source.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Temperature control elements may be used for applications where a maximum temperature must not be exceeded (such as, e.g., for example in coffee makers, irons, dishwashers, dryers) and to protect electric heating elements. A temperature control element typically has a melt solder insert in the mounting plate which is in direct thermal contact with the surface that is to be monitored. When the preset temperature is reached, the solder melts causing a pin to move which results in the electrical contacts opening.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 1</b></figref> shows schematically and exemplarily a conventional heating system as disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20060236999A1"><text>US patent application 2006/0236999 A1</text></patcit>, which is incorporated herein by reference. The heating system of <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 1</b></figref> comprises a carrier unit T, a heating unit H, a heat transfer element W, and safety devices S1, S2 arranged on the heat transfer element W. The first safety device S1 interrupts the power circuit to the heating unit H, based on the temperature of the heating unit H, which is detected by the first safety device S1. First safety device S1 preferably interrupts the power circuit to the heating unit H when the temperature of the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> heating unit H exceeds a first predetermined temperature limit value, for example when the heating unit H runs dry. The first predetermined temperature limit value may be chosen such that melting of plastic parts in the region of the heating system is avoided. The second safety device S2 interrupts the power circuit to the heating unit H based on the temperature of the medium to be heated, which is detected by the second safety device S2. Second safety device S2 preferably interrupts the power circuit to the heating unit H when the temperature of the medium to be heated exceeds a second predetermined temperature limit value which can be defined for example by the boiling temperature of the medium to be heated. Consequently the medium is prevented from boiling. Safety devices S1, S2 may be considered temperature monitoring and/or control elements.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The heating system may be connected to, e.g., a conveyor pump of a dishwashing machine, of which only the housing PG comprising a plastic material with a low melting point is shown in part in <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 1</b></figref><b>.</b> The heating system can be mounted to the conveyor pump or the housing PG thereof during assembly of the domestic appliance or can form a pre-assembled structural unit together with the conveyor pump.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As can be seen from <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 1</b></figref><b>,</b> carrier unit T is a circular disc 10 which may be produced, e.g., from corrosion-resistant steel. In concentric relationship with its central axis (not shown) disc 10 has a circular hole 12, through which the suction pipe of the pump is passed in sealing integrity in relation to the medium. At its outer peripheral edge 14, disc 10 may engage over the edge of the pump housing PG in sealing integrity in relation to the medium. That side of disc 10, which faces in the direction of the lower edge of the sheet in <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 1</b></figref><b>,</b> is in direct contact with the medium to be heated in the installed condition of the pump and can therefore be referred to as the wet side whereas the side of the disc 10, which faces towards the upper edge of the sheet, does not come into contact with the medium and can thus be referred to as the dry side.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As can further be seen from <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 1</b></figref><b>,</b> disc 10 forming carrier unit T has a recess 16 which extends there around in concentric relationship with its central axis at approximately the radial centre of the disc 10. Recess 16 is of a square<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> configuration in cross-section, wherein one side of the square, being the upwardly facing side, is omitted. Heating unit H which is formed by a tubular heater of known kind is fitted in the recess 16. As can be seen from <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 1</b></figref><b>,</b> the shape and the outside dimensions of heating unit H are matched to the shape and the outside dimensions of recess 16 in disc 10 in such a way that heating unit H is in full area contact at three sides against the inside walls (not identified in greater detail) of recess 16. Consequently, heat produced by heating unit H is transferred to the medium which is disposed on the wet side of disc 10 and which is to be heated.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">When using conventional temperature monitoring and/or control elements (such as, e.g., thermal fuses) with continuous-flow water heaters, there is a problem when the temperature monitoring and/or control elements are fixed with, e.g., one or more screws, to a mounting plate, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 1</b></figref> for the prior-art heating system shown therein. That is, when the mounting plate is soldered to the heating unit, it may curve. Further, when fastening respective fixing screws on a temperature monitoring and/or control element, the temperature monitoring and/or control element may be lifted from the fixing plate and remain in the air above the hot location. This effect is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 2</b></figref> and indicated by an arrow. As a consequence, the largest amount of heat in the center of the heating unit cannot be released directly to the temperature monitoring and/or control element, but has to be released via, e.g., the mounting plate, screws, and/or the base plate flange. These effects result in an unacceptable (i.e., too slow) response time of the temperature monitoring and/or control element.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">One idea to address the above-identified issue is to directly fix the temperature monitoring and/or control element onto the heating unit, preferably in the direct vicinity of the hottest spot thereof. The fixing may be carried out by welding, preferably by laser welding. In general, as set out in the following, employing laser welding for attaching temperature monitoring and/or control elements in heating systems involves the advantage of higher functionality and security as compared to prior art mounting approaches using, e.g., curved spring washers. In particular, fixing the temperature monitoring and/or control element onto the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> heating unit by welding significantly improves (i.e., reduces) the temperature monitoring and/or control element's response time.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Several examples for fixing the temperature monitoring and/or control element onto the heating unit by welding are illustrated in the following. <figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Fig. 3</b></figref> shows schematically and exemplarily one option to fix the temperature monitoring and/or control element onto the heating unit by welding. That is, <figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Fig. 3</b></figref> shows a temperature monitoring and/or control element 310. A spot weld 330 on respective mounting portions of monitoring and/or control element 310 is illustrated as well. <figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Fig. 4</b></figref> shows schematically and exemplarily another option to fix the temperature monitoring and/or control element onto the heating unit by welding. That is, <figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Fig. 4</b></figref> shows a top view of a temperature monitoring and/or control elements' base plate comprising weld seams 530.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idrefs="f0003"><b>Fig. 5A</b></figref> shows schematically and exemplarily an embodiment of a temperature monitoring and/or control system 500 comprising temperature monitoring and/or control elements 510a, 510b.

As further shown in the detailed view of area D of the left panel of <figref idrefs="f0003"><b>Fig. 5A</b></figref><b>,</b> Temperature monitoring and/or control elements 510a, 510b are mounted to carrier unit 520 via weld seams 530.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039"><figref idrefs="f0003"><b>Figs. 5B</b></figref><b>and</b><figref idrefs="f0004"><b>5C</b></figref> show schematically and exemplarily further views of temperature monitoring and/or control system 500. The heating system of <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">Figs. <b>5A to 5C</b></figref> comprises a carrier unit 520, a heating unit 500-H, a heat transfer element 500-W, and temperature monitoring and/or control units 510a, 510b, which may preferably be safety devices. Temperature monitoring and/or control units 510a, 510b are arranged on heat transfer element 500-W. A first temperature monitoring and/or control unit 510a interrupts the power circuit to the heating unit 500-H, based on the temperature of the heating unit 500-H, which is detected by the first temperature monitoring and/or control unit 510a. First temperature monitoring and/or control unit 510a preferably interrupts the power circuit to heating unit 500-H when the temperature of heating unit 500-H exceeds a first predetermined temperature limit value, for example when heating unit 500-H runs dry. The first predetermined temperature limit value may be chosen such<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> that melting of plastic parts in the region of the heating system is avoided. A second temperature monitoring and/or control unit 510b interrupts the power circuit to heating unit 500-H based on the temperature of the medium to be heated, which is detected by second temperature monitoring and/or control unit 510b. Second temperature monitoring and/or control unit 510b preferably interrupts the power circuit to heating unit 500-H when the temperature of the medium to be heated exceeds a second predetermined temperature limit value which can be defined for example by the boiling temperature of the medium to be heated. Consequently the medium is prevented from boiling.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The heating system may be connected to, e.g., a conveyor pump of a dishwashing machine in a similar manner as the heating system shown in <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 1</b></figref><b>.</b> The heating system can be mounted to the conveyor pump or to a housing thereof during assembly of the domestic appliance or can form a pre-assembled structural unit together with the conveyor pump.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">As can be seen from <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004"><b>Figs. 5A to 5C</b></figref><b>,</b> carrier unit 520 is a circular disc 500-10 which may be produced, e.g., from corrosion-resistant steel. However, in other embodiments of carrier unit 520, circular disc 500-10 may be produced, e.g., from AlMg<sub>3</sub>, AlMg<sub>1</sub>, or Al<sub>99,5</sub>. In concentric relationship with its central axis (not shown) disc 500-10 has a circular hole 500-12, through which the suction pipe of the pump is passed in sealing integrity in relation to the medium.

Consequently, heat produced by heating unit 500-H is transferred to the medium which is disposed on the wet side of disc 500-10 and which is to be heated.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">As can further be seen from <figref idrefs="f0003"><b>Figs. 5B</b></figref> <b>and</b> <figref idrefs="f0004"><b>5C</b></figref><b>,</b> a laser beam 540 may be employed to attach temperature monitoring and/or control units 510a, 510b to carrier unit 520. In particular, respective lower parts of temperature monitoring and/or control units 510a, 510b may comprise beveled edges 550a, 550b. By employing a beveled edge 550a or 550b, laser beam 540 can be directed such that it is prevented from getting too close to sensitive parts of temperature monitoring and/or control units 510a, 510b. A welded seam 530a, 530b is established along beveled edges 550a, 550b. Further details are explained herein below.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044"><figref idrefs="f0004"><b>Fig. 6</b></figref> shows schematically and exemplarily another embodiment of a temperature monitoring and/or control system comprising temperature monitoring and/or control elements 510a, 510b mounted on a tube filed with a fluid to be heated, such as, e.g., a water pipe. Temperature monitoring and/or control elements 510a, 510b are fixed to the tube by means of laser weld seams 530.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In order to illustrate the effect of welding the temperature monitoring and/or control elements to the carrier unit, several test measurements have been carried out. In a first test experiment, a temperature monitoring and/or control element was fixed to a continuous-flow water heater by (a) pressing and (b) laser-welding. The test yielded a response time of the laser-welded temperature monitoring and/or control element which was two to four seconds shorter than the corresponding response time of the pressed temperature monitoring and/or control element. In addition, for case (b) overshoot was reduced by approximately 20°C.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In a further test experiment, there occurred a problem that, when fixing the temperature monitoring and/or control element to the base plate of a continuous-flow water heater, a high laser power of up to 2 kW (or even more) was necessary due to a disadvantageous laser entry angle. This yields an unsatisfactory welding result. One solution to improve the laser entrance into the base plate material (which may be preferably AlMg<sub>3</sub>) is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005"><b>Figs. 7 and 8</b></figref> and relates to employing a bevel 910 (i.e., a beveled edge connecting the two adjacent surfaces) of preferably 25° to 35° at wing ends 920 of temperature monitoring and/or control element 930. Bevel 910 is preferably punched or stamped into wing ends 920. Punching or stamping is preferably carried out by means of a punch cutter or stamping tool, respectively.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Employing bevel 910 makes it easier for laser beam 540 to enter the material at a preferred angle of 90°. As a consequence of laser beam 540 entering at a more preferred angle, the welds turn solid and the melt enters the carrier plate 940 and wing ends 920 preferably in a cone-shaped manner. The conical entering of melt 1110 in the direction of the laser beam is shown in <figref idrefs="f0006"><b>Fig. 9</b></figref><b>.</b> In the test experiment described, a laser power of 1 kW was sufficient when using a 45°-bevel. As explained herein above, a bevel of 25° to 35° degrees is even more preferred. By applying a bevel to the wing ends of the temperature monitoring and/or control element, the laser power necessary to satisfactorily mount the temperature monitoring and/or control element can thus be reduced.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">An optimal thermal coupling of temperature monitoring and/or control element to the heating system results in an improved heat transfer and shorter response time. Consequently, strong heating powers can be controlled in a secure manner and positive effects on scaling of the tubes are observed. By welding the temperature monitoring and/or control element to the heating system, less mounting elements are needed, because, e.g., fixing elements, such as, e.g., screws, may be omitted. Accordingly, the mounting is eased in general. Automating the coupling process is possible as well. In accordance with the improved thermal coupling, a higher temperature threshold of the temperature monitoring and/or control element may be chosen. Consequently, the<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> temperature monitoring and/or control system is rendered more robust overall in view of a potential formation of scale of the heating surface.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049"><figref idrefs="f0006"><b>Fig. 10</b></figref> shows schematically and exemplarily a further embodiment of a temperature monitoring and/or control system comprising temperature monitoring and/or control elements. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0006"><b>Fig. 10</b></figref><b>,</b> cutout portion 1050 is provided in carrier plate 940. By means of cutout portion 1050, it is possible to define the quantity of heat transferred from a heat transfer element on carrier plate 940 to temperature monitoring and/or control element 930a. That is, by making cutout portion 1050 larger, the cross section area available for conducting heat is made smaller so that less heat is transferred to temperature monitoring and/or control element 930a. Alternatively, by making cutout portion 1050 smaller, the cross section area available for conducting heat is made larger so that more heat is transferred to temperature monitoring and/or control element 930a. Defining the heat quantity to be conducted to temperature monitoring and/or control element 930a may become necessary in order to account for the improved thermal coupling due to laser welding. That is, when pressing a conventional temperature monitoring and/or control element on a carrier plate, less heat is transferred to the conventional temperature monitoring and/or control element. The temperature monitoring and/or control element's temperature thresholds are accordingly adjusted to trigger when a certain amount of heat has been received. With the improved thermal coupling according to the present invention, that certain amount of heat is conducted to the temperature monitoring and/or control element much faster. In order to avoid having to adjust the respective temperature thresholds, one may thus consider including cutout portion 1050 as described herein.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050"><figref idrefs="f0007"><b>Fig. 11</b></figref> shows schematically and exemplarily an exploded view of a detail from the temperature monitoring and/or control system of <figref idrefs="f0006"><b>Fig. 10</b></figref><b>.</b> Temperature monitoring and/or control element 930 is shown on the top.
