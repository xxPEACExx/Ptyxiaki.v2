More particularly, exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a magnetic brake capable of putting on a brake to a rotating body.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In general, a mechanical brake and a magnetic brake are most widely used to put on a brake to a rotating body. The mechanical brake having mechanical structure puts on a brake to a rotary motion through a frictional force by contacting a brake pad to the rotating body and, the magnetic brake using magnetism puts on a brake to a rotary motion through a frictional force by contacting a brake pad to the rotating body.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The magnetic brake puts on a brake to rotary motion of the rotating body by applying a voltage to a pad portion formed in an electromagnetic, the disk portion of the rotating body is moved to the pad portion, making a contact and generating a frictional force between the pad portion and the disk portion.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, in a conventional magnetic brake as described above, when a voltage is applied to a pad formed by an electromagnetic, the whole portion of the pad portion is contacted to the whole portion of the disk portion at the same time, a large frictional force is generated in a moment, and therefore, a big braking impact is applied to the rotating body, as well as, there is problem that the rotating body is stopped in a quick brake without being stopped gradually and smoothly.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Therefore, conventional magnetic brake as described above is actually impossible to apply to an industrial robot arm which requires a precise control and a surgical robot arm which requires more precise control.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Therefore, the technical problem of the present invention is to provide a magnetic brake in which a frictional force is gradually generated between a disk portion and a pad portion during stopping a rotating body, and therefore, a braking impact applied to the rotating body is minimized and, at the same time, the rotating body is stopped smoothly.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a magnetic brake includes a disk portion which is installed on a rotating body to rotate in connection with the rotating body, a pad portion which is disposed away from the disk portion at a predetermined interval and formed by an electromagnetic capable of adjusting a voltage and, the pad portion stops the rotating body by generating a frictional force by contacting the disk portion to the pad portion when a voltage is applied, and a buffer means which smoothly stops the rotating body by gradually increasing the frictional force between the disk portion and the pad portion through gradually increasing a contact surface between the disk portion and the pad portion when the disk portion gets in a contact with the pad portion.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In one embodiment, the buffer means is installed on the disk portion or the pad portion, and may be an arc shaped in which a contact surface is gradually increased outwardly from a center portion when the disk portion gets in contact with the pad portion.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In other embodiment, the buffer means may be a leaf spring which is elastically interposed between the disk portion and the pad portion, and the leaf spring is pressed by the disk portion and the pad portion and gradually increases the contact surface when the disk portion gets in contact with the pad portion.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Meanwhile, the disk portion may be an electromagnet capable of adjusting a voltage, arranged to face the pad portion, and has a polarity opposite to a polarity of the pad portion.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In another embodiment according to the present invention, a magnetic brake may include a disk portion which is installed on a rotating body to rotate in connection with the rotating body, and a pad portion in which at least two electromagnets arranged forming a concentric circle and capable of adjusting a voltage independently, disposed away from the disk portion at a predetermined interval, a voltage is applied to each of the electromagnets at a predetermined interval, each of the electromagnets is gradually contacted with the disk portion at a predetermined interval, a frictional force is gradually increased between the disk portion and the pad portion, and therefore, the pad portion smoothly stops the rotating body.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In one embodiment, a voltage may be applied gradually from the electromagnet positioned in a center of the pad portion to the electromagnet positioned in the outermost of the pad portion such that the pad portion gets in contact with the disk portion from the electromagnet positioned in a center of the pad portion to the electromagnet positioned in the outermost of the pad portion.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In other embodiment, a voltage may be applied gradually from the electromagnet positioned in the outermost of the pad portion to the electromagnet positioned in a center of the pad portion such that the pad portion gets in contact with the disk portion from the electromagnet positioned in the outermost of the pad portion to the electromagnet positioned in a center of the pad portion.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Meanwhile, different voltage may be applied to each of the electromagnets which form the pad portion.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In one embodiment, voltage may gradually be increased from the electromagnet positioned in a center of the pad portion to the electromagnet positioned in the outermost of the pad portion.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In another embodiment, a voltage may gradually be increased from the electromagnet positioned in the outermost of the pad portion to the electromagnet positioned in a center of the pad portion.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Thus, a magnetic brake according to an embodiment of the present invention gradually increases a frictional force generated between the pad portion and the disk portion by gradually increasing a contact surface between the pad portion and the disk portion through a simple structured buffer means, or gradually increases a frictional force generated between the pad portion and the disk portion by arranging at least two electromagnets forming a concentric circle and capable of independently adjusting a voltage, gradually applying a voltage to each of the electromagnets at a predetermined<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> interval ,and therefore, each of the electromagnets is gradually in contact with the disk portion at a predetermined interval.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Accordingly, a magnetic brake according to an embodiment of the present invention minimizes a braking impact applied to a rotating body and stops smoothly the rotating body, and therefore, it may be used in a robot arm which requires precise controlling, a restriction of installing space is minimized by manufacturing in a simple structure, and as well as, various devices to which the magnetic brake is applied may be smaller and lighter.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIG.1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a
