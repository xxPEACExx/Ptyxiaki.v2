Therefore, there are cases in which a small gap is provided between the two lamp units so as to prevent interference between the lamp units upon opening and closing the back door or the trunk lid.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In such cases, the gap between the lamp units stands out when the tail lamp is lit, which might degrade the appearance.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to provide a vehicular lamp in which a gap between two mutually movable lamp units is made less noticeable so as to improve the appearance.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">A vehicular lamp according to the present invention includesa first lamp unit and a second lamp unit that are adjacent to each other with a gap therebetween, in which<br/>
the first lamp unit includes:
<ul><li>a first lamp body;</li><li>a first lens cover that covers a front side of the lamp in the first lamp body to form a first lamp chamber between the first lens cover and the first lamp body; and</li><li>a first light source disposed in the first lamp chamber,</li><li>the first lens cover includes:

<ul><li>a second lamp body;</li><li>a second lens cover that covers a front side of the lamp in the second lamp body to form a second lamp chamber between the second lens cover and the second lamp body; and</li><li>a second light source disposed in the second lamp chamber,</li></ul></li><li>the second lens cover includes:

Accordingly, even in the case where a small gap is formed between the first lamp unit and the second lamp unit, a non-light-emitting area that is formed between the first lamp unit and the second lamp unit and that does not emit light can be made smaller than that of a conventional vehicular lamp, when the lamp is lit. Thus, it is possible to make the gap between the first lamp unit and the second lamp unit less noticeable so as to improve the appearance.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the vehicular lamp according to the present invention, a first reflecting surface that reflects the light from the first light source toward the first light control surface may be provided between the first connection portion and the first light control surface in the first lens cover, and a second reflecting surface that reflects the light from the second light source toward the second light control surface may be provided between the second connection portion and the second light control surface in the second lens cover.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the vehicular lamp with the configuration described above, since the light from the first light source is reflected by the first reflecting surface toward the first light control surface, it is possible to more efficiently guide the light to the first light control surface. Similarly, it is possible to more efficiently guide the light from the second light source to the second light control surface. Thus, it is possible to make the gap between the first lamp unit and the second lamp unit further less noticeable, and thus to further improve the appearance.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the vehicular lamp according to the present invention, a first groove portion may be formed in a surface of the first connection portion facing the second lamp unit, and one of two side surfaces of the first groove portion may be a part of the first reflecting surface. Further, a second groove portion may be formed in a surface of the second connection portion facing the first lamp unit, and one of two side surfaces of the second groove portion may be a part of the second reflecting surface.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the vehicular lamp with the configuration described above, it is possible to increase the area of the first reflecting surface by forming the first groove portion and thus to increase the light quantity of the reflected light, while maintaining the first connection portion sufficiently large to ensure the connection strength between the first lens cover and the first lamp body. Similarly, it is possible to increase the area of the second reflecting surface and thus to increase the light quantity of the reflected light, while maintaining the second connection portion sufficiently large. Thus, it is possible to more efficiently guide light to the first light control surface and the second light control surface, and thus to further improve the appearance.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the vehicular lamp according to the present invention, the first lamp unit may include, in the first lamp chamber, a first light guide that guides the light of the first light source and emits the light forward of the lamp, and a part of the light emitted from the first light guide may reache the first light control surface. The second lamp unit may include, in the second lamp chamber, a second light guide that guides the light of the second light source and emits the light forward of the lamp, and a part of the light emitted from the second light guide may reache the second light control surface.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to the vehicular lamp with the configuration described above, the use of the first light guide and the second light guide makes it possible to increase the light-emitting area of the entire lamp while preventing an increase in the number of light sources in the entire lamp. Further, the use of the first light guide and the second light guide makes it possible to prevent generation of point lights which might be generated in the case where plural light sources are arranged at predetermined intervals, and thus to improve the appearance of the lamp.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the vehicular lamp according to the present invention, the first lens cover and the first light guide may be integrally molded or fixed in close contact with each other, and the second lens cover and the second light guide may be integrally molded or fixed in close contact with each other.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to the vehicular lamp with the configuration described above, light can be efficiently guided from the first light guide to the first light control surface without passing through an air layer. Similarly, light can be more efficiently guided from the second light source to the second light control surface. Thus, it is possible to make the gap between the first lamp unit and the second lamp unit further less noticeable, and thus to further improve the appearance.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In the vehicular lamp according to the present invention, the first lens cover and the first light guide may have different refractive indices, and the second lens cover and the second light guide may have different refractive indices.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to the vehicular lamp with the configuration described above, it is possible to prevent light from the first light guide from being refracted and needlessly spread in the plane of the first lens cover, and to prevent light from the second light guide from being refracted and needlessly spread in the plane of the second lens cover. Thus, it is possible to prevent portions of the first lens cover and the second lens cover that are not designed to be light-emitting areas from appearing as light-emitting areas from the front of the lamp, and thus to maintain a good appearance of the lamp.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the vehicular lamp according to the present invention, the first lens cover and the first light guide may have different colors, and the color of the first light guide may have a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> higher transmittance at a wavelength of the light emitted from the first light source than the color of the first lens cover. Further, the second lens cover and the second light guide may have different colors, and the color of the second light guide may have a higher transmittance at a wavelength of the light emitted from the second light source than the color of the second lens cover.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to the vehicular lamp with the configuration described above, since the color of the first light guide is a color different from that of the first lens cover and having a higher transmittance, it is possible to increase the light guiding efficiency in the first light guide.

Thus, the clear PC portions have a higher refractive index than the red acrylic portions. Therefore, among light L1 and light L2 guided in the first light guide 51A and the second light guide 51B formed of the clear PC portions, lights with relatively small incident angles on the first lens cover 22A and the second lens cover 22B are totally reflected at interfaces with the first lens cover 22A and the second lens cover 22B formed of the red acrylic portions.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">In this way, it is possible to prevent the light L1 and the light L2 from being needlessly spread in the planes of the first lens cover 22A and the second lens cover 22B formed of the red acrylic portions. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent portions of the first lens cover 22A and the second lens cover 22B that are not designed to be light-emitting areas<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> from appearing as light-emitting areas from the front of the lamp, and thus to maintain a good appearance of the lamp.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">Note that in the case where, in the vehicular lamp 10A, the first lens cover 22A and the first light guide 51A have different colors, the first light guide 51A preferably has a color whose transmittance at a wavelength of the light emitted from the first light source 23A is higher than a color of the first lens cover 22A.
