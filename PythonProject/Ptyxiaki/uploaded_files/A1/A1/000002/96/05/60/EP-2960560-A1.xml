For safety reasons, HIPPS systems always require a manual action for opening.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">High Integrity Pressure Protection Systems (HIPPS) are commonly known Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) for preventing unsafe conditions caused by pressure rising in a pipeline. HIPPS valves require high reliability figures and shall be designed to close the pipeline at any condition when required. When a critical pressure is sensed, the final element (valve) is closed to prevent further pressurization of the downstream pipeline. The known HIPPS valve have an<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> external actuator, these actuators often use springs/hydraulics and are very large to ensure sufficient safety to be able to close the valve at any condition. These external actuators could fail resulting in a loss of actuation force.</p><heading id="h0003">PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">It is an object of the invention to provide a valve in which the actuation force is inherently present when the valve has to close.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">The invention suggests that an opposite face of the control element, opposite to the control face is exposed to the pressure of the fluid, so that the pressure of the fluid pushes the closure member into the closing position. In an HIPPS according to the invention, the rising downstream pressure of the fluid itself is the acting means, that closes the ON/OFF-valve.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In a preferred HIPPS according to the invention, the actuator is arranged inside the housing. In such HIPPS, the actuator is protected from pressure and other impact from the environment, in particular in sub-sea, and in seabed applications. Alternatively, e.g. in globe valves, the actuator may be arranged outside the housing.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In such HIPPS, the conduit preferably surrounds the actuator. With the conduit surrounding the actuator, inside an inner housing, the ON/OFF-valve is basically pressure balanced. Alternatively, the conduit may be formed alongside the actuator, to avoid wear of the inner housing.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In a further preferred HIPPS according to the invention, the control element is a piston of the hydraulic actuator. Such HIPPS is preferred in particular for large diameters.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In an alternatively preferred HIPPS according to the invention, the control element is a cylinder barrel of the hydraulic actuator. Such HIPPS is preferred in particular for smaller diameters.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In a further preferred HIPPS according to the invention, a spring pushes the closure member into the closing position. Such additional springs are suggested by common standards for HIPPS, to assist closing of the valve.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In a further preferred HIPPS according to the invention, at least one sensor identifies a position of the closure member. Including a sensor into the ON/OFF-valve provides for monitoring the status of the HIPPS.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In a further preferred HIPPS according to the invention, the closure member has an orifice, giving way to the fluid from the outlet through the closure member to the back face of the control element. An orifice formed in the closure member provides the most simple connection from the outlet of the valve, to the inside of the inner housing.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The invention further suggests a method for operating such HIPPS in a fluid line, wherein an opposite face of the control element, opposite to the control face, is exposed to the pressure, so that the pressure of the fluid pushes the closure member into the closing position. The method according to the invention may be executed using the HIPPS described supra, and features the same advantages.</p><heading id="h0005">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">The apparatus according to the invention and the associated method are subsequently described in more detail with reference to preferred embodiments illustrated in the drawing figures.
