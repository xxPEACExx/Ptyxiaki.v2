The coupling includes a pair of hubs and a rubber spacer located between the pair of hubs. Silicone rubber, urethane rubber, chloroprene rubber, styrene-butadiene-copolymer rubber (SBR), or the like is used to form the rubber spacer. The rubber spacer needs to have a certain rigidity to limit the oscillation amplitude and improve the torque transmission performance.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Non-patent document 1 discloses a solution for such servomotors. More specifically, to avoid resonance, the resonance angular frequency needs to be increased to be separated from an input angular frequency. However, this results in the need to at least increase the torsional rigidity of a shaft joint, which represents the mechanical system. When there is a resonance relationship resulting from a low torsional rigidity, the control gain of the control system, particularly, that of the servomotor, needs to be decreased to a level in which the resonance does not occur. Alternatively, a selective band-pass filter needs to be used to remove the resonance.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For example, to increase the natural frequency, the rigidity of a shaft joint may be increased. This enlarges the shaft joint and increases the moment of inertia. However, in a high-speed and high-response precision positioning mechanism, the use of a shaft joint having such a large moment of inertia affects the acceleration time, the deceleration time, and stopping accuracy. Thus, it is difficult to control the positing mechanism. Additionally, the shaft joint having a large moment of inertia would require the use of a motor having a capacity larger than that intended for the original task of the motor. Thus, there is a limitation to the size of the shaft joint that may be used.</p><heading id="h0003">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h0004">NON-PATENT DOCUMENT</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Non-Patent Document 1: "<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>Next-Generation Precision Positioning Technology", Published by Fuji Technosystem, April 25, 2000, pp. 359-361</text></nplcit>.</p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">PROBLEMS THAT ARE TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">As described in non-patent document 1, there is a limit to the improvement in the responsiveness when increasing the speed control gain of a servomotor only by increasing the torsional rigidity of a coupling, which functions as the shaft joint.

When the square root K<sup>1/2</sup> of the dynamic torsional spring constant K decreases, the damping ratio ζ increases. When the square<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> root K<sup>1/2</sup> of the dynamic torsional spring constant K increases, the damping ratio ζ decreases. The speed control gain, which indicates the responsiveness of a coupling, increases as the damping ratio ζ and the square root K<sup>1/2</sup> of the dynamic torsional spring constant K increases. In the coupling of the present invention, the product of the damping ratio ζ and the square root K<sup>1/2</sup> of the dynamic torsional spring constant K is 1.3 to 12.0. Thus, the damping ratio ζ and the square root K<sup>1/2</sup> of the dynamic torsional spring constant K may each be increased. This contributes to an improvement of the gain.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Additionally, an increase in the damping ratio ζ of the coupling increases the damping properties. An increase in the square root K<sup>1/2</sup> of the dynamic torsional spring constant K increases the rigidity.

The first hub 111 and the second hub 112 each include an inner end surface 11 a. The inner end surfaces 11a are opposed to each other. Each inner end surface 11a includes three coupling claws 12 arranged at equal intervals in the circumferential direction. The claws 12 project in the direction of the axis x of the first hub 111 and the second hub 112. The coupling 10 includes a rubber spacer 13, which is arranged between the first hub 111 and the second hub 112. The first hub 111 and the second hub 112 each include an insertion hole 14 extending through the center of the hub in the direction of the axis x. The rubber spacer 13 includes a through hole 15 that communicates with the insertion holes 14 of the first hub 111 and the second hub 112.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the coupling 10 is configured in such a manner that a driving side<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> rotation shaft 16 of a servomotor or the like is inserted into one of the insertion holes 14 of the first hub 111 and the second hub 112, and a driven side rotation shaft 17 is inserted into the other insertion hole 14 and connected to the driving side rotation shaft 16.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The first hub 111 and the second hub 112 are formed from metal, such as, aluminum (aluminum alloy), cast iron, steel material (stainless steel), or copper alloy. The rubber spacer is formed from a rubber material, such as, fluorine-based rubber, hydrogenated acrylonitrile-butadiene-copolymer rubber (HNBR), natural rubber (NR), styrene-butadiene-copolymer rubber (SBR), chloroprene rubber (CR), urethane rubber (U), or silicone rubber (Q). Fluorine-based rubber is preferred to other rubber materials from the viewpoint of hardness, damping properties, and the like. One example of a fluorine-based rubber is vinylidene fluoride-based rubber (FKM).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">It is preferred that the loss tangent tan δ of the rubber material be 0.2 to 1.3. Further preferably, the loss tangent tan δ of the rubber material is 0.2 to 0.7. The loss tangent tan δ is a ratio of loss shear elastic modulus to storage shear elastic modulus. The loss tangent tan δ shows the energy level absorbed by a rubber material when the rubber material is deformed, that is, a heat conversion level. When the loss tangent tan δ is in the above range, the damping ratio ζ and the rigidity of the coupling 10 are increased with further ease.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">It is preferred that the damping ratio ζ of the coupling 10 be 0.07 to 0.27. The damping ratio ζ is a coefficient showing the damping properties and calculated from a constant logarithmic decrement obtained from the logarithm of the ratio of adjacent amplitudes in a damping free oscillation waveform where the amplitudes are exponentially damped. When the damping ratio ζ is in the above range, the oscillation amplitude and the rigidity of the coupling 10 may be set to desired values.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The first hub 111 and the second hub 112 each include an outer end surface that is cut into to be semi-tubular and define a cutaway portion 11c. Each cutaway portion 11c receives a fastening member 18. The first hub 111 and the second hub 112 each include two through holes 11b extending in a direction orthogonal to the axis x. Each fastening member 18 includes two screw holes 18a.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">3</figref>, when the driving-side rotation shaft 16 is inserted into the insertion hole 14 of the first hub 111 and the driven-side rotation shaft 17 is inserted into the insertion hole 14 of the second hub 112, two hexagonal socket head bolts 19 are inserted into the through holes 11b of each of the first hub 111 and the second hub 112. Then, the hexagonal socket head bolts 19 are each engaged with and fastened to one of the screw holes 18a of the fastening member 18 with a hex key (not shown). In this manner, the coupling 10 couples the driving-side rotation shaft 16 and the driven-side rotation shaft 17. In this situation, torque is transmitted from the driving-side rotation shaft 16 to the driven-side rotation shaft 17 through the coupling 10.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The coupling 10 is manufactured as follows. First, the first hub 111 and the second hub 112 are opposed to each other and placed in a mold. Here, the first claws 12a of the first hub 111 are each positioned in a gap 20 between two adjacent second claws 12b of the second hub 112 so that the first claws 12a and the second claws 12b are located at equal intervals in the circumferential direction. An insert is also arranged at locations corresponding to the through hole 15 of the rubber spacer 13 and the insertion holes 14 of the first hub 111 and the second hub 112. The mold is then clamped. Subsequently, a molten rubber material is injected into a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> cavity 21 defined by the inner end surfaces 11 a of the first hub 111 and the second hub 112 to perform molding. When cooled, the mold is unclamped, and a molded product is removed from the mold. This manufactures the coupling 10 that includes the rubber spacer 13 between the first hub 111 and the second hub 112.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, when the first claws 12a of the first hub 111 and the second claws 12b of the second hub 112 are located at equal intervals in the circumferential direction, the rubber spacer 13 is located in the cavity 21 defined by the opposing inner end surfaces 11a of the first hub 111 and the second hub 112. In a cross-section orthogonal to the axis x of the first hub 111 and the second hub 112, it is preferred that a cross-sectional area of the rubber spacer 13 between the inner circumference of the claws 12 and the outer circumference of the claws 12 be 20% to 50% of a combined cross-sectional area of the claws 12 and the rubber spacer 13 between the inner circumference of the claws 12 and the outer circumference of the claws 12. When the cross-sectional area of the rubber spacer 13 between the inner circumference of the claws 12 and the outer circumference of the claws 12 is in the above range, the rubber spacer 13 limits oscillations and increases the square root K<sup>1/2</sup> of the dynamic torsional spring constant K further easily.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">For example, when the outer diameter of the coupling 10 (rubber spacer 13) is 25 mm, and the diameter of the through hole 15 of the rubber spacer 13 is 5 mm, the proportion of the cross-sectional area of the claws 12 may be 53%. In other words, the proportion of the cross-sectional area of the rubber spacer 13 may be 47%. When the outer diameter of the coupling 10 is 25 mm, and the diameter of the through hole 15 of the rubber spacer 13 is 12 mm, the proportion of the cross-sectional area of the claws 12 may be 61%. In other words, the proportion of the cross-sectional area of the rubber spacer 13 may be 39%.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">To increase the resonance frequency of the coupling 10, it is preferred that the square root K<sup>1/2</sup> of the dynamic torsional spring constant K of the coupling 10 be 12.2 to 58.3. When K<sup>1/2</sup> is in the above range, a sufficient gain may be easily obtained.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>, in the rubber spacer 13, the relationship between the square root K<sup>1/2</sup> of the dynamic torsional spring constant K and the damping ratio ζ is expressed by damping curves. When K<sup>1/2</sup> is small, the damping ratio ζ is large. As K<sup>1/2</sup> increases, ζ gradually decreases. In the rubber spacer 13 of the first embodiment, the product of ζ and K<sup>1/2</sup> is set to be 1.3 to 12.0.

When the product of ζ and K<sup>1/2</sup> exceeds 12.0, the gain may be increased.

<ol><li>(1) The gain, which indicates the responsiveness of the coupling 10, increases as the damping ratio ζ and the square root K<sup>1/2</sup> of the dynamic torsional spring constant K increase. Thus, when the product of K<sup>1/2</sup> and ζ is set to be 1.3 to 12.0, each K<sup>1/2</sup> and ζ may be increased.

The first claws 12a and the second claws 12b project in the direction of the axis x of the first hub 111 and the second hub 112. Each first claw 12a of the first hub 111 is positioned in a gap 20 between the two adjacent second claws 12b of the second hub 112 so that the five first claws 12a and the five second claws 12b are located at equal intervals in the circumferential direction.

When the outer diameters of the first hub 111 and the second hub 112 are each 25 mm, and the diameters of the insertion holes 14 of the first hub 111 and the second hub 112 are each 12 mm, the proportion of the cross-sectional area of the claws 12 may be 79%.

Thus, the proportion of the cross-sectional area of the rubber spacer 13 is smaller than that of the first embodiment. Therefore, the coupling 10 of the second embodiment has a higher torsional rigidity than the coupling 10 of the first embodiment and thus effectively limits the amplitude of oscillations. In this case, when torque is transmitted from the driving-side rotation shaft to the driven-side rotation shaft 17 through the coupling 10, the gain may be further increased and the settling time may be shortened compared to the first embodiment.</p><heading id="h0013">Examples</heading><p id="p0042" num="0042">The embodiments will now be described in further detail using examples and comparative examples.</p><heading id="h0014">Examples 1 to 12 and Comparative Examples 1 to 7</heading><p id="p0043" num="0043">In examples 1 to 10 and comparative examples 1 to 7, the outer diameter of the coupling 10 was 25 mm, and the rubber spacer 13 was formed from the rubber materials described below.
