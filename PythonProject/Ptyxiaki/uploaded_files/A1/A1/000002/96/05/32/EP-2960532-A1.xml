Especially, the present invention pertains to a hook which is able to reliably prevent an object from dropping and use a space inside the hook effectively.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">For example, a hook put on a wall can be used to hook an elongated object such as a shoulder strap or a handle of a bag for hanging the bag and the like. The hook holds and hangs the object which is inserted within a hook body through an opening portion. In this case, an arm for closing the opening portion may be provided to prevent the hanged object from slipping from the hook and dropping. (For example, refer to Patent Document 1.)</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>, such an arm 14 is usually biased by an arm biasing means 18 so as to be displaced toward an outside of a hook body 12, while the displacement is regulated by a stopper 30 provided at a tip of the hook body 12, thereby having a function of preventing an inserted object 1 from dropping by closing an opening portion 16 of the hook body 12. On the other hand, the arm 14 opens the opening portion 16 and allows the object 1 to be inserted into the hook body 12 when the object 1 to be hanged is pressed toward the arm 14 so that the arm 14, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>, is pressed into the hook body 12 against a biasing force of an arm biasing means 18.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In this situation, conventionally, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>, the arm 14 was only able to be displaced toward the inside of the hook body 12 because the stopper 30 blocked the arm 14 from displacing toward the outside of the hook body 12. As a result of this, in the case where the object 1 is not present or a few objects are present inside the hook body 12, or the object 1 has a small size of width as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8(B)</figref>, the arm 14 was able to be freely displaced inside the hook body 12, and reliably close the opening portion 16 and prevent the object 1 from dropping. However, especially in the case where multiple objects 1 were hanged or the object 1 had a large size of width, since the object 1 was inserted<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> into the hook body 12 while being pressed to the arm 14, the arm 14 which has been pressed by the object 1 stayed inside the hook body 12 and was not able to return to its original closing position. Consequently, the opening portion 16 remained open. Accordingly, in the case where multiple objects or the object 1 having a large size of width, which were both especially desired not to be dropped, were hanged, there was a problem that the object was not reliably prevented from dropping.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Meanwhile, if the prevention of the object 1 from dropping by closing the opening portion 16 by the arm 14 is given priority by ensuring the displacement of the arm 14, the number of the objects 1 to be hooked on the hook 10 will be limited. As a result of this, there occurs a problem that the holding space inside the hook body 12 cannot be efficiently used. That is, the conventional hook 10 had to ensure a space inside the hook body 12 to maintain the displacement of the arm 14 for reliably preventing the object 1 from dropping with using the arm 14. Consequently, there was a dead space inside the hook body 12.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Also, the arm 14 of the conventional hook 10 was only able to swing toward the inside of the hook body 12. For this reason, in order to take out the object 1 hanged on the hook body 12, the arm 14 was pressed into the inside of the hook body 12 so as to open the opening portion 16, and the object 1 had to be taken out while keeping the state where the arm 14 remained pressed. This operation was troublesome.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Prior Art Documents</b></heading><heading id="h0004"><b>Patent Documents</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">Patent Document 1: Registered Design Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO1320516A"><text>1320516</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005"><b>Summary of the Invention</b></heading><heading id="h0006"><b>Problems to be Solved by the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The problem to be solved by the present invention is, in view of the problems above, to provide a hook which can hold multiple objects or an object having a large size of width by efficiently using a space inside the hook, also reliably prevent the hanged object from dropping, and allow the hanged object to be easily taken out.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0007"><b>Means for Solving the Problems</b></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">As the first means for solving the problems mentioned above, the present invention is to provide a hook including:
<ul><li>a hook body having an opening portion for hanging an object which is inserted through the opening portion on, the hook body having a front receiving portion for preventing the object hanged within the hook body from dropping forward;</li><li>and an arm for closing the opening portion of the hook body, the arm being biased by an arm biasing means so as to be displaced toward an outside of the hook body, and closing the opening portion by the displacement of the arm being regulated, while opening the opening portion and allowing the object to be inserted into the hook body when the arm is pressed into the hook body against a biasing force of the arm biasing means; wherein the hook body has a latch for closing the opening portion by regulating the displacement of the arm by locking the arm which is biased by the arm biasing means, the latch is biased by a latch biasing means such that the latch is present at an arm regulating position for locking the arm, and when the latch is displaced from the arm regulating position against a biasing force of the latch biasing means, the arm is unlocked and the opening portion is allowed to be released with the arm displaced toward the outside of the hook body by the biasing force of the arm biasing means.</li></ul></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As the second means for solving the problems mentioned above, the present invention is to provide a hook. In the hook as the second means according to the first means described above, from a state where the arm is displaced at the outside of the hook body, when the arm is pressed into the hook body while pressing the latch such that the latch is displaced from the arm regulating position against the biasing force of the latch biasing means, and is then released, the arm is locked by the latch which has returned to the original arm regulating position by the latch biasing means after being released from the press by the arm, and returns to a position for closing the opening portion.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As the third means for solving the problems mentioned above, the present invention is to provide a hook.

Therefore, there are benefits that multiple objects or an object having a large size of width can be inserted and held within the hook body without the necessity of displacing the arm excessively into the hook body, and that the hanged object can be easily taken out.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Meanwhile, according to the present invention, as described above, when the arm which has been displaced at the outside of the hook body is pressed down, the latch is pressed down at the same time. After the latch is released from the contact with the arm, the latch returns to its original position, and also the arm easily returns to a normal state for closing the opening portion. Therefore, there is a benefit that even after multiple objects or an object having a large size of width are inserted, the opening portion can be properly closed and the inserted objects can be reliably prevented from dropping. Also, there is a benefit that the arm can easily return to the original state after the objects are taken out from the hook body.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In this case, according to the present invention, as described above, since the latch is slidably provided at the front receiving portion which is positioned at the front side of the hook body, there are benefits that the latch can be easily operated, and that the displacement of the arm can be controlled without disfiguring the appearance of the hook.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Also, according to the present invention, as described above, since the latch is swingably provided at the front receiving portion which is positioned at the front side of the hook body, there are benefits that the latch can be easily operated, and that the displacement of the arm can be easily controlled.</p><heading id="h0009"><b>Brief Description of the Drawings</b></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><p id="p0017" num="0017"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a hook of the present invention on which a bag has been hanged.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a perspective view of a hook of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> shows a hook of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(A)</figref> is a longitudinal sectional view of the hook seen from the right side.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(B)</figref> is a sectional view taken along the line A-A of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(A)</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(C)</figref> is a front view of the hook.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(D)</figref> is a longitudinal sectional view of the hook seen from the left side.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(E)</figref> is a back view of the hook.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(F)</figref> is a plane view of the hook.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(G)</figref> is a bottom view of the hook.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is an enlarged sectional view of a tip portion of a latch and a selected part of an arm which are both used for a hook of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> is a longitudinal sectional view showing a state where a hook of the present invention is operated.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> is a side view and a sectional view of another example of a hook of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> shows another example of a hook of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7(A)</figref> is a perspective view of the hook.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7(B)</figref> is a plane view of the hook.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7(C)</figref> is a front view of the hook.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref> shows a conventional hook.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8(A)</figref> is a perspective view of the hook.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8(B)</figref> is a side view of the hook.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8(C)</figref> is a longitudinal sectional view of the hook.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010"><b>Description of the Preferred Embodiment</b></heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">Embodiments for implementing the present invention are described with referring to the figures. <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref> show a hook 10 of the present invention, and as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the hook 10 is put on a wall and the like and used to hang and hold especially an elongated object 1 such as a shoulder strap or an handle of a bag.
