Consequently, because a distribution of pressure acting on the inner circumference of the cam ring is varied rapidly, there is a risk that noise is caused by variation in pressure of the working fluid discharged from the discharge port due to vibration of the cam ring about the pin.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">An object of the present invention is to provide a variable displacement vane pump that is capable of suppressing occurrence of noise due to pressure variation of working fluid that is discharged from a discharge port.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to one aspect of the present invention, a variable displacement vane pump used as a fluid pressure source includes a rotor that is configured to rotationally driven by motive power from a motive-power source; a plurality of slits radially formed so as to open to an outer circumference of the rotor; vanes slidably received in the respective slits; a cam ring having an inner circumferential cam face with which tip portions of the vanes are brought into sliding contact, the cam ring being capable of being made eccentric to a center of the rotor; a side member provided so as to be in contact with a side surface of the cam ring; pump chambers defined by the rotor, the cam ring, the side member, and the adjacent vanes; a suction port formed to have an arc<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> shape on the side member in a region in which displacement of the pump chambers are expanded by rotation of the rotor, the suction port being configured to guide working fluid to be sucked into the pump chambers; and a discharge port formed to have an arc shape on the side member in a region in which displacement of the pump chambers are contracted by rotation of the rotor, the discharge port being configured to guide working fluid discharged from the pump chambers. The side member has a first transition section and a second transition section, the first transition section being a section from an end point of the suction port to a start point of the discharge port, the second transition section being a section from an end point of the discharge port to a start point of the suction port. An angle between the start point and the end point of the suction port with respect to the rotor serving as a center is set such that a pressurizing timing is offset from a depressurizing timing, the pressurizing timing being a timing at which one pump chamber starts to communicate with the start point of the discharge port from the first transition section, the depressurizing timing being a timing at which another pump chamber starts to communicates with the start point of the suction port from the second transition section.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1] FIG. 1</figref> is a front view showing a variable displacement vane pump according to an embodiment of the present invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2] FIG. 2</figref> is a front view showing a state in which a rotor and vanes are arranged on a side plate according to the embodiment of the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A] FIG. 3A</figref> is a front view showing the side plate when the number of vanes is an odd number.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3B] FIG. 3B</figref> is a front view showing the side plate when the number of vanes is an odd number.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4A] FIG. 4A</figref> is a front view showing the side plate when the number of vanes is an even number.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4B] FIG. 4B</figref> is a front view showing the side plate when the number of vanes is an even number.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5] FIG. 5</figref> is a front view showing a state in which a rotor and vanes are arranged on a side plate according to a comparative example.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">An embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the attached drawings.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a front view of a variable displacement vane pump 100 (hereinafter, simply referred to as "vane pump 100") according to this embodiment and is a diagram in which the vane pump 100 is viewed from the axial direction of a shaft 1 in a state in which a pump cover has been detached.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The vane pump 100 is used as a fluid pressure source for a fluid hydraulic apparatus, such as, for example, a power steering apparatus, a continuously variable transmission, or the like, mounted on a vehicle. Oil, aqueous alternative fluid of other type, or the like may be used as working fluid.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The vane pump 100 is driven by an engine (not shown) etc., for example, and generates fluid pressure as a rotor 2 linked to the shaft 1 is rotated clockwise as shown by an arrow in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The vane pump 100 includes a pump body 3, the shaft 1 that is<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> rotatably supported by the pump body 3, the rotor 2 that is linked to the shaft 1 so as to be rotationally driven, a plurality of vanes 4 that are provided so as to be capable of reciprocating in the radial direction relative to the rotor 2, a cam ring 5 that accommodates the rotor 2 and the vanes 4, and an annular adapter ring 6 that surrounds the cam ring 5.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the rotor 2, a plurality of slits 2a having openings on the outer circumferential surface of the rotor 2 are radially formed with predetermined gaps therebetween. The vanes 4 are slidably inserted into the respective slits 2a. At the base-end sides of the slits 2a, back pressure chambers 2b are formed by being defined by base-end portions of the vanes 4. The base end portions are end portions at the opposite side from the direction in which the vanes 4 project from the slits 2a. The working fluid is guided to the back pressure chambers 2b. The vanes 4 are pushed in the directions projecting out from the slits 2a by the pressure of the back pressure chambers 2b.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the pump body 3, a pump accommodating concaved portion 3a accommodating the adapter ring 6 is formed. A side plate 20 is arranged on a bottom surface of the pump accommodating concaved portion 3a so as to be in contact with the one side in the axial direction (back side in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) of each of the rotor 2, the cam ring 5, and the adapter ring 6. An opening of the pump accommodating concaved portion 3a is closed with a pump cover (not shown) that is in contact with the other side (front side in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) of each of the rotor 2, the cam ring 5, and the adapter ring 6. The pump cover and the side plate 20 serving as side members are arranged in a state in which both side surfaces of each of the rotor 2, the cam ring 5, and the adapter ring 6 are sandwiched. Pump chambers 7 are defined between the rotor 2 and the cam ring 5 by being partitioned by the respective vanes 4.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">On the side plate 20, at a sliding contact surface that is in sliding<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> contact with the rotor 2; a through hole 21 into which the shaft 1 is inserted and fitted (see <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref>); a suction port 22 configured to guide the working fluid into the pump chambers 7; and a discharge port 23 configured to discharge the working fluid from the pump chambers 7 to a fluid hydraulic apparatus are formed. The suction port 22 and the discharge port 23 are respectively formed to have an arc shape centered at the through hole 21.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">On the pump cover, at the sliding contact surface that is in sliding contact with the rotor 2; a through hole, a suction port, and a discharge port are formed at respective positions symmetrical to those on the side plate 20. In other words, the suction port of the pump cover is in communication with the suction port 22 of the side plate 20 through the pump chambers 7, the discharge port of the pump cover is in communication with the discharge port 23 of the side plate 20 through the pump chambers 7. Furthermore, the through hole of the pump cover is arranged coaxially with the through hole 21 of the side plate 20. If manufacturing precision of the pump cover is low, the individual ports may be set smaller than the respective ports 22 and 23 of the side plate 20 such that switching timing of the ports is determined by the side plate 20.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The cam ring 5 is an annular member, and has an inner circumferential cam face 5a with which tip portions 4a of the vanes 4, which are end portions of the vanes 4 in the direction projecting from the slits 2a, are brought into sliding contact. As the rotor 2 rotates, the tip portions 4a of the vanes 4 extend/contract in the radial direction of the rotor 2 while being in sliding contact with the inner circumferential cam face 5a. The cam ring 5 defines a suction region 31 and a discharge region 32. The pump chambers 7 are expanded in the suction region 31 and contracted in the discharge region 32 in response to the extension/contraction of the vanes 4.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The suction port 22 penetrates the side plate 20 and communicates with a tank (not shown) through a suction passage (not shown) formed in the pump body 3, and thereby, the working fluid in the tank is passed through the suction passage and is supplied to the pump chambers 7 from the suction port 22 of the side plate 20.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The discharge port 23 penetrates the side plate 20 and communicates with a high-pressure chamber (not shown) formed in the pump body 3. The high-pressure chamber communicates with the fluid hydraulic apparatus (not shown) outside the vane pump 100 through a discharge passage (not shown). In other words, the working fluid discharged from the pump chambers 7 is supplied to the fluid hydraulic apparatus through the discharge port 23, the high-pressure chamber, and the discharge passage.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The adapter ring 6 is accommodated in the pump accommodating concaved portion 3a of the pump body 3. A support pin 8 is interposed between the adapter ring 6 and the cam ring 5, closer to the discharge port 23 than the rotor 2.
