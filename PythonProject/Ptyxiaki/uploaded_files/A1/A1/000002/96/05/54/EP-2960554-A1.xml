With reference to <figref idrefs="f0015">Figs. 33 and 34</figref>, a seal ring according to a conventional art will be described. <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 33</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view showing a seal ring according to the conventional art in a condition in which the hydraulic pressure is not held. <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 34</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view showing the seal ring according to the conventional art in a condition in which the hydraulic pressure is held. In the case of a seal ring 600 according to the conventional art, the seal ring 600 is configured so as to seal an annular gap between a shaft 400 and a shaft hole of a housing 500 by being attached to an annular groove 410 provided on an outer periphery of the shaft 400, and being slidably in contact with an inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole of the housing 500, through which the shaft 400 is inserted, and a side wall surface of the annular groove 410.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the seal ring 600 which is used for the above described purpose, it is required to sufficiently reduce a sliding torque. Accordingly, the circumference of an outer peripheral surface of the seal ring 600 is configured to be shorter than the circumference of the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole of the housing 500, thus it is configured to have no interference. Consequently, in a condition in which an<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> engine of an automobile is operated and the hydraulic pressure is high, the seal ring 600 is expanded in diameter by the hydraulic pressure and makes close contact with the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole and the side wall surface of the annular groove 410 to thereby exhibit a function of sufficiently holding the hydraulic pressure (see <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 34</figref>). In contrast to this, in a condition in which the hydraulic pressure is not applied due to stoppage of the engine, the seal ring 600 is configured so as to be apart from the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole and the side wall surface of the annular groove 410 (see <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 33</figref>).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, in the case of the seal ring 600 which is configured in the above described manner, the seal ring 600 does not exhibit a sealing function in the condition in which the hydraulic pressure is not applied. Accordingly, in a configuration such as AT or CVT, in which gear shifting control is performed by oil which is pressure-fed by a hydraulic pump, when it is in a no-load condition in which the hydraulic pump is stopped (e.g., during an idling stop), the oil sealed by the seal ring 600 may no longer be sealed and return to an oil pan, thereby leaving no oil in the vicinity of the seal ring 600. Consequently, when the engine is started (re-started) from such a condition, the operation is started in a condition in which no oil is present in the vicinity of the seal ring 600; hence, without lubrication, a problem arises in that responsiveness or operativity may be poor.</p><heading id="h0003">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT LITERATURE</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent Literature 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP4665046B"><text>Japanese Patent No. 4665046</text></patcit>.

Accordingly, even in a condition in which the fluid pressure is not applied (the pressure difference is not created) or the fluid pressure is almost not applied (the pressure difference is<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> almost not created), the seal ring is contact with the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole of the housing, thereby exhibiting a sealing function. Consequently, it is possible to hold the fluid pressure from immediately after the start of increase of the fluid pressure in the sealing target area. In addition, the concave portion is formed on the outer peripheral surface of the seal ring, and the fluid is introduced into the concave portion from the high pressure side. Accordingly, even when the fluid pressure is increased, the fluid pressure acts towards the inner peripheral surface side within an area where the concave portion is provided. Consequently, it is possible to prevent the increase of pressure acting towards the outer peripheral surface side via the seal ring due to the increase of the fluid pressure, thereby making it possible to suppress a sliding torque.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Since the metal spring is provided so as to be placed along the inner peripheral surface of the seal ring in the state in which the gap is formed between the metal spring and the groove bottom surface of the annular groove, the metal spring is hardly influenced by eccentricity of the shaft and the housing. In addition, the seal ring and the metal spring would not rotate relative to each other. Consequently, the seal ring and the metal spring would not slide relative to each other; hence the inner peripheral surface side of the seal ring would not be abraded due to sliding.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In addition, a plurality of the concave portions may preferably be formed at intervals in a circumferential direction.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">When such a configuration is adopted, a portion between the two concave portions maintains a state in which it is in contact with the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole of the housing, and it becomes possible to suppress degrading of the rigidity of the seal ring. Consequently, it becomes possible to prevent the seal ring from being tilted within the annular groove, and stabilize an attachment state of the seal ring.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Further, a guide portion which positions the metal spring in an axial direction (a direction of a central axis of the shaft; the same shall apply hereinafter) may preferably<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> be formed on the inner peripheral surface of the seal ring.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Accordingly, it becomes possible to prevent the metal spring from being displaced in the axial direction. Consequently, the seal ring can be pressed towards the outer peripheral surface side stably by the metal spring.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In addition, another sealing device of the present invention is a sealing device which is attached to an annular groove provided on an outer periphery of a shaft and holds a fluid pressure in a sealing target area by sealing an annular gap between the shaft and a housing rotating relative to each other, the sealing target area being configured such that the fluid pressure changes, the sealing device including: a seal ring made of resin which is in close contact with a side wall surface on a low pressure side of the annular groove, and slides against an inner peripheral surface of a shaft hole in the housing through which the shaft is inserted; and a metal spring which is provided along an inner peripheral surface of the seal ring in a state in which a gap is formed between the metal spring and a groove bottom surface of the annular groove, and presses the seal ring toward an outer peripheral surface side, wherein a concave portion is formed on an outer peripheral surface of the seal ring which extends from an end portion on a high pressure side of the outer peripheral surface to a position which does not reach an end portion on a low pressure side of the outer peripheral surface, and introduces a fluid from the high pressure side, and a guide portion which positions the metal spring in an axial direction is formed on the inner peripheral surface of the seal ring, and a protrusion which prevents the metal spring from being detached to an inner peripheral surface side is provided at a tip of the guide portion.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Still further, yet another sealing device of the present invention is a sealing device which is attached to an annular groove provided on an outer periphery of a shaft and holds a fluid pressure in a sealing target area by sealing an annular gap between the shaft and a housing rotating relative to each other, the sealing target area being configured such that the fluid pressure changes, the sealing device including: a seal ring made of resin which is in close contact with a side wall surface on a low<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> pressure side of the annular groove, and slides against an inner peripheral surface of a shaft hole in the housing through which the shaft is inserted; and a metal spring which is provided along an inner peripheral surface of the seal ring in a state in which a gap is formed between the metal spring and a groove bottom surface of the annular groove, and presses the seal ring toward an outer peripheral surface side, wherein a concave portion is formed on an outer peripheral surface of the seal ring which extends from an end portion on a high pressure side of the outer peripheral surface to a position which does not reach an end portion on a low pressure side of the outer peripheral surface, and introduces a fluid from the high pressure side, and an abutment portion is provided at one position on the seal ring in a circumferential direction, and protrusions which restrict a movement of the metal spring in the circumferential direction are provided on the inner peripheral surface on both sides of the abutment portion.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Still further, yet another sealing device of the present invention is a sealing device which is attached to an annular groove provided on an outer periphery of a shaft and holds a fluid pressure in a sealing target area by sealing an annular gap between the shaft and a housing rotating relative to each other, the sealing target area being configured such that the fluid pressure changes, the sealing device including: a seal ring made of resin which is in close contact with a side wall surface on a low pressure side of the annular groove, and slides against an inner peripheral surface of a shaft hole in the housing through which the shaft is inserted;

Accordingly, even in a condition in which the fluid pressure is not applied (the pressure difference is not created) or the fluid pressure is almost not applied (the pressure difference is almost not created), the seal ring is contact with the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole of the housing, thereby exhibiting a sealing function. Consequently, it is possible to hold the fluid pressure from immediately after the start of increase of the fluid pressure in the sealing target area. In addition, the concave portion is formed on the outer peripheral surface of the seal ring, and the fluid is introduced into the concave portion from the high pressure side. Accordingly, even when the fluid pressure is increased, the fluid pressure acts towards the inner peripheral surface side within an area where the concave portion is provided. Consequently, it is possible to prevent the increase of pressure acting towards the outer peripheral surface side via the seal ring due to the increase of the fluid pressure, thereby making it possible to suppress a sliding torque.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> e.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Since the metal spring is provided so as to be placed along the inner peripheral surface of the seal ring in the state in which the gap is formed between the metal spring and the groove bottom surface of the annular groove, the metal spring is hardly influenced by eccentricity of the shaft and the housing.

exemplarily described in detail based on examples thereof with reference to the drawings. However, the dimensions, materials, shapes, relative arrangements and so on of constituent parts described in the examples are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention to these alone in particular unless specifically described. Note that a sealing device according to each of the present examples is used for the purpose of sealing an annular gap between a shaft and a housing which rotate relative to each other in order to hold a hydraulic pressure in a transmission for automobiles such as AT and CVT. In addition, in the following description, a "high pressure side" denotes one side where a pressure is high when a pressure difference is created between two sides of the sealing device, and a "low pressure side" denotes another side where the pressure is low when the pressure difference is created between the two sides of the sealing device.</p><heading id="h0011">(First Example)</heading><p id="p0029" num="0029">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figs. 1 to 7</figref>, a sealing device according to a first example of the present invention will be described.</p><heading id="h0012">&lt;Configuration of Sealing Device&gt;</heading><p id="p0030" num="0030">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figs. 1 and 5 to 7</figref>, in particular, the configuration of the sealing device according to the first example of the present invention will be described. A sealing device 100 according to the present example is attached to an annular groove 410 provided on an outer periphery of a shaft 400, and seals an annular gap between the shaft 400 and a housing 500 (an inner peripheral surface of a shaft hole in the housing 500 through which the shaft 400 is inserted) which rotate relative to each other. With this, the sealing device 100 holds a fluid pressure in a sealing target area configured such that the fluid pressure (a hydraulic pressure in the present example)<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> changes. Herein, in the present example, the fluid pressure in the right area in each of <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">Figs. 5 to 7</figref> is configured to change, and the sealing device 100 plays a role in holding the fluid pressure in the sealing target area on the right in the drawing. Note that, in a condition in which an engine of an automobile is stopped, the fluid pressure in the sealing target area is low and a no-load condition is created, and when the engine is started, the fluid pressure in the sealing target area increases.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The sealing device 100 according to the present example is constituted of a seal ring 200 that is made of resin such as polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and a metal spring 300. For the metal spring 300 in the present example, a C-ring, in which a cut-out is made at one place on an annular member in a circumferential direction, is used.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In a state in which the seal ring 200 is combined with the metal spring 300, the circumference of an outer peripheral surface of the seal ring 200 is configured to be longer than the circumference of the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole of the housing 500. Note that the circumference of the outer peripheral surface of the seal ring 200 itself is configured to be shorter than the circumference of the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole of the housing 500, and thus configured to have no interference. Consequently, when the metal spring 300 is not attached and an external force is not applied, the outer peripheral surface of the seal ring 200 does not make contact with the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole of the housing 500.</p><heading id="h0013">&lt;Seal Ring&gt;</heading><p id="p0033" num="0033">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">Figs. 1 to 4</figref>, in particular, the seal ring 200 according to the first example of the present invention will be described in detail. On the seal ring 200, an abutment portion 210 is provided at one position in a circumferential direction. In addition, a plurality of concave portions 220 for introducing a fluid is formed on the outer peripheral surface of the seal ring 200 at intervals in the circumferential direction. Further, on an inner peripheral surface of the seal ring 200, protrusions 223 and 224 as guide portions which position the metal spring 300 in an axial direction (a direction<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> of a central axis of the shaft 400; the same shall apply hereinafter) are provided. The protrusions 223 and 224 are provided on a side of one of two side surfaces of the seal ring 200 and on a side of another of the two side surfaces thereof, respectively, so as to be provided on both sides of the metal spring 300. A plurality of the protrusions 223 and 224 are provided at intervals in the circumferential direction.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Note that the seal ring 200 according to the present example has the configuration in which the abutment portion 210, a plurality of the concave portions 220, and a plurality of the protrusions 223 and 224 are formed on an annular member having a rectangular cross section. However, this is only a description of the shape, and this does not necessarily mean that an annular member having the rectangular cross section is used as a material and a process to form an abutment portion 210, a plurality of concave portions 220, and a plurality of protrusions 223 and 224 is applied on this material. As a matter of course, it is also possible to form an abutment portion 210, a plurality of concave portions 220, and a plurality of protrusions 223 and 224 by applying a cutting-work after molding an annular member having a rectangular cross section. However, for example, a plurality of concave portions 220 may be formed by applying a cutting-work after a member having an abutment portion 210 and a plurality of protrusions 223 and 224 is molded in advance; hence production method is not particularly limited.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The abutment portion 210 employs so-called a special step cut in which the abutment portion 210 is cut to have a step-like shape when viewed from each of an outer peripheral surface side and both of side wall surface sides. Accordingly, in the seal ring 200, a first engagement convex portion 211 a and a first engagement concave portion 212a are provided on an outer peripheral side on one of two sides separated by a cutoff portion, and a second engagement concave portion 212b, with which the first engagement convex portion 211 a is engaged, and a second engagement convex portion 211b, with which the first engagement concave portion 212a is engaged, are provided on an outer peripheral side on another of the two sides. Since the special<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> step cut is a well-known technique, the detailed description thereof will be omitted, but it should be noted that the special step cut has a characteristic such that a stable sealing performance can be maintained even when the circumference of the seal ring 200 changes due to thermal expansion/contraction. Note that although the case of the special step cut is described as an example of the abutment portion 210 thus far, the abutment portion 210 is not limited thereto, and it is also possible to adopt a straight cut or a bias cut. Note that, in a case where a material having low elasticity (PTFE or the like) is adopted as a material for the seal ring 200, the seal ring 200 may be made endless without providing an abutment portion 210.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">A plurality of the concave portions 220 are formed at intervals in the circumferential direction. Note that, in the present example, a plurality of the concave portions 220 are provided at regular intervals except in the vicinity of the abutment portion 210. In addition, the length of the concave portion 220 in the circumferential direction is configured to be relatively long, and the length of a portion between the two concave portions 220 in the circumferential direction is configured to be shorter than the length of the concave portion 220 in the circumferential direction except in the vicinity of the abutment portion 210. Hereinafter, the portion between the two concave portions 220 is referred to as a rib 221. With the above configuration, the concave portions 220 are formed over the almost entire region in the circumferential direction. That is, the concave portions 220 are formed over the entire region in the circumferential direction except for the portion where the abutment portion 210 is formed and the portions where a plurality of the ribs 221, each having a short length in the circumferential direction, is formed. In addition, both side surfaces of the rib 221 in the present example are configured to be perpendicular to a bottom surface of the concave portion 220.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In addition, the concave portion 220 is formed so as to extend from one end portion (a high pressure side (H) as will be described later) to a position which does not reach another end portion (a low pressure side (L) as will be described later).<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> More specifically, the concave portion 220 is formed so as to extend to the position in the vicinity of the other end portion. Hereinafter, a portion on the other side (the low pressure side (L)) on the outer peripheral surface side of the seal ring 200 where the concave portion 220 is not formed is referred to as a low pressure side convex portion 222. Note that, with regard to the depth of the concave portion 220, the rigidity of the portions provided with the rib 221 and the low pressure side convex portion 222 is higher as the concave portion 220 is shallower. On the other hand, the rib 221 and the low pressure side convex portion 222 become abraded due to sliding; hence the depth of the concave portion 220 becomes shallower over time. Accordingly, when the depth of the concave portion 220 becomes excessively shallow, a fluid may not be introduced. To cope with this, it is preferable to set the initial depth of the concave portion 220 in consideration of both of the rigidity and maintaining the introduction of the fluid even when the temporal wear progresses. For example, in the case where the thickness of the seal ring 200 is 1.7 mm, the depth of the concave portion 220 is preferably set to 0.1 mm or more and 0.3 mm or less, approximately. With regard to the width of the concave portion 220 (the width in the axial direction), the width of the low pressure side convex portion 222 becomes narrower as the width of the concave portion 220 is made wider. Although a torque can be reduced more as the width is set narrower, sealing performance and durability may be degraded if the width is set excessively narrow. To cope with this, it is desirable to reduce the width as much as possible to the extent that the sealing performance and the durability can be maintained in accordance with a use environment or the like. For example, in the case where the overall length of the width of the seal ring 200 (the width in the axial direction) is 1.9 mm, the width of the low pressure side convex portion 222 is preferably set to 0.3 mm or more and 0.7 mm or less, approximately. In addition, the width of the rib 221 in the circumferential direction is preferably set to 0.3 mm or more and 0.7 mm or less, approximately.</p><heading id="h0014">&lt;Mechanism during Use of Sealing Device&gt;</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --><p id="p0038" num="0038">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">Figs. 5 to 7</figref>, in particular, the mechanism during use of the sealing device 100 according to the present example will be described.

The seal ring 200 in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 5</figref> corresponds to an AA cross section in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 3</figref>, and the seal ring 200 in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 6</figref> corresponds to a BB cross section in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 3</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 7</figref> shows a condition in which the engine is started, and the fluid pressure in the right area is increased and became higher than the fluid pressure in the left area separated by the sealing device 100. Note that <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 7</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view (a cross-sectional view including the axis of the shaft 400) of the portion provided with the concave portion 220 on the seal ring 200. The seal ring 200 in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 7</figref> corresponds to the AA cross section in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In a state in which the sealing device 100 is attached to the annular groove 410, the metal spring 300 exhibits the function of pressing the seal ring 200 towards the outer peripheral surface side by its own expansive force. Consequently, portions of the outer peripheral surface of the seal ring 200 except for the concave portions 220, namely portions provided with the rib 221 and the low pressure side convex portion 222 maintain contact with the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole of the housing 500.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In a condition in which the engine is started and the pressure difference is created, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 7</figref>, the seal ring 200 is in a state in which it is in close contact with the side wall surface on the low pressure side (L) of the annular groove 410 by the fluid pressure from the high pressure side (H). Note that it goes without saying that<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> the seal ring 200 maintains a state in which it is in contact with (it slides against) the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole of the housing 500.</p><heading id="h0015">&lt;Advantages of the Sealing Device according to the Present Example&gt;</heading><p id="p0041" num="0041">According to the sealing device 100 of the present example, the seal ring 200 is pressed towards the outer peripheral surface side by the metal spring 300. Accordingly, even in a condition in which the fluid pressure is not applied (the pressure difference is not created), or the fluid pressure is almost not applied (the pressure difference is almost not created), the seal ring 200 is in contact with the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole of the housing 500. Note that an annular continuous sealing surface is formed by the outer peripheral surface of the rib 221, the outer peripheral surface of the low pressure side convex portion 222, and the outer peripheral surface of the portion in the vicinity of the abutment portion 210 where the concave portion 220 is not formed. Accordingly, as long as the seal ring 200 maintains a state in which it is in close contact with the side wall surface on the low pressure side (L) of the annular groove 410, the sealing function is exhibited. Consequently, it is possible to hold the fluid pressure from immediately after the start of increase of the fluid pressure in the sealing target area. That is, as for an engine having an idling stop function, it is possible to hold the hydraulic pressure from immediately after the start of increase of hydraulic pressure on the sealing target area side when the engine is started by pressing an accelerator pedal from an engine stop condition.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Generally speaking, in a case of a seal ring made of resin, a function of suppressing leakage of a fluid is not exhibited so well. However, in the present example, because the seal ring 200 is pressed towards the outer peripheral surface side by the metal spring 300, the function of suppressing the leakage of the fluid is exhibited to a certain extent. Accordingly, it becomes possible to maintain the state in which the pressure difference is present for a while even after an action of a pump or the like has stopped due to the stop of the engine. Consequently, in the engine<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> having the idling stop function, in a case where a period of the engine stopping state is not too long, it is possible to maintain the state in which the pressure difference is present; hence, when the engine is re-started, it is possible to suitably hold the fluid pressure from immediately after the re-start.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In a condition in which considerable time has elapsed since the stop of the engine, the fluid pressure no longer acts (the pressure difference becomes zero). In this case, the seal ring 200 may move away from the side wall surface of the annular groove 410 (the side wall surface on the low pressure side (L) when the pressure difference is present). Accordingly, the leakage of the fluid may occur. However, as described above, in the case where the period of the engine stop state is not too long, it is possible to maintain the condition in which the pressure difference is present; hence it is possible to maintain the state in which the seal ring 200 is in close contact with the side wall surface on the low pressure side (L) of the annular groove 410. Consequently, even in a low-load condition, the function of suppressing the leakage of the fluid is exhibited.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In addition, a plurality of the concave portions 220 are formed on the outer peripheral surface of the seal ring 200, and the fluid is introduced into a plurality of the concave portions 220 from the high pressure side (H). Accordingly, even when the fluid pressure is increased, the fluid pressure acts towards the inner peripheral surface side in the region provided with the concave portions 220. Note that arrows in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 7</figref> show a state in which the fluid pressure is acting on the seal ring 200. With this, in the sealing device 100 according to the present example, it is possible to suppress the increase of the pressure towards the outer peripheral surface side by the seal ring 200 due to the increase of the fluid pressure, thereby making it possible to suppress the sliding torque.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In addition, since a plurality of the concave portions 220 are formed at intervals in the circumferential direction, the portion (the rib 221) between two concave portions 220 makes contact with the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole of the housing<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> 500. Further, by providing a plurality of the ribs 221, it is possible to suppress a degradation in the rigidity of the seal ring 200 as compared with a case where the ribs 221 are not provided. Consequently, it is possible to prevent the seal ring 200 from being tilted within the annular groove 410, and stabilize an attachment state of the seal ring 200. Note that, in a case where a configuration is adopted in which a plurality of the ribs 221 is not provided, it is anticipated that the seal ring 200 may be tilted in counter-clockwise direction in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">7</figref>.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In addition, in the present example, the concave portions 220 are formed over the entire periphery except in the vicinity of the abutment portion 210 and the portions provided with a plurality of the ribs 221 with a short length in the circumferential direction, and are formed so as to extend from the end portion on the high pressure side (H) to the vicinity of the end portion on the low pressure side (L). As described, in the present example, by providing the concave portions 220 over a large area of the outer peripheral surface of the seal ring 200, it is possible to reduce a sliding area between the seal ring 200 and the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole of the housing 500 as much as possible, thereby significantly reducing the sliding torque. Note that the sliding area between the seal ring 200 and the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole of the housing 500 is sufficiently smaller than a contact area between the seal ring 200 and the side wall surface on the low pressure side (L) of the annular groove 410. With this configuration, it is possible to prevent the seal ring 200 from sliding relative to the side wall surface on the low pressure side (L) of the annular groove 410. Consequently, in the seal ring 200 according to the present example, because it is the outer peripheral surface side that is sliding, a lubricating film made of a sealing target fluid (an oil film in the present example) is formed more easily as compared with a case where the sealing ring slides against the side wall surface of the annular groove; hence it becomes possible to further reduce the sliding torque.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">As described, since it is possible to realize the reduction of sliding torque, it becomes possible to suppress the generation of heat due to sliding; hence it becomes<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> possible to suitably use the sealing device 100 according to the present example even under high-speed and high-pressure environmental conditions.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Further, in the present example, since the metal spring 300 is provided so as to extend along the inner peripheral surface of the seal ring 200 in a state in which a gap is formed between the metal spring 300 and the groove bottom surface of the annular groove 410, the metal spring 300 is hardly influenced by eccentricity of the shaft 400 and the housing 500. In addition, the seal ring 200 and the metal spring 300 do not rotate relative to each other.

In this case, the groove 225 may be formed on the inner<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> peripheral surface of the seal ring 200 by cutting work. In a case where difficulty in cutting arises, a substantially annular groove 225 may be formed excluding the vicinity of the abutment portion. In this case, the metal spring 300, which is a C-ring, may be fitted in the groove 225 such that the cut-out formed at one place in the circumferential direction is positioned in the vicinity of the abutment portion. Note that, in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 8 and 9</figref>, the configuration other than the groove 225 is the same as the configuration described in the above example; hence the same constituent parts are designated by the same reference numerals and the description thereof is omitted.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In addition, the C-ring has been described as an example of the metal spring 300, but the metal spring 300 is not limited to the C-ring.

A sealing device 100 according to the present example is attached to an annular groove 410 provided on an outer periphery of a shaft 400, and seals an annular gap between the shaft 400 and a housing 500 (an inner peripheral surface of a shaft hole in the housing 500 through which the shaft 400 is inserted) which rotate relative to each other. With this, the sealing device 100 holds a fluid pressure in a sealing target area configured such that the fluid pressure (a hydraulic pressure in the present example) changes. Herein, in the present example, the fluid pressure in the right area in each<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> of <figref idrefs="f0009 f0010">Figs. 17 to 19</figref> is configured to change, and the sealing device 100 plays a role in holding the fluid pressure in the sealing target area on the right in the drawing.

However, this is only a description of the shape, and this does not necessarily mean that an annular member having the rectangular cross section is used as a material and a process to form an abutment portion 210, a plurality of concave portions 220, a plurality of the concave portions 220, a plurality of the guide protrusions 231 and 232 provided with the first protrusions 231 a and 232a respectively, and the pair of second protrusions 233 is applied on this material. As a matter of course, it is also possible to form an abutment portion 210, a plurality of concave portions 220, a plurality of the concave portions 220, a plurality of the guide protrusions 231 and 232 provided with the first protrusions 231a and 232a respectively, and the pair of second protrusions 233 by applying a cutting-work after molding an annular member having a rectangular cross section. However, for example, a plurality of concave portions 220 may be formed by applying a cutting-work after a member having an abutment portion 210, a plurality of the guide protrusions 231 and 232 provided with the first protrusions 231 a and 232a respectively, and the pair of second protrusions 233 is molded in advance; hence production method is not particularly limited.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The abutment portion 210 employs so-called a special step cut in which the abutment portion 210 is cut to have a step-like shape when viewed from each of an outer peripheral surface side and both of side wall surface sides. Accordingly, in the seal ring 200, a first engagement convex portion 211 a and a first engagement concave portion 212a are provided on an outer peripheral side on one of two sides separated by a cutoff portion, and a second engagement concave portion 212b, with which the first engagement convex portion 211a is engaged, and a second engagement convex<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> portion 211b, with which the first engagement concave portion 212a is engaged, are provided on an outer peripheral side on another of the two sides. Since the special step cut is a well-known technique, the detailed description thereof will be omitted, but it should be noted that the special step cut has a characteristic such that a stable sealing performance can be maintained even when the circumference of the seal ring 200 changes due to thermal expansion/contraction. Note that although the case of the special step cut is described as an example of the abutment portion 210 thus far, the abutment portion 210 is not limited thereto, and it is also possible to adopt a straight cut or a bias cut.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">A plurality of the concave portions 220 are formed at intervals in the circumferential direction. Note that, in the present example, a plurality of the concave portions 220 are provided at regular intervals except in the vicinity of the abutment portion 210. In addition, the length of the concave portion 220 in the circumferential direction is configured to be relatively long, and the length of a portion between the two concave portions 220 in the circumferential direction is configured to be shorter than the length of the concave portion 220 in the circumferential direction except in the vicinity of the abutment portion 210. Hereinafter, the portion between the two concave portions 220 is referred to as a rib 221. With the above configuration, the concave portions 220 are formed over the almost entire region in the circumferential direction. That is, the concave portions 220 are formed over the entire region in the circumferential direction except for the portion where the abutment portion 210 is formed and the portions where a plurality of the ribs 221, each having a short length in the circumferential direction, is formed. In addition, both side surfaces of the rib 221 in the present example are configured to be perpendicular to a bottom surface of the concave portion 220.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">In addition, the concave portion 220 is formed so as to extend from one end portion (a high pressure side (H) as will be described later) to a position which does not reach another end portion (a low pressure side (L) as will be described later).<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> More specifically, the concave portion 220 is formed so as to extend to the position in the vicinity of the other end portion. Hereinafter, a portion on the other side (the low pressure side (L)) on the outer peripheral surface side of the seal ring 200 where the concave portion 220 is not formed is referred to as a low pressure side convex portion 222. Note that, with regard to the depth of the concave portion 220, the rigidity of the portions provided with the rib 221 and the low pressure side convex portion 222 is higher as the concave portion 220 is shallower. On the other hand, the rib 221 and the low pressure side convex portion 222 become abraded due to sliding; hence the depth of the concave portion 220 becomes shallower over time. Accordingly, when the depth of the concave portion 220 becomes excessively shallow, a fluid may not be introduced. To cope with this, it is preferable to set the initial depth of the concave portion 220 in consideration of both of the rigidity and maintaining the introduction of the fluid even when the temporal wear progresses. For example, in the case where the thickness of the seal ring 200 is 1.7 mm, the depth of the concave portion 220 is preferably set to 0.1 mm or more and 0.3 mm or less, approximately. With regard to the width of the concave portion 220 (the width in the axial direction), the width of the low pressure side convex portion 222 becomes narrower as the width of the concave portion 220 is made wider. Although a torque can be reduced more as the width is set narrower, sealing performance and durability may be degraded if the width is set excessively narrow. To cope with this, it is desirable to reduce the width as much as possible to the extent that the sealing performance and the durability can be maintained in accordance with a use environment or the like. For example, in the case where the overall length of the width of the seal ring 200 (the width in the axial direction) is 1.9 mm, the width of the low pressure side convex portion 222 is preferably set to 0.3 mm or more and 0.7 mm or less, approximately. In addition, the width of the rib 221 in the circumferential direction is preferably set to 0.3 mm or more and 0.7 mm or less, approximately.</p><heading id="h0020">&lt;Mechanism during Use of Sealing Device&gt;</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --><p id="p0066" num="0066">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0009 f0010">Figs. 17 to 19</figref>, in particular, the mechanism during use of the sealing device 100 according to the present example will be described.

Note that an annular continuous sealing surface is formed by the outer peripheral surface of the rib 221, the outer peripheral surface of the low pressure side convex portion 222, and the outer peripheral surface of the portion in the vicinity of the abutment portion 210 where the concave portion 220 is not formed. Accordingly, as long as the seal ring 200 maintains a state in which it is in close contact with the side wall surface on the low pressure side (L) of the annular groove 410, the sealing function is exhibited. Consequently, it is possible to hold the fluid pressure from immediately after the start of increase of the fluid pressure in the sealing target area. That is, as for an engine having an idling stop function, it is possible to hold the hydraulic pressure from immediately after the start of increase of hydraulic pressure on the sealing target area side when the engine is started by releasing a brake pedal or pressing an accelerator pedal from an engine stop condition.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Generally speaking, in a case of a seal ring made of resin, a function of suppressing leakage of a fluid is not exhibited so well.

Accordingly, it becomes possible to maintain the state in which the pressure difference is present for a while even after an action of a pump or the like has stopped due to the stop of the engine. Consequently, in the engine<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> having the idling stop function, in a case where a period of the engine stopping state is not too long, it is possible to maintain the state in which the pressure difference is present; hence, when the engine is re-started, it is possible to suitably hold the fluid pressure from immediately after the re-start.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">In a condition in which considerable time has elapsed since the stop of the engine, the fluid pressure no longer acts (the pressure difference becomes zero). In this case, the seal ring 200 may move away from the side wall surface of the annular groove 410 (the side wall surface on the low pressure side (L) when the pressure difference is present). Accordingly, the leakage of the fluid may occur. However, as described above, in the case where the period of the engine stop state is not too long, it is possible to maintain the condition in which the pressure difference is present; hence it is possible to maintain the state in which the seal ring 200 is in close contact with the side wall surface on the low pressure side (L) of the annular groove 410. Consequently, even in a low-load condition, the function of suppressing the leakage of the fluid is exhibited.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">In addition, a plurality of the concave portions 220 are formed on the outer peripheral surface of the seal ring 200, and the fluid is introduced into a plurality of the concave portions 220 from the high pressure side (H). Accordingly, even when the fluid pressure is increased, the fluid pressure acts towards the inner peripheral surface side in the region provided with the concave portions 220. Note that arrows in <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 19</figref> show a state in which the fluid pressure is acting on the seal ring 200. With this, in the sealing device 100 according to the present example, it is possible to suppress the increase of the pressure towards the outer peripheral surface side by the seal ring 200 due to the increase of the fluid pressure, thereby making it possible to suppress the sliding torque.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">In addition, since a plurality of the concave portions 220 are formed at intervals in the circumferential direction, the portion (the rib 221) between two concave portions 220 makes contact with the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole of the housing<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> 500. Further, by providing a plurality of the ribs 221, it is possible to suppress a degradation in the rigidity of the seal ring 200 as compared with a case where the ribs 221 are not provided. Consequently, it is possible to prevent the seal ring 200 from being tilted within the annular groove 410, and stabilize an attachment state of the seal ring 200. Note that, in a case where a configuration is adopted in which a plurality of the ribs 221 is not provided, it is anticipated that the seal ring 200 may be tilted in counter-clockwise direction in <figref idrefs="f0009 f0010">Figs. 17 to 19</figref>.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">In addition, in the present example, the concave portions 220 are formed over the entire periphery except in the vicinity of the abutment portion 210 and the portions provided with a plurality of the ribs 221 with a short length in the circumferential direction, and are formed so as to extend from the end portion on the high pressure side (H) to the vicinity of the end portion on the low pressure side (L). As described, in the present example, by providing the concave portions 220 over a large area of the outer peripheral surface of the seal ring 200, it is possible to reduce a sliding area between the seal ring 200 and the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole of the housing 500 as much as possible, thereby significantly reducing the sliding torque.

With this configuration, it is possible to prevent the seal ring 200 from sliding relative to the side wall surface on the low pressure side (L) of the annular groove 410. Consequently, in the seal ring 200 according to the present example, because it is the outer peripheral surface side that is sliding, a lubricating film made of a sealing target fluid (an oil film in the present example) is formed more easily as compared with a case where the sealing ring slides against the side wall surface of the annular groove; hence it becomes possible to further reduce the sliding torque.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">As described, since it is possible to realize the reduction of sliding torque, it becomes possible to suppress the generation of heat due to sliding; hence it becomes<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> possible to suitably use the sealing device 100 according to the present example even under high-speed and high-pressure environmental conditions.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Further, in the present example, since the metal spring 300 is provided so as to extend along the inner peripheral surface of the seal ring 200 in a state in which a gap is formed between the metal spring 300 and the groove bottom surface of the annular groove 410, the metal spring 300 is hardly influenced by eccentricity of the shaft 400 and the housing 500. In addition, the seal ring 200 and the metal spring 300 do not rotate relative to each other.

Consequently, even under a condition in which the pressure difference becomes large, the deformation of the seal ring 200 is suppressed; hence the sealing performance can be exhibited stably.</p><heading id="h0030">REFERENCE SIGNS LIST</heading><p id="p0123" num="0123"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>100:</dt><dd>sealing device</dd><dt>200:</dt><dd>seal ring</dd><dt>210:</dt><dd>abutment portion<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --></dd><dt>211a:</dt><dd>first engagement convex portion</dd><dt>211b:</dt><dd>second engagement convex portion</dd><dt>212a:</dt><dd>first engagement concave portion</dd><dt>212b:</dt><dd>second engagement concave portion</dd><dt>220, 220a, 220b, 220c, 220d, 220e, 220f, 220g, 220h:</dt><dd>concave portion</dd><dt>221,221a,221b:</dt><dd>rib</dd><dt>222:</dt><dd>low pressure side convex portion</dd><dt>222a:</dt><dd>high pressure side convex portion</dd><dt>222b,222c, 222d:</dt><dd>convex portion</dd><dt>223,224:</dt><dd>protrusion</dd><dt>225:</dt><dd>groove</dd><dt>231, 232, 271, 272:</dt><dd>guide protrusion</dd><dt>231a, 32a, 271a, 272a:</dt><dd>first protrusion</dd><dt>233,</dt><dd>273: second protrusion</dd><dt>250:</dt><dd>convex portion</dd><dt>251:</dt><dd>rib</dd><dt>260:</dt><dd>concave portion</dd><dt>273a:</dt><dd>engagement concave portion</dd><dt>400:</dt><dd>shaft</dd><dt>410:</dt><dd>annular groove</dd><dt>500:</dt><dd>housing</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90460153" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A sealing device which is attached to an annular groove provided on an outer periphery of a shaft and holds a fluid pressure in a sealing target area by sealing an annular gap between the shaft and a housing rotating relative to each other, the sealing target area being configured such that the fluid pressure changes,<br/>
