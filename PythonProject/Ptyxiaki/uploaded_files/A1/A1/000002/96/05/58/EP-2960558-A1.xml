For example, a shaft seal device disclosed in the following PTL 1 is known as an example of the shaft seal device.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref> is a view showing the schematic structure of a shaft seal device 110 in the related art. The shaft seal device 110 includes a housing 109 that is supported by the inner peripheral surface of a stator, and a seal body 112 that is disposed in a circumferential direction in the housing 109.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The seal body 112 includes a plurality of thin-plate seal pieces 120 that are laminated with a minute gap therebetween so that the thickness direction (the direction of the plane of paper of <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref>) of each thin-plate seal piece is parallel to the circumferential direction of the rotor (rotating shaft 6). Each thin-plate seal piece 120 is obliquely disposed so that an inner end portion (tip) of each thin-plate seal piece 120 in the radial direction of the rotor is positioned on the front side of a radially outer end portion (rear end) thereof in the rotational direction of the rotor. Rear ends of the thin-plate seal pieces 120 are connected to each other through a soldering portion 24, and tips thereof become free ends.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The thin-plate seal piece 120 of the seal body 112 is a flat plate-like member that has a predetermined width in the direction of the axis of the rotor.

Further, when the rotor rotates, the tips of the thin-plate seal pieces 120 float from the outer periphery of the rotor by a dynamic pressure effect that is caused by the rotation of the rotor. Accordingly, the tips of the thin-plate seal pieces 120 do not come into contact with the rotor. For this reason, the wear of the thin-plate seal pieces 120 is suppressed in the shaft seal device 110. Accordingly, the life of the seal is lengthened.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008"><ul><li>[PTL 1] <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP3616016B"><text>Japanese Patent No. 3616016</text></patcit></li><li>[PTL 2]<patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2008509369W"><text> PCT Japanese Translation Patent Publication No. 2008-509369</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009"><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> Incidentally, when the shaft seal device 110 in the related art is applied to a position where a relative eccentricity between the rotor and the stator is large, that is, when the center of rotation of the rotor deviates from a design center of rotation, a difference occurs in the pressing force of the thin-plate seal piece 120 in the circumferential direction.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">That is, the rotor is eccentric from the stator, an interval between the rotor and the stator is locally reduced so that a large pressing force is generated, and an interval between the rotor and the stator is increased so that a pressing force becomes excessively small. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10</figref>, the stiffness of the thin-plate seal pieces 120 is increased and the floating characteristics of the thin-plate seal pieces 120 deteriorate at a position where an excessively large pressing force is generated. Therefore, there is a possibility that wear may occur. Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 11</figref>, gaps G1 and G2 are increased and leakage is increased at the position where a pressing force is excessively small.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">PTL 2 discloses a shaft seal device that suppresses the change of floating characteristics even when a rotor is eccentric since an end edge of a seal body is chamfered.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">However, since a gap between a seal body 112 and a housing 109 is not defined in the shaft seal device disclosed in PTL 2, there is a problem in that it is difficult to adjust floating characteristics.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">An object of the invention is to provide a shaft seal device that can suppress the wear of thin-plate seal pieces of the shaft seal device and suppress leakage to a low-pressure side from a high-pressure side even when a relative eccentricity between a rotor and a stator is increased.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a shaft seal device that partitions a space between a rotor and a stator into a high-pressure side and a low-pressure side. The shaft seal device includes: a seal body that includes a plurality of thin-plate seal pieces extending toward the rotor from the stator and laminated in a circumferential direction of the rotor; and a housing that is fixed to the stator and holds the seal body so as to surround the seal body from the outside in a radial direction, and includes a first facing surface facing a high-pressure-side edge of the seal body and a second facing surface facing a low-pressure-side edge of<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the seal body. A high-pressure-side clearance between the seal body and the first facing surface is set to be smaller than a low-pressure-side clearance between the seal body and the second facing surface, and a slope part, which gradually slopes to the high-pressure side toward a tip close to the rotor, is formed at the low-pressure-side edge of each thin-plate seal piece of the seal body.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to the above-mentioned structure, the floating force of the thin-plate seal piece is increased as the amount of pressing is increased. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the wear of the thin-plate seal piece.

The thickness direction of the high-pressure-side side plate 13 is parallel to the direction of the axis O, and the high-pressure-side side plate 13 has the shape of an arched band when seen in the direction of the axis O of the rotating shaft 6.

That is, since the thin-plate seal piece 20 is curved due to an increase of the pressing force of the thin-plate seal piece 20, the low-pressure-side clearance t2 becomes a distance between the inner wall of the stepped portion 23 and the slope part 20b of the thin-plate seal piece 20.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In summary, low-pressure-side clearances t1 and t2 are reduced at the position where the rotor and the stator are spaced apart from each other, and are increased at the position where the rotor and the stator are close to each other.

Meanwhile, the thin-plate seal piece 20 has a T shape in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>.

Further, when gas pressure applied to<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> the low-pressure-side region from the high-pressure-side region is applied to each thin-plate seal piece 20 and the gas pressure distribution 40a is formed as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6A</figref>, gas pressure is adjusted so that gas pressure applied to the lower surface 20q is higher than gas pressure applied to the upper surface 20p at an arbitrary position along the cross-section of each thin-plate seal piece 20.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In this case, the working fluid g, which flows to the low-pressure-side region from the high-pressure-side region, flows in from a gap between the high-pressure-side side wall 21 and the outer peripheral surface of the rotating shaft 6. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6A</figref>, the working fluid g flows between the outer peripheral surface of the rotating shaft 6 and the inner periphery-side tip of the thin-plate seal piece 20 and radially flows toward the corner r2 from the corner r1 along the upper and lower surfaces 20p and 20q of the thin-plate seal piece 20. Since the working fluid g flows as described above, a low-pressure region is widened toward an outer periphery-side base end of the thin-plate seal piece 20. For this reason, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6B</figref>, gas pressure distributions 40b and 40c of the gas pressure applied perpendicular to the upper and lower surfaces 20p and 20q of each thin-plate seal piece 20 become a triangular distribution in which gas<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> pressure is increased toward the inner periphery-side tip of the thin-plate seal piece 20 and is reduced toward the outer periphery-side base end of the thin-plate seal piece 20.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The gas pressure distributions 40b and 40c on the respective upper and lower surfaces 20p and 20q have substantially the same shape. However, since each thin-plate seal piece 20 is disposed so that an angle between each thin-plate seal piece 20 and the peripheral surface of the rotating shaft 6 becomes an acute angle, relative positions of the respective gas pressure distributions 40b and 40c on the upper and lower surfaces 20p and 20q deviate from each other. Accordingly, a difference in the gas pressure on the upper and lower surfaces 20p and 20q at an arbitrary point P from the outer periphery-side base end of the thin-plate seal piece 20 toward the inner periphery-side tip thereof is generated. That is, gas pressure applied to the lower surface 20q of the thin-plate seal piece 20 is higher than gas pressure applied to the upper surface 20p. Accordingly, a floating force FL is generated in a direction where the inner periphery-side tip of the thin-plate seal piece 20 floats from the rotating shaft 6.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057"><!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> When a pressure difference is made to be generated between the upper and lower surfaces 20p and 20q of each thin-plate seal piece 20 as described above, a floating force FL is applied to each thin-plate seal piece 20.

That is, when the rotating shaft 6 stops, the inner periphery-side tip of the thin-plate seal piece 20 comes into contact with the peripheral surface of the rotating shaft 6 with a predetermined pre-load. However, since the floating force FL is applied to the inner periphery-side tip of the thin-plate seal piece 20 when the rotating shaft 6 is rotated, the thin-plate seal piece 20 floats from the rotating shaft 6 and does not come into contact with the rotating shaft 6. As a result, a predetermined seal clearance is formed.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Here, when the low-pressure-side clearance is made to be larger than the high-pressure-side clearance, gas g, which flows to the low-pressure-side region from the high-pressure-side region through the thin-plate seal piece 20, is likely to flow and spread toward a diagonal corner along the upper and lower surfaces 20p and 20q of each thin-plate seal piece 20 during the application of<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> pressure from the high-pressure side.
