In more detail, an embodiment of the present specification relates to a method and apparatus capable of off-loading traffic by selecting an Access Network (AN) most suitable for a User Equipment (UE) in consideration of state information of the AN in a wireless communication system including a heterogeneous network.</p><heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In general, a mobile communication system has been developed to provide a voice service while guaranteeing activity of a user. However, the mobile communication system has gradually extended its field to the data providing service beyond the voice providing service and has now developed to such a level at which the mobile communication system can provide a high speed data service. However, since resources are lacking and users demand higher speed services in the mobile communication system currently providing a service, a more improved mobile communication system is needed.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">To meet the demand, standardization of Long Term Evolution (LTE) is being progressed by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as one of the next generation mobile communication systems that are being developed. The LTE is a technology of implementing high speed packet based communication with a transmission rate of up to about 100 Mbps. To this end, several methods are being discussed, including a method of reducing the number of nodes located on a communication channel by simplifying a network architecture, a method of making wireless protocols closely access a wireless channel to the maximum, and the like.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In such a mobile communication system, a UE can simultaneously use a plurality of heterogeneous networks. In this case, which kind of mobile communication system is used by<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> a user to transmit specific traffic is determined by a predetermined policy.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An operator can provide a wireless access service to users through various network configurations. For example, an operator can install a 3G/4G access network, additionally install a non-3GPP access network in an area where there are a large number of users, and rent a non-3GPP network in a partial area by concluding an agreement with another operator.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example of a network according to the related art.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, an operator Access Point (AP) 120 which is directly installed by an operator and a partner AP 130 which is installed by a partner who concludes an agreement with the operator may be located within an LTE coverage 110. At this time, costs actually required for providing a service to a user may be varied according to each access network. For example, costs of a 3G/4G service including an LTE network are most expensive due to 3G/4G frequency costs, costs of a non-3GPP network including the partner AP 130, rented from another operator, are second most expensive due to a rental expense, and costs of a non-3GPP network including the operator AP 120, installed directly by the operator itself, are cheapest. Thus, the operator should be able to control a use rate by differentially applying a priority according to each access network when selecting an access network to be used by users.</p><heading id="h0003">Disclosure of Invention</heading><heading id="h0004">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention has been conceived to solve the above-described problem, and an aspect of the present invention is to prevent a situation in which a process of reselecting an unnecessary access network occurs frequently or access to an access network having a low priority is unnecessarily maintained for a long time, when various access networks have different access priorities in a wireless communication system including a heterogeneous network.</p><heading id="h0005">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">In order to achieve the above-described aspects, in<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> accordance with an embodiment of the present specification, a method of selecting an access network in a UE of a mobile communication system is provided. The method includes: when traffic is generated in the UE, selecting an access network according to a characteristic of the generated traffic and network selection policy information; and transmitting/receiving the generated traffic to/from the selected access network.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In accordance with another embodiment of the present specification, a UE for selecting an access network in a mobile communication system is provided. The UE includes: a transmission/reception unit that transmits/receives a signal to/from a network entity including an eNB and a wireless access point; and a controller that controls the transmission/reception unit, selects an access network according to a characteristic of generated traffic and network selection policy information when the traffic is generated, and controls the UE to transmit/receive the generated traffic through the selected access network.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In accordance with another embodiment of the present specification, a network entity apparatus including an eNB or a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Access Point (AP) in a mobile communication system is provided. The network entity apparatus includes: a transmission/reception unit that transmits/receives a signal to/from a UE; and a controller that controls the transmission/reception unit, and controls the network entity apparatus to, when traffic is generated in the UE, transmit/receive data corresponding to the generated traffic, wherein the network entity is selected according to a characteristic of the traffic and network selection policy information.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present specification, a method of transmitting/receiving a signal to/from a network entity including an eNB and a WLANAP in a mobile communication system is provided. The method includes: transmitting/receiving a signal to/from a UE; and when traffic is generated in the UE, transmitting/receiving data corresponding to the generated traffic, wherein the network entity is selected according to a characteristic of the traffic and network selection policy information.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0006">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to an embodiment, in a wireless communication system including a heterogeneous network, an access priority for each user and each application is adjusted, so that the number of times of reselecting an access network of a UE is reduced and a probability that a UE unnecessarily accesses a network having a low priority or high costs for a long time is reduced.

At this time, the "RoutingRule" may have a selection condition, for example, a venue condition, a load state condition such as BSS load and WAN metric, a signal intensity condition, a prediction transmission rate condition, etc. When the selection condition is included, if a current state or configuration of the selected WLAN satisfies the selection condition, the UE can determine that traffic can be offloaded. For example, when a WLAN-2 is selected according to an embodiment of the present invention, there is traffic matched with the flow distribution rule, and in the "RoutingRule", a WLAN having an SSID of WLAN-1 has a priority of 1, 3GPP has a priority of 2, and a WLAN having an SSID of WLAN-2 has a priority of 3, the UE can transmit/receive the corresponding traffic through a 3GPP access network, and generate a PDN connection through the 3GPP access network as needed.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111"><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an operation according to a third embodiment of the present specification.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref>, in a third embodiment, data can be transmitted/received between an ANDSF 1002, a UE 1004, a 3GPP 1006, a WLAN 1008, and a WLAN 1010.</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">In more detail, the ANDSF 1002 can transmit/receive data including related policy information to/from the UE 1004.

The WLAN selection condition has a configuration in which the WLAN 1008<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> corresponds to NSWO, has a priority of 1, and can be used when a BSS load level is lower than 70, and the WLAN 1010 having an SSID of "partnerAP" corresponds to NSWO and has a priority of 2. The traffic offloading policy for "NonSeamlessOffloading" has a configuration in which, with regard to a data flow #1 (e.g. "abc.com"), a priority of 1 corresponds to "myAP" having BSS load lower than 30, a priority of 2 corresponds to "partner AP" having BSS load lower than 50, and a priority of 3 corresponds to a 3GPP 1006 access network which is not a WLAN.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">Meanwhile, with regard to a data flow #2 (e.g. "xyz.com"), a priority of 1 corresponds to "myAp" 1008, a priority of 2 corresponds to "partner AP" 1010, and a priority of 3 corresponds to an 3GPP 1006 access network. In this situation, when the UE scans a WLAN, the "myAP" 1008 and the "partnerAP" 1010 are searched for, and it can be assumed that a BSS load state of the "myAP" 1008 is 55 and a BSS load state of the "partnerAP" 1010 is 20.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">In step 1015, the UE 1004 can select and be connected to the "myAP" 1008 having a priority of 1 and satisfying a BSS load state according to a WLAN selection rule in the previously performed WLAN selection process.</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">In step 1020, the UE can detect execution of a service using "abc.com" and a service using "xyz.com".</p><p id="p0118" num="0118">Thereafter, the UE 1004 performs a traffic offloading selection process.

With regard to flow #2, an offloading condition with respect to the currently selected "myAP" 1008 having the highest priority does not exist separately, and thus, data can be transmitted/received through the "myAP" 1008, in step 1020.</p><p id="p0119" num="0119">Meanwhile, the offloading using the WLAN may be largely classified into two types according to a network configuration of an operator.</p><p id="p0120" num="0120">One kind is NSWO, and the NSWO includes a case where, since a WLAN is not connected to a core network entity (e.g. ePDG or PGW) of an operator network, traffic is directly offloaded to<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> the Internet.</p><p id="p0121" num="0121">In contrast, in a case of Seamless WLAN Offloading (SWO), since a WLAN is connected to a core network entity of an operator network, an operator intra-network service (e.g. an IMS-based service) can be used, and a session continuity in which an IP address is maintained between the 3GPP access network and the WLAN can be supported as needed.</p><p id="p0122" num="0122">When the SWO is used, there may be two kinds of network configurations specifically classified.

Thus, an operator can configure a policy for which kind of WLAN is preferentially selected, when configuring a rule for WLAN offloading with regard to a UE.</p><p id="p0124" num="0124">An ANDSF server of the operator network can transmit a policy of a type of a WLAN together with the above-described WLANSP to the UE so as to configure an operation of the UE. In the description of an embodiment of the present specification, it is exemplified that the additional information is provided as a policy called a Connection Type Policy (CTP) separately from the WLANSP. However, the subject matter of the present specification does not depend on a specific structure of the ANDSF MO, and may include a case where additional information is transmitted with another structure through a slight change. For example, information included in the CTP may be transmitted while being included as a part of the WLANSP.

Further, the rule may include a condition ("RoutingCriteria") used when whether one CTP rule is valid is determined.</p><p id="p0128" num="0128">A condition for determining validity may include an APN, a time, a location condition, and an "IPFlow" (the "IPFlow" may include information by which an IF flow can be distinguished, and the information may include one or more of a transmission/reception IP address, a port, a protocol type, an application ID, and a domain name). In an embodiment, the UE determines that the corresponding rule is valid when one or more conditions among the valid conditions are satisfied or all the valid conditions are satisfied. Further, some necessary conditions among the "RoutingCriteria" may be configured to be directly included in the CTP. For example, the CTP rule may include a valid area condition ("ValidityArea") and a value time condition ("TimeOfDay") as lower information instead of the "RoutingCriteria".</p><p id="p0129" num="0129">For example, when the APN is included as a valid condition, the UE determines that the corresponding rule is valid only when an APN of a currently generated PDN connection coincides with the APN. The CTP rule includes one or more selection rules ("SelectionRule") for selecting an actual connection type of a WLAN. The selection rule may include a preferred connection type of a WLAN and a priority value therefor. Connection types of the WLAN may include:
<ul><li>WLAN interworks with an operator core network and supports Home Routed (e.g. S2a with Home Routed)</li><li>WLAN interworks with an operator core network and supports LBO (e.g. S2a with LBO)</li><li>WLAN interworks with an operator core network (e.g. S2a with either Home Routed or LBO)</li><li>WLAN does not interwork with an operator core network (e.g.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> NSWO)</li></ul></p><p id="p0130" num="0130">The above-mentioned APN or IPFlow information may be configured by not the "RoutingCriteria" but a separate field and transmitted. Further, as a simpler form, the CTP may include only information indicating whether a WLAN connection through S2a is preferred, e.g. an S2a Connection Preference field.</p><p id="p0131" num="0131">From now, an operation of selecting a WLAN by a UE according to the present specification will be described. It can be assumed that the following two CTP rules are transferred to the UE.

When the UE has a PDN connection of which the APN is an IMS, the UE should select a rule having a rule priority of 1 according to the policy, and accordingly, should most preferentially select a WLAN connected to a core network in which the "Home Routed" is supported.</p><p id="p0133" num="0133">When the CTP is configured in a simple form as described above (i.e. the CTP includes "S2a Connection Preference", "RulePriority", "ValidityArea", and "TimeofDay"), the UE should be operated by the rule having the highest priority from among rules in which effective conditions ("ValidityArea" and "TimeofDay") are satisfied. At this time, when the "S2a Connection Preference" field of the rule is configured such that an S2a connection is preferred, the UE selects a WLAN supporting the S2a connection, or else, when selecting a WLAN, the UE needs not to consider whether the S2a connection is supported.<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --></p><p id="p0134" num="0134">When the CTP is transmitted separately from the WLANSP, the selecting of the WLAN is actually performed using the WLANSP. At this time, which type of connection is supported by one WLAN is inquired/answered using an ANQP procedure. When the UE tries to select the WLAN according to the WLANSP, if a valid WLAN is not selected, the UE should select one of WLANs supporting S2a/LBO according to the next priority. When the UE cannot also select one of the WLANs, the UE can select one of WLANs supporting the NSWO having the last priority.</p><p id="p0135" num="0135">When the UE does not have a PDN connection of which the APN is an IMS or the Internet, since the rules having the priorities of 1 and 2 are invalid, the UE should select a rule having a third priority. As in this example, information on the APN or the "IPFlow" indicating validity of the rule or a traffic condition of a user may be used as a concept of a blacklist. In this case, the UE should preferentially select a WLAN supporting the NSWO by using the WLANSP, and when it is impossible to select a WLAN, the UE should select a WLAN supporting S2a.</p><p id="p0136" num="0136">When there is no rule satisfying a valid condition, the UE may be configured to preferentially select a WLAN supporting the NSWO or preferentially select a WLAN supporting the S2a.</p><p id="p0137" num="0137">The CTP may be implemented in a simpler form.</p><p id="p0138" num="0138"><figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates an example of a CTP configuration according to an embodiment of the present specification.</p><p id="p0139" num="0139">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 13</figref>, when a CTP as in an embodiment is transferred, the UE simply configures each priority according to a connection type (one of four types described below) of a WLAN preferred by a home operator, without a valid condition.

An operation of receiving such a WLANSP by the UE can be performed similarly to the above description.</p><p id="p0145" num="0145">That is, the UE can determine a validity of a rule according to the APN (or the "IPFlow") of a currently generated PDN connection, and can preferentially select a WLAN having a connection type preferred by an operator additionally to the existing selection criterion when a WLAN is selected according to a valid rule.
