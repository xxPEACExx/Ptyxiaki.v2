According to an existing protocol standard, the establishment of a complete signalling flow is still required even though the amount of transmitted data is small, which brings high signalling overhead relative to the amount of the transmitted data during data transmission and seriously reduces system efficiency, so that it is imperative to make researches on the characteristic of the small data transmission. Present researches on small data mainly focus on how to reduce Control Plane (CP) signalling overhead brought by data transmission.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For the problem of how to reduce CP signalling overhead brought by data transmission, some solutions have been provided at present, mainly including carrying small data with CP signalling, sending the small data with a short message service, rapidly establishing a connection or the like. In consideration of differences between network and UE versions or differences in strategies of operating companies, there may exist differences in whether supporting optimized small data transmission methods or not or in supported optimized small data transmission methods between a network and UE, which may cause a failure of small data transmission between the UE and the network and even cause an abnormal condition to increase network processing complexity instead.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For the problem that an optimized small data transmission solution cannot be completely utilized and network processing complexity may even be increased due to the fact that network equipment and UE may be mismatched in small data processing capability in a related technology, there is yet no effective solution.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Summary</u></b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The embodiments of the present disclosure provide data transmission methods, devices and system, so as to at least solve the problem that an optimized small data transmission solution cannot be completely utilized and network processing complexity may even be increased due to the fact that network equipment and UE may be mismatched in small data processing capability in a related technology.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to one aspect of the embodiments of the present disclosure, a data transmission method is provided, which includes that: UE sends data processing capability information of the UE to network equipment;
