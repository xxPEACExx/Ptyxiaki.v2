a communication control method, and a radio communication apparatus.</p><heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A recent radio communication environment has been facing the problem of depletion of frequency resources due to a rapid increase in data traffic. Then, there has been an active discussion about a framework for releasing a frequency band given usage permission for a specific carrier but not used, for secondary communication. Such a frame work for the secondary communication is also called a licensed shared access (LSA). For example, European conference of postal and telecommunications administrations (CEPT) has proposed a technical requirement for devices that secondarily use a so-called "TV white space" not used for a television broadcasting (white space devices: WSDs) (see, for example, Non-Patent Literature 1 below).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Generally, transmission power of a transmitter secondarily using a frequency band is limited so as to prevent harmful interference to a receiver as a primary system. For example, in order to properly control the transmission power of the WSD, there has been proposed the installation of a geo-location database (GLDB) that provides information such as coverage, a position of a digital terrestrial television (DTT) receiver and an allowable interference level of a DTT system as a primary system (see, for example, Non-Patent Literature 1 below). Since the usage<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> permission of the frequency band is normally given for each country (or region), the GLDB would be also installed for each country (or region). The GLDB can also perform such as a calculation of a protection ratio for protecting the primary system from the interference. A method for calculating the protection ratio has been presented (see, for example, Non-Patent Literature 2 below).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It has been proposed that an advanced geo-location engine (AGLE) for using the information provided from the GLDB to maximize a system capacity of a secondary system through a more advanced calculation is installed, for example, by a country or a third party (see, for example, Non-Patent Literature 3 below). It has been determined that the approach of installing the AGLE is adopted by an office of communications (OfCom) as a frequency management body in the UK, and a database developer as a third party.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Non-Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005"><ul><li>Non-Patent Literature 1: <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>ECC (Electronic Communications Committee), "TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE POSSIBLE OPERATION OF COGNITIVE RADIO SYSTEMS IN THE 'WHITE SPACES' OF THE FREQUENCY BAND 470-790 MHz", ECC REPORT 159, January 2011</text></nplcit></li><li>Non-Patent Literature 2: <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>ECC (Electronic Communications Committee), "Complementary Report to ECC Report 159; Further definition of technical and operational requirements for the operation of white space devices in the band 470-790 MHz", ECC REPORT 185, September 2012</text></nplcit></li><li>Non-Patent Literature 3: <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Naotaka Sato (Sony Corporation), "TV WHITE SPACE AS PART OF THE FUTURE SPECTRUM LANDSCAPE FOR WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS", ETSI Workshop on Reconfigurable Radio Systems, December 12 2012, Cannes (France</text></nplcit>)</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The allocation of the frequency band in each country is normally performed for each frequency channel formed by dividing the frequency band according to any frequency division scheme. When a number is given for each frequency channel in this case, channels having the same number become the same channels having bands matched with each other, and channels having different numbers become different channels having bands not overlapped with each other. The calculation formula of the protection ratio described in Non-Patent Literature 2 is based on such assumption.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, in a case of the secondary usage around a boundary of a country or a region, a radio signal transmitted on a frequency channel permitted for the secondary usage may give the interference to the radio signal received on another frequency channel in another country. Further, these frequency channels may not be the combination of the frequency channels obtained by the division according to one division scheme. The similar problem may occur not only in the TV white space, but also, for example, in the flexible allocation of the frequency channel to a small cell when the small cell secondarily uses a frequency band protected for a macro cell. In an existing control system for transmission power, these cases are not sufficiently considered.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Therefore, it is desirable that, in a case of the interference of the radio signal between frequency channels as the combination of frequency channels that can be partially overlapped with each other, a new system capable of properly controlling power of the interference signal is realized.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the present disclosure, there is provided a communication control apparatus

frequency channels that can be partially overlapped with each other; and an interference control unit that determines overlapping on a frequency axis between the first frequency channel and the second frequency channel on the basis of the channel arrangement information, and calculates a protection ratio for protecting the second frequency channel from interference according to the determined

With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref>, there are shown five frequency channels formed by evenly dividing a frequency axis by a fixed bandwidth. In these frequency channels, a bandwidth of is W<sub>0</sub>, and center frequencies are F<sub>01</sub>, F<sub>02</sub>, F<sub>03</sub>, F<sub>04</sub> and F<sub>05</sub>, respectively. A primary system is assumed to be given usage permission for these five frequency channels, and to use only a frequency channel CH<sub>n</sub> having the center frequency F<sub>02</sub>. A desired signal indicated by the solid line in the drawing is a radio signal of the primary system. On the other hand, a frequency channel CH<sub>n+j</sub> is not used by the primary system. Therefore, the frequency channel CH<sub>n+j</sub> can be released to a secondary system for efficient usage of frequency resources. When the secondary system transmits a radio signal on the frequency channel CH<sub>n+j</sub>, the radio signal is viewed as an interference signal from a viewpoint of the primary system (the dotted line in the drawing). Therefore,<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> transmission power used by the secondary system is required to be determined so that the interference in the primary system does not exceed an allowable level. Then, Non-Patent Literature 2 has proposed that a protection ratio PR<sub>adj</sub> calculated as expressed by Formula (1) is applied to the secondary system.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">[Math. 1] <maths id="math0001" num="(1)"><math display="block"><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="italic">PR</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">adj</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="italic">PR</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">Co</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mn>10</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>log</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mfenced separators=""><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="italic">ACLR</mi><mi>j</mi></msub><mo>/</mo><mn>10</mn></mrow></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="italic">ACS</mi><mi>j</mi></msub><mo>/</mo><mn>10</mn></mrow></msup></mfenced></mrow></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="135" he="10" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In Formula (1), PR<sub>Co</sub> is a predefined protection ratio applied to transmission on a co-channel. ACLR<sub>j</sub> is an adjacent channel leakage ratio for a channel having a channel number separated by j. The ACLR<sub>j</sub> is one of transmission characteristics of a transmitter transmitting the interference signal, and represents a rate of reception power measured on a receiving side on the n-th frequency channel to transmission power on the n+j-th frequency channel. ACS<sub>j</sub> is adjacent channel selectivity for a channel having a channel number separated by j. The ACS<sub>j</sub> is one of reception characteristics of a receiver receiving the interference, and represents a rate of an attenuation amount of the interference signal on the n+j-th frequency channel to an attenuation amount of the desired signal on the n-th frequency channel.

However, many of actual transmitters and receivers do not have such ideal transmission characteristics and reception characteristics. Then, in order to make system implementation easier, the adoption of the ACLR and ACS without depending on an offset j of the channel number is also prevalent. In the example of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1B</figref>, the ACLR and ACS are constant without depending on the offset j between the frequency channel on which the desired signal is transmitted and the frequency<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> channel on which the interference signal is transmitted.</p><heading id="h0013">[1-2. Explanation of problem]</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the examples of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B</figref>, even when any two pairs are taken out from the five frequency channels, the frequency channels taken out are not overlapped with each other on the frequency axis. Therefore, it is possible to calculate the protection ratio according to Formula (1) by using the transmission characteristics and the reception characteristics measured in advance, and the offset of the channel number. However, for example, when the secondary system is operated around a national boundary, a radio signal transmitted on a frequency channel permitted for the secondary usage in a certain country may give the interference to another frequency channel specified according to a different frequency division scheme in an adjacent country. In this case, the combination of the frequency channel on an interfering side and the frequency channel on an interfered side is not identical to the combination of the frequency channels obtained by the division according to one division scheme.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is an explanatory diagram for explaining an example of a combination of frequency channels specified according to different division schemes. The frequency axis in the lower column of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is related to a first frequency division scheme RG1. The frequency axis in the upper column of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is related to a second frequency division scheme RG2. For example, the first frequency division scheme RG1 is adopted in a first country, and the frequency band is divided into four frequency channels having a bandwidth W<sub>1</sub> and center frequencies F<sub>11</sub>, F<sub>12</sub>, F<sub>13</sub> and F<sub>14</sub>, respectively. The second frequency division scheme RG2 is adopted in a second country adjacent to the first country, and the frequency band is divided into four frequency channels having a bandwidth W<sub>2</sub> and center frequencies F<sub>21</sub>, F<sub>22</sub>, F<sub>23</sub> and F<sub>24</sub>, respectively. Here, for example, when it is permitted that the secondary system uses a frequency channel CH<sub>21</sub> around a national boundary of the second country, a radio signal transmitted by the second system may give the interference to the primary system transmitted on a frequency channel CH<sub>11</sub> in the first country.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> However, in the example of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the frequency channel CH<sub>11</sub> and the frequency channel CH<sub>21</sub> are not channels fully equal to each other or fully separated from each other.

According to the embodiments described above, when the frequency channel on which the interference signal is transmitted and the frequency channel on which the desired<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> signal is transmitted can be partially overlapped with each other, the protection ratio for protecting the frequency channel on the interfered side is calculated on the basis of how these frequency channels are overlapped with each other on the frequency axis. Therefore, in a case of the interference which the existing method could not have handled, it is possible to more properly control the power of the interference signal.</p><p id="p0125" num="0125">Moreover, according to the embodiments described above, the overlapping between the frequency channels are determined from the bandwidths and center frequencies of the frequency channel on the interfering side and the frequency channel on the interfered side. Then, the weights included in the calculation formula of the protection ratio are determined according to the overlapping between the frequency channels. Therefore, the protection ratio can be flexibly changed for the various combinations of the frequency channels obtained by the division according to different frequency division schemes. For example, this makes it possible to optimize the allocation of the transmission power to the secondary system around the boundary of counties or regions having different frequency management bodies. Further, in such a radio communication environment that the macro cell and the small cell concurrently exist, this makes it possible to flexibly allocate the frequency channel to the small cell while properly protecting the macro cell.</p><p id="p0126" num="0126">Furthermore, according to the embodiments described above, the protection ratio includes the component corresponding to the interference of the co-channel, the component corresponding to the transmission characteristics of the apparatus transmitting the interference signal, and the component corresponding to the reception characteristics of the apparatus receiving the desired signal, and the weights among these components are adjusted according to the overlapping between the frequency channels. For example, in the calculation of the protection ratio, when the bandwidth on the interfering side is dominant, such adjustment that the transmission characteristics on the interfering side more contributes can be made, or when the bandwidth on the interfered side is dominant, such adjustment that the<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --> reception characteristics on the interfered side more contributes can be made. Therefore, in various scenarios such as the secondary usage of the TV white space, the heterogeneous network, the infrastructure sharing, and the coexistence with the MNO and the MVNNO, it is possible to reflect the characteristics of the device and the arrangement of the channels involved in each scenario to the calculation of the protection ratio.</p><p id="p0127" num="0127">Furthermore, according to the embodiments described above, when the plurality of interference signals exist, the aggregate protection ratio can be calculated from the individual protection ratio calculated for each of the plurality of interference signals. Therefore, the technology according to the present disclosure can be also applied to a case where the relationship between the interfering side and the interfered side is not in a one-to-one state. Further, the technology according to the present disclosure can be also applied to a case where the frequency hopping technology is used.</p><p id="p0128" num="0128">Furthermore, according to the embodiments described above, the interference margin determined depending on how many of or which of the databases manages the frequency channel considered in the calculation of the protection ratio is reckoned into the calculation of the protection ratio. Therefore, for example, while the harmful interference is securely avoided by increasing the interference margin in such a region that the management region by the frequency management body is complicated, the capacity of the secondary system can be positively enhanced by suppressing the interference margin in a region other than such a region.</p><p id="p0129" num="0129">Note that the series of control processing by the respective apparatuses described herein may be implemented by using any of software, hardware, and a combination of software and hardware. Programs constituting the software are previously stored in, for example, storage media (non-transitory media) provided in the inside or the outside of the respective apparatuses. And the respective programs are, for example, read into a random access memory (RAM) during execution and<!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --> executed by the processor such as the CPU.</p><p id="p0130" num="0130">The preferred embodiments of the present disclosure have been described above with reference to the accompanying drawings, whilst the present invention is not limited to the above examples, of course.
