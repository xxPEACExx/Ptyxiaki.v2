Power supplies convert the available AC voltage into a DC low voltage adapted to power LED diodes.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">These power supplies have a primary side with input terminals connected to the electric mains and a secondary side with a bifilar output line for connecting the LED diodes. For safety reasons, the output line is isolated from the terminals connected to the electric mains.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The possibility of regulating the luminous intensity emitted from the LED lamp is typically contemplated by providing an additional regulation line connected to a button for turning on/off the LED lamps by pushing the button for a short time, and for varying their luminous intensity by pushing the button for a prolonged time. Numerous control algorithms are known for establishing how and how much the luminous intensity of the lamp must vary in function of the time duration in which the button is pushed. This control technique based on using a button or a monostable switch is well known to the skilled person with the expression "Push Button Dimming" or also "Push Button Control".</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An example of application of this technique is depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>. The power supply 2 has input terminals 1 connected to the AC mains and provides on its output terminals 5 a DC voltage or current adapted to supply the LED lamps 4. In order to regulate the luminous intensity emitted by the LED lamps, the power supply 2, that may also be for example a buck regulator, has an input 6 connected to a switch (button) 3, through which the LED lamps are turned on/off and regulated according to the so called "Push Button Dimming" technique. The luminous intensity of the LED lamp 4 is regulated by modulating the output (voltage or current) of the power supply 2 between two levels ON<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">(turned on) and OFF (turned off) in PWM mode, as schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 2</figref>: Toff and Ton being respectively the intervals in which the LED lamp is respectively off and on. Eyes of observers see a mean luminous intensity proportional to the duty cycle D=Ton/T of the PWM signal and if its frequency f=1/T is sufficiently high, for example is 200Hz, human eye does not see a pulsed light, because of the phenomenon of persistence of vision.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">This solution has numerous drawbacks. The power supply has a line and additional connection terminals for regulating and, in case of large plants in which more regulation points that may be handled by users are requested, it is necessary to install, aside the low voltage output line that supplies the LED lamps, an additional line with a terminal at the mains voltage, thus at a potentially dangerous voltage.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In literature LED lamps with intelligent buttons equipped with a microprocessor with a remote powering modulator are known, wherein pushing the "intelligent" button implies the emission of an encoded digital command received by the microprocessor available in each single lamp with LED diodes. A drawback of this solution is its relatively high cost that makes it hardly usable in most widespread applications.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">An objective of the present disclosure is to provide a method of regulating and a related device that overcome the above mentioned drawbacks.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">This objective is attained with a method of regulating in switching mode as defined in claim 1, that contemplates the installation, between the output terminals of a power supply, of an electric bipole having a monostable switch normally in an opened position connected in series with a resistive element or with a diode. According to an embodiment, the switching duty-cycle is determined by a control signal generated so as to correspond to at least a voltage value available between the output terminals of the power supply sensed during a present and/or previous off time interval.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to an embodiment, the method comprises the steps of:

By pushing a button it is possible to regulate the luminous intensity according to the Push Button Dimming technique. The method is applicable to voltage<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> stabilized power supplies as well as current stabilized power supplies.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">By summarizing, the supplied voltage/current delivered at the output of the power supply is sensed during off time intervals of the switching cycles and the switching duty-cycle is updated in function of the values sensed during a present and/or previous off time interval.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> depicts an exemplary embodiment according to the present disclosure of a device for regulating in switching mode the luminous intensity of at least a solid state lamp, wherein the regulation device includes an AC/DC converter, so as for example a buck or flyback converter.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The power supply for LED lamps (20) has terminals (10) for the connection to electric mains and an output line (50) to which at least a LED lamp (90) is connected and at least a regulation button (70) with a series resistor (80).</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The block POWER SUPPLY (30) is a switching mode power supply that delivers at its main output an ON-OFF voltage or a current modulated in a PWM mode by a control circuit CONTROL UNIT through a signal applied to an inner control line (40).</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">There are various methods known to the skilled persons for ON-OFF modulating the output of a power supply, for example by connecting a switch, for example a MOSFET, in series with the output, by applying the signal available at the inner control line to the MOSFET gate. In the case in which the power supply is current-regulated, numerous integrated circuits, well known to skilled persons, have been developed for driving the LED in a constant current mode, equipped with a control line for modulating ON-OFF the output current, thus they will not be illustrated in detail.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The switching power supply POWER SUPPLY (30) delivers preferably also an auxiliary voltage Vaux having a value smaller than a minimum value required for turning on the LEDs. This voltage, through a bias network (110) is applied to the output line (50) so as to ensure the presence of a voltage difference at the output terminals 50 also when the lamp 90 must be kept off. The bias network (110), conveniently, may contain a resistor, for limiting the delivered current, connected in series with a diode that is reverse-biased when the switching converter generates on the output terminals 50 a voltage adapted to turn on the lamp.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to an innovative aspect, there is at least an electric bipole, electrically<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> connected in parallel between the output terminals, having a monostable switch (button) normally in an open position connected in series with a resistive element 80 or with a diode (not shown in the figure). By pushing the button (70) a resistor (80) is connected in parallel with the output line (50). The resistor (80) conveniently may have a resistance determined so as to not absorb an excessive power from the output line during the on time interval Ton of the PWM cycle, though absorbing a power adapted to cause during the off time interval Toff of the PWM cycle a detectable variation of the voltage provided to the output line of the bias network (110). An appropriate resistance may be for example a resistance that cause a power absorption from the output line of 0.5W during the on time interval Ton and that, cooperating with other electronic components, causes during the off time interval Toff a drop of the bias voltage available at the output line (50) greater than 50%.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The control circuit CONTROL UNIT (100) applies to the inner control line (40) a control signal for varying the duty-cycle D of the switching cycles according to a requested light level. By means of a resistive voltage divider (120) connected between the output terminals 50, it monitors the voltage available at the output line (50) during an off time interval Toff, and recognizes whether the button (70) has been pushed by a user.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref> is an exemplary time graph that illustrates the voltage (Vbus) available at the output terminals 50 of the device of <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">During the interval "TIME 1" in which the button 70 is not pushed and thus the resistor 80 is isolated, the voltage at the terminals 50 is switched between two levels Von and Vpol. During the on time Ton, the LEDs are turned on and the voltage Vbus is at the value Von; during the off time interval Toff the LEDs are off and at the output there is the voltage Vpol applied by the bias network, a voltage that is smaller than the voltage for turning on the LEDs.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">During the interval "TIME 2" at least a button connected between the output terminals 50 is pushed, thus the resistor 80 is inserted in a current path between the output terminals 50. As a consequence, the voltage available at the output terminals decreases down to the value Vpsh during off time intervals, thus allowing the control circuit to determine that a button 70 has been pushed by reading the voltage available at the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> output line during the off time interval Toff.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">By counting the number of consecutive PWM cycles during which the button is kept pushed, it is possible to discriminate between a short pushing and a prolonged pushing of the button, and this information is usable in standard control algorithms, that are well known to the skilled persons in the art, for implementing the Push Button Dimming control technique.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">An alternative solution applicable for detecting a pushed button, consists in the use of a bias voltage having reversed polarity in respect to the polarity applied at the output during the on time interval Ton and in the use of a diode instead of the resistor placed in series to the button, by connecting the diode so as pushing the button does not short the output throughout the diode thus turning off the LEDs during the on time interval Ton. Another embodiment of a switching regulation device according to the present disclosure, applied to the case of a power supply delivering an output voltage, is shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The regulation device comprises a power supply POWER CONVERTER equipped with a pair of input terminals (219, 220) for connection with electric mains and output terminals (217, 218) for connecting the LED lamps (211, 212) as well as one or more command buttons (210, 214) in series with respective series resistors (209, 214). The regulation device includes in this case all the components comprised between the input terminals (219, 220) and the output terminals (217, 218). The power supply, that may be an AC/DC converter (200) draws a power from the electric mains connected to the input terminals (219, 220) and delivers at the inner output terminals OUT+ (215) and OUT-(216) a DC voltage, typically of +24V. Preferably, the AC/DC converter delivers also at an inner auxiliary line (217) a voltage of +5V referred to the output terminal at the lowest potential (216), used as a reference terminal at a null potential.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">A MOSFET (205), used to operate as a switch, allows to ON-OFF modulate in a PWM mode the LED lamps connected to the output terminals (217, 218) by varying their luminous intensity. A microprocessor (206), preferably powered throughout the inner auxiliary line at 5V (217), generates a PWM control signal applied to the gate of the MOSFET (222) used for modulating the LED lamps.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">A circuit for sensing the voltage available between the output terminals is, in this case, a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> voltage divider composed of resistors (203, 204), that during the off time interval Toff, without any button being pushed, biases the line connected to the output terminals (217, 218) with a voltage difference insufficient to turn on the LEDs, for example about 6V, but sufficient to bias a PNP transistor (201) so as to keep it on. With these values, the collector of the PNP transistor is at a voltage of +24V, thus the voltage divider composed of the resistors 207 and 208 provides a signal at a logic level 1 to the input terminal (221) of the microprocessor 206.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">By pushing for example the button 210, the resistor 219 is inserted in parallel with the output terminals (217, 218), with the effect of reducing, during the off time interval Toff, the value of the voltage difference available at the output terminals (217, 219) down to a value of about 0.5V, that is a value insufficient to bias the PNP transistor (215). As a consequence, the voltage available at the collector of the PNP transistor nullifies, thus the voltage divider composed of the resistors 207 and 208 provides a signal at a logic level 0 at the input 221 of the microprocessor 206, thus allowing the microprocessor to recognize the fact that a button has been pushed simply by controlling the logic level available at its input 221 during the off time interval Toff.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">A resistor (202) connected between the base and the emitter of the PNP transistor (201) allows to better define the minimum voltage value required for biasing the transistor. By sensing the commands sent by a user by pushing the button, the microprocessor varies the duty-cycle of the PWM control signal applied to the gate of the MOSFET 205, turning on/off, regulating the luminous intensity of the LED diodes, in accordance to what is required by the Push Button Dimming technique.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The fact that the same microprocessor (206) generates the PWM control signal and monitors the signal available at the terminal (221), destined to detect the pushing of the button during the off time interval Toff, makes this operation particularly simple, because no complex external synchronization signals are required.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Certain components, the use of which is immediately evident for the skilled persons, such as for example filter capacitors, have not been shown because they are inessential for the comprehension of the functioning.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In an embodiment, the maximum duty-cycle is Dmax=94%, the frequency of the PWM modulating wave is 200Hz, the resistors 209, 213 have a value of 1.2kOhm.
