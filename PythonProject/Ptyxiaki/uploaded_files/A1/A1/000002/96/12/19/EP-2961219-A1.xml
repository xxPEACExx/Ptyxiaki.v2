In such an area where two or more cells overlap, interference may occur between radio waves from respective ones of the corresponding base stations. If such radio wave interference occurs, it results in deterioration in the quality of received signals, for example, SINR (Signal to Interference and Noise power Ratio). Accordingly, the certain base station comes to have no choice but to change the modulation method from that for high speed communication to that for medium to low speed communication. Therefore, a wireless communication system including a plurality of base stations has a problem in that the communication throughput may be reduced when a wireless terminal is present near a cell edge.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In this respect, in wireless communication systems such as of LTE-Advanced and WiMAX 2 (WiMAX is a trademark or registered trademark of the WiMAX Forum), "multi-base-station cooperative transmission technology" (may be referred to also as a distributed<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> downlink coordinated multipoint framework or as coordinated multipoint transmission and reception) including such as a multi-base-station cooperative MIMO (Patent Literature 1) and a CoMP has been proposed. In the multi-base-station cooperative transmission technology, the same data is sent at the same timing from a plurality of base stations (the serving base station and its one or more neighboring base stations). A transmit diversity is thereby realized, and accordingly, the downlink throughput at the cell edges is improved.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the above description, LTE is the abbreviation of Long Term Evolution. WiMAX is the abbreviation of Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access. MIMO is the abbreviation of Multiple Input Multiple Output. CoMP is the abbreviation of Coordinated Multiple Point.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent Literature 2 describes a base station which continuously manages the status of load such as the number of mobile terminals connected at each frequency. If a load condition is satisfied for one frequency and not satisfied for another frequency, the base station of Patent Literature 2 performs handover on the initiative of the base station, for load distribution.</p><heading id="h0003">[Citation List]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Patent Literature]</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006"><ul><li>[Patent Literature 1] <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2010537520W"><text>Japanese translation of PCT international application No. 2010-537520</text></patcit> (pages 9 and 12 to 13)</li><li>[Patent Literature 2] <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2012015838A"><text>Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2012-015838</text></patcit> (pages 6 and 7)</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">[Summary of Invention]</heading><heading id="h0006">[Technical Problem]</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><p id="p0007" num="0007">If the multi-base-station cooperative transmission is performed, the difference in quality of downlink signals (for example, SINR or CINR) becomes almost zero between the base stations (the serving base station and its neighboring base station), and accordingly, there is generated a situation where handover is hardly performed. In the above description, CINR is the abbreviation of Carrier to Interference and Noise Ratio.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">As a result, even when the environment has become one where uplink signals reach to the neighboring base station in better condition than to the serving base station, if the multi-base-station cooperative transmission is in execution at that time, it is possible that handover from the serving base station to the neighboring base station is not performed, as described above. The uplink signals' reaching in better condition makes it possible to expect improvement in the uplink throughput and reduction in power consumption of a wireless terminal. However, as a result of that handover comes to be hardly performed, it becomes likely that the above-described effects, which intrinsically are to be achieved, become unable to be achieved.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Patent Literature 2 describes handover.

Accordingly, the condition for executing handover is that at least either of the first and second conditions is satisfied, as described above. When checks on satisfaction of respective ones of the two conditions are performed one after the other, there is no particular restriction on the order of the checks on condition satisfaction. Further, when condition satisfaction has been confirmed in one of the checks performed first, it does not raise any problem even if the next check on satisfaction of the other condition is not performed.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">If at least either of the first and second conditions is satisfied (if determined YES in a step S4 / if the "precondition" is broken), the control unit 36 performs handover from the first base station 12 to the second base station 14 (step S5).

That is, the control unit 36 keeps setting the base station to serve the wireless terminal 16 to be the first base station 12.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As has been described above, in the present exemplary embodiment, in the environment where the first base station 12 and the second base station 14 perform down link transmission in a manner of multi-base-station cooperative transmission, if the environment becomes one where uplink signals reach in a better condition to the second base station 14 (neighboring base station) than to the first base station 12 (current serving base station), handover from the current serving base station to the neighboring base station is certainly performed. As a result, it becomes possible to perform uplink transmission to a base station to which signals reach in a better condition.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Accordingly, the level of uplink RSSI becomes higher even if the transmission power is kept the same as that before the handover, and consequently, it becomes possible to increase the upper limit value of uplink SINR.

In other words, according to the present exemplary embodiment, it becomes possible to solve the demerit of multi-base-station cooperative transmission (decrease in the uplink throughput or increase in power consumption of the wireless terminal 16), while maintaining the merit of multi-base-station cooperative transmission (improvement in the downlink throughput at a cell edge).</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">By the way, it infrequently occurs that values of the transmission powers Pt_A and Pt_B are different from the values of powers actually transmitted by the respective base stations. Further, by the influence of a wireless propagation environment, it may infrequently occur that a phenomenon where the downlink signal strength (RSSI) becomes higher for a more distant base station than for a less distant base station. Therefore, in order to eliminate more surely the influence of phenomena which infrequently occur, such as described above, it is preferable to determine the condition for executing handover to be "if both of the first and second conditions are satisfied".</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">When the handover has been executed, and accordingly, the serving base station has been changed (that is, when the second base station 14 has become the current serving base station, and the first base station 12 has become a neighboring base station), the first and second conditions after the handover correspond to the inverse ones of the respective ones before the handover. Specifically, in the case of the present exemplary embodiment, the first and second conditions after the handover become, respectively, "path loss PL_A &lt; path loss PL_B" and "distance Dis_A &lt; distance Dis_B".</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, the illustration is given for the operation in the case of<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> performing handover only once, in order to make the description clearer. However, it is obvious that handover may be performed repeatedly.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In the case of performing handover repeatedly, when determination of the next handover is performed in a state where only either of the first and second conditions has already been satisfied (that is, when the process shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> is executed again), the precondition has become different from that at the time of the ordinary determination of handover (the first handover in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>). In contrast to that the ordinary precondition is "in both path loss and distance, the serving base station is smaller than the neighboring base station", the precondition after the first handover has been performed in the above-mentioned state becomes "in either path loss or distance, the neighboring base station is smaller than the serving base station". Accordingly, when the process shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> is performed under the latter precondition, the next handover is immediately executed because the condition for handover that either of the first and second conditions is satisfied has already been satisfied by the precondition. That is, it is likely that a so-called "ping-pong phenomenon", where handovers are continually executed, occurs.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In order to avoid the above-described ping-pong phenomenon, the procedure may be modified to be one which makes the next determination of handover (that is, the process shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>) wait for a certain time period (for example, 10 seconds) since execution of the preceding handover until the precondition again becomes "in both path loss and distance, the serving base station is smaller than the neighboring base station".</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Alternatively, the procedure may be modified to be one where the<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> number of handovers between specific base stations per unit time is counted, and if the count value has exceeded a predetermined threshold value (for example, three), the next determination of handover (that is, the process shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>) is made to wait for a certain time period (for example, 10 seconds).</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The exemplary embodiment described above is not limited to an "integrated type base station device (a device comprising a baseband function unit and a transmission amplifier function unit)" such as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, but can be applied also to a "separated type base station device (a device consisting of a baseband function unit BBU and an amplifier function unit RRH which are separated from each other)" such as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>, for example.

For example, when the number of base stations to perform multi-base-station cooperative transmission is "3", one of them is the serving base station, and the number of neighboring base stations (candidate base stations for handover) is two. In that case, a more preferable neighboring base station may be selected between the two. Specifically, the path loss between the wireless terminal 16 and a third base station corresponding to the second neighboring base station is defined as PL_C, and the distance between the wireless terminal 16 and the third base station is defined as Dis_C. Then, for example, if a condition "PL_A &gt; PL_B &gt; PL_C" is satisfied, the wireless terminal 16 is handed over from the first base station 12, which is the current serving station, to<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> the third base station.
