However, because the conventional art has an error range of about several meters when measuring a location of a mobile terminal, the conventional art has a drawback that accurate positioning to<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> distinguish a location of each terminal located at a near distance is impossible. Therefore, conventional positioning technology has a problem that cannot provide a service in which a user of a mobile terminal specifies a random terminal located within several meters and transmits a message to a user of the specified terminal.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Detailed Description of Invention</u></b></heading><heading id="h0004"><b><u>Technical Problem</u></b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">A technical object of disclosed technology is to provide a method in which a mobile terminal specifies any one of random terminals located at a near distance by interlocking with a detection server. According to an exemplary embodiment of disclosed technology, as a user of a mobile terminal disposes the mobile terminal with a pose similar to that of a terminal (hereinafter, a synchronized terminal) in which the user of the mobile terminal is to specify among peripheral terminals, a detection server detects a synchronized terminal having a pose similar to that of the mobile terminal. When one of peripheral terminals located at a near distance is specified, the user may provide various services such as transmission of a message to the specified synchronized terminal or transmission of a coupon or a product coupon (e.g., giftcon). Disclosed technology has a characteristic in which a mobile terminal can recognize a synchronized terminal by independently taking a pose similar to the synchronized terminal to specify, unlike technology in which a mobile terminal and the synchronized terminal recognize each other, as both the mobile terminal and the synchronized terminal simultaneously perform a previously promised specific operation. That is, according to disclosed technology, in order for a mobile terminal to recognize a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> synchronized terminal, because the mobile terminal does not require an intentional action of the synchronized terminal, the mobile terminal may independently recognize a terminal of an unknowing person.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For example, conventionally, when a user finds the favorite opposite sex at a periphery and wishes to transmit a text message, there is a problem that the user cannot specify a terminal without participation of the corresponding opposite sex. Further, existing positioning technology has a limitation of deteriorated accuracy in specifying any one of terminals located at a near distance. However, according to disclosed technology, as the user disposes a mobile terminal similarly to a terminal of the favorite opposite sex, the user may specify a terminal of the corresponding opposite sex (i.e., a synchronized terminal) and transmit a text message to the corresponding opposite sex.</p><heading id="h0005"><b><u>Technical Solution</u></b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, a method of detecting a synchronized terminal having a pose similar to that of reference pose data (the pose data includes at least one of a location direction and an inclined level) includes: receiving, by a detection server, reference pose data from a mobile terminal that requests detection of a synchronized terminal; receiving, by the detection server, location data to be a reference that detects the synchronized terminal; receiving, by the detection server, pose data of peripheral terminals from each of the peripheral terminals existing within a predetermined radius from a reference location determined based on the location data; detecting, by the detection server, a terminal having pose data similar to the reference pose data among the peripheral terminals as a synchronized terminal; and transmitting,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> by the detection server, a detection result of the synchronized terminal to the mobile terminal.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, a method in which a mobile terminal detects a synchronized terminal having a pose similar to that of the mobile terminal includes: collecting, by the mobile terminal, pose data including at least one of a location direction and an inclined level of the mobile terminal; transmitting, by the mobile terminal, the pose data to a detection server; and receiving, by the mobile terminal, a detection result of a synchronized terminal having pose data similar to the pose data within a predetermined radius from a reference location from the detection server.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In accordance with a third aspect of the present invention, a method of detecting a synchronized terminal having a pose similar to reference pose data (the pose data includes at least one of a location direction and an inclined level) includes: receiving, by the synchronized terminal, a request for pose data from a detection server; collecting, by the synchronized terminal, the pose data including at least one of a location direction and an inclined level of the synchronized terminal; and transmitting the pose data to the detection server.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In accordance with a fourth aspect of the present invention, a method in which a first terminal transmits a message to a second terminal located at a periphery includes: photographing an image including the second terminal; and transmitting a message to a terminal having pose data similar to pose data including at least one of a location direction and an inclined level of the second terminal calculated based on the image.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In accordance with a fifth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> computer readable recording medium on which a program for executing the method is recorded.</p><heading id="h0006"><b><u>Advantageous effects</u></b></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">Exemplary embodiments of disclosed technology may have an effect including the following merits.

A mobile terminal 110 of a user may detect a synchronized terminal 124 having the same pose as that of the mobile terminal 110 among peripheral terminals 122, 124, and 126 located within a constant radius from a reference location, for example, a location thereof. <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a process in which the mobile terminal 110 detects the synchronized terminal 124 and transmit a message to the synchronized terminal 124 according to disclosed technology. The mobile terminal 110 and the peripheral terminals 122, 124, and 126 may give and receive data by wireless based on a mobile communication network, a wireless Local Area Network (LAN), or a personal area network (Bluetooth, etc.), but it is not limited thereto and may use any communication method. A process in which a user finds the favorite opposite sex and transmit a message to the corresponding opposite sex will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A user, having found the favorite opposite sex disposes a mobile terminal with the same pose as that of a terminal of the corresponding opposite sex, i.e., the synchronized terminal 124 to detect (S200). Here, a pose is a direction toward a terminal or an inclined angle of a terminal, but it is not limited thereto. For example, a pose may further include movement information of a terminal and sequence information in which a direction or angle of a terminal changes. The mobile terminal 110 disposed with a predetermined pose collects pose data thereof (S205). For example, the mobile terminal 110 may collect a direction, an inclined level, a rotation angle, and movement information thereof from a terrestrial magnetic sensor, an acceleration sensor, and a<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> gyroscope sensor. The mobile terminal 110, having collected pose data transmits pose data to the detection server 200 (S210). In addition, according to an implementation, the mobile terminal 110 may transmit location information for determining a reference location to the detection server 200. The detection server 200, having received pose data and location data detects peripheral terminals 122, 124, and 126 existing within a predetermined radius from a reference location based on the pose data and the location data (S220). In this case, terminals 122, 124, 126, 132, 134, and 136 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> are terminals previously subscribed to a service according to the present exemplary embodiment and are terminals in which providing of pose data and location data and message reception is allowed by the user. The detection server 200 transmits a signal that requests pose data to the detected peripheral terminals 122, 124, and 126 (S225). The peripheral terminals 122, 124, and 126 each collect pose data according to a request (S230) and transmit the collected pose data to the detection server 200 (S235). The detection server compares the received pose data and detects the synchronized terminal 124 having a pose similar to that of the mobile terminal 110 among the peripheral terminals 122, 124, and 126. When the mobile terminal 110 receives a detection result of the synchronized terminal 124 from the detection server 200 (S245), the mobile terminal 110 may transmit a message to the synchronized terminal 124 (S250, S255). The message may be, for example, a text message that expresses a user mind and a profile information message of a user. The user profile may include general information of the user, such as a picture, an age, or a job of the user, or information, in which a user of the synchronized terminal 124 can visually determine, such as presently wearing clothing and a hair style. The user profile may enable the user of the synchronized terminal 124 to determine who is the user of the mobile terminal 110. According to an exemplary embodiment, in order for the user of the synchronized<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> terminal 124 to easily determine the user of the mobile terminal 110, having transmitted a message, the mobile terminal 110 may transmit additional information such as a location direction and distance thereof. For example, the user of the mobile terminal 110 may dispose the mobile terminal 110 toward the synchronized terminal 124 (S260) and may transmit direction information of the mobile terminal 110 to the synchronized terminal 124 (S265, S270). Further, the user of the mobile terminal 110 may input a distance between the mobile terminal 110 and the synchronized terminal 124 and transmit the distance to the synchronized terminal 124. The synchronized terminal 124 may determine a direction or a distance in which the mobile terminal 110 is located based on received information and notify the user of the synchronized terminal 124 of the direction or the distance (S280). <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram illustrating a method in which a synchronized terminal notifies a location of a mobile terminal through a screen. For example, the synchronized terminal 124 may display a direction of the mobile terminal 110 on a screen based on a location direction of the synchronized terminal 124, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref>. For another example, while moving the synchronized terminal 124, when a direction of the synchronized terminal 124 corresponds with a direction of the mobile terminal 110, the synchronized terminal 124 may generate alarm (sound, vibration, and flicker). For another example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 3B</figref>, a camera mounted in the synchronized terminal may photograph an image, augment an object (e.g., a heart shape) representing a location of the mobile terminal 110 in the photographed image, and output the object on the screen. According to another exemplary embodiment, when the user of the synchronized terminal 124 selects a received message, the synchronized terminal 124 may send a signal to the corresponding mobile terminal 110 and enable the mobile terminal 110 to vibrate or enable an LED lamp or a screen of the mobile terminal 124 to flicker. The user of the synchronized terminal 124 may search<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> for a terminal in which a vibration occurs or in which an LED lamp or a screen flickers at a periphery and determine the user of the mobile terminal 110. As in the foregoing exemplary embodiments, when the user of the mobile terminal 110, having transmitted a message is determined, the user of the synchronized terminal 124 may accept or reject a message according to a user of the determined mobile terminal 110.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Hereinafter, a process of detecting a synchronized terminal will be described in detail with reference to a flowchart of <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006 f0007">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method in which a detection server detects a synchronized terminal having a pose similar to that of a mobile terminal according to an exemplary embodiment of disclosed technology.

The detection server 200 receives location data to be a reference to detect the synchronized terminal 124 (S420). For example, when a location to be a reference is a location of the mobile terminal 110, the detection server 200 may receive location data of the mobile terminal 110 from the mobile terminal 110 or a base station of a wireless network to which the mobile terminal 110 belongs. For another example, the mobile terminal 110 may designate a predetermined location to a reference location and transmit location data to a detection server. The predetermined location may be, for example, a location at which a specific actor is located in a program presently broadcasting with a television. The detection server 200 detects peripheral terminals<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> 122, 124, and 126 existing within a predetermined radius from a reference location determined based on the received location data (S430). For example, a predetermined radius may be set to 3 meters, 5 meters, or 10 meters and be determined with a distance input by a user, and a predetermined radius be adjusted according to a detection result. Terminals 122, 124, 126, 132, 134, and 136 are terminals previously subscribed to a service in which the detection server 200 provides and periodically provide location data thereof to the detection server 200. The detection server 200 requests pose data to the detected peripheral terminals 122, 124, and 126, and the peripheral terminals 122, 124, and 126 each collect pose data thereof and transmit the pose data to the detection server 200 (S440).</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The detection server 200 detects a terminal having pose data similar to that of the mobile terminal 110 among the peripheral terminals 122, 124, and 126 as a synchronized terminal (S450). According to an exemplary embodiment, the detection server 200 compares a pose data value of the mobile terminal 110 or a symmetry value of pose data with a pose data value of the peripheral terminals 122, 124, and 126, and if a difference thereof is smaller than a threshold value, the detection server 200 may detect the peripheral terminal as the synchronized terminal 124. That is, the detection server 200 may detect a terminal having pose data that belongs within a threshold range from a pose data value of the mobile terminal 110 or a symmetry value of pose data as a synchronized terminal. In this case, by comparing also with a symmetry value of pose data, the detection server 200 determines whether a pose of the mobile terminal 110 and the synchronized terminal 124 is similar to a pose including a case in which the right side, the left side, the upper side, the lower side, the front, and the rear of the mobile terminal 110 and the synchronized terminal 124 are inverted (when seen from the front, when it is difficult to divide the upper side, the lower side, the front, and the rear) as<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> well as a case in which the right side, the left side, the upper side, the lower side, the front, and the rear of the mobile terminal 110 and the synchronized terminal 124 are the same.

The detection server 200 transmits a detection result of the synchronized terminal 124 to the mobile terminal 110 (S460). According to an exemplary embodiment, when a plurality of synchronized terminals may be detected, the detection server 200 may determine whether a plurality of synchronized terminals are detected (S470). For example, if a plurality of synchronized terminals are detected, the detection server 200 may repeat step S410 of receiving pose data of the mobile terminal 110, step S440 of receiving pose data of a peripheral terminal, and step S450 of detecting as a synchronized terminal until the detection server 200 detects any one synchronized terminal of a plurality of synchronized terminals. The detection server 200 may repeat steps S410, S440, and S450 and may exclude a peripheral terminal having pose data deviating from a threshold range from a synchronized terminal or may determine a terminal having pose data most similar to that of the mobile terminal 110 as a final synchronized terminal. If one synchronized terminal is detected, the detection server 200 transmits a message received from the mobile terminal 110 to the detected synchronized terminal (S480). For example, the mobile terminal 110 may transmit a text message, a discount coupon or a free coupon of food or beverage, or a product coupon expressing a user mind to a synchronized terminal. Further, for another example, by transmitting a user profile thereof to the synchronized terminal 124, the mobile terminal 110 may enable a user of the synchronized terminal 124 to determine<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> who is a user of the mobile terminal 110.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the foregoing exemplary embodiment, a case of sending a message to the favorite opposite sex is illustrated, but disclosed technology may be applied to a sales promotion event of a company, a department store, and a mart.

Further, for another example, disclosed technology may be applied to a program public relation service of a broadcasting company. For example, while the user views a television program, when disposing a mobile terminal of the user with the same pose as that of a terminal of an entertainer in which the user prefers and inputting program information or a reference location, the detection server may specify the entertainer.

First, the user of the mobile terminal 110 disposes the mobile terminal 110 with a pose similar to that of a terminal<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> to detect, i.e., the synchronized terminal 124. Thereafter, the mobile terminal 110 collects pose data including at least one of a location direction and an inclined level thereof and transmits the collected pose data to the detection server 200 (S510). According to an exemplary embodiment, the mobile terminal 110 may collect location data thereof together with pose data and transmit the collected location data to the detection server (S520). In this case, location data may be generated based on GPS receiving information or location information received from a base station. The detection server 200, having received pose data from the mobile terminal 110 detects the synchronized terminal 124 having pose data similar to that of the mobile terminal 110 within a predetermined radius from a reference location based on the pose data. Thereafter, the mobile terminal 110 receives a detection result of the synchronized terminal 124 from the detection server 200 (S530). For example, the synchronized terminal 124 is a terminal to which a pose data value belongs within a threshold range of a pose data value of the mobile terminal 110 or a symmetry value of pose data. The mobile terminal 110 determines whether a plurality of synchronized terminals are detected based on a synchronized terminal detection result received from the detection server 200 (S540). If a plurality of synchronized terminals are detected, the mobile terminal 110 repeatedly performs step S510 of collecting, step S520 of transmitting, and step S530 of receiving until one synchronized terminal is detected. The mobile terminal may repeat steps S510 to S530 and may exclude a terminal having pose data deviating from a threshold range from a synchronized terminal or may determine a terminal having pose data most similar to that of the mobile terminal as a final synchronized terminal. If one synchronized terminal 124 is detected, the mobile terminal may transmit a message to the detected synchronized terminal 124 (S550). For example, the mobile terminal 110 may transmit a text message, a discount coupon<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> or a free coupon of food or beverage, or a product coupon to the synchronized terminal 124.

In order to enhance accuracy, the user may provide distance information between the mobile terminal 110 and the synchronized terminal 124 as well as direction information to the detection server 200 or the synchronized terminal 124. The distance information may be estimated through, for example, a direct input from the user, an image processing, or a wireless signal processing.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method of detecting a synchronized terminal having a pose similar to that of a mobile terminal in an aspect of the synchronized terminal according to an exemplary embodiment of disclosed technology.

The first terminal 710 calculates pose data including at least one of a location direction and an inclined level of the second terminal 720 based on a photographed image (S710). According to an exemplary embodiment, the first terminal 710 may extract the second terminal 720 from a photographed image and perform an image processing process that calculates a location direction or an inclined angle of the second terminal 720.
