In 4G, technologies such as carrier aggregation, relay, and Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) have been noticed.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In particular, carrier aggregation is a technology capable of collectively handling, for example, five frequency bands with a bandwidth of 20 MHz to handle a bandwidth of 20 MHz×5=100 MHz. According to carrier aggregation, an advance in the maximum throughput is expected. Various technologies related to such carrier aggregation have been investigated.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For example, Patent Literature 1 discloses a technology for suppressing deterioration in throughput by controlling assignment of a measurement gap for each component carrier (CC) based on a determination result of urgency of handover.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005"><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Patent Literature 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2011120196A"><text>JP 2011-120196A</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">On the other hand, in Release 11 of the 3GPP, new carrier types (NCTs) have been investigated as new component carriers apart from legacy CCs (existing CCs) capable of maintaining backward compatibility. Here, the NCTs are assumed to be new types of CCs as well as the types of CCs. Further, as the NCTs, an NCT (Synchronized New Carrier Type: SNCT) synchronized with the legacy CCs and an NCT (Unsynchronized New Carrier Type: UNCT) not synchronized with the legacy CCs have been investigated.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The SNCT is synchronized with any legacy CC. Therefore, when a user equipment (UE) establishes synchronization in one CC between the mutually synchronized SNCT and the legacy CC, a synchronization result of the UE in the one CC can be used for the other CC. That is, the UE does not have to establish separate synchronization with a synchronization signal (for example, a common reference signal (CRS)) in the other CC.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The UNCT is not synchronized with any legacy CC, but can be synchronized with different UNCTs. When the UE establishes synchronization in one UNCT among two or more mutually synchronized UNCTs, a synchronization result of the UE in the one UNCT can be utilized for the different CCs. That is, the UE does not have to establish separate synchronization with a synchronization signal in the other CCs.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">However, in order for the UE to use the synchronization result of the UE in a certain CC for another CC, there is a concern of a large load being applied to the UE.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> For example, since a frequency band separate from the SNCT can be present in the legacy CC, the SNCT is not synchronized with all of the legacy CCs. Therefore, the UE verifies the synchronization regarding various conbinations between the SNCT and legacy CCs in order to use the synchronization result of the UE in the legacy CC for the SNCT. In this way, a large load may be applied to the UE.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">For example, there is a possibility of the UNCT being synchronized with another UNCT, but not all of the UNCTs are necessarily synchronized. Therefore, the UE verifies the synchronization regarding various combinations between the UNCTs in order to use the synchronization result of the UE in a certain UNCT for another UNCT. In this way, a large load may be applied to the UE.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In particular, when a macro cell and a small cell partially or entirely overlapping with the macro cell are present, the number of combinations of the synchronizable CC is considerably large. Therefore, a larger load may be applied to the UE in order to verify the synchronization.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Originally, when the UE does not use a synchronization result of a UE in a certain CC for a different CC, it is necessary to establish synchronization with a synchronization signal in each CC. In this way, a large load may be applied to the UE.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Based on the above description, the inventors of the present specification conceived of supplying information indicating a synchronization relationship (that is, which CCs are mutually synchronized) between CCs to a UE. However, even when the information indicating the synchronization relationship is reported to the UE, valuable radio resources in a macro cell may be consumed when a considerable amount of information is supplied by the macro cell.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a configuration in which consumption<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> of radio resources of a macro cell can be suppressed while reducing a load in a UE in carrier aggregation when the macro cell and a small cell are deployed.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the present disclosure, there is provided a communication control device including: a communication control unit configured to control radio communication in a small cell partially or entirely overlapping with a macro cell; and an acquisition unit configured to acquire first synchronization relationship information indicating which frequency bands are mutually synchronized among a plurality of frequency bands used for the small cell.

Technology for radio communication in 3GPP&gt;&gt;&gt;</heading><p id="p0024" num="0024">First, a technology for radio communication in the 3GPP will be described as a premise.</p><heading id="h0012">(Carrier aggregation of Release 10)</heading><heading id="h0013">- Component carrier</heading><p id="p0025" num="0025">In carrier aggregation of Release 10, up to five component carriers (CCs) are bundled and used by a UE. Each CC is a bandwidth of up to 20 MHz. In carrier aggregation, CCs continuing in a frequency direction are used in some cases and CCs separated in the frequency direction are used in some cases. In carrier aggregation, the CCs to be used can be set for each UE.</p><heading id="h0014">- Primary CC and secondary CC</heading><p id="p0026" num="0026">In carrier aggregation, one of the plurality of CCs used by the UE is a special CC. The one special CC is referred to as a primary component carrier (PCC). Of the plurality of CCs, the remaining CCs are referred to as secondary component carriers (SCCs). The PCC can differ for each UE. This point will be described more specifically below with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is an explanatory diagram illustrating an example of the PCC of each<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> UE. A UE 30A, a UE 30B, and five CCs 1 to 5 are illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. In this example, the UE 30A uses two CCs, the CC 1 and the CC 2. The UE 30A uses the CC 2 as the PCC. On the other hand, the UE 30B uses two CCs, the CC 2 and the CC 4. The UE 30B uses the CC 4 as the PCC. In this way, each UE can use a different CC as the PCC.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Since the PCC is the most important CC among the plurality of CCs, the CC for which communication quality is the stablest is preferable. Which CC is used as the PCC actually depends on the way in which they are installed.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The CC with which a UE initially establishes connection is the PCC for the UE. The SCC is added to the PCC. That is, the PCC is a main frequency band and the SCC is an auxiliary frequency band. The SCC is changed by deleting the existing SCC and adding a new SCC. The PCC is changed in an inter-frequency handover sequence of the related art. In carrier aggregation, a UE cannot use only the SCC, but necessarily uses one PCC.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The PCC is also referred to as a primary cell. The SCC is also referred to as a secondary cell.</p><heading id="h0015">- Synchronization by UE in CRS</heading><p id="p0031" num="0031">In carrier aggregation, a common reference signal (CRS) is transmitted in each CC. A UE establishes synchronization in each CC by the CRS. In the present specification, "synchronization (by the UE in the CC)" means that the UE adjusts (for example, tracks synchronization) a timing and/or a frequency in reception of a signal so that a signal can be correctly received in the CC. The common reference signal is also referred to as a cell-specific reference signal.</p><heading id="h0016">(NCT of Release 12)</heading><p id="p0032" num="0032">In carrier aggregation, each CC has been assumed to be able to be used by a legacy UE (that is, an existing UE) from the viewpoint of guarantee of backward<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> compatibility. However, the definition of a CC that cannot be used by a legacy UE but is more efficient has started to be investigated. That is, definition of new CCs referred to as new carrier types (NCT) or additional carriers has started to be investigated.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The ultimate motivation for the NCT is to reduce overhead of the CCs. Overhead is radio resources other than radio resources utilized to transmit user data. That is, overhead is radio resources utilized for control. When overhead increases, the radio resources that can be utilized to transmit user data may decrease. Therefore, the increase in overhead is not preferable. One cause of overhead is a CRS present in each CC in a downlink. This point will be described more specifically below with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is an explanatory diagram illustrating an example of a CRS transmitted in a CC on a downlink. Several radio resource blocks (RBs) corresponding to the CCs of 20 MHz are illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>. Each RB has a width of 12 subcarriers in a frequency direction and a width of 7 Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols in a time direction. The CRSs are transmitted in each RB. That is, the CRSs are transmitted in all of the RBs present across the bandwidth of the CCs in the frequency direction and present for each slot in the time direction. Accordingly, the CRS is transmitted in each CC and each subframe.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">One objective of the CRS is for a UE to establish synchronization. As the synchronization, there is time synchronization (or timing synchronization) which is synchronization in the time direction and frequency synchronization which is synchronization in the frequency direction. The UE can establish synchronization with high precision in the frequency direction and the time direction by the CRS. Further, the UE continues to establish synchronization by the CRS.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Another objective of the CRS is that the UE properly demodulates a<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> downlink signal. The UE demodulates different received signals based on the phases of the CRSs.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The common reference signal (CRS) is the most fundamental reference signal (RS) introduced in Release 8. On the other hand, at present, there is an intermittently transmitted RS such as a channel state information-reference signal (CSI-RS). The RS is used to demodulate a downlink signal. Accordingly, a current objective of the CRS is mainly that the UE can establish synchronization. Therefore, as far as the UE can establish synchronization, the interval at which the CRS is transmitted can be decreased.</p><heading id="h0017">(Reduction in CRSs investigated in NTC in Release 11)</heading><heading id="h0018">- Kinds of NCTs</heading><p id="p0038" num="0038">As the NCTs investigated in Release 11, there are broadly two kinds of NCTs.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">One of the two kinds of NCTs is an NCT that is synchronized with a legacy CC (that is, an existing CC). When the UE establishes synchronization in a legacy CC, the UE can utilize a synchronization result of the UE in the legacy CC for the NCT synchronized with the legacy CC. Such an NCT is referred to as a synchronized NCT (hereinafter referred to as an "SNCT"). Further, in the present specification, "utilize the synchronization result (of the UE in the CC) (for a different CC)" means that a reception timing and a reception frequency in the different CC are acquired from a reception timing and a reception frequency in the CC.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The other of the two kinds of NCTs is an NCT that is not synchronized with a legacy CC. The UE necessarily establishes synchronization in an NCT. Such an NCT is referred to as an unsynchronized NCT (hereinafter referred to as an "UNCT"). Since the synchronization process is necessary in the UNCT, the CRSs are transmitted in the UNCT.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041"><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> As described above, as the NCT, there are the SNCT and the UNCT. Hereinafter, specific examples of the SNCT and the UNCT will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is an explanatory diagram illustrating an example of the NCT. Five CCs 40 are illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. Of the five CCs 40, a CC 40A and a CC 40B are legacy CCs. In this example, the CC 40A and the CC 40B are mutually synchronized. A CC 40C, a CC 40D, and a CC 40E are the NCTs. More specifically, the CC 40C is an SNCT that is synchronized with both of the CC 40A and the CC 40B which are the legacy CCs. The CC 40D and the CC 40E are UNCTs that are synchronized with neither the CC 40A nor the CC 40B. In this example, the CC 40D and the CC 40E are not mutually synchronized.</p><heading id="h0019">- Reduction in CRSs in unsynchronized NCT</heading><p id="p0043" num="0043">Since the CRS transmitted in the legacy CC is transmitted not only to establish synchronization of the UE but also to demodulate a received signal, the CRS is redundant. On the other hand, since the CIS-RS is standardized as an RS for demodulation in releases after Release 10, it is possible to reduce the CRSs. Accordingly, an extent to which CRSs can be reduced while enabling the UE to continuously establish synchronization has been investigated. In particular, a reduction in the CRSs in the frequency direction and a reduction in the CRSs in the time direction have been investigated as the reduction in the CRSs of the unsynchronized NCT (that is, the UNCT).</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As the reduction in the CRSs in the frequency direction, for example, the RBs in which the CRSs are transmitted is reduced to 6 RBs, 25 RBs, or 50 RBs. Hereinafter, this point will be described specifically with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is an explanatory diagram illustrating an example of a reduction in the CRSs in the frequency direction. A case in which the RBs in which the CRSs are transmitted are reduced to 6 RBs in the frequency direction and a case in which<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> the RBs in which the CRSs are transmitted are reduced to 25 RBs in the frequency direction are illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>. In this way, not all of the CRSs in the RBs in the frequency direction are transmitted, but the CRSs in a limited number of the RBs are transmitted.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">On the other hand, as the reduction in the CRSs in the time direction, for example, a transmission period of the CRSs is considered to be 5 ms or 10 ms. This point will be described specifically with reference to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is an explanatory diagram illustrating an example of a reduction of the CRSs in the time direction.

In this way, not all of the CRSs of the slots or the subframes in the time direction are transmitted, but the CRSs of a limited number of the subframes are transmitted.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">As described above, a method of combining the reductions in the CRSs in the frequency direction and the reductions in the CRSs in the time direction has been investigated. As an evaluation of whether the UE establishes synchronization, whether accuracy of about 500 Hz is maintained in an environment of an SNR of -8 dB was evaluated. As a result, in the environment of an SNR of -8 dB, it is necessary to transmit the CRS in 25 RBs every 5 ms.</p><heading id="h0020">- Reduction in CRSs in synchronized NCT</heading><p id="p0049" num="0049">On the other hand, since the synchronized NCT (SNCT) is synchronized with the legacy CC, the existing CRSs can be basically deleted in the SNCT.</p><heading id="h0021">(Synchronization monitoring procedure)</heading><p id="p0050" num="0050">The UE monitors whether the UE establishes synchronization based on a block error rate (BLER) of a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH). In other words, the UE detects synchronization deviation of the UE based on the BLER of the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> PDCCH. For example, when the BLER of the PDCCH is equal to or greater than 10%, the UE detects the synchronization deviation.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">When the synchronization deviation is detected a predetermined number of times, a timer starts. Then, when a period of time of the timer expires, radio link failure (RLF) is recognized. When the RLF is recognized, the UE stops all of the transmission within 40 ms from the recognition of the RLF in order to avoid interference with another UE. Thereafter, the UE performs a procedure of RRC reestablishment including cell selection and random access.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The UE performs the above-described synchronization monitoring on the PCC, but does not perform the synchronization monitoring on the SCC. The UE deactivates the SCC when the PDCCH is not detected in the SCC.</p><heading id="h0022">(NCT of Release 12)</heading><p id="p0053" num="0053">NCT of Release 12 is a study item (SI) that was approved in September 2012 as RP-121415 at the 3GPP RAN #57 Plenary meeting. This SI is divided into phase 1 and phase 2. In phase 1, enhancement of NCT of Release 11 is scheduled to be investigated. In phase 2, the enhancement is scheduled to be investigated in consideration of scenarios of small cells. Specific examples of small cells include a pico cell, a nano cell, and a femto cell. In the present specification, the description will be made exemplifying a pico cell as the small cell.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">As the scenarios of a small cell, three deployment scenarios of a small cell are considered at present in 3GPP. In a first deployment scenario (that is, Deployment Scenario 1), a small cell is entirely overlapping with a macro cell. In a second deployment scenario (that is, Deployment Scenario 2), a small cell is partially overlapping with a macro cell. In a third deployment scenario (that is, Deployment Scenario 3), a small cell is not overlapping with a macro cell. That is, there is no macro cell near the small cell and only the small cell is operated. Hereinafter, specific examples of the deployment scenarios will be described with reference to<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is an explanatory diagram illustrating examples of three deployment scenarios of a small cell.

Pico eNodeBs 10 which are base stations of the pico cells 11 and a macro eNodeB 20 which is a base station of the macro cell 21 are also illustrated. First, the pico cell 11A is entirely overlapping with the macro cell 21, the pico cell 11B is partially overlapping with the macro cell 21, and the pico cell 11C is not overlapping with the macro cell 21. That is, the deployment of the pico cell 11A corresponds to the first deployment scenario, the deployment of the pico cell 11B corresponds to the second deployment scenario, and the deployment of the pico cell 11C corresponds to the third deployment scenario.

For example, as in the example illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>, deviation can occur in the time direction between the reception timing of a signal with the CC 1 in the UE and the reception timing with the CC 2 in the UE. For example, when the deviation in the time direction is less than a guard interval length of the OFDM, the CC 1 and the CC 2 can be considered to be mutually synchronized in the time direction.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065"><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> is an explanatory diagram illustrating frequency synchronization between component carriers. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>, the frequency band of the CC 1 and the frequency band of the CC 2 are illustrated. A center frequency of the CC 1 and a center frequency of the CC 2 are also illustrated. The center frequency of the CC 1 is separated from the center frequency of the CC 2 by a predetermined frequency width. However, in practice, for example, deviation can occur in the frequency direction between the center frequency of the CC 2 and a frequency separated from the center frequency of the CC 1 by the predetermined frequency width. For example, when the deviation in the frequency direction is within a predetermined frequency width (for example, 500 Hz in LTE), the CC 1 and the CC 2 can be considered to be mutually synchronized in the frequency direction.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">As described above, the synchronization between the frequency bands includes the time synchronization and the frequency synchronization. Therefore, there are the following four cases of the synchronization between the frequency bands:
