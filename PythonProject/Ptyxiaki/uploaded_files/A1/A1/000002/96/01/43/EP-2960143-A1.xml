For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2007176239A"><text>2007-176239</text></patcit> (hereinafter, referred to as "PTL 1") discloses a vehicle having a seat and a filler opening lid which are openable and closeable by operation of two wires, respectively.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The unlocking operation disclosed in PTL 1 is as follows. First, pressing one end (56a) of a swingable seesaw-structured operating arm (56: see FIG. 10A of PTL 1) causes an operating arm (63) to turn and press an abutment portion (65a) to turn first driving arm (65) and pull a wire (80a). Subsequently, pulling the wire (80a) causes an engaging pin (34: see <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> of PTL 1) to move and unlock a lid lock structure (90). Note that, PTL 1 discloses an operation to unlock a seat lock as well.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The vehicle disclosed in PTL 1, however, requires a mechanism that converts the operation to press the operating arm into the operation to pull the wire because the wire is pulled by pressing the operating arm. For this reason, there arises a problem in that the mechanism that operates the wire is likely to increase in size.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An object of the present invention is a vehicle that downsizes the mechanism that operates a wire.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Various aspects of the present invention are defined in the independent claims. Some preferred of optional features are defined in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A vehicle according to an aspect of the present invention (hereinafter, referred to as "vehicle according to a first aspect") includes or comprises: an operating member to be pressed for operation. The vehicle may comprise a wire,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> which may have one end disposed closer to the operating member than another end of the wire. The vehicle may comprise a wire cover that slidably covers the wire. The vehicle may comprise an actuating section that may support a portion of the wire cover and may move the wire cover in a direction away from the one end of the wire in accordance with the operation of the operating member. The vehicle may comprise a non-actuating section that supports the one end of the wire, e.g. so that an operation amount of the one end of the wire with respect to a vehicle body is smaller than an operation amount of the actuating section when the operating member is operated.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present Inventors have studied mechanisms other than the mode that changes a pressing operation into a pulling operation. Employing an operation arm to be pulled by hand for the purpose of pulling a wire does not require any conversion from a pressing operation into a pulling operation, thus making the structure simple. Such an operation arm to be pulled by hand, however, requires two operations including an operation to hold the operation arm and an operation to pull the operation arm, which degrades operability compared with the structure in which the operation arm is pressed. Thus, the present inventors have focused their attention to the wire structure. Wires are provided with wire covers that cover the outside of wires in order to prevent the wires from being in contact with and rubbed by another component during operation of the wires. The present inventors have noticed that, when the wire is puled, the wire cover moves relatively in a direction opposite to the direction in which the wire is pulled when viewed from the wire. Thus, the present inventors have found that operating the wire cover in a direction opposite to the direction in which the wire is pulled, i.e. pressing the wire cover in the direction opposite to the direction in which the wire is pulled, while the wire is fixed to the vehicle body frame causes one end of the wire and one end of the wire cover to relatively operate in the same manner as the related art. At least one embodiment of the present invention may comprise an arrangement where the wire cover is moved in a direction away from the one end of the wire in accordance with the operation of an operating member and can provide a structure in which the wire cover is pressed. Accordingly, the present invention may not require any mechanism that changes the operation to press the operating member into the operation to pull the wire, and thus may downsize the mechanism that operates the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> wire. Moreover, the present invention may suppress degradation of operability compared with the case where the operating member is pulled, because the wire may be pulled by pressing the operating member. As described above, according to the vehicle of the present invention, the mechanism that operates the wire may be downsized, and degradation of operability may be suppressed.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The vehicle may further include one or more supporting sections that support the wire cover, e.g. on the vehicle body. The supporting section may support a region of the wire cover that is closer to the other end of the wire than the portion of the wire cover supported by the actuating section. At least one of the supporting sections may fix the wire cover, e.g. to the vehicle body.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The one or more supporting sections that support the wire cover on, to or relative to the vehicle body may support a region of the wire cover that is closer to the other end of the wire than the portion of the wire cover supported by the actuating section, and at least one of the supporting sections may fix the wire cover, e.g. to the vehicle body. Thus, the position of the wire with respect to the vehicle body between the portion of the wire cover supported by the actuating section and the supporting section that fixes the wire cover to the vehicle body may not easily change. When the position of the wire changes with respect to the vehicle body, how the wire and the wire cover deform when the actuating section is operated may change. Thus, the operation load required for operating the actuating section may change. Suppression of a change in the position of the wire with respect to the vehicle body may make it possible to suppress a change in the operation load. In other words, the operational feeling may be stabilized.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A supporting section, among the one or more supporting sections, that is closest in distance along the wire to the portion of the wire cover supported by the actuating section may fix the wire cover to the vehicle body.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Accordingly, a supporting section among the supporting sections that is closest in a distance along the wire to the portion of the wire cover supported by the actuating section may fix the wire cover to the vehicle body. Thus, the position of the wire with respect to the vehicle body between the portion of the wire cover supported by the actuating section and the supporting section that fixes the wire cover to the vehicle body may not easily change. When the position of the wire changes with respect to the vehicle body, how the wire and the wire cover deform<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> when the actuating section is operated may change. Thus, the operation load required for operating the actuating section may change. Suppression of a change in the position of the wire with respect to the vehicle body may make it possible to suppress a change in the operation load. In other words, the operational feeling may be stabilized.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The vehicle may further include one or more supporting sections which may support the wire cover on the vehicle body. The supporting section may support a region of the wire cover that is closer to the other end of the wire than the portion of the wire cover supported by the actuating section. The wire cover may bend the wire, e.g. between the portion of the wire cover supported by the actuating section and a supporting section from among the one or more supporting sections that is closest in a distance along the wire to the portion of the wire cover supported by the actuating section.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Accordingly, the one or more supporting sections that support the wire cover support a region of the wire cover that is closer to the other end of the wire than the portion of the wire cover supported by the actuating section, and the wire cover may bend the wire between the portion of the wire cover supported by the actuating section and a supporting section, among the one or more supporting sections that is closest in a distance along the wire to the portion of the wire cover supported by the actuating section. Thus, in a case where the wire is to be operated by pressing the wire cover, bending the wire or changing the degree of the curvature between the portion of the wire cover supported by the actuating section and a region of the wire cover close to the other end of the wire may enable operation of the wire. Moreover, bending the wire in advance may make it easier to bend the wire, which may reduce the operation load of the operating member and may make it possible to stabilize an operational feeling.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The supporting section among the one or more supporting sections that is closest in a distance along the wire to the portion of the wire cover supported by the actuating section may fix the wire cover to the vehicle body.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Accordingly, the supporting section among the one or more supporting sections that is closest in a distance along the wire to the portion of the wire cover supported by the actuating section among the one or more supporting sections may fix the wire cover to the vehicle body. Thus, in a case where the wire is to be<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> operated by pressing the wire cover, bending the wire or changing the degree of the curvature between the portion of the wire cover supported by the actuating section and a region of the wire cover close to the other end of the wire may enable operation of the wire.

Accordingly, the wire may be easily bent and supported.

A straddle-type vehicle, saddle-ride vehicle or motor vehicle as used herein is intended to include the following terms also used in the art:
<ul><li>saddle-ride type vehicle or motor vehicle, saddle-straddling type vehicle or motor vehicle, and includes: motorcycles and motorbikes as well as motor tricycles and All Terrain Vehicles (ATV's), scooter, mopeds and snowmobiles.</li></ul></p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a side view of a vehicle 1, in the form of a saddle-ride vehicle, in this embodiment a scooter, according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is a top view of the vehicle 1 according to the embodiment of the present invention. Note that <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> illustrates a state of the vehicle 1 in which the steering handle, front wheel, seat and the like have been removed. The vehicle 1 according to the embodiment is a so-called scooter-type motorcycle.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The vehicle comprises a front wheel 2, a rear wheel 3, an engine 4 and a seat 5, for example, and a storage box 6 disposed under the seat 5. The storage box 6<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> is used for storing a helmet, for example, and is formed of an open-top box shape.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The seat 5 also serves as a lid for opening and closing the top opening of the storage box 6. A seat lock bar 7 for closing the top opening of the storage box 6 using the seat 5 is provided under the seat 5 (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>).</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">A hook 8 is provided at a position on a vehicle body side that faces the seat lock bar 7 in a state where the seat 5 closes the top opening of the storage box 6, and configured to lock the seat lock bar 7 (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>). The hook 8 is turnable around the hinge 9 (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>) within a certain range. However, a spring is connected to the hook 8, so that the hook 8 stays at a certain orientation due to the elastic force of the spring when no external force acts on the hook 8. Meanwhile, when the seat 5 is opened or closed, an external force greater than the elastic force of the spring acts on the hook 8, so that the hook 8 turns around the hinge 9.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The vehicle 1 includes a wire-lock unlocking mechanism 10 for unlocking the locked seat 5. The wire-lock unlocking mechanism 10 includes a wire 11, a non-actuating section 12, a wire cover 13, an actuating section 14, an operation button 15, and supporting sections 16 and 17. Hereinafter, the wire-lock unlocking mechanism 10 will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In the wire-lock unlocking mechanism 10, one end of the wire 11 is supported by the non-actuating section 12 while the other end of the wire 11 is connected to the hook 8. In addition, the wire 11 is slidably covered by the wire cover 13.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The actuating section 14 is provided to one end of the wire cover 13 near the one end of the wire 11 supported by the non-actuating section 12. The operation button 15 is connected to the actuating section 14. Note that, the operation button 15 may be in contact with the actuating section 14. In addition, the supporting sections 16 and 17 that support the wire cover 13 are provided at the other end and an optional position, e.g. an intermediate position, of the wire cover 13, respectively, and fix the wire cover 13 to the vehicle body, e.g. such that the wire cover 13 is fixed against movement relative to the vehicle body at the location of at least one or each of the supporting sections 16 and 17.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The non-actuating section 12 supports the one end of the wire 11 so that the operation amount of the one end of the wire 11 with respect to the vehicle body becomes smaller than the operation amount of actuating section 14 when the operation to press the operation button 15 is performed. The non-actuating section<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> 12 is fixed to the vehicle body. However, the non-actuating section 12 may not be fixed to the vehicle body, and may be movably supported in this case as long as the operation amount is smaller than the actuating section 14.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The supporting section 17 is provided at a position closest in a distance along the wire 11 to the actuating section 14 and disposed at a position different from an actuation axis of actuating section 14 in a direction perpendicular to the actuation axis. Accordingly, the wire 11 can be easily bent and supported. In addition, the bent wire 11 can be easily controlled in a direction opposite to a direction in which the wire cover 13 moves by the operation to press operation button 15.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The actuating section 14 supports the one end of the wire cover 13 and also moves the wire cover 13 in a direction away from the one end of the wire 11 supported by the non-actuating section 12, in accordance with the operation to press the operation button 15.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The position of the wire 11 with respect to the vehicle body does not easily change between the one end of wire cover 13 supported by the actuating section 14 and the supporting section 17 that fixes the wire cover 13 to the vehicle body. When the position of the wire 11 with respect to the vehicle body changes, how the wire 11 and the wire cover 13 deform when the actuating section 14 is operated changes. Accordingly, the operation load required to operate the actuating section 14 changes. Suppressing such a change in the position of the wire 11 with respect to the vehicle body enables suppressing a change in the operation load, which in turn, makes it possible to stabilize an operational feeling.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The wire 11 is bent between the one end of the wire cover 13 supported by the actuating section 14 and the supporting section 17. In a case where the wire 11 is to be operated by pressing the wire cover 13, the bending wire 11 or changing the degree of the curvature between the portion of the wire cover 13 supported by the actuating section 14 and a region of the wire cover 13 close to the other end of the wire 11 enables operation of the wire 11. Moreover, bending the wire 11 in advance makes it easier to further bend the wire 11, which reduces the operation load of the operation button 15 and makes it possible to stabilize an operational feeling.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The operation button 15 becomes available (i.e. can be pressed) when a key (not illustrated) is inserted into a key cylinder (not illustrated) or when the key lock is unlocked. This configuration is provided for security purpose.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0042" num="0042">An operation of the wire-lock unlocking mechanism 10 will be described using <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>. When the operation button 15 is pressed, the actuating section 14 connected to the operation button 15 moves the wire cover 13 in a direction away from the one end of the wire 11 in accordance with the operation to press the operation button 15. At this time, the actuating section 14 moves the wire cover 13 so that the operation amount of the wire cover 13 with respect to the vehicle body is larger than that of the wire 11.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Since the wire cover 13 is fixed to the vehicle body by the supporting section 17, the degree of curvature of the wire cover 13 moved by the actuating section 14 increases between the actuating section 14 and the supporting section 17.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Since the one end of wire 11 is supported by the non-actuating section 12, the other end of wire 11 is pulled by the wire cover 13 whose degree of curvature has increased between the non-actuating section 14 and the supporting section 17, and turns the hook 8 connected to the other end of wire 11. The hook 8 removes a latch from the seat lock bar 7 and thus can unlock the storage box 6.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">As described above, according to the embodiment, since the one end of wire 11 is supported by the non-actuating section 12, moving the wire cover 13 using the actuating section 14 in a direction away from the one end of wire 11 in accordance with the operation to press operation button 15 makes it possible to pull the other end of the wire 11. Thus, provision of a mechanism that converts a pressing operation into a pulling operation is no longer required, and the mechanism that operates the wire can be downsized. In addition, pressing the operation button 15 makes it possible to pull the wire 11, so that degradation of operability can be suppressed as compared to a case where an operation lever is pulled, for example.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">An embodiment of the present invention has been described thus far.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The embodiment has been described using the case where supporting portions 16 and 17 are provided at the other end and at an optional position of the wire cover 13, respectively, and fix the wire cover 13 to the vehicle body. However, the present invention is not limited to this case. For example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>, a configuration may be employed in which at least one supporting section 16 supports a region of the wire cover 13 near the other end of the wire cover 13 and fixes the wire cover 13 to the vehicle body.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Furthermore, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref>, a supporting section 18, such as a<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> loosely fitting loop, may be employed that regulates large movement of the wire cover 13 while allowing for certain movement of the wire cover 13, instead of fixing the wire cover 13 to the vehicle body, for example.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Furthermore, the embodiment has been described using the case where the supporting section 17 which is closest to the actuating section 14 is disposed at a position different from the actuation axis of the actuating section 14 in a direction perpendicular to the actuation axis. The present invention is not limited to this case, however, and as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref>, the supporting section 17 which is closest to the actuating section 14 may be placed on the actuation axis of the actuating section 14.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In addition, the embodiment has been described using the case where the wire cover 13 extending from the actuating section 14 to the supporting section 17 which is closest to the actuating section 14 is bent. The present invention is not limited to this case, however, and the wire cover 13 extending from the actuating section 14 to the supporting section 17 which is closest to the actuating section 14 may be straight.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In addition, the embodiment has been described using a sliding operating member as the operation button, as an example. The sliding operating member may have a knob and allow the user to slide the knob in a direction to press the actuating section. A sliding operating member as described herein, is provided for every single wire, so that, even when the number of wires to be operated increases, the number of operating members may be increased for the number of wires. Thus, a design in accordance with the number of wires is made possible, which improves the design freedom.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Furthermore, the operating member may be a seesaw operating member (also called a "rocker operating member") other than the sliding operating member. The seesaw operating member includes first and second operation sections and turns around a shaft disposed between the first and the second operation sections. When one of the operation sections that is raised and available (i.e. can be pressed) is pressed, the other operation section is raised and becomes available (i.e. can be pressed). Accordingly, when a seesaw operating member is used, the actuating section of the wire-lock unlocking mechanism is connected to the available operation section (i.e. can be pressed) in an actuatable manner.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In addition, the embodiment has been described using the case where a seat lock is unlocked.
