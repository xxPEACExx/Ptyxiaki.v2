When the hand wheel torque sensor becomes faulty and does not function properly, the EPS system may not be able to provide the assist torque. In some cases, the vehicle is also put in a Limp Home mode, in which the vehicle operates in a limited fashion, when the hand wheel torque sensor becomes degraded. Accordingly, it is desirable to have an EPS system that better handles a situation of a degraded hand wheel torque sensor.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In an electric power steering (EPS) system, the assist torque provided by a motor typically reduces the steering effort by a driver. In certain situations, such as when a torque sensor that is used to determine the driver requested assist torque degrades, the assist torque is instantly switched off. When the EPS system stops providing the assist torque, there is a possibility of a sudden perceptible change that the driver may feel on the hand wheel torque. This is because an instantaneous removal of the assist torque allows the stored energy in the system to back-drive the motor with some velocity. It is therefore desirable to provide an EPS system that handles this stored energy and eliminate the sudden perceptible change on the hand wheel.</p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">In one embodiment of the invention, a method for controlling a motor in an electrical power steering system is provided.

It should be understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals indicate like or corresponding parts and features.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, where the invention will be described with reference to specific embodiments without limiting same, an exemplary embodiment of a vehicle 10 including a steering system 12 is illustrated. In various embodiments, the steering system 12 includes a hand wheel 14 coupled to a steering shaft 16. In one exemplary embodiment, the steering system 12 is an electric power steering (EPS) system that further includes a steering assist unit 18 that couples to the steering shaft 16 of the steering system 12 and to tie rods 20, 22 of the vehicle 10. The steering assist unit 18 includes, for example, a rack and pinion steering mechanism (not shown) that may be coupled through the steering shaft 16 to a steering actuator motor<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> and gearing (hereinafter referred to as the steering actuator). During operation, as the hand wheel 14 is turned by a vehicle operator (driver), the motor of the steering assist unit 18 provides the assistance to move the tie rods 20, 22 which in turn moves steering knuckles 24, 26, respectively, coupled to roadway wheels 28, 30, respectively of the vehicle 10. Although an EPS system is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> and described herein, it is appreciated that the steering system 12 of the present disclosure includes various controlled steering systems including, but not limited to, steering systems with hydraulic configurations, and steer by wire configurations.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the vehicle 10 further includes various sensors 31-33 that detect and measure observable conditions of the steering system 12 and/or of the vehicle 10. The sensors 31-33 generate sensor signals based on the observable conditions. In various embodiments, the sensors 31-33 include, for example, a hand wheel velocity sensor, a hand wheel angle sensor, a lateral acceleration sensor, a yaw rate sensor, roadway wheel velocity sensors, a vehicle velocity sensor, and other sensors. The sensors 31-33 send the signals to the control module 40.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In various embodiments, a control module 40 controls the operation of the steering system 12 and/or the vehicle 10. For instance, the control module 40 controls the motor of the steering assist unit 18 to generate assist torque requested by the driver of the vehicle 10. In a normal mode of the motor operation, the control module 40 generates a normal assist torque command based on, e.g., a hand wheel torque signal from a hand wheel torque sensor and sends the normal assist torque command to the motor. In a limited assist mode, to which the control module 40 of some embodiments transitions when certain abnormality is detected (e.g., degraded functioning of a hand wheel torque sensor), the control module 40 generates and sends a limited assist torque command (e.g., based on sensor signals other than the sensor signal from a degraded sensor). In a manual mode, to which the control module 40 of some embodiments transitions when the control module 40 determines that no assist torque should be generated by the motor (e.g., degraded functioning of one or more sensors 31-33 is detected), the control module 40 directs the motor not to generate any assist torque. In some embodiments, these commands are signals representing amount of torque to be generated by the motor.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Generally speaking, the method in various embodiments of the invention generates a damping torque command that damps the reaction torque as the motor is driven by the energy built up in the steering system 12 during the transitions between different modes of operations, so as to prevent an abrupt change in the reaction torque at the steering wheel. Specifically, in some embodiments, the control module 40 switches on and off (e.g., enables or disables) the damping torque command based on a phase plane with axes being the values of a hand wheel velocity and a hand wheel angle or position. The phase plane defines the relationship between the velocity of the hand wheel 14 and the angle of the hand wheel 14. That is, the phase plane defines the relationship between the angle or position of the hand wheel and the magnitude and direction of a movement of the hand wheel.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a block diagram of the control module 40 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> that controls the steering system 12 and/or the vehicle 10 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. The control module 40 includes one or more sub-modules and datastores such as a damping torque command generation module 202, a damping torque command scaling module 204, and a final torque command generation module 206.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The damping torque command generation module 202 generates a damping torque command 214 based on a hand wheel velocity signal 208, a hand wheel angle signal 210, and optionally a vehicle velocity signal 212. More specifically, in some embodiments, the damping torque command generation module 202 determines a damping gain and scales the damping gain with the motor velocity. For instance, the damping gain is multiplied by the motor velocity. The damping torque command generation module 202 determines a damping factor that is used to scale the damping gain further. The damping torque command generation module 202 determines the damping factor based on a phase plane or a coordinate plane with axes being the values of the hand wheel velocity and the hand wheel angle. As the hand wheel velocity represents the rotational direction and the magnitude of a movement of the hand wheel and the hand wheel angle represents the angle or position of the hand wheel with respect to the center position of the hand wheel, the phase plane defines the relationship between the hand wheel velocity and the hand wheel angle. In some<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> embodiments, the damping factor that is determined based on the phase plane indicates whether the whole damping gain should be used or none of the damping gain should be used. For instance, the damping factor is zero or one and is multiplied by the product of the damping gain and the hand wheel velocity. In some embodiments, the damping torque command generation module 202 may employ one or more filters (not shown) to filter the hand wheel velocity signal 208 and the hand wheel angle signal 210 for determining the damping gain.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In some embodiments, the damping torque command generation module 202 determines the damping factor further based on the vehicle velocity. In these embodiments, the damping factor is also a function of the vehicle velocity. That is, in addition to indicating whether the whole damping gain should be used or not, the damping factor generated based on the vehicle velocity may indicate or specify a portion of the damping gain that should be used. More details about the damping torque command generation module 202 will be described further below by reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The damping torque command scaling module 204 takes as inputs the damping torque command 214 generated by the damping torque command generation module 202 and an assist mode 216. The assist mode 216 is a signal that indicates an assist mode - e.g., the normal assist mode, the limited assist mode, and the manual mode. The damping torque command scaling module 204 time-scales the damping torque command 214 based on the duration of time since the assist mode 216 changes from one assist mode to another assist mode. The damping torque command scaling module 204 generates a scaled damping torque command 218 and an assist mode duration 220. More details about the damping torque command scaling module 204 will be described further below by reference to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 8</figref>.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The final torque command generation module 206 generates a final torque command 228 to send to the motor of the steering system 12 (<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>). More specifically, according to the assist mode indicated by the assist mode signal 216, the final torque command generation module 206 switches between a normal assist torque command 222, a limited assist torque command 224, and a manual assist torque<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> command 226 to send as the final torque command 228. The manual assist torque command directs the motor not to generate any assist torque. Moreover, the final torque command generation module 206 combines the scaled damping torque command 218 into the final torque command 228 based on whether a transition between different assist modes is completed. More details about the final torque command generation module 206 will be described further below by reference to <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 10</figref>.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As used herein the terms module and sub-module refer to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that executes one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the described functionality. As can be appreciated, the sub-modules shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> can be combined and/or further partitioned to similarly calculate assist torque. As can be appreciated, the sub-modules shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> can be implemented as a single control module 40 or multiple control modules. Inputs to the control module 40 can be generated from the sensors of the vehicle 10 (<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>), can be modeled within the control module 40 (e.g., by other sub-modules (not shown)), can be received from other control modules (not shown), and/or can be predefined. For instance, the assist mode signal 216, the normal assist torque command 222, and the limited assist torque command 224 are generated by other sub-modules (not shown) of the control module 40 of some embodiments.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a block diagram of the damping torque command generation module 202 of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> in accordance with some embodiments of the invention.

The left half of the phase plane (i.e., the left side of the vertical axis) is represented by negative values of the hand wheel angle (e.g., when the hand wheel is turned to the left with respect to the center angle of the hand wheel).

Specifically, when the damping factor is not permanently set to one (i.e., damp on), the damping control module 304 makes the damping factor a function of the vehicle velocity. That is, for the unshaded area of the phase plane shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the damping factor is not set to zero but instead set to a value determined based on the vehicle velocity.

The damping factor is at zero (i.e., damp off) for a vehicle velocity that is above a second vehicle velocity threshold (e.g., above about 20 kph as shown). Between the first and second thresholds, the damping factor decreases from one to zero. In <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 7</figref>, the output damping factor changes linearly as the vehicle velocity increases from the first vehicle velocity threshold to the second vehicle velocity threshold.

The damping torque command scaling module 204 includes one or more sub-modules and datastores such as a delay module 802, a counter module 804, a scale factor generation module 806, and a scaling module 808.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The counter module 804 maintains a duration counter (not shown) that indicates a duration of time for which an assist mode has stayed before changing to another assist mode. The counter module 804 generates the assist mode duration signal 220. Specifically, in some embodiments, the counter module 804 takes as inputs the assist mode signal 216 and a delayed assist mode signal 810. The delayed assist mode signal 810 is the assist mode signal 216 delayed by the delaying module<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> 802, which implements a filter that delays a signal by a certain duration of time (e.g., tens or hundreds of milliseconds). The counter module 804 compares the assist mode signal 216 and the delayed assist mode signal 810 to determine whether the assist mode has been changed. If it is determined that the assist mode has been changed, the counter module 804 resets the duration counter (e.g., to zero) and starts increasing the duration counter. If it is determined that the assist mode has not been changed, the counter module 804 increases the duration counter. In some embodiments, when the duration counter reaches an upper limit, the counter module 804 does not increase the duration counter.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In some embodiments, the counter module 804 resets and increases the duration counter only if the change is from the normal assist mode to the limited assist mode, from the normal assist mode to the manual mode, or from the limited assist mode to the manual mode. In other embodiments, there is no such restriction and a change of the assist mode from any mode to another resets the duration counter.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The scale factor generation module 806 generates a scale factor 812 based on the assist mode duration signal 220. The scale factor 812 is used for time-scaling the damping torque command 214.

As shown, the scaling factor is at one (i.e., full damping) for an assist mode duration that is below a first duration threshold (e.g., below about 0.1 second as shown). The scaling factor then decreases as the assist mode duration increases to a second duration threshold (e.g., about 1 second as shown), which is the upper limit of the assist mode duration signal 220. In <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 9</figref>, the scaling factor changes linearly as the assist mode duration value increases from the first duration threshold to the second duration threshold.

The limited assist torque command 224 is selected when the assist mode signal 216 indicates the current assist mode is the limited assist mode. The manual assist torque command, which directs the motor not to generate any assist torque, is generated and selected when the current assist mode is the manual mode. In some embodiments, the command selection module 1002 instantly switches from one torque command to another as the assist mode changes from one mode to another. Alternatively or conjunctively, the command selection module 1002 may progressively reduce (e.g., ramp out) one command (e.g., the normal assist torque command) and progressively increase (e.g., ramp in) the other command (e.g., the limited assist torque command).

The damping determination module 1010 determines that the scaled damping torque command 218 should be combined into the selected torque command 1006 when (1) the assist mode 216 indicates that the current assist mode is not the normal assist mode and (2) the transition status 1014 indicates that the current transition from one assist mode to another is incomplete. If any of these two conditions is not satisfied, the damping determination module 1010 determines that the scaled damping torque command 218 should not be combined into the selected torque command 1006, effectively disabling the scaled damping torque command 218, and that the selected torque command 1006 should be sent out as the final torque command 228.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The transition status determination module 1008 determines whether a transition from one assist mode to another assist mode should be deemed complete or not.
