More particularly, the present disclosure relates to aircraft structures, such as stringers and other related assemblies.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>BACKGROUND</u></b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Elongated structures for use with vehicles, such as airplanes, are available in a wide variety of configurations to provide structural support under a variety of loading conditions. In particular, the wing and fuselage surfaces of an aircraft typically include parallel and span-wise oriented structural members called stringers. Such stringers are typically operably coupled to skin members on the wing and fuselage surfaces that cooperatively provide the desired flexural and torsional stiffness to the wing and fuselage surfaces. Such wing and fuselage surfaces may be fabricated from a metal, such as aluminum, steel or titanium. The stringer may include a planar web portion that is generally oriented in a direction approximately perpendicular to the skin member and extending in a span wise direction along the wing or fuselage surface so that the web portion offers resistance to a bending moment generated by the load.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A flange portion may be positioned on one or both of the longitudinal edges of the web portion in order to provide resistance to localized failure of the web portion due to lateral buckling. The flange portion further allows the stringer to be coupled to the skin member and/or frame members by providing an attachment surface for the skin member. The stringer also may help carry and/or transfer loads. For example, a stringer may transfer a load from a skin panel to another structure. This other structure may be, for example, a frame or rib.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Although such elongated structures can offer certain superior bending stiffness properties over other design configurations, one issue that may tend to limit the usage of certain elongated structures is the difficulty of attaching the elongated structure to adjacent structures with adequate load transfer at the attachment region without undue increase in weight and cost. For example, typically attachment fittings must be machined in order to facilitate the proper attachment of certain elongated structures to various types of related structures, such as wing or fuselage frame members. While in certain situations it can be relatively easy to attach certain elongated structures when the applied loads are low, it is quite a challenge to do so for highly loaded structure.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Designing stringers with a desired weight and performance characteristics may also be challenging. For example, a stringer with desired performance characteristics may be more structural and geometrically complex or may weigh more than desired. With increased structural and geometrical complexity, time and cost for manufacturing a stringer also may increase. If the stringer has a desired weight, performance characteristics may be such that additional stringers<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> may be required where a single stringer is desired. Therefore, it would be advantageous to have a method and apparatus that takes into account at least some of the issues discussed above, as well as possibly other issues.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Although desirable results have been achieved using prior art apparatus and methods, a stringer and skin structure that may be more easily and inexpensively fabricated, and that may provide a more favorable strength to weight ratio in comparison to conventional stringer and skin structures, would have utility.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">There is, therefore, a need for a more cost effective and less labor intensive method of assembling elongated structures and their related assemblies. It would also be desirable to reduce or eliminate the need for the total number of stringers for certain aircraft assemblies (i.e., the fuselage and wings) in order to reduce the overall weight and assembly time. It would also be desirable to reduce the number of stingers required to attach the skin to the stringers and the frame. It would also be desirable to be able to tailor or vary an elongated structure's geometry so as to be able to adequately withstand different types or varying types of loads that the elongated structure will undergo along the length of the elongated structure, so as to minimize the amount of structure material and therefore weight of the elongated structure. Such a desired cost effective and less labor intensive assembled structures should also offer a more efficient method of providing a more robust attachment of stringers to frame members while also increasing manufacturing facility throughput while also driving down overall system manufacturing costs.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>SUMMARY</u></b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to an exemplary arrangement, a method and system for forming an elongated structure is presented. For example, in one arrangement, an elongated structure comprises a web extending along a length of the elongated structure and a top flange comprising a first flange portion. The first flange portion extends away from an area of the web. The first flange portion comprising a variable width along at least a portion of the length of the elongated structure. The first flange portion of the elongated structure may comprise a variable width along the length of the elongate structure. The first flange portion of the elongated structure may comprise a constant width along at least a portion of the length of the elongated structure.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In one arrangement, the elongated structure may further comprise a second flange portion in addition to the first flange portion. The second flange portion may comprise a variable width along at least a portion of the length of the elongate structure. In addition, the second flange portion may comprise a constant width along at least a portion of the length of the elongated structure.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The first flange portion may comprise a planar surface, a rounded portion, a sharp portion, and/or a concave portion. The first flange portion may comprise a shape selected from any of the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> following shapes including convex, fin-shaped, saw tooth, rectangular, stepped and/or ramped shapes.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A structural assembly is disclosed comprising a first elongated structure comprising a web, a first flange extending along at least a portion of the web, the first flange comprising a variable width. The structural assembly further comprises a second elongated structure comprising approximately a perpendicular orientation to the first elongated structure and comprising an opening that is complimentary in shape to the first elongated structure.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A method for supporting a structural load in a vehicle is disclosed. This method comprises the steps of loading a first load onto an elongated structure, the first load being received in a flange of the elongated structure, the flange comprising a variable width along at least a portion of the elongated structure, and unloading the first load on the elongated structure. This first load may be provided when the vehicle is airborne. This first load may be unloaded when the vehicle is not airborne. In addition, the first load may vary along a length of the flange. This flange width may vary with load along a length of the flange.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The features, functions, and advantages can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present disclosure or may be combined in yet other embodiments in which further details can be seen with reference to the following description and drawings.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></b></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The novel features believed characteristic of the illustrative embodiments are set forth in the appended claims.

For example, an exemplary aircraft fuselage 10 of the present disclosure is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1. Figure 2</figref> illustrates a perspective view of the inside of the fuselage of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> illustrating a plurality of elongated structures and frame members. As illustrated, the aircraft fuselage 10 comprises a plurality of structural assemblies comprising elongated members (e.g., stiffeners, beams, stringers, spars, and ribs) that may be used to form a skeletal like structure (e.g., a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> framework). This skeletal like structure may be overlaid with a skin material, such as a composite material or alternatively metal. In this illustrated arrangement, this aircraft fuselage comprises a plurality of elongated structures 20 <i>(e.g.,</i> stringers), a plurality of frame members 25, and a skin assembly 30 having a row of windows 35 housed therein.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The skin assembly 30 may be attached to the members 20, 25 via an array of fasteners 40 that operably couple the skin assembly and the members to one another. And as described in greater detail herein, the elongated structures 20 may be operably coupled to the frame members 25 by way of a mounting clip. The fuselage 10 of the illustrated embodiment may have a tapered, cylindrical shape frequently used in aircraft, but other shapes are also possible and are still considered to be within the scope of the present invention. It should also be noted that the present disclosure is applicable to fuselage structures for other craft, including other aerospace craft such as a rocket or a launch vehicle, where it is desirable to have a lightweight, strong structure.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The elongated structures 20 comprise an elongated member that extends generally parallel to the axis of the aircraft fuselage 10, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1 and 2</figref>. The frame members 25 typically comprise annular hoops, extending circumferentially around, and spaced along, an axis of the fuselage.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> illustrates an exploded, partial cross sectional view of skin and elongated structure assembly, such as the elongated structure 20 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1 and 2</figref>. In this particular illustrated arrangement, the elongated structure comprises a stringer or beam structure. The stringer or beam structure comprises an "I" beam structure, however, as noted below, alternative stringer, beam, and/or hat type structures may also be used.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">As illustrated, the elongated structure 20 of the elongated structural assembly 30 comprises an elongated structure portion 22. This elongated structure portion 22 comprises a web 65 that is positioned between a base or lower flange 45 and an opposing top or upper flange 70.

In this configuration, the first mounting surface 320 of the first body portion 310 is attached to a planar wall of the frame member 304, near the web opening 305. This flat or planar wall of the frame member 304 is similar to the flat or planar wall surface 250 comprising an increased thickness 246 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Similarly, the first mounting surface 330 of the second body portion 312 is mounted along a flat or planar wall 340 (illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref>) of the web 302 of the elongated structure 302. Preferably, this mounting clip 302 may be mounted in place by an adhesive, by being bonded, cured, riveted, or using any other similar mounting method.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">One advantage of such mounting clips for use with the presently disclosed elongated structures is that such clips can be generally quickly and easily mounted since no special machining of the clip is required since it can be installed along the generally planar or flat surface<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> of a frame member. In addition, such a clip may also be generally quickly and easily installed along a corresponding flat surface of the elongated structure web. Consequently, no additional machining or fabrication of the elongated structure is required. Moreover, since the mounting clip may be installed along the relatively flat surfaces of both the frame member and the elongated structure, the installed clip will remain in place even when the structural assembly is subjected to heightened vibrational and other forces which airplanes frequently encounter. Another advantage of such a clip configuration is that the thickness of the clip can be varied, depending on the overall load that the elongated structure is designed to carry. Such thickness of the clip may be varied without altering the elongated structure and frame member surfaces.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">With reference now to <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 8</figref>, an illustration of a flowchart of a process 400 for increasing load on an elongated structure is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. Specifically, <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 8</figref> illustrates one arrangement for supporting a structural load in an airplane where the structural load resides on a structural assembly, such as the elongated structural assemblies disclosed herein. As illustrated, the method begins by operating an aircraft at step 410. In particular, the operation of the aircraft applies a pressure and therefore load at step 420 to the elongated structures and frame member attached to this structure. The elongated structure may be a stringer, may be a composite stringer or may be a metallic stringer as discussed herein. The structure may also be coupled to a skin assembly of a fuselage or a wing as also discussed herein. In response to the operation of the aircraft, the process generates forces configured to apply the load to certain portions of the elongated member, particularly along a flange portion of the elongated structure at step 430. Such a load may be received in a flange of the elongated structure, the flange comprising a variable width along at least a portion of the elongated structure. The forces may be in a direction substantially perpendicular to a top surface of the elongated structure.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">The method further includes the step 440 of unloading the first load on the elongated structure. This first load may be unloaded when the vehicle is not airborne. In addition, the first load may vary along a length of the flange. This flange width may vary with load along a length of the flange.</p><heading id="h0012"><b>Embodiments Disclosure</b></heading><p id="p0063" num="0063">Embodiments of the disclosure may find use in a variety of potential applications, particularly in the transportation industry, including for example, aerospace, marine, automotive applications and other application where elongated structures may be used.

Others may be apparent from the disclosure and discussion provided herein. As just one example, the disclosed elongated structures reduce the overall weight of a elongated structured assembly, such as a fuselage. This weight may be reduced by avoiding the use of heavier materials to facilitate strength to bear concentrated loads or by avoiding the use of additional materials that are not necessary to facilitate strength to bear certain concentrated loads. In addition, the elongated structure may be designed to have greater stability along only certain portions of the elongated structure, such as a mid-bay section of a fuselage. In addition, the elongated structures may be configured so as to provide a more effective load bearing member through an opening in the frame member.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">The presently disclosed elongated structures may also reduce the weight of a structured assembly by eliminating the need for costly machined attachment fittings by way of the disclosed mounting clip. Moreover, the presently disclosed elongated structures also can be used to reduce costs by way of a reduced "buy to fly" ratio of material purchased to machine attachment fittings. That is, the elongated structures do not require an undesirable amount labor or machining in order to prepare the structure for final installation into the components and subassemblies, such as in airplane components and subassemblies such as fuselages and wings. In addition, the increased load bearing capabilities of such elongated structures may allow for a reduced number of stringers provided for a elongated structure assembly, such as a fuselage or a wing.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Furthermore, the elongated structures can help to reduce costs by eliminating the labor costs and machining time of fabricating attachment fittings typically associated with conventional stinger and frame membrane structures. As such, the elongated structures will also help to further reduce costs by eliminating the cost of additional cutting tools and related maintenance expenses.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">In addition, the elongated structures will help to reduce the total cycle time of component and subassembly structures by eliminating the fabrication time necessary to manually modify elongated structures for the attachment fittings. As such, in certain applications, the presently disclosed elongated structures will also help to reduce the amount of time and expense for welding attachment fittings to the elongated structures.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">According to an aspect of the present disclosure there is provided an elongated structure comprising a web extending along a length of the elongated structure; and a top flange comprising a first flange portion, the first flange portion extending away from an area of the web, wherein the first top flange portion comprises a variable width along at least a portion of the length of the elongated structure.
