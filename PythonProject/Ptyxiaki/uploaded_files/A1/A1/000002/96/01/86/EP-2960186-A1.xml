In particular, the invention relates to a separation web or screen conveyor for use in association with root crop harvesters to facilitate the separation of stones, mud, crop tops and other debris from the crop. Discussion of the invention herein is in that context by way of example. However it should be understood that the invention is not limited to application in this field of technology but find potential use in any situation where it is desirable to provide an endless conveyor comprising articulated sections on a medium to large scale.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Separation webs, screens and graders which take the form of an endless conveyor onto which the product to be separated is transferred, the conveyor surface being provided with a grid, screen or the like have widespread application in a number of areas of the agricultural and food industries. Such devices, known variously as separation webs, separation conveyors, screen conveyors, grading conveyors, and the like have a range of applications both in separating and sizing products and in separating products from debris.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A particular form of conveyor, to which the invention is particularly though not exclusively applicable, is a screening conveyor for use with a root crop harvester to enable separation of stones, mud, extraneous vegetation and other debris from the root crop. In such devices, the conveyor is typically an endless conveyor web comprising an endless grid screen, the grid screen typically taking the form of at least two parallel endless belts linked transversely by a plurality of generally parallel and typically generally evenly spaced transverse members, such as solid rods. The transverse rods make up the screen with the pitch of the rods giving the effective screening size. As the conveyor is driven, with product on top of the conveyor screen, the desired crop is generally retained above the screen, whilst mud, stones and other debris generally falls through the gaps defined by adjacent cross members to be discarded.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Drive means are provided which typically take the form of drive cylinders located internally with the endless conveyor wound therearound. Since the belts are heavy, significant stresses can build up in the webbing strips as the conveyor passes around the drive cylinders.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">This can be offset to some extent by dividing the conveyor into sections with articulated linkages between adjacent conveyor sections and for example between the webbing strips of adjacent sections.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Prior art systems are known in which a web conveyor is made up of a plurality of linked conveyor sections, with adjacent sections being linked, for example in that the elongate webs making up the web conveyor are linked, by provision of articulated linkages having a transversely extending pivot, for example in the form of a hinge such as a rod/sleeve or barrel hinge, extending in the direction transverse to an elongate direction of the web conveyor section to allow articulation about a pivot axis transverse to the elongate direction.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Examples of such an arrangement can be found for example, in European Patent Publication <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP0312629A"><text>EP0312629</text></patcit>. This publication describes a conveyor, in particular for a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> root crop harvester, which consists of at least two carrier belts disposed parallel to each other in an elongate direction, and a plurality of evenly spaced and parallel transversely extending rods. The web conveyor is divided into a plurality of sections which are linked by means of articulated linkages between each belt at adjacent ends.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref> of that reference by way of example, the linkage assembly in the prior art consists of first and second structures with a mutually articulating engagement, each structure having a connection plate (11, 12) but engages under its respective free belt end (13, 14) and is clamped thereon with a pressure piece (15, 16) which also clamps in position the end most two transverse rods 3. The two pieces are articulated together in that respective partial sleeve formations (8, 9, 10) or hinge eyes co-operate when the assembly is brought together to form a complete sleeve housing to receive the pivot member (23) and form a transverse barrel hinge.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In some arrangements of this type, such as the embodiment of European Patent Publication <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP0312629A"><text>EP0312629</text></patcit>, a separate pivot pin is inserted into the receiving sleeve formed by the paired hinge eyes to simultaneously connect the first and second structures and thus link the respective sections. In other cases, it is known to use the end of a transverse rod for this purpose. In either case, the link between the first and second conveyor sections is completed by insertion of the pivot member into the hinge sleeve.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Dividing the conveyor into sections with articulated linkages such as in the examples given can assist to some extent in accommodating drive loads. Even so, failure of the webbing, particularly in the vicinity of these linkages, is a problem.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Moreover, such linkage systems do not lend themselves very readily to in-field assembly, or to in-field disassembly for example for repair. Insertion of a pivot member into the hinge sleeve to complete the hinge and also the connection<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> between conveyor sections can a difficult operation in practice in situ on the machine, especially in an in-field secenario.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present invention seeks to mitigate some or all of the above disadvantages by provision of an alternative linkage system and method, and in particular preferably by provision of an alternative linkage system and method that reduces the bending stresses experienced by the web as it passes around a drive and/ or that is adapted for ease of in-field assembly and/ or to facilitate in-field disassembly for example for cleaning or repair.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In accordance with the invention in a first most general aspect a linkage system for the articulated connection of two sections of a conveyor comprises:
<ul><li>a first linkage assembly comprising a first linkage body having a conveyor engagement portion at a first end and a first sleeve formation at a second end distal from the first end, a second linkage body having a second sleeve formation at a first end and a first linkage formation at a second end distal from the first end, and a pivot member, wherein the first and second sleeve formations are shaped so as together to be assembleable to provide a single sleeve formation into which the pivot member may be surroundingly received; and a second linkage assembly comprising a first linkage body having a conveyor engagement portion at a first end and a first sleeve formation at a second end distal from the first end, a second linkage body having a second sleeve formation at a first end and a second linkage formation at a second end distal from the first end, and a pivot member, wherein the first and second sleeve formations are shaped so as together to be assembleable to provide a single sleeve formation into which the pivot member may be surroundingly received; wherein the first and second linkage formations are mutually adapted so as to be mountable together in rigid fixed relationship.</li></ul></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In use a first and second conveyor section are joined together first by means of the attachment of a first linkage assembly to the first conveyor section, a second linkage assembly to the second conveyor section, and then by engagement between the first and second linkage formations of the respective first and second linkage assemblies.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Thus, the linkage assemblies are first attached to their respective conveyor sections and completion of the link between the conveyor sections is effected by mounting together the first and second linkage formations in rigid fixed relationship. Assembly of each individual linkage formation may be effected off machine and the linkage formations then attached to their respective conveyor sections. The linkage formations may be supplied as assembled units. The process of attaching the two conveyor sections is simplified to one of engaging each linkage formation to its respective conveyor section and then mounting the respective first and second linkage assemblies together. The necessary mountings may be simple and for example rigid mechanical engagements. The assembly process may therefore be simplified.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Preferably, the conveyor engagement portion of each linkage assembly is mountable in rigid fixed relationship to its respective conveyor section. A similarly rigid fixed engagement is made between the two linkage assemblies by connection together of the linkage formations. A pivoting capability about an axis transverse of the longitudinal direction of the conveyor is provided by the sleeve and pivot member assembly of each respective linkage assembly.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">This is conveniently effected in that the first and second sleeve formations of a linkage assembly are shaped and configured so as to cooperate together when assembled to define together a single sleeve structure which is suitably shaped and sized to receive the pivot member, such that the assembly at this point constitutes a sleeve and rod or barrel hinge disposed in a direction and pivotable about an axis transverse of the longitudinal direction of the linked conveyor sections. The pivot member is shaped to define a surface about which the sleeve formations may rotate in use in familiar manner.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">However, it is a feature of the invention that a sleeve and rod or barrel hinge is provided within each linkage formation, between a first linkage body that engages for example rigidly with a first conveyor section and a second linkage body that engages for example rigidly with its counterpart on the other linkage formation.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> The final connection is not effected at either hinge. Rather, the final connection is effected by mounting together the first and second linkage formations in rigid fixed relationship. Assembly of each individual linkage formation may be effected off machine and the linkage formations then attached to their respective conveyor sections. The linkage formations may be supplied as assembled units in which completion of the hinge is effected by insertion of a bespoke pin and bearing arrangement and most preferably may be supplied as sealed bearing units. The mountings between the respective linkage formations may be of simple design for ease of assembly on machine, and for example may be simple rigid mechanical engagements. The on machine assembly process may therefore be simplified compared with existing methods of providing hinge and pin articulation, where the assembly/ disassembly of respective conveyor sections is effected by insertion/ removal of a joining pin (either a bespoke pin or an end of a transverse rod as the case may be) into the receiving sleeve formed by the sleeve portions of the two parts to be joined.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The provision of an assembly in accordance with the provision of separate linkage formations on each respective linkage assembly which are adapted so as to be mounted together in rigid fixed relationship provides for effective assembly/disassembly of the two conveyor sections, by mounting and demounting of the two linkage formations, which might for example facilitate in-field assembly and/or in-field disassembly e.g. cleaning or repair.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Moreover the design of linkage offers greater flexibility than that of prior art designs for example in relation to different web conveyor configurations, and in particular, different transverse member pitches, with a potential to mitigate load problems that might be encountered using typical drive systems, in particular by the provision of two separate linkage assemblies each of which provides a discrete articulating pivot in association with its respective conveyor and for example web section.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Since the final connection is not effected at either hinge but is effected by mounting together the first and second linkage formations in rigid fixed relationship, the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> linkage formations may be supplied as assembled units and most preferably may be supplied as sealed bearing units.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Thus, in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention, each of the first and second linkage assemblies is provided in an assembled condition with the first and second linkage bodies assembled together so that the hinge link composed of the first and second sleeve formations and a pivot member in the form of a pivot pin, for example with suitable bearings, is assembled for rotation of the sleeve portions and hence of the respective first and second linkage bodies about the pivot pin received within the sleeve formation.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">More preferably, each of the first and second linkage assemblies is provided in an assembled condition wherein the hinge link composed of the first and second sleeve formations, pivot pin and suitable bearings is a sealed unit, and so that the hinge link is mounted for rotation about the pivot pin on the sealed bearings. In this way, a pivoting articulation is provided in use at two points in the assembled whole, at the hinge in each first and second linkage assembly between its first and second linkage bodies. This is separate from the location of the mechanical connection between the two linkage assemblies, which is formed by the mechanical engagement of the first and second linkage formations of the first and second linkage assemblies.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Such a design can be contrasted with that of existing methods, which make use of the hinge and pin arrangement, where the pin is typically removable to enable the web to be joined in-situ on the machine, and for example in the field. By contrast, in accordance with the present invention, the web sections may be joined in-situ on the machine, and for example in the field, by means of mounting together of the first and second linkage formations of the first and second linkage assemblies, and the individual linkage assemblies (and the hinged pivoting parts thereof) may be provided without requiring assembly in-situ. This is a particular advantage of the arrangement of the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In accordance with the invention, connection is completed between the first linkage assembly and the second linkage assembly (and hence when each linkage assembly is attached to a respective conveyor section, between first and second conveyor sections, by mounting together the first and second linkage formations in rigid fixed relationship). The first and second linkage formations are mutually adapted so as to be so mountable together.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The first and second linkage formations may be mutually adapted so as to be mountable together in rigid fixed relationship by a releasable or a permanently fixed mechanism. Preferably, a releasable mechanism is provided to facilitate in-situ assembly and disassembly.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In a preferred embodiment, the first and second linkage formations comprise mutually engageable mounting portions, and for example, comprise mutual engageable mounting plates with mutually engageable faces. The mounting portions may be adapted themselves to engage together, for example by provision of mutually engageable projections and recesses or the like and/maybe adapted to be engaged together by means of additional fixing formations.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In a particularly convenient embodiment, each of the first and second linkage formations comprises a mounting plate with mutually engageable mounting faces, and with complementarily positioned through apertures for receipt of connecting members, in particular, lockable and releasable connecting members such as screw threaded connecting members, and for example such as nuts and bolts.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Such an arrangement provides for simple assembly and disassembly in-situ in the field of the first and second linkage assemblies, and accordingly of the first and second conveyor sections on which they are mounted in use in a more complete conveyor assembly.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Each linkage body is provided with a conveyor engagement portion at a first end.

This pivot is effected in that the respective first and second linkage bodies of a linkage assembly define mutually co-operable sleeve formations which come together which form a continuous single sleeve for the receipt of a pivot formation or pivot member about which the two linkage bodies may pivot relative to each other and thus effect in the assembled whole a transverse articulation about a rotational pivot axis in a direction transverse to the belt.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">To effect this, the respective first and second sleeve formations are shaped so as together to be assembleable to provide a single continuous sleeve into which the pivot formation or pivot member may be surroundingly received.

A lower surface at the end of belt 1 is provided with a pressure plate 4 and the hinge plate and pressure plate are bolted together in order to grip the end of the belt 1.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In the illustrated embodiment, a pressure plate clamp bolt 7 is shown which clamps directly to the pressure plate, and a second bolt 6 is shown which clamps through an end of an endmost web bar 5 to the pressure plate 4. A recessed lower portion of the hinge plate 8 accommodates the web bar end 5. The web bar 5 may be of a typical design, equivalent to the other web bars (not shown) supported along the length of the belt, as web bar ends are typically of this formation in order to be bolted to the belt in any event.

When brought together the two sleeve portions or hinge eyes define a cylindrical recess for receiving a hinge joining pin 10 about which the hinge eyes may rotate, and hence provide a transverse articulation axis permitting relative articulating movement between the hinge plate part and the linkage plate part.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">A first distinctive feature of the invention can be seen by the provision of the discrete linkage plates 11a as part of the first linkage assembly L1 and 11b as part of the second linkage assembly L2 which are releasably linked together by means of the hinge link connecting bolts 14. This releasable connection is entirely separate from the pivoting hinges themselves. This can be contrasted with existing methods which use a hinge and pin where the pin is removeable to enable the belt sections to be joined. By contrast in accordance with the present invention, completion of the connection between two linkage assemblies L!, L2 is effected by means of the bolted connection via bolts 14 of a first linkage formation comprising the first hinge linkage 11a and a second linkage formation comprising the second hinge linkage 11b.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">An advantage of this arrangement is that it simplifies connection in-situ on the machine, and for example in the field, relative to prior art arrangements where the pin is typically inserted/ removed to enable the web to be assembled/ disassembled in-situ. By contrast, in accordance with the embodiment, the linkage assemblies may be assembled first, and for example provided pre-assembled, and the web end may be joined in-situ on the machine, and for example in the field, by means of the bolted connection via bolts 14 of the two hinge linkages 11a, 11b.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">A further advantage of this arrangement is that it gives much greater flexibility of the design of each hinge. Two particular examples of the refinements that are possible are shown in the illustrated embodiment.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0066" num="0066">First, the hinge may be formed as a pre-assembled sealed unit. In the illustrated embodiment, each hinge eye 9 may be constructed to rotate about the hinge joining pin 10 on sealed bearings, with the unit being sealed by virtue of the seals 12. Such an arrangement would not be possible where it was desirable to insert the pin in-situ to enable the web to be joined on the machine.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Second, in the illustrated embodiment, the pin 10 is in the form of a hollow bush. This allows a bespoke "filling bar" 3, otherwise identical to one of the web bars but without the flattened bolted end, to be received in and located through the centre of the pin 10. By this means, and by appropriate sizing of the hinge linkages 11a, 11b, the pitch of the web bars may be maintained across the web joints as desired.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">A design such as represented by the illustrated embodiments embodying the principles of the invention, enables a solution which mitigates disadvantages of prior art systems, and in particular which provides for flexibility to accommodate a range of different web pitches in a system which is more readily assembleable and dissassembleable in-situ, and which allows for the provision of sealed bearings for the pivoting hinge.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90459984" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A linkage system for the articulated connection of two sections of a conveyor comprising:
