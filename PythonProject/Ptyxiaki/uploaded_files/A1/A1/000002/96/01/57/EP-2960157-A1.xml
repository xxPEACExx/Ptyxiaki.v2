One typical ventilated cavity resides within the wing-to-body fairing that forms a blended aerodynamic surface between the fuselage and wing. These wing-to-body fairings are typically ventilated with air scoops or air inlets to remove air that could possibly contain fuel vapors. Another typical ventilated cavity is an enclosure for a heat exchanger of environmental control systems on the aircraft.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As the speed of the aircraft increases, the air flow through these ventilated cavities increases with a fixed area air scoop. This increased air flow causes excess noise in the cabin of the aircraft and can increase the aerodynamic drag on the aircraft. One solution for decreasing this excess noise and drag is to modulate the area of the air scoop. Such modulation is typically accomplished with use of electronic actuators and sensors to actively manage the area of the air scoop. These<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> actively managed air scoops have the disadvantage of requiring additional electronic components and adding complexity to the aircraft.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As such, it is desirable to provide air scoop systems with modulating areas that have reduced management complexity. In addition, other desirable features and characteristics will become apparent from the subsequent summary and detailed description, and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and this background.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The object of the present invention is solved by the subject-matter of the independent claims, wherein further embodiments are incorporated in the dependent claims.

The passive pneumatic actuator is operatively coupled with the movable element and is configured to move the movable element towards the closed position in response to an increasing altitude of the aircraft based on a differential pressure between the external environment and a substantially constant interior air mass enclosed by an interior compartment of the aircraft at a cabin pressure during flight of the aircraft.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In a second non-limiting embodiment, an aircraft includes, but is not limited to, an interior compartment, an outer skin, an air scoop, a movable element, and a passive pneumatic actuator.

An interior air mass enclosed by interior compartment 110 typically remains at a higher pressure than the external environment 119 to maintain passenger comfort.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Fairing cavity 115 and ECS compartment 114 are ventilated cavities that are not pressurized during flight of aircraft 100 and have internal pressures similar in magnitude to the external environment 119. Wing-to-body fairing 112 is ventilated according to Federal Aviation Administration requirements based on removing potential fuel vapor from fairing cavity 115.

Each air scoop system 118 includes an air scoop<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 120, a movable element 122, a passive pneumatic actuator 124, a pressure actuated valve 126, an air pressure supply line 133, and two resilient members 128. Air scoop system 118 is movable between an open position and a closed position based on the altitude of aircraft 100, as will be described below. In the open position, an air flow area through which air can flow through air scoop system 118 and the ventilated cavity is maximized. The maximized air flow area is preselected to provide an air flow based on a low speed operation of aircraft 100, such as during takeoff/landing and flight below 10,000 feet. In the closed position, the air flow area through which air can flow through air scoop system 118 and the ventilated cavity is minimized. The minimized air flow area is typically preselected to provide an air flow based on a high speed operation of aircraft 100, such as when aircraft 100 is at cruising speed.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Air scoop 120 is an aperture or opening in outer skin 108. In the example provided, air scoop 120 includes a fixed member 130 extending into the ventilated cavity from outer skin 108. Fixed member 130 provides a counter-acting force to passive pneumatic actuator 124 and resilient members 128, as will be described below. Air scoop 120 may have various shapes to reduce wind noise within or drag on aircraft 100, as will be appreciated by those with skill in the art.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Movable element 122 is movable between an open position and a closed position over air scoop 120 to define an air flow area through air scoop 120. The open and closed positions of movable element 122 define the open and closed positions of air scoop system 118, as will be appreciated by those with skill in the art. By varying the air flow area, the air flow through the ventilated cavity may be modulated to reduce air flow at higher altitudes where aircraft 100 is typically at a cruising speed. In the example provided, movable element 122 is an articulating ramp that is secured to air scoop 120 or outer skin 108 with a hinge 132.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Passive pneumatic actuator 124 is operatively coupled with movable element 122. Passive pneumatic actuator 124 is further configured to move movable element 122 towards the closed position and in response to an increasing altitude of aircraft 100 based on a differential pressure between the interior air mass in interior compartment 110 and external environment 119. As will be appreciated by those<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> with skill in the art, as altitude of aircraft 100 increases, atmospheric pressure in external environment 119 decreases. The forces provided by passive pneumatic actuator 124 and resilient member 128 may vary and be optimized for particular applications without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the example provided, passive pneumatic actuator 124 is an air bladder that rotates movable element 122 about hinge 132. In some embodiments, passive pneumatic actuator 124 is a bellows system, a pneumatic piston, or any other device that may be used to passively actuate movable element 122 based on the differential pressure. Passive pneumatic actuator 124 is configured to put movable element 122 in the closed position when aircraft 100 is at a cruise altitude. As will be appreciated by those with skill in the art, aircraft 100 is generally traveling at a cruising speed when at cruise altitude. At cruising speed, the air flow area of air scoop system 118 when movable element 122 is in the closed position is sufficient to ventilate the ventilated cavity.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The interior air mass of interior compartment 110 is much larger than the volume of air used to actuate passive pneumatic actuator 124. Accordingly, the air pressure of the interior air mass in interior compartment 110 may be considered to be substantially constant throughout the movable range of passive pneumatic actuator 124 and movable element 122.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Pressure actuated valve 126 is operatively coupled between the interior air mass of interior compartment 110 and passive pneumatic actuator 124. Pressure actuated valve 126 restricts air flow from interior compartment 110 to passive pneumatic actuator 124 when the differential pressure between interior compartment 110 and external environment 119 is below a threshold value. By way of example, pressure actuated valve 126 may be selected to open at a specific p.s.i.d. and keep air scoop system 118 in the open position at low altitudes and speeds. Passive pneumatic actuator 124 may also contain a small exit port 131 to allow pressurized air to slowly escape so that pressurized air is not trapped in the passive pneumatic actuator 124 when pressure actuated valve 126 is closed. In some<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> embodiments, pressure actuated valve 126 is omitted, and the interior air mass is in direct fluid communication with movable element 130.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the example provided, resilient members 128 are coil springs in tension between fixed member 130 and movable element 122. In other embodiments, other type of resilient members may be utilized. Tension within resilient members 128 pulls movable element 122 toward fixed member 130 and away from outer skin 108 to urge air scoop system 118 into the open position. Passive pneumatic actuator 124, resilient members 128, and pressure actuated valve 126 cooperate to position movable element 122 in the open position when the aircraft is below a threshold altitude to maximize the air flow area. As will be appreciated by those with skill in the art, at low altitudes aircraft 100 is generally traveling at low air speeds and a maximized air flow area is desirable to provide sufficient ventilation of fairing cavity 115 or ECS compartment 114.
