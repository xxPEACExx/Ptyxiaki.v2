Further, the waterdrop flows down from an upward oriented surface of the male connector in the vicinity of the fitting opening along an edge portion of the fitting opening so that the waterdrop accumulates on a lower surface side of the connector fitting opening. As a result, there is a problem in that the waterdrop adheres to a connector contact portion or a wiring coupling portion through a slight gap between the male connector and the female connector due to a capillary action to corrode the contact portion or the coupling portion to lower contact reliability.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Further, there is a problem in that the above-mentioned contact reliability is similarly lowered by the waterdrop entering a locking hole of the connector, which is formed on a side surface of the connector.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further, a direction of fitting the connector is formed oblique with respect to an outer surface of the control unit, while the locking hole is formed inside the connector so as to close the connector locking hole. As a result, a size of the control unit is increased. In addition, a die configuration becomes complex due to the need of an inner sliding mechanism for the die or the like. Thus, there is another problem in that weight and costs are increased.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further, the unit cover covers an outer circumference of a side of the connector, which is connected to the control board. Therefore, the unit cover is increased in size. Thus, there is also a problem in that the weight and costs of the control unit are further increased.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention has been made to solve the problems described above,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> and therefore has an object to provide a vehicle-mounted electronic control device including a control unit reduced in size, weight, and costs with improved contact reliability between electric components included in the control unit.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problems</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a vehicle-mounted electronic control device, including a control unit including:
<ul><li>a control board having a control circuit mounted thereon;</li><li>a housing for covering the control board; and</li><li>a connector exposed externally, for electrically connecting the control board and an external wiring to each other,</li><li>the connector having an opening hole formed in at least one of a side surface and a lower surface relative to an upper surface that is an upward oriented surface, and a waterway formed on a surface of the connector, for preventing flowing down water from entering the opening hole.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0008">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the vehicle-mounted electronic control device according to the one embodiment of the present invention, the connector has the opening hole formed in at least one of the side surface and the lower surface relative to the upper surface that is the upward oriented surface, and the waterway for preventing the flowing down water from entering the opening hole, which is formed on the surface. Thus, with the simple configuration, the control unit can be reduced in size, weight, and costs, whereas the contact reliability between electric components included in the control unit can be improved.</p><heading id="h0009">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view illustrating an electric power

Further, the female connector 27 is inclined downward at an angle θ with respect to a horizontal direction along an upper surface 29 that is an upward oriented surface of the female connector when the female connector 27 is viewed from a front side, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Locking holes 31 that are opening holes for the torque sensor 4, the vehicle-speed sensor 5, and the power supply unit 14, are formed in a side surface 32 of the female connector 27.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">By elastically locking projections 30a to the locking holes 31, a male connector 30 is held to the female connector 27.

The microcomputer 36 computes a current value corresponding to the steering assist torque. A motor driving current flows through the electric motor 11 by the power unit 23. A required amount of assist torque is output in a required rotating direction from the electric motor 11.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In this embodiment, the female connector 27, which is formed integrally with the frame 24, has the fitting opening 28 oriented vertically downward relative to the basic plane 24a of the frame 24. Further, the upper surface 29 of the female connector 27 is inclined downward to a near side at the angle θ relative to the horizontal direction when the female connector 27 is viewed from the front side. Further, the waterways 33 formed on the upper surface 29 are formed so as to be located away from the locking holes 31 on the side surface 32.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Therefore, even when a waterdrop falls from above of the female connector 27, the waterdrop flows in a direction indicated by the arrows Z along the waterways 33 so as to be discharged regardless of vehicle conditions and usage conditions. Therefore, the waterdrop is prevented from entering inside of the control unit 12 through the fitting opening 28 and also is prevented from entering inside of the control unit 12 through the locking holes 31.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">It is conceivable to close the locking holes so as to prevent the waterdrop from<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> entering through the locking holes. In this case, however, a shape of the female connector is increased. Further, a die sliding structure for providing a locking mechanism for locking the projections 30a of the female connector 30 to the locking holes must be added.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">On the other hand, the locking holes 31 of this embodiment are held in communication with exterior. Thus, the female connector 27 can be reduced in size, while the die structure can be simplified. Therefore, the control unit 12 can be reduced in weight and costs.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Further, although the housing 25 covers the control board 22, an outer circumference of the female connector 27 on the side connected to the control board 22 is not required to be surrounded by the housing 25. Therefore, the housing 25 can be reduced in size, which enables the control unit 12 to be reduced in weight and costs.</p><heading id="h0012">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> is a front view of a principal part, for illustrating an electric power steering device according to a second embodiment of the present invention, <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8</figref> is an enlarged view illustrating a portion (portion D) indicated by the arrow D in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 9</figref> is a view of the portion D in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref>, as viewed from a direction of the arrow E.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In this embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref>, the upper surface 29 is inclined at the angle θ toward one side in a width direction when the female connector 27 is viewed from the front side along the upper surface 29.
