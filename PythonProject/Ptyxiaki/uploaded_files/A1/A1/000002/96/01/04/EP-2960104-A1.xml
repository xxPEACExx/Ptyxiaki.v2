In particular, and for reasons of safety, it is highly important to obtain an optimal seating position for a driver in the driver's seat, in order to have high seating comfort and also a clear visual view out from the vehicle.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In particular, the driver needs a clear and unobstructed view of the surrounding traffic situation and also of the vehicle's instrument panel. Also, the driver needs a clear view of the vehicle's rear view mirrors, i.e. both the internal rear view mirror and the external rear view mirrors.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">To solve the above-mentioned requirements, it is today known to provide automatic seat adjustment systems which are adapted to provide input data by detecting the position of a driver in a driver's seat and to automatically adjust the position of a vehicle seat component such as a rear view mirror or a vehicle seat<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> depending on said input data. In this manner, the driver's position in the seat can be optimized.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The patent document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE19519619"><text>DE 19519619</text></patcit> discloses a system which is arranged for automatically adjusting the rear view mirrors of a vehicle. More precisely, the rear view mirrors are fitted with adjusting servo motors which are controlled by a processor. Furthermore, sensors in front of the position of the driver of the vehicle are configured to monitor the position of a driver's head and automatically set the programmed optimum setting for the interior rear view mirror and the two external mirrors.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Furthermore, the document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US4689537A"><text>US 4689537</text></patcit> discloses a driving position control system for a vehicle which may store user settings for different drivers in a memory. The system comprises a power seat having adjusting means responsive to a control signal from a control unit for adjusting the position of the seat, and detecting means for detecting the seating position of the seat and supplying a position signal to the control unit. The system may then adjust the seating position together with the angle of the mirror to an optimal position.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Consequently, it is previously known to control the positions of various vehicle components, such as a rear view mirror, in order to obtain an optimal driving position for a driver of a vehicle. It is also known to detect the vertical position of a driver's head in order to provide the most optimal positions for the vehicle seat and the rear view mirror.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Although the two above-mentioned patent documents suggest solutions to the problem of adapting the positions of certain vehicle components to the actual position of the driver of the vehicle, there is a continuing need for improved systems for monitoring various sensors in a vehicle in order to adapt the seating position for a driver of a vehicle.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In particular, there is a need for methods and systems which are more accurate than previous ones in determining and setting the relative vertical distance between various vehicle components.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">Consequently, an object of the invention is to provide a method which solves the above-mentioned problems related to prior art and provides a solution which is more accurate than previously known technology in order to set the relative vertical distance between different vehicle components, so as to provide an optimal seating position for the driver.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The object is achieved by a method for setting the relative vertical distance between a vehicle seat and at least a further vehicle component in a vehicle, said method comprising: providing input data related to the vertical position of a driver of said vehicle; and setting said vertical distance based on said input data. Furthermore, the method comprises: providing said input data based on information related to natural length changes of said driver of the vehicle due to human spine length decrease during daytime; and adjusting said vertical distance at least partly based on said input data.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The invention provides certain advantages over previously known technology, primarily due to the fact that it caters for naturally occurring length changes in the human spine during the course of a day. This means that the actual length of the driver will decrease slightly during a day, i.e after a night's sleep and rest. In this way, more accurate adjustments of the vertical position between the seat and a further vehicle component, for example a rear view mirror, can be obtained by means of the invention.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Also, the invention provides an advantage since the driver of a vehicle will not have to make any small adjustments of a rear view mirror, which otherwise would have to be made.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to an embodiment, the method further comprises setting said vertical distance by adjusting the vertical position of the vehicle seat. This means that the position of the vehicle seat is vertically adjusted, suitably by means of a control unit, in order to compensate for the natural length changes of the driver.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to a further embodiment, the method comprises setting the vertical distance by adjusting the vertical position of a rear view mirror in said vehicle. This means that the vertical distance between the seat and the rear view mirror can be adjusted by vertical adjustment of the position of the rear view mirror.

With initial reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, there is shown a vehicle in the form of a car 1 in which a driver 2 is seated<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> in a vehicle seat 3 in a conventional manner. The vehicle seat 3 comprises a seat cushion 3a and a backrest 3b.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The vertical position of the vehicle seat 3 can be adjusted, as schematically indicated by means of an arrow 4 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. To this end, the vehicle seat 3 is supported and adjustable by means of a motorized seat adjustment unit 5. The seat adjustment unit 5 is also arranged for setting the inclination of the backrest 3b. In this manner, it is possible to adjust the height of the seat cushion 3a and also to pivot the seat backrest 3b. According to previously known technology, the settings are suitably determined by means of an actuator (not shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) of conventional type by means of which the driver 2 may provide input to a computer-based control unit 6 in order to set the desired position of the vehicle seat 3. The control unit 6 is then configured for controlling various motorized units (now shown) in order to adjust the vehicle seat 3 as desired by the driver 2.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The general manner in which a seat adjustment unit 5 can be adapted for adjusting the position of the seat cushion 3a and backrest 3b based on manual input from a passenger or driver of a vehicle is known as such, and for this reason it is not described in further detail.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">According to the shown embodiment of the invention, the settings of the vehicle seat 3, as implemented by means of the seat adjustment unit 5, can be controlled in an automatic manner by means of the control unit 6. Such settings are based on input related to the vertical position of a driver 2. This will be described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The car 1 is furthermore provided with an additional component in the form of a rear view mirror 7 which is necessary for the driver 2 in order to assist with a clear view of the surrounding traffic. Although not shown in the drawings, the car 1 may also be equipped with conventional external rear view mirrors positioned on the exterior of the car 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">An essential purpose with the settings of the vehicle seat 3 is to ensure that the driver 2 has a vertical position which is appropriate considering the fact that the driver's 2 head should be on a suitable level with reference to the height and position of a rear view mirror 7. In its simplest form, i.e. as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the rear view mirror 7 can be fixedly arranged in the vehicle 7, i.e. having a fixed vertical position.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The invention is based on the insight that the length of the human spine decreases during daytime, i.e. after a night's sleep. This is due to the load which is imposed on the spine during daytime, as opposed to a corresponding situation during sleep at night when the person in question is lying down and rests. The main reason for the decrease in length of the spine during daytime is at that the spinal discs of the spine are compressed when a person stands and walks. In other words, it is the body weight of the person which compresses the spinal discs and decreases the length of the spine during daytime.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">On the other hand, during sleep at night, the compressive force acting upon the spine is relieved, which means that the discs are allowed to expand. For a normal adult person, the difference in length of the spine due to these compressive forces between morning and evening is approximately 10 mm.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In order to explain the principles of the invention, the spine of the driver 2 is indicated by means of reference numeral 8 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. The spine 8 extends from a lower end point 8a, which generally corresponds to the position of the so-called sacrum and up to a point close to the head of the driver 2. As indicated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, there is defined a distance d<sub>1</sub> which extends from said lower end point 8a of the spine and up to the vertical position of the driver's 2 eyes 9.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The distance d<sub>1</sub> as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> corresponds to a situation in the morning, i.e. when the spine 8 has been relieved from compressive forces during sleep. Consequently, the length of the spine 8 has its maximum value, which means that the distance d<sub>1</sub> is relatively long. In contrast, the distance d<sub>2</sub> as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> corresponds to a situation in the evening, i.e. after a day of walking and standing up, meaning that compressive forces cause the spine 8 to be compressed slightly. This means that the distance d<sub>2</sub> is slightly shorter than the distance d<sub>1</sub>. As indicated above, the difference between d<sub>1</sub> and d<sub>2</sub> is normally in the magnitude of 10 mm for an adult person of average length.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The invention is based on the principle that there is provided an adjustment of the relative vertical distance between the vehicle seat 3 and the rear view mirror 7 in order in order to compensate for the difference in length of the spine 8 between the morning and the evening. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> indicates in a schematic manner the effect of this change of the length of the spine 8, i.e. the length as measured from the lower end point 8a to the end of the spine 8 close to the head of the driver 2 decreases during the course of a day.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Even though the changes of the length of the spine 8 are relatively small, it has a noticeable effect on the position of the rear view mirror 7 as observed by the driver 2.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">To provide input data related to the changes of the spine 8, the embodiment in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> can be configured so that the driver may operate an actuator (not shown) in the vehicle 1, for example in the form of a push button or similar, which upon actuation saves the settings of the seat 3. Such a saving process can be carried out once in the morning and once in the evening and should correspond to optimal seat positions for the driver 2 on both occassions, i.e. it should correspond to morning and evening positions wherein the driver 2 has an optimal position with a clear and correct view of the surrounding traffic situation and of the vehicle's instrument panel.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The input data originating from the above-mentioned morning and evening settings, which normally are entered one single time and not every day, then forms the basis for automatic adjustments which are used during subsequent use of the system in the car 1 during a given day. In other words, the control unit 6 is<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> configured for automatically adjusting the relative vertical distance between the seat 3 and the rear view mirror 7 during a day, based on the driver's 2 morning and evening settings, in order to avoid further manual adjustments. These automatic adjustments are carried out by means of the control unit 6 issuing adjustment instructions to the seat adjustment unit 5 which is associated with the seat 3.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In summary, the invention as described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is arranged for setting the relative vertical distance between the seat 3 and the rear view mirror 7 and is arranged for providing input data related to the vertical position of a driver 2 and for setting the vertical distance based on said input data. Furthermore, the input data is based on information related to natural length changes of the driver due to human spine decrease during daytime. Adjustments of the vertical distance can then be based on said input data so that the position of the seat 3 is slightly adjusted during the day, either step by step or continuously.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">An alternative embodiment of the invention is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>. This embodiment generally corresponds to the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> but, in contrast to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, it shows an embodiment in which the rear view mirror 7 does not have a fixed vertical position but can be adjusted vertically. To this end, the embodiment includes a mirror adjustment unit 10 which is arranged for setting the vertical height of the rear view mirror 7, i.e. for adjusting the rear view mirror 7 in the vertical direction.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, the mirror adjustment unit 10 is connected to the control unit 6 and is also configured for receiving commands from the control unit 6 as to settings of the rear view mirror 7 in the vertical direction. This means that the principles of the invention - i.e. setting the vertical distance between the seat 3 and a further component such as the rear view mirror 7 - can be obtained either by adjusting the vertical position of either the rear view mirror 7 or by adjusting the vertical position of the seat 3, or by a combination of adjusting both the rear view mirror 7 and the seat 3.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0041" num="0041">A further embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, which shows an alternative way of providing input data which relates to natural length changes of said driver 2. More precisely, the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> comprises an image capturing device such as a camera 11 which is arranged close to the head of the driver 2. The camera 11 is configured for detecting the vertical position of the head of the driver 2, suitably by image analysis of captured images which gives information of the vertical position of the head. This input data can be provided at occasions corresponding to the morning and evening settings mentioned above, or can be provided at a number of times (or continuously) during the course of a day to provide input data corresponding to the length changes of the spine 8. This input data is then fed to the control unit 6 and used in order to set the relative vertical distance between the seat 3 and the rear view mirror 7 so that the driver 2 always has an optimal position as explained above.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The difference between this embodiment and the embodiment described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1 and 2</figref>, in which the driver 2 manually enters morning and evening settings, is that the camera 11 can be used in an automatic manner for providing relevant input data.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The embodiment as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> is particularly suitable to be used in vehicles which are already equipped with a camera which is used for safety reasons, for example for detecting if a driver is drowsy and may fall asleep. Such a camera may then additionally be used for detecting the position of, for example, the head or the eyes of the driver, in order to provide input data to be used for setting the relative vertical distanced between the seat 3 and the rear view mirror 7.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref> is a simplified flow chart describing the general principles of the invention. Initially, as mentioned above, it should be mentioned that input data related to the vertical position of the driver 2 is provided. This input data is provided either by manual settings of the driver 2, i.e. information as to the morning and evening<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> settings as described above (step 12) or by information provided by a camera as described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> (step 13).</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Said input data is then fed to the control unit 6 (step 14). Based on the input data, the control unit 6 is configured for setting a vertical distance between the vehicle seat 3 and the rear view mirror 7 (step 15). This means that input data based on the natural length changes due to human spine decrease will be taken into account for the setting. Also, during the course of a day, the control unit 6 is suitably configured for adjusting (step 16) the setting of the vertical distance between the vehicle seat 3 and the rear view mirror 7 since the spine 8 will gradually be compressed during the day. The input data previously obtained will be used during such adjustments.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above and illustrated in the drawings; rather, the skilled person will recognize that many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the appended claims.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">For example, the control unit 6 can be used for storing settings for different persons, for example different members of a family using the same car, in order to provide optimal adjustments of the relative vertical distance between the seat and a further component based on each person's natural length changes due to spine compression. In such case, each person using the car would have to enter information regarding his or her identity before using the car, in order for the control unit to provide the correct settings for that particular person. Such identity information can be provided for example by means of a smart card, an NFC tag or other suitable technology.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Also, the relative vertical distance discussed above can relate to a distance between a vehicle seat and an additional vehicle component, wherein said additional vehicle component can be a mirror (i.e. both internal and external rear view mirror), an instrument panel, a steering wheel or another component. Finally,<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> in the event that the vehicle in question is equipped with a head up display in a front windshield, the position of such a display may also be adjusted according to the principles of the invention.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90460068" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A method for setting the relative vertical distance between a vehicle seat (3) and at least a further vehicle component (7) in a vehicle (1), said method comprising:
