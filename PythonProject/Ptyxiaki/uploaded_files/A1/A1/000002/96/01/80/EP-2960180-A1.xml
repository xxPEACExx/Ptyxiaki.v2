This known flexible wrapping material is embodied as a sheet comprising a plurality of scored intersecting lines, and is movable from a first unfolded position into a second folded position by folding along the plurality of scored intersecting lines in a predefined sequence, wherein after the folding is completed the wrapping material forms a package with a predetermined shape having a decorative, hand-wrapped appearance.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20060054521A"><text>US2006/0054521</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="GB2496391A"><text>GB-A-2 496 391</text></patcit> each disclose a wrapping material for wrapping flowers and/or plants, comprising at least two connected parts having mutually distinctive shapes bordering next to each other along a straight line separating said parts from each other. The wrapping material of <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US20060054521A"><text>US2006/0054521</text></patcit> is flexible, whereas in comparison the wrapping material of <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="GB2496391A"><text>GB-A-2 496 391</text></patcit> is a carton and therefore relatively rigid.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is an object of the invention to provide a flexible wrapping material with a preferably decorative, but in any case hand-wrapped appearance at lower costs of manufacturing, in an easier way and with less requirements as to its preparation and with reference to its manner of completion into a folded package with a more consistent endresult compared to hand-wrapped production.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The flexible wrapping material of the invention has the features of one or more of the appended claims.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In a first aspect of the invention a flexible wrapping material for wrapping flowers and/or plants is proposed, comprising at least two connected or connectable parts having mutually distinctive shapes bordering next to each other along a straight line or region separating said parts from each other, wherein said parts are provided with mutually distinctive prints on said parts and/or said parts are provided with different optical properties and/or said parts are embodied in mutually different materials. When in this specification reference<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> is made to connected parts, the wrapping material is unitary. When in this specification reference is made to connectable parts, the wrapping material is made up from two separate parts that are connected to each other, for instance by gluing or by otherwise known connection means such as sealing or taping. Such known ways of connecting two separate parts to each other are obvious to the skilled person and require no further elucidation. The irregular and different shapes of the connected or connectable parts form the root of the eventual hand-wrapped appearance of the wrapping material after its completion in wrapped form.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Desirably the at least two connected or connectable parts are foldable towards each other along said straight line or region, which straight line or region is arranged such that after folding the two connected parts together, said connected or connectable parts at least partly overlap each other. Preferably the shapes of the connected or connectable parts are distinctive so as to arrange that after their folding together, the parts only partly overlap.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The effect of the hand-wrapping appearance is particularly promoted by arranging that said parts are provided with mutually distinctive prints on said parts or with different optical properties, for instance one being translucent and the other not. In addition or instead of that it is also possible that said parts are embodied in mutually different materials. Suitably one part is for instance embodied in a plastic material and the other part is embodied in a woven or nonwoven fabric material.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">To achieve best effects it is preferable that after the two connected or connectable parts are being folded against each other, said connected parts are further foldable by one or more further folds, each further fold occurring along a virtual line symmetrically dividing the wrapping material in a left part and a right part, wherein after the fold is completed said left part and said right part are adjacent to each other.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Preferably after completion of the final fold neighbouring edges of the adjacent left part and right part are sealed to each other so as to construct the final shape of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the product.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Advantageously the wrapping material is provided with a cutout by removal of material of the connected parts, thus enabling that the flowers can be received in the package.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The invention will hereinafter be further elucidated with reference to the drawing of an exemplary embodiment of an apparatus according to the invention that is not limiting as to the appended claims.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the drawing:

The flexible wrapping material 1 can be a unitary cut from a larger sheet of a single material, or be obtained from several cuts in several materials. The flexible wrapping material 1 comprises at least two connected or connectable parts 2, 3 having mutually distinctive shapes bordering next to each other along a straight line or region 4 separating said parts 2, 3 from each other. Hence, when in this application reference is made to <u>connected</u> parts 2, 3, the wrapping material is made from a unitary cut of a single material. When in this application reference is made to <u>connectable</u> parts 2, 3, the wrapping material is made up from two separate parts that are made by several cuts in several materials that are afterwards connected to each other, for instance by gluing or by otherwise known means such as a sealing or taping. Such known ways of connecting two separate parts 2, 3 to each other are obvious to the skilled person and require no further elucidation.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The at least two connected or connectable parts 2, 3<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> are preferably foldable towards each other along said straight line or region 4, wherein said straight line or region 4 is arranged such that after their folding along said line or region 4, the two connected or connectable parts 2, 3 at least partly lie on top of each other or overlap. This is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1B</figref> for the first embodiment of the wrapping material of the invention, and in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2B</figref> for the second embodiment of the wrapping material of the invention.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Both <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2A</figref> are very clear in showing that the shapes of the connected parts 2, 3 are distinctive so as to arrange that after their folding together as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1B</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2B</figref> respectively, the parts 2, 3 only partly overlap.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">To support the distinction between the two parts 2, 3 said parts are for instance provided with mutually distinctive prints on said parts 2, 3. It is however also possible that said parts 2, 3 are embodied in mutually different materials or with different optical properties, such as one part translucent and the other part not translucent. When made of different materials one part, for instance part 2, is preferably embodied in a plastic material and the other part (part 3) is embodied in a woven or nonwoven fabric material. It can of course also be the other way around wherein part 2 is made from woven or nonwoven fabric material, and part 3 is a plastic material.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As mentioned above the at least two connected or connectable parts 2, 3 are foldable towards each other along said straight line or region 4 so as to arrange that the two connected parts 2, 3 will partly overlap each other. It is preferred that after the two connected or connectable parts 2, 3 are being folded against each other, said connected parts 2, 3 are further foldable by one or more further folds. With reference to the first embodiment of the wrapping material 1 as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1A</figref> this is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1C</figref> corresponding to one further fold only. With reference to the second embodiment of the wrapping material 1 as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2A</figref>, this is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">figures 2C and 2D</figref> respectively. This relates to two subsequent folds. Each further fold applied after folding the two parts 2, 3 together, occurs along a virtual line or<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> region symmetrically dividing the wrapping material in a left part and a right part, wherein after the fold is completed said left part and said right part are overlapping each other. This is clear for the skilled person from what is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figures 1C</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0002">2C and 2D</figref> respectively. After completion of the final fold neighbouring edges 5 of the adjacent left part and right part are sealed to each other. See <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1D</figref> for the first embodiment and <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2E</figref> for the second embodiment. Sealing can be affected in many ways for instance by heating, gluing or by ultrasonic sealing.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Finally, <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1D</figref> for the first embodiment, and <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2E</figref> for the second embodiment depict that the wrapping material 1 is provided with a cutout 6 by removal of material of the connected parts.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Although the invention has been discussed in the foregoing with reference to two exemplary embodiments of the wrapping material of the invention, the invention is not restricted to these two embodiments which can be varied in many ways without departing from the gist of the invention.
