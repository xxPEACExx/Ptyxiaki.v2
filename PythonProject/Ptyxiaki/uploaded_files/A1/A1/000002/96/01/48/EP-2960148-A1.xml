The electrical machines are typically arranged in a twin or tandem configuration. A fault in one of the electrical machines will typically mean that the drive shaft cannot be used until the fault is cleared.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">An objective of the present invention is to provide a drive shaft, with two driving electrical machines, where an electrical machine, typically the electrical machine that is closest to the load, can be disconnected easily, when faulty, so that the drive shaft can be returned to service and driven by the remaining electrical machine.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In particular, the present invention provides a drive shaft comprising:
<ul><li>an inner shaft having:
<ul><li>a first end that is adapted to be connectable to a first connecting shaft that is rotated by torque applied by an external electrical machine (e.g., an electric motor);</li><li>a second end that is adapted to be connectable to a second connecting shaft; and</li><li>a hollow outer shaft, coaxial with the inner shaft, the outer shaft defining at least part of, or being operatively coupled to, a rotor assembly of an associated electrical machine (e.g., an electric motor that is part of a drive assembly), and being adapted to<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> be releasably connected to the inner shaft so that the drive shaft is selectively configurable in a first arrangement for normal operating conditions where the outer shaft is connected to the inner shaft for rotation therewith, and a second arrangement where the outer shaft is not connected to the inner shaft.</li></ul></li></ul></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It will be readily appreciated that the first and second connecting shafts do not form part of the drive shaft <i>per se</i> but that the ends of the drive shaft are connected to the first and second connecting shafts in use. The second connecting shaft can be directly or indirectly coupled to any suitable load, e.g., a propulsion means such as a propeller, impeller, water jet etc. in the case of a marine propulsion assembly. Similarly, the external electrical machine and the non-related parts of the associated electrical machine (e.g., the stator assembly, active parts of the rotor assembly etc.) do not form part of the drive shaft <i>per se</i> but can apply a torque to the drive shaft in use. The electrical machines can have any suitable construction and can be arranged in a twin or tandem configuration. The outer shaft of the drive shaft can carry the active parts of the rotor assembly of the associated electrical machine or can be directly or indirectly coupled to the rotor assembly. In general terms, the external electrical machine will be operated to apply torque to the inner shaft through the first connecting shaft to which it can be directly or indirectly coupled. The associated electrical machine will be operated to apply torque to the outer shaft.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The inner shaft can be rated to take a higher torque than that delivered by the associated electrical machine.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The first end of the inner shaft can include a connecting flange that is connectable to a corresponding connecting flange of the first connecting shaft. Similarly, the second end of the inner shaft can include a connecting flange that is connectable to a corresponding connecting flange of the second connecting shaft. The first and second connecting shafts are therefore connected to the first and second ends of the inner shaft in use for rotation therewith. The connecting flange at the second end of the inner shaft can be releasably connected to the inner shaft. This allows the connecting flange to be fitted to the inner shaft after it has been properly located within the outer shaft. The<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> respective connecting flanges can be connected together using mechanical fixings such as bolts, pins, clamps etc.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The inner shaft can include a first intermediate flange that is releasably connected to a flange provided at a first end of the outer shaft, e.g., using mechanical fixings such as bolts, pins, clamps etc. that can be removed to disconnect the inner and outer shafts at the first end and configure the drive shaft in the second arrangement. In one arrangement, the mechanical fixings are expanding hydraulic bolts. The drive shaft can further comprise a spacer between the first intermediate flange and the first end flange of the outer shaft. Any suitable spacer can be used. In one arrangement the spacer can be a segmented ring spacer that is divided into two or more segments, each segment receiving at least one mechanical fixing such as a bolt. Such a spacer can be removed in a radial direction while the inner shaft remains in place.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">To provide additional protection against high shock loading, the inner and outer shafts can be releasably connected at both ends of the outer shaft. In particular, the inner shaft can further include a second intermediate flange that is releasably connected to a flange provided at a second end of the outer shaft, e.g., using mechanical fixings such as bolts, pins, clamps etc. that can be removed to disconnect the inner and outer shafts at the second end and configure the drive shaft in the second arrangement. The drive shaft can further comprise a spacer between the second intermediate flange and the second end flange of the outer shaft. Once again, any suitable spacer can be used, e.g., a segmented ring spacer. Each spacer between an intermediate flange and the adjacent end flange of the outer shaft can be removed when the inner and outer shafts are disconnected to allow a clear gap to be created between the respective flanges.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In general terms, it will be readily appreciated that any suitable means can be used to releasably connect the inner and outer shafts to enable the drive shaft to be selectively configurable in the first or second arrangement. Such means can be provided at one or both ends of the outer shaft. The means can be a coupling of any suitable type (e.g., flange, viscous, magnetic, flexible etc.) or a clutch assembly of any suitable type (e.g., dog, friction, magnetic etc.). It will be readily appreciated that such means do not<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> necessarily need to use corresponding flanges on the inner and outer shafts. The inner and outer shafts can be physically adapted or constructed in other ways to facilitate their releasable connection.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">During normal operating conditions, torque from the external electrical machine can be transmitted between the first and second connecting shafts through the inner shaft. Torque from the associated electrical machine can also be transmitted between the outer shaft and the inner shaft through the intermediate flange(s). In the case of a fault condition which prevents the outer shaft from being rotated, the inner and outer shafts can be disconnected (e.g., by removing the bolts, pins, claims or other mechanical fixings, or by operating the clutch assembly) so that torque can still be transmitted between the first and second connecting shafts through the inner shaft. This means that the drive shaft can still be used even if there is a fault that requires the outer shaft to remain stationary.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The connecting flanges and intermediate flanges of the inner shaft are preferably located axially outside the outer shaft.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The outer shaft can further comprise one or more collars to prevent lateral movement of the drive shaft. Such collars are not normally intended to bear thrust load.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The present invention further provides a drive assembly comprising:
<ul><li>a drive shaft as herein described; and</li><li>an associated electrical machine having a rotor assembly defined at least in part by, or operatively coupled to, the outer shaft.</li></ul></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The drive assembly can further comprise one or more bearings for supporting the drive shaft.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The drive assembly can further comprise locking means for selectively preventing rotation of the outer shaft when the drive shaft is in the second arrangement.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The drive shaft (or the drive assembly) can be part of a marine propulsion assembly where the second connecting shaft can be used to drive propulsion means, e.g., a propeller, impeller, water jet etc. A marine propulsion assembly can also include components such as one or more plummer blocks, thrust block etc.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The present invention further provides a method of operating a drive shaft comprising:
<ul><li>an inner shaft having:
