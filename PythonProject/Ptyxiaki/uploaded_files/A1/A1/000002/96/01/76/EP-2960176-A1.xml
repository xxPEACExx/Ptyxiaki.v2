The edge of the valve body part 131 of the check valve 130 installed in the lid 120 through the fixing part 136 maintains a state pressing on the top surface of the lid 120. In other words, in a state that the check valve 130 is installed in the lid 120 through the fixing part 136, the edge of the valve body part 131 is pressed by the surface of the lid 120.

The edge protrusion 139 is for maintaining the vacuum state much longer, by making the edge of the valve body part 131 thicker in a ring shape so that the ring shape is not deformed when the vacuum level in the vacuum container 100 is low and also high. In a case that there is no edge protrusion 139, it is not easy to obtain symmetry according to the variation of the vacuum level in directions of front-and-rear and right-and-left in the thin edge of the valve body part 131, which is disadvantageous in maintaining the vacuum level.
