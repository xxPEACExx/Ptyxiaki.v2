A solution to the problem is described in the following.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to one aspect of the present invention, a seat device includes: a seat part that is upward-downward swingably supported and is capable of changing a posture thereof to a use posture that allows sitting on the seat part and to a non-use posture that does not allow sitting on the seat part; a support part that is upward-downward swingably supported and supports the seat part in a state in which the seat part has been changed to the use posture; a guide part in which a free groove that slidably guides a predetermined portion of the support part and a regulation groove that regulates sliding of the predetermined portion in the state in which the seat part has been changed to the use posture are formed, the guide part being fixed on the seat part; a biasing member that biases the support part so that the predetermined portion is held in the regulation groove in the state in which the seat part has been changed to the use posture; and a release member that causes the predetermined portion to slide from the regulation groove to the free groove by causing the support part to swing in a first direction against a biasing force of the biasing member.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">With this configuration, the seat part can be easily changed from the use posture to the non-use posture.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to a preferred embodiment of the above-mentioned seat device, a first groove and a second groove are formed in the regulation groove. Thereby the seat part can be reliably held in the use posture.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to another preferred embodiment of any one of the above-mentioned seat devices, the first groove section is configured to regulate or guide a first movement of the predetermined portion during upward swinging of the seat part from the use posture. The first groove preferably regulates, at a first end thereof, sliding of the predetermined portion and guides the predetermined portion to slide from the first end to a second end accompanying upward swinging of the seat part that is in the state in which the seat part has been changed to the use posture.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to another preferred embodiment of any one of the above-mentioned seat devices, the second groove section is configured to regulate or guide the predetermined portion after upward swinging of the seat part from the use posture.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to another preferred embodiment of any one of the above-mentioned seat devices, the second groove section is configured to regulate or guide the predetermined portion after upward swinging of the seat part from the non-use posture. Thereby, the seat part can be stably held in the non-use posture.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to another preferred embodiment of any one of the above-mentioned seat devices, the second groove section is configured to regulate or guide the predetermined portion during release of the release member.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to another preferred embodiment of any one of the above-mentioned seat devices, the second groove section is configured to regulate or guide the predetermined portion as it moves between the first groove section and the free groove or vice versa.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The second groove preferably guides the predetermined portion to slide from an end that is connected to the second end of the first groove to an end that is connected to the free groove accompanying swinging of the support part in the first direction due to the release member.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to another preferred embodiment of any one of the above-mentioned seat devices,, the biasing member biases the support part so that the predetermined portion is held in the free groove in the state in which the seat part has been changed to the non-use posture.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to another preferred embodiment of any one of the above-mentioned seat devices, the release member is arranged near an outer edge of the seat part and has an operation<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> part that is operated by a worker or user. Thereby, the seat part can be more easily changed from the use posture to the non-use posture.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to another preferred embodiment of any one of the above-mentioned seat devices, the seat device is a passenger or auxiliary seat arranged in a vehicle cabin.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to a second aspect of the present invention, a seat device includes: a seat part that is upward-downward swingably supported and is capable of changing a posture thereof to a use posture that allows sitting on the seat part and to a non-use posture that does not allow sitting on the seat part; a support part that is upward-downward swingably supported and supports the seat part in the state in which the seat part has been changed to the use posture; a guide part that is formed to extend in a predetermined direction, has a groove capable of changing the seat part to the use posture and to the non-use posture by slidably guiding a predetermined portion of the support part, and is fixed on the seat part; and a biasing member that biases the support part toward a swinging position at which the support part can support the seat part in the state in which the seat part has been changed to the use posture. In a state in which the seat part has been changed to the use posture, a direction along which a biasing force acts on the predetermined portion due to the biasing member and a formation direction of the groove are different. In other words, in the use posture, the biasing member is oriented along a first direction and the groove is oriented along a second direction that is different from the first direction.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">With this configuration, the seat part can be reliably held in the use posture.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to a preferred embodiment of the seat device of the second aspect, the portion of the support part is prevented from engaging with the groove until a release member is activated.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to a third aspect of the present invention, a seat device includes: a seat part that is swingably mounted and is capable of moving between an up deployed position allowing seating and a non-deployed and folded-down position; a support that is swingably mounted and is capable of moving between a supporting position wherein the seat part is in deployed position and a non-supporting position wherein the seat part is in the non-deployed and folded-down position; a guide coupled to a bottom side of seat part and comprising first and second groove sections configured to guide movement of a portion of the support between the up deployed position and the non-deployed and folded-down position; a biasing member biasing the support toward the supporting position; and a release member accessible to a user, wherein the portion of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the support engages with the first groove section at least when the seat part moves upward from the up deployed position, and wherein the portion of the support is prevented from engaging with the second groove section until the user activates the release member.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to a preferred embodiment of the seat device of the third aspect, the seat is a passenger or auxiliary seat arranged in a work vehicle cabin.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">According to another preferred embodiment of any one of the seat devices above-mentioned, the seat device preferably further includes a frame.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Preferably, the seat device further includes a free groove. The free groove is preferably a portion formed to extend from a front part of the guide member to a rear part in substantially a front-rear direction. As a result, a swing angle of the seat part can be assured.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The free groove preferably penetrates through the guide member in a left-right direction. As a result, the support part is reliably held.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The free groove is preferably arranged at a position lower, in a side view, than an abutment member supporting a predetermined portion of the support part in a use posture. As a result, the support part can be reliably held.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The seat device preferably includes a first groove. The first groove is preferably arranged above the free groove. A first end of the first groove is further preferably formed in a semicircular shape that follows an outer shape of a predetermined portion of the support part. As a result, the support part can be reliably held.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The abutment member is arranged at the first end of the first groove. The abutment member supports the predetermined portion of the support part in the use posture. As a result, the seat part is reliably held in the use posture. The first groove is preferably a portion formed to extend downward from the first end. As a result, the support part can be displaced smoothly toward a second groove described hereafter.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The seat device preferably further includes the second groove. The second groove is preferably a portion formed to extend substantially downward from a second end of the first groove. As a result, the support part can be displaced smoothly toward the free groove.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In a state in which the seat part has been changed to the use posture, the biasing member is preferably in a state of being oriented with its longitudinal direction in a direction that is slightly inclined upward with respect to the forward direction. As a result, the seat part can be reliably held in the use posture.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">A front-rear direction middle part of the biasing member is preferably arranged above a rotation shaft in a side view, the rotation shaft rotatably coupling the support part to the frame. As a result, when the biasing member is changed to a non-use posture, in a side view, the front-rear direction middle part moves from above the rotation shaft to below the rotation shaft. In addition, in the state in which the biasing member has been changed to the non-use posture, the biasing member biases the support part to swing downward by pulling on the support part. Therefore, in the state in which the seat part of the seat device has been changed to the non-use posture, the seat part can be prevented from swinging upward due to vibration and the like when a tractor is traveling.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In the state in which the seat part has been changed to the use posture, the biasing member biases the support part in substantially the rearward direction by pulling on the support part. As a result, in the state in which the seat part has been changed to the use posture, the biasing member can bias the support part to swing upward.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The release member is preferably arranged below a left front part of the seat part. As a result, a worker can easily operate the release member.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The release member is preferably upward-downward swingably supported on a release rotation shaft via a coupling member and a release abutment member. A rear end part of the release abutment member is swung downward by swinging the release member upward. Thus, the release abutment member is configured to be in contact with a front upper end of the support part and capable of swinging the support part downward.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">According to this, when changing the seat part of the seat device to the non-use posture, the worker can swing the release member in a comfortable posture.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In the seat device according to a preferred embodiment, the seat part can be held in the use posture and the non-use posture by only the biasing member. Therefore, in the seat device, by simply swinging the seat part upward and downward, the posture of the seat part can be easily changed without separately performing an operation in order to hold the seat part.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Also, the seat device preferably further includes a regulation groove. The regulation groove 54 is formed in a folded-back shape with respect to the free groove. Therefore, in the seat device, when the seat part is changed to the use posture or the non-use posture, the seat part is briefly put in a posture in which the seat part is lifted upward from the use posture. Therefore, when the support part is caught in the free groove or the regulation groove when the posture of<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the seat part is changed, the seat part is in a posture in which the seat part has been lifted upward. Therefore, the worker can easily understand that the support part is caught when the seat part is inclined. Further, the seat device has a configuration in which the worker changes the seat part to the non-use posture by performing a lifting operation of the seat part and an operation of the release member. Therefore, the seat part can be reliably prevented from moving to the non-use posture at a time that is not intended by the worker.</p><heading id="h0006"><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p id="p0042" num="0042">The present invention is further described in the detailed description which follows, in reference to the noted plurality of drawings by way of non-limiting examples of exemplary embodiments of the present invention, in which like reference numerals represent similar parts throughout the several views of the drawings, and wherein:

By performing such an operation of the lever 70, the worker causes the seat support 40 to swing downward relative to the seat part 30.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">Thus, the worker causes the sliding part 40a to slide from the second end of the first groove 54a and via the second groove 54b to the free groove 52 (see the sliding part 40a illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8B</figref>).</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">Thereafter, the worker releases the lifting operation of the seat part 30 and the operation of the lever 70. As a result, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008 f0009">Figs. 8A - 9B</figref>, the worker causes the seat part 30 to swing downward by its own weight. In this case, the front upper end of the seat support 40 passes below the second abutment member 32b of the seat part 30 to move to a front side of the second abutment member 32b. Thus, the worker causes the sliding part 40a to slide along the<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> free groove 52 and the seat support 40 to swing downward (see an arrow illustrated inside the free groove 52 in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9B</figref>).</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">By causing the sliding part 40a to slide to the front part of the free groove 52, the worker changes the seat part 30 to the non-use posture.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">As described above, the worker can easily change the seat part 30 of the seat device 10 to the non-use posture by only operating the lever 70 once.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">Further, the seat device 10 has a configuration in which the worker changes the seat part 30 to the non-use posture by performing a lifting operation of the seat part 30 and an operation of the lever 70. Therefore, the seat part 30 can be reliably prevented from changing or moving to the non-use posture at a time that is not intended by the worker. Therefore, the seat part 30 of the seat device 10 can be reliably held in the use posture. For example, even when the seat part 30 is lifted due to vibration and the like, as long as the lever 70 is not operated, the seat part 30 is not changed to the non-use posture. Further, even when the lever 70 is inadvertently operated, as long as the seat part 30 is not lifted, the seat part 30 is not changed to the non-use posture.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">As described above, the seat device 10 has a configuration in which, when the sliding part 40a slides along the front-rear direction middle part of the free groove 52, the dead point is crossed and the seat support 40 is biased to swing downward by the pulling of the spring 60 (see the black arrow illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9B</figref>).</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">According to this, when the seat part 30 of the seat device 10 is changed to the non-use posture, the seat part 30 can be biased to swing downward due to the spring 60. Therefore, in the state in which the seat part 30 of the seat device 10 has been changed to the non-use posture, the seat part 30 can be prevented from swinging upward due to vibration and the like when the tractor is traveling. Therefore, the seat part 30 of the seat device 10 can be stably held in the non-use posture.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">Thus, in the state in which the seat part 30 has been changed to the non-use posture, the spring 60 biases the seat support 40 so that the sliding part 40a is held in the free groove 52, that is, so that the sliding part 40a moves to the front part of the free groove 52.</p><p id="p0105" num="0105">As described above, the grip 72 of the lever 70 is arranged near the front end of the seat part 30, that is, near an outer edge of the seat part where the grip 72 can be easily gripped by the worker. According to this, when changing the seat part 30 of the seat device 10 to the non-use posture, the worker can swing the lever 70 in a comfortable posture. Therefore, the seat device<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> 10 can have a configuration that allows the worker to easily perform the operation of the lever 70 and the lifting (swinging) operation of the seat part 30.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">Further, in the seat device 10, the first abutment member 32a is arranged at a position in contact with the rubber part 22 when the seat part 30 has been swung downward.

As a result, the worker causes the sliding part 40a to slide from the rear end of the free groove 52 to the second groove 54b. Thereafter, the worker releases the lifting operation of the seat part 30.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">As described above, the spring 60 crosses the dead point when the sliding part 40a slides along the front-rear direction middle part of free groove 52. Therefore, when the sliding part 40a slides in the second groove 54b, the spring 60 biases the seat support 40 to swing upward (see the black arrow illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7B</figref>).</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">As a result, in the seat device 10, when the worker releases the lifting operation of the seat part 30, the sliding part 40a is caused to slide such that it does not return to the free groove 52 (when the seat part 30 swings downward, the sliding part 40a slides from the second groove<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> 54b to the first groove 54a). Thus, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>, in the seat device 10, the sliding part 40a and the first groove 54a of the regulation groove 54 engage each other, the front upper end of the seat support 40 and the second abutment member 32b of the seat part 30 are in contact with each other, and the seat part 30 is held in the state in which the seat part 30 has been changed to the use posture. Thus, the worker can change the seat part 30 of the seat device 10 from the non-use posture to the use posture by simply lifting the seat part 30.</p><p id="p0114" num="0114">In the seat device 10, by biasing the seat support 40 using such a spring 60, even when the seat part 30 swings upward and the sliding part 40a slides to the second groove 54b due to vibration and the like when the tractor travels, the sliding part 40a can be returned to the first end of the first groove 54a (see the black arrow illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7B</figref>). Thus, the worker can change the seat part 30 of the seat device 10 to the use posture by simply lifting the seat part 30, and a stable use posture can be maintained.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">As described above, in the state in which the seat part 30 has been changed to the use posture, the spring 60 biases the seat support 40 so that the sliding part 40a is held in the regulation groove 54, that is, so that the sliding part 40a is returned to the first groove 54a of the regulation groove 54 (the sliding part 40a does not slide to the free groove 52 when the seat part 30 swings upward).</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">Thus, in the state in which the seat part 30 has been changed to the use posture, the spring 60 biases the seat support 40 toward a swinging position (position of the sliding part 40a illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>) at which the seat part 30 can be supported. Further, in the state in which the seat part 30 has been changed to the use posture, the spring 60 biases the sliding part 40a in a direction different from a formation direction of the free groove 52 and the regulation groove 54 (more specifically, a formation direction of a portion that guides the sliding part 40a). As a result, the seat device 10 has a configuration in which the seat part 30 that has been changed to the use posture can be reliably held.</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">In the seat device 10 according to the present embodiment, the seat part 30 can be held in the use posture and the non-use posture by only the spring 60.

Therefore, when the sliding part 40a is caught in the free groove 52 or the regulation groove 54 (when the sliding of the sliding part 40a is stopped), when the posture of the seat part 30 is changed, the seat part 30 is in a posture in which the seat part 30 has been lifted upward.
