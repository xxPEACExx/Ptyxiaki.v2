Note that the airbag device of the above configuration is provided with an airbag having a single inflation section (known as a single chamber). The internal pressure is accordingly uniform across all locations that could contact the seated occupant. However, in consideration of differences in resilience of respective parts of the human body (for example, front parts of the chest and abdomen have low resilience), there is a limit to how high the internal pressure of the airbag can be raised. Namely, there is room for improvement from the perspective of suppressing movement of a seated occupant using the airbag (securing/improving on a required restraint performance).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A subject of the present invention is to obtain a far side airbag device capable of effectively suppressing movement of a seated occupant toward a vehicle center side in the vehicle width direction.</p><heading id="h0004">Summary</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">A far side airbag device of a first aspect of the present invention includes: a side airbag provided to a side section on a vehicle center side of a seatback in a vehicle width direction, the side airbag including a rear inflation section that inflates and deploys when supplied with gas and that restrains at least rear parts of the chest and abdomen of a seated occupant, and a front inflation section that inflates and deploys when supplied with gas through a communication path formed at a boundary with the rear inflation section and that restrains at least front parts of the chest and abdomen of the seated occupant; a fixing structure that fixes the side airbag to a seatback frame at the rear inflation section; and a tension cloth that receives tension and deploys accompanying inflation and deployment of the side airbag, wherein a vehicle front-rear direction front end side of the tension cloth is connected to the side airbag and a vehicle front-rear direction rear end side of the tension<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> cloth is connected to the seatback frame, and in a deployed state, the tension cloth covers at least a portion of the rear inflation section as viewed from a side of the seatback.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In this far side airbag device, in the event of a side-on collision for example, the rear inflation section inflates and deploys when the rear inflation section is supplied with gas, and the front inflation section inflates and deploys when the front inflation section is supplied with gas through the communication path from the rear inflation section. The rear inflation section, that contacts the rear parts of the chest and abdomen of the seated occupant that have relatively high resilience, inflates and deploys with a relatively high internal pressure, and the front inflation section, that contacts the front parts of the chest and abdomen of the seated occupant that have relatively low resilience, inflates and deploys with a relatively low internal pressure.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The tension cloth receives tension between respective connection portions connecting the tension cloth to the side airbag and the seatback frame accompanying inflation and deployment of the side airbag, and deploys to cover at least a portion of the rear inflation section as viewed from the side of the seatback. The tension cloth restricts rotation of the side airbag, namely the rear inflation section, about a fixing location to the seatback frame configured by the fixing structure and movement of the side airbag toward the rear at the vehicle center side in the vehicle width direction is restricted. Due to the tension cloth, the side airbag obtains a reaction force from the seatback frame at the relatively high pressure rear inflation section, thereby suppressing movement of the seated occupant toward the vehicle center side in the vehicle width direction (restraining the seated occupant).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The first aspect accordingly enables movement of the seated occupant toward the vehicle center side in the vehicle width direction to be more effectively suppressed in the event of a side-on collision or the like than in a configuration in which a tension cloth is not provided.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A far side airbag device of a second aspect of the present invention is the first aspect, wherein the rear inflation section includes a shoulder restraint portion that restrains the shoulder region of the seated occupant in an inflated and deployed state, and the tension cloth deploys to cover at least a portion of the shoulder restraint portion as viewed from the side of the seatback.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In this far side airbag device, the shoulder restraint portion of the side airbag effectively restrains the seated occupant at the shoulder region, this being a part of human body with high resilience. In particular, the tension cloth, that covers at least a portion of the shoulder restraint portion as viewed from the side of the seatback, effectively restricts movement of the shoulder restraint portion toward the vehicle center side in the vehicle width<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> direction.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A far side airbag device of a third aspect of the present invention is either the first aspect or the second aspect, including, as the tension cloth, an outside tension cloth with the rear end side thereof connected to a portion of the seatback frame positioned to the rear side of the fixing structure in the vehicle front-rear direction, and that deploys at the seat width direction outside of the side airbag.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In this far side airbag device, the outside tension cloth deploys at the seat width direction outside of the rear inflation section (at the vehicle center side in the vehicle width direction) due to tensile force. The outside tension cloth presses the side airbag against the seatback frame at a portion further to the rear side than the fixing location to the seatback frame. This pressing force and a moment due to the pressing force restrict the side airbag that receives load toward the vehicle center side in the vehicle width direction from the seated occupant from rotating about the location where the fixing structure fixes the side airbag to the seatback frame.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">A far side airbag device of a fourth aspect of the present invention is the third aspect, wherein in plan view, a peripheral length of the outside tension cloth from a connection location with the side airbag to a connection location with the seatback frame is the same as or less than a peripheral length of the side airbag from a fixing location with the seatback frame to the connection location with the outside tension cloth.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In this far side airbag device, the peripheral length between the front and rear ends of the outside tension cloth is the same as or less than the peripheral length of the side airbag from the fixing location with the seatback frame to the connection location with the outside tension cloth. Tension accordingly acts on the outside tension cloth accompanying inflation and deployment of the side airbag, and the outside tension cloth restricts rotation of the rear inflation section about the fixing location of the rear inflation section to the seatback frame by the fixing structure.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A far side airbag device of a fifth aspect of the present invention is the configuration of any one of the first aspect to the fourth aspect, including, as the tension cloth, an inside tension cloth that deploys at the seat width direction inside of the side airbag.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In this far side airbag device, the inside tension cloth that receives tension and deploys at the seat width direction inside (seat center side) of the side airbag supports the rear inflation section by pulling from the seat width direction inside. This support (tensile) force restricts rotation of the side airbag, that receives load toward the vehicle width direction central side from the seated occupant, about the fixing location of the side airbag to the seatback frame with the fixing structure.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">A far side airbag device of a sixth aspect of the present invention is any one of the first aspect to the fifth aspect, wherein the front inflation section includes a portion that inflates and deploys to the upper side of the rear inflation section in a vehicle up-down direction, and the tension cloth deploys to cover at least an upper portion of the rear inflation section.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In this far side airbag device, the tension cloth restricts at least an upper portion of the rear inflation section, namely a vehicle up-down direction central portion of the side airbag, from moving toward the front. Namely, the inflation and deployment position (trajectory) of the rear inflation section is stabilized. The upper portion of the rear inflation section that has relatively high internal pressure is a location with a relatively high potential to interfere a seated occupant when the occupant sits in an irregular seating posture (out of position). However, restricting movement of this location contributes to a reduction in the likelihood of interference of the rear inflation section with a seated occupant when in an irregular seating posture.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A far side airbag device of a seventh aspect of the present invention is any one of the first aspect to the sixth aspect, wherein a length of the tension cloth in the vehicle up-down direction at the rear end side of the tension cloth is shorter than a length of the tension cloth in the vehicle up-down direction at the front end side of the tension cloth.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In this far side airbag device, the up-down width of the tension cloth is short on the side where the tension cloth is connected to the seatback frame, thereby simplifying the connection structure of the tension cloth to the seatback frame. Connection to a curved seatback frame is also made simple.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A far side airbag device of an eighth aspect of the present invention is any one of the first aspect to the seventh aspect, wherein the front end side of the tension cloth is connected to the side airbag at a boundary between the rear inflation section and the front inflation section.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">This far side airbag device enables the rear inflation section, that inflates and deploys with a relatively high internal pressure, to be directly supported (movement-restricted) by the seatback frame.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A far side airbag device of a ninth aspect of the present invention is the fifth aspect, wherein at least one out of the rear end side of the outside tension cloth or a rear end side of the inside tension cloth is connected to the fixing structure.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In this far side airbag device, rotation of the side airbag, namely of the rear inflation section, about the fixing location of the side airbag to the seatback frame with the fixing structure (movement toward the rear at the vehicle center side in the vehicle width direction)<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> is restricted.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A far side airbag device of a tenth aspect of the present invention is any one of the first aspect to the ninth aspect, wherein the front end side of the tension cloth is connected to the front inflation section.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As described above, the far side airbag device according to the present aspects exhibits the excellent advantageous effect of enabling movement of a seated occupant toward the vehicle center side in the vehicle width direction to be more effectively suppressed than in a configuration in which a tension cloth is not provided.</p><heading id="h0005">Brief Description of the Drawings</heading><p id="p0027" num="0027">Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail based on the following figures, wherein:

Unless specifically indicated, reference to the shape of the side airbag 20 in the following explanation refers to the shape in an inflated and deployed state.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The side airbag 20 is divided (segmented) into two inflation sections 26, 28, adjacent to the front and rear of each other. Specifically, as viewed from the side, part of the side airbag 20 that inflates on receipt of a gas supply is divided into a rear inflation section 26 configuring a rear lower portion of the side airbag 20, and a front inflation section 28 configuring the remainder of the part. In other words, a space inside the side airbag 20 is partitioned into a rear chamber 26C that is a space inside the rear inflation section 26, and a front chamber 28C that is a space inside the front inflation section 28. In the present exemplary embodiment, the boundary between the rear inflation section 26 and the front inflation section 28 is formed by stitching together a base cloth on both vehicle width direction sides of the side airbag 20 at a seam 30.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The rear inflation section 26, namely the rear chamber 26C, includes a main inflation portion 26M that, as viewed from the side, has a rectangular shape that is long in the up-down direction, following the seatback 14, and a secondary inflation portion 26S that projects out toward the front from an upper end side of the main inflation portion 26M.

The rear chamber 26C and the front chamber 28C are in communication with each other through communication paths 20C. The communication paths 20C are formed as portions (discontinuous portions) of the boundary between the rear chamber 26C and the front chamber 28C, where the seam 30 is not present. In the present exemplary embodiment, a communication path 20C in communication with the front chamber 28C is formed at a lower portion of the rear chamber 26C (main inflation portion 26M) so as to open forward, and another communication path 20C in communication with the front chamber 28C is formed at an upper end portion of the rear chamber 26C (main inflation portion 26M) so as to open upward.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The front chamber 28C is accordingly supplied with gas from the inflator 18 through the rear chamber 26C.

In the present exemplary embodiment, an internal pressure adjustment means to give the rear inflation section 26 a higher internal pressure than the internal pressure of the front inflation section 28 is implemented by the configuration of placing the inflator 18 inside the rear chamber 26C, and the configuration of placing the rear chamber 26C and the front chamber 28C in communication with each other through the communication paths 20C.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The side airbag 20 described above is, for example, formed in a bag shape by stitching together upper and lower edges, and front edges, of a base cloth that is folded back on itself at a rear end, and is divided into the rear inflation section 26 and the front inflation section 28 by the seam 30. The location formed with the seam 30 configures a non-inflation section. A nylon-based or polyester-based fabric, for example, may be employed as the base cloth. The stitching of the base cloth at the front edge (and upper and lower edges) of the side airbag 20 configures a seam 31, illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the inflator 18 is configured by what is known as a cylinder type inflator, and is installed inside the rear chamber 26C as described above, with its length direction oriented along the length direction of the seatback 14 as viewed from the side (substantially in the up-down direction). In the present exemplary embodiment, the inflator 18 and the flow regulator cloth 22 that houses the inflator 18 are both disposed inside the rear chamber 26C.

The tension cloth 24 is configured so as to deploy covering (overlapping) at least a portion of the rear inflation section 26 as viewed from the side on receipt of tension accompanying inflation and deployment of the side airbag 20.

The front parts of the chest and abdomen, and the head, of the seated occupant D are gently restrained by the front inflation section 28 that has relatively low internal pressure. In other words, the rear parts of the chest and abdomen, and the shoulder region, these being parts of the human body with relatively high resilience (robust parts), are restricted from moving toward the collision side while bearing a large reaction force from the rear inflation section 26. However, the front parts of the chest and abdomen, and the head, these being parts of the human body with relatively low resilience are restricted from moving toward the collision side, and the reaction force from the front inflation section 28 is suppressed.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">For example, in a comparative example provided with a single-chamber side airbag, the side airbag has uniform internal pressure throughout, this being an internal pressure comparable to that of the front inflation section 28 of the present exemplary embodiment.

Note that in <figref idrefs="f0014">Fig. 20</figref>, the side airbag 20 prior to restraining the seated occupant D is illustrated by intermittent lines, and an anticipated state of positional displacement is illustrated by solid lines. More specifically, in this comparative example, the side airbag 20 is only supported against the seatback frame 14F by the fastening structure 40, and so it is foreseeable that the base cloth on the vehicle center side in the vehicle width direction of the rear inflation section 26 could move away to the rear on receipt of the load F described above.

The rear inflation section 26 is accordingly pressed against the seatback frame 14F by reaction force from the tension cloth 24. Accordingly, even when moment M acts on the side airbag 20 due to the load F, moment Mr in a direction to cancel out the moment M acts on a portion of the rear inflation section 26 further to the rear than the fastening structure 40 due to a reaction force R against the pressing force described above (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>). Rotation (positional displacement toward the rear at the vehicle center side) of the side airbag 20 about the fastening structure 40 is accordingly effectively restricted.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Due to the above, the far side airbag device 10 enables the seated occupant D moving toward the vehicle center side in the vehicle width direction to be restrained with a greater reaction force (restraining force) from the collision side in the vehicle width direction than in a configuration provided with a single chamber airbag, and not provided with a tension cloth.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Accordingly, the far side airbag device 10 according to the first exemplary embodiment enables movement of the seated occupant D toward the vehicle center side in the vehicle width direction to be effectively suppressed.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">The tension cloth 24 deploys covering substantially the entire face of the rear inflation section 26 (the main inflation portion 26M and the secondary inflation portion 26S) as viewed from the side, thereby suppressing positional displacement toward the rear at the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> vehicle center side in the vehicle width direction of the secondary inflation portion 26S that restrains the shoulder region of the seated occupant D. Namely, positional displacement of the secondary inflation portion 26S with respect to the shoulder region of the seated occupant D is restricted by the tension cloth 24. This thereby enables movement of the seated occupant D toward the vehicle center side in the vehicle width direction to be even more effectively suppressed (restraining performance of the seated occupant D by the side airbag 20 is improved).</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">The front end of the tension cloth 24 is connected to the side airbag 20 at the seam 30 that divides the side airbag 20 into the rear inflation section 26 and the front inflation section 28. Portions of the side airbag 20 that inflate and deploy with relatively high internal pressure can accordingly be stably supported directly by the seatback frame 14F through the tension cloth 24. The tension cloth 24 can moreover be set without increasing the number of stitching locations in the side airbag 20.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Moreover, the side airbag 20, including the front inflation section 28 that inflates and deploys to the front of and above the rear inflation section 26 (that protects the head of the seated occupant D), has a large volume. In the comparative example in which the tension cloth 24 is not provided, the side airbag 20 is liable to move toward the front during inflation and deployment in the event of a side-on collision. When this occurs, there are concerns of the side airbag 20 interfering with the seated occupant D if the seated occupant D is in an irregular seating posture (out of position: OOP).</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">However, in the far side airbag device 10, the tension cloth 24 restricts the rear inflation section 26, namely the side airbag 20, from moving toward the front. In particular, since the tension cloth 24 couples at least an upper portion of the rear inflation section 26, namely a central portion of the side airbag 20 in the up-down direction, to the seatback frame 14F, the side airbag 20 has a stable orientation and is restricted from moving toward the front. Accordingly, the far side airbag device 10 contributes to a reduction in potential harm to the seated occupant D when in an irregular seating posture. In particular, although the secondary inflation portion 26S that projects out to the front of the main inflation portion 26M would otherwise be likely to interfere with the seated occupant D when in an irregular seating posture, the inflation and deployment orientation of the side airbag 20 is stabilized by the tension cloth 24, contributing to a reduction in potential interference by the secondary inflation portion 26S when the seated occupant D is in an irregular seating posture.</p><heading id="h0011">Other Exemplary Embodiments</heading><p id="p0072" num="0072">Next, explanation follows regarding other exemplary embodiments of the present invention.

This point is satisfied as long as configuration is made such that the rear inflation section 26 adopts a deployed (tension-applied) state in which the rear inflation section 26 is pressed against the seatback frame 14F by a reaction force from the tension cloth 24. In other words, this point is satisfied as long as configuration is made such that tension acting on the tension cloth 24 is supported by the seatback frame 14F at the rear side of the<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> fastening structure 40 (the tension cloth 24 is wrapped around the seatback frame 14F at the rear side of the fastening structure 40). Accordingly, for example, as in the modified example illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 16</figref>, configuration may be made in which the rear end side of the tension cloth 24 is connected to the seatback frame 14F by the fastening structure 40. Moreover, for example, the rear end side of the tension cloth 24 may run around to the seat width direction inside of the seatback frame 14F and be connected to the seatback frame 14F further to the front side than the fastening structure 40.</p><p id="p0121" num="0121">It goes without saying that various other modifications may be implemented within a range not departing from the scope of the present invention.
