The pillow bags on which the supplying device according to the present invention is intended to operate are pillow bags containing salty snacks preferably having a bulk density ranging between 0.02 and 0.15 Kg/liter.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An example of such pillow bags, which will be explicitly referred to herein below, is given by bags containing chips or the like.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">By case packer is meant, in the context of the present invention, a machine that is able to form a box, usually made of cardboard, intended to contain a plurality of pillow bags.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The case packers intended to form a container, usually made of cardboard, intended to house pillow bags containing salty snacks have been long used in the salty snack production industry.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">More and more often the case packers are arranged downstream of the bagging machines and connected therewith by a conveyor belt, so as to directly connect the bagging machine intended to the formation and filling of the pillow bags to the case packer intended to insert the pillow bags into the cardboard container being formed. In this manner, it is possible to avoid the use of operators who provide for manually transferring the pillow bags into the cardboard containers, with apparent advantages.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Particularly, the bagging machines are usually configured to supply the pillow bags that have been obtained and containing the salty snacks to a conveyor belt.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The pillow bags are individually supplied to the conveyor belt (one bag at a time) so as to obtain a single ordered row of bags.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Each bag is oriented parallel to the other ones, with the front portion thereof (carrying images and information regarding the bag contents) in contact with the rear portion (the portion opposite the front one) of the bag preceding it in the row.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The case packers usually provide for a forming line (or track), along which the container forming stations are arranged, which line extends along a rectilinear path. The insertion of the bags in the forming line occurs perpendicularly thereto, so that the pillow bags are inserted into the container being formed.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">It shall be apparent that the pillow bags have to be inserted into the cardboard containers in a preordered manner, i.e., orienting each pillow bag in a predetermined manner with respect to both the container and the other bags.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> In particular, each type of container requires a specific ordering of the pillow bags.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In fact, it shall be noticed that, exactly due to the nature of the products to be inserted into the containers being formed, it is not possible to adopt pushing devices or flow deflectors (borrowed by the field of the casing in of solid and evenly-shaped packagings) to re-orient the pillow bags. In fact, too vigorous mechanical actions onto the pillow bags would risk to damage the same bags or to damage the salty snacks having a low bulk density contained therein. Furthermore, the bulging shape of the pillow bags makes controlling the spatial orientation thereof very difficult, which is the reason the bagging machine supplies a conveyor belt with an ordered row of pillow bags in mutual contact. Furthermore, it shall be noticed that the bagging machines have variable manufacturing rates of the pillow bags, i.e., the manufacturing thereof is not constant over time.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">This may involve problems relating to the complete filling of the containers. In fact, each container is designed to contain a preset number of pillow bags, for example, six, eight, ten, etc. Since the containers move along a support plane at a predetermined speed, there is the tangible risk that some of such containers may contain a number of pillow bags less than the value that had been set when designing them.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">This involves a delivery to the supply chain, whether it is a retail or a large-scale chain, of unfinished containers. In such a situation, the problem originates of the reliability in carrying out the container filling operation with the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> proper number of pillow bags, an economical damage to the manufacturer of salty products, to the supply chain, as well as a dissatisfaction of the clientele. Furthermore, there is also the risk that not all the produced bags are actually put into the containers. This occurs particularly when the manufacturing rate is particularly high. In this scenery there is the possibility that the operator is not able to maintain the manufacturing rate of the case packer; therefore, some bags fall out of the line.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Such problems can be further exacerbated when particular marketing campaigns are underway. In fact, and more and more frequently, selling bags of salty snacks in combination with a gadget (such as, for example, small toys, objects, picture cards, or similar products) or another type of salty snacks. In such a scenery, containers have to be produced, to be delivered to the supply chain, which take into account both the so-called base salty snack and the gadget(s) or another salty snack that has to be combined.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In order to solve such problems, it is usually resorted to employ additional operators so as to ensure that the containers get the actual number of expected bags and gadgets and, moreover, that the bags that possibly have not been put into the containers are picked up again and inserted into a still unfinished container.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">In this context, the technical task underlying the present invention is to propose a system and relative method for sorting pillow bags containing salty products at a case packer which solves the above-mentioned drawbacks of the prior art.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Particularly, it is the object of the present invention to provide a system for sorting the pillow bags containing salty products at a case packer capable of ensuring the proper filling of the containers independently from the case packer manufacturing rate.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The indicated technical task and the specified objects are substantially achieved by a system and relative method for sorting pillow bags containing salty products at a case packer, comprising the technical characteristics set forth in one or more of the appended claims.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">By virtue of the present invention, it is possible to implement a system capable of avoiding that a number of pillow bags less than that expected during the designing is inserted into the containers, and at the same time that no recollecting operations of pillow bags that are not immediately used to fill the containers are necessary.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">Further characteristics and advantages of the present invention will be more clearly apparent from the illustrative, hence non-limiting, description of a preferred, but not exclusive, embodiment of a system for sorting pillow bags containing salty products at a case packer, as illustrated in the appended drawing of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, in which a system for sorting pillow bags containing salty products at a case packer according to the present invention is schematically shown.</p><heading id="h0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --><p id="p0023" num="0023">A system for sorting pillow bags containing salty products at a case packer in accordance with the present invention has been generally indicated by the number 1 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The system 1 comprises a first loading station 2 to which a plurality of pillow bags 100, for example, bags of chips (which will be explicitly referred to herein below) is sent, a second loading station 3 to which a plurality of gadgets 200 (which will be explicitly referred to herein below) or pillow bags, for example bags of chips, is sent, and an ordering station 6 and a ordering station in which the bags 100 and the gadget 200 are ordered in a predetermined amount. The first loading station 2 is arranged at a supplying line of bags that come, for example, from a bagging machine (not shown), and it provides for a loading position at which the pillow bags are supplied, and an unloading position, opposite the loading position.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The second loading station 3 is arranged at a hopper (not shown) from which the gadgets are dispensed, and is provides for a loading position at which the gadgets are supplied, and an unloading position, opposite the loading position.
