When it comes to using such wet sheets, traditionally multiple individually packaged wet sheets are packed in a single bag and, to use the sheets, the individual packages must be taken out from the bag and opened separately; however, such wet sheets are not easy to use because their package must be opened separately one by one to use the sheet, although the individual packaging prevents growth of bacteria and attachment of contaminants.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In addition, types of wet sheets that are widely used include multiple wet tissues, body wipes or other relatively large wet sheets that are folded and stacked in a pop-up manner and stored in a plastic container or packaged in a pillow bag. Just like tissue papers, some wet sheets are placed in a box or bag and pulled out one by one from the opening provided at the top of the box or in one area of the bag to be used. However, wet sheets must be folded in a special manner to allow for removal from the opening one by one, which makes the manufacturing process complex.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">On the other hand, an art of packaging small wet sheets (such as small-sized pads and partial facial masks) individually and then layering and storing them in a sealable container is also widely used.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An example of stacking such multiple small wet sheets in a box or bag is found in Patent Literature 1 where pads impregnated with cosmetic preparation are stacked and stored in a container so that the pads are removed one by one from the opening provided at the top of the container for use, or in Patent Literature 2 that describes a container in which pads impregnated with cosmetic preparation are stacked in such a way that the pads are layered while partially overlapping with each other to allow the overlapping parts to be removed from the lidded opening provided at the top of the container.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Patent Literature 3 describes a flexible material dispensing container characterized in that one plastic sheet is folded to form a molding of roughly W shape in cross section having two exterior walls and two interior walls and the upper sections of the exterior walls are partially cut off to provide a dispensing outlet; however, this container is not sealable and no means are available, either, for sealing the dispensing outlet formed by the cutout.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Means for stacking and storing pads in a container without individually packaging them so that the pads are removed one by one from the outlet at the top of the container, such as the means described in Patent Literatures 1 and 2 above, require that the pads, after removal from the container, must be spread by two hands for use because they are folded in a certain manner.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In addition, the art described in Patent Literature 1 causes the wet sheets to easily stick together, resulting in insufficient operability to separate and remove the wet sheets one by one. To solve this problem, a method of stacking wet sheets by offsetting the positions of adjacent sheets is proposed in Patent Literature 2, but since a large container is required relative to the original area size of the sheet, this method is not desirable in terms of cost and reduction of waste material.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Prior Art Literatures</b></heading><heading id="h0004"><b>Patent Literatures</b></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009"><ul><li>Patent Literature 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5046640A"><text>US Patent No. 5046640</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Literature 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US7007801B"><text>US Patent No. 7007801</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Literature 3: <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JPSHO63199944A"><text>Japanese Utility Model Laid-open No. Sho 63-199944</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b>Summary of the Invention</b></heading><heading id="h0006"><b>Problems to Be Solved by the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">As described above, with wet sheets, facial mask sheets and other sheets (hereinafter referred to as "facial mask sheets") individually stored in bags, it is not easy to remove the facial mask sheet from the bag, and when the fingers are inserted into the bag, not only the fingertips pinching the sheet, but also other fingers as well as the palms and backs of the hands, get wet by the cosmetic preparation, etc. Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to minimize the wetting of the hands when removing the facial mask sheet from the bag, except for the fingertips pinching the facial mask sheet.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Another object of the present invention is to allow for easy, reliable spreading of the folded facial mask sheet that has been removed from the bag for use, so that the removed facial mask sheet can be attached onto the face, etc., quickly and reliably without wetting the fingers or causing the facial mask sheet to<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> tear or wrinkle.</p><heading id="h0007"><b>Means for Solving the Problems</b></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present invention achieves the aforementioned objects by adopting a specific package in which facial mask sheets are stored, and specifically adopts the means specified below:
<ol><li>1. A facial mask sheet package comprising a perforated tray which has a hole provided at the bottom and in which a stack of Z-folded facial mask sheets wetted with chemical solution is placed, wherein such tray is stored in a pillow bag whose top side has a butt joint formed by sealing the ends of a film, in such a way that the bottom of the tray is positioned on the opposite side of the butt joint.</li><li>2. A facial mask sheet package according to 1, wherein the hole is pre-formed and sealed with a liquid-impermeable sheet so that it is opened when the liquid-impermeable sheet is removed.</li><li>3. A facial mask sheet package according to 1 or 2, wherein, when the facial mask sheet package is placed with the hole in the perforated tray facing up, the Z-folded facial mask sheets are stacked in such a way that the edge of the bottom side of a facial mask sheet is positioned on top of the edge of the top side of the facial mask sheet under it.</li><li>4. A facial mask sheet package according to any one of 1 to 3, wherein, when the facial mask sheet package is placed with the hole in the perforated tray facing up, the edge on the top side of the Z-folded facial mask sheet is positioned at the center of the folded facial mask sheet.</li><li>5. A facial mask sheet package according to any one of 1 to 4, wherein a window that can be opened for removal of sheets is formed in the pillow bag film contacting the hole provided in the perforated tray.</li><li>6. A facial mask sheet package according to 5, wherein a window outline for forming a window is pre-formed in a thin area of the pillow bag film contacting the hole provided in the perforated tray, and a window is formed whose outline can be torn with an external force along the thin area.</li><li>7. A facial mask sheet package according to 5, wherein the window has a lid member that can engage with the rim of the window and seal it in an airtight manner.</li><li>8. A facial mask sheet package according to any one of 1 to 7, wherein the perforated tray in which the facial mask sheets are placed is combined with a separate inverted tray.</li><li>9. A method of manufacturing the facial mask sheet package in 8, wherein such manufacturing method comprises:<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> -->
<ul><li>placing facial mask sheets in a separate tray;</li><li>supplying and impregnating chemical solution to/into the facial mask sheets;</li><li>placing over the separate tray in a manner covering the facial mask sheets a perforated tray having a hole at the bottom which is blocked by a liquid-impermeable sheet; and</li><li>storing in a pillow bag the perforated tray, facial mask sheets and separate tray by inverting or not inverting them together, and then sealing the opening of the pillow bag.</li></ul></li></ol></p><heading id="h0008"><b>Effects of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">The package storing facial mask sheets as proposed by the present invention is such that facial mask sheets impregnated with cosmetic preparation or other chemical solution are packaged inside, thus preventing the sheets from getting dried up or degrading while in storage before use, and when the facial mask sheets are used, the package can be opened by a specific means so that the sheets can be removed easily from the package without wetting the fingers and hands excessively, and furthermore the removed facial mask sheets can be spread out easily and reliably without wetting the fingers excessively.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Also because the facial mask sheets are placed in the perforated tray and stored in the pillow bag, the perforated tray does not cause the facial mask sheet outlet in the facial mask sheet package to deform when the sheets are used, which makes it easy to remove the sheets. In addition, when the facial mask sheet package is formed by combining the perforated tray in which the facial mask sheets are placed and the separate inverted tray, the shape of the facial mask sheet package reflects the shape of the two combined trays, which results in excellent ease of handling the package during storage, transport, etc., as well as excellent ease of holding the facial mask sheets in hand when used.</p><heading id="h0009"><b>Brief Description of the Drawings</b></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1a</figref>] Drawing of a facial mask sheet</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 1b</figref>] Drawing of a facial mask sheet</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2</figref>] Drawing showing an example of steps to place facial mask sheets in a separate tray and supply chemical solution</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 3</figref>] Drawing showing an example of a step to place facial mask sheets in a perforated tray and supply chemical solution</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 4</figref>] Drawing of a facial mask sheet package before facial mask sheets are removed</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 5</figref>] Drawing showing how facial mask sheets are folded</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>] Drawing of a mode in which a facial mask sheet is removed from a facial<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> mask sheet package</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>] Drawing of a mode in which a facial mask sheet is removed from a facial mask sheet package</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>] Drawing of a mode in which a facial mask sheet is removed from a facial mask sheet package</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref>] Drawing of a mode of facial mask sheet package</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 10</figref>] Drawing of a mode of facial mask sheet package</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 11</figref>] Drawing of a mode of facial mask sheet package</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 12</figref>] Drawing of a mode of facial mask sheet package</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010"><b>Description of the Symbols</b></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016"><ul><li>1: Facial mask sheet</li><li>2: Facial mask sheet package</li><li>3: Window</li><li>4: Hole</li><li>5: Edge</li><li>6: Window outline</li><li>7: Lid member</li><li>T1: Perforated tray</li><li>T2: Separate tray</li><li>L: Chemical solution</li><li>S: Liquid-impermeable sheet</li></ul></p><heading id="h0011"><b>Mode for Carrying Out the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">The present invention is a package comprising a perforated tray which has a hole provided at the bottom and in which folded facial mask sheets are placed, wherein the perforated tray is stored in a pillow bag having a butt joint on the top side, which package is a facial mask sheet package in which a window is formed that can be opened as needed when removing the sheets, provided on the side of the pillow bag contacting the hole provided in the perforated tray which is opposite the one on which the butt joint is formed.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The present invention is explained based on the drawings.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">Figs. 1</figref> a and 1 b each show a facial mask sheet 1 to be placed in a perforated tray which is stored in the facial mask sheet package proposed by the present invention.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The facial mask sheets 1 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">Figs. 1</figref> a and 1b are Z-folded.

For the manufacturing method of such sheet, any known method can be used that employs a knitting machine, resin molding machine, any of various non-woven fabric forming methods, or the like.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In addition to the above, a laminated sheet or other laminate comprising fiber sheet or foamed sheet and resin film can also be used. Preferably the base material is a sheet with thin synthetic resin film laminated on one side, so that the water repellency of the film makes it easier to separate the sheets even when<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> they are wet.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Under the present invention, the facial mask sheet can have any shape such as circle, ellipse, comma shape, polygon, etc., and although a folded facial mask sheet is preferred because the folded parts spread out naturally when the sheet is pinched and lifted up with fingers, the sheet need not be folded.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The chemical solution with which the facial mask sheet is impregnated is a cosmetic preparation or the like, but it is not limited in any way and can be water, skin lotion, cleaning agent, etc., where preferably the facial mask sheet is impregnated with liquid that does not corrode the sheet material and pillow bag.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Under the present invention, any known chemical solution can be impregnated into or attached to the facial mask sheets when they are stored. Such solution can have any property such as liquid, paste, cream or gel, where examples include face wash, skin lotion, skin milk, and other skin care cosmetics, foundation, cheek color and other makeup products, perfume, whitening agent, antioxidant, anti-wrinkling agent, moisturizing agent, sunscreen solution, hair removal agent, antibacterial agent, bactericidal agent, acne treatment agent, and various other types of cosmetics, chemical agent, surface active agent, etc. Under the present invention, cosmetic preparations, chemical agents, cleaning agents, and other chemical solutions in liquid state of varying viscosity, or in semi-liquid state such as cream or gel, can be used in a favorable manner.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The cosmetic preparation, chemical agent, or cleaning agent is retained preferably by 30 to 800 percent by weight, or by 30 to 500 percent by weight, relative to the weight of the base material of facial mask sheet. If the cosmetic preparation, chemical agent, or cleaning agent is liquid, then using it by 30 percent by weight or less does not allow the cosmetic preparation, etc., to be applied efficiently due to small application amount, while using it by more than 800 percent by weight exceeds the liquid retention property of the facial mask sheet and tends to cause any excess liquid applied to drip and collect at the bottom of the storage implement.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">For the material film of the pillow bag, any known material may be adopted which can be formed into a pillow bag to store wet facial mask sheets in an airtight manner. Examples of such material include laminate film constituted by multiple resin layers, and laminate film having aluminum or other metal layers, among others.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">After these Z-folded facial mask sheets are placed in the perforated tray, skin lotion or other chemical solution is introduced into the perforated tray to impregnate the facial mask sheets, while the perforated tray and facial mask<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> sheets are stored in the pillow bag whose top side has a butt joint formed by sealing the ends of a film, in such a way that the bottom of the tray is positioned on the opposite side of the butt joint, after which the opening of the pillow bag is sealed by means of thermal fusion or any other known means to obtain the facial mask sheet package proposed by the present invention.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2(a)</figref> shows the stage of placing the facial mask sheets in a separate tray T2 before it is stored in the pillow bag constituting the facial mask sheet package proposed by the present invention. The separate tray T2 has no hole 4 at the bottom, and by placing multiple Z-folded facial mask sheets 1 in the separate tray T2 and then supplying skin lotion or other chemical solution L into the separate tray T2 from above, the facial mask sheets in the separate tray T2 are impregnated with the chemical solution. It is also possible to supply the chemical solution L into the separate tray T2 before placing the facial mask sheets in the separate tray T2.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2(b)</figref>, a perforated tray T1 is placed just like closing a lid on the top opening of the separate tray T2. This perforated tray T1 has a hole 4 formed at the bottom. The perforated tray T1 can be simply placed on top of the separate tray T2, or any means for fixing the perforated tray T1 onto the separate tray T2, such as bonding or fusion, can also be adopted.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Here, the hole 4 in the perforated tray T1 is blocked with a liquid-impermeable sheet S. By blocking the hole 4 this way, leakage of the chemical solution into the pillow bag outside the tray can be prevented when the facial mask sheet package is rotated or inverted during storage or distribution.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Thereafter, the separate tray T2, perforated tray T1 and facial mask sheets 1 placed therein are turned upside down, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2(c)</figref>, and stored in the pillow bag.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The pillow package thus obtained has the structure of the facial mask sheet package wherein the facial mask sheets 1 placed in the perforated tray T1 are covered by the inverted separate tray T2.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Needless to say, a method in which the separate tray T2 is not used can be adopted, instead of the one in which the separate tray T2 is used for storage, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2</figref> above. For example, a hole 4 is formed at the bottom of the perforated tray T1 and the hole 4 is blocked with the liquid-impermeable sheet S beforehand, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 3</figref>. Here, the liquid-impermeable sheet S is used to block the hole 4 of the perforated tray T1 from inside. By placing the multiple Z-folded facial mask sheets 1 in this perforated tray T1 and then supplying the chemical solution L into the perforated tray T1 from above, the chemical solution<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> is impregnated into the facial mask sheets 1 in the perforated tray T1. It is also possible to supply the chemical solution L into the perforated tray T1 before the facial mask sheets 1 are stored in the perforated tray T1. Thereafter, the perforated tray T1 and facial mask sheets 1 placed in it are stored in the pillow bag.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">It should be noted that the perforated tray and separate tray used in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">3</figref> must be made of resin, metal or other proper material and also have a proper structure so that the shape of the tray is retained and the chemical solution does not permeate through. This way, the facial mask sheet package as a whole will have enough strength needed during storage, transport, and when used.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The facial mask sheet package proposed by the present invention, thus obtained, is used as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 4</figref> and the subsequent figures, for example.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 4</figref> shows a facial mask sheet package 2 having a window 3 on the side of the pillow bag opposite the butt joint, where the window 3 is opened with fingers, etc., and the hole 4 provided at the bottom of the perforated tray is also open after the sheet, etc., that was sealing it has been removed.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 5</figref> is a section view of Z-folded facial mask sheets 1. When these Z-folded facial mask sheets 1 are stored in the facial mask sheet package so that their ends 5 are facing up, the end 5 of the topmost Z-folded facial mask sheet is positioned to be seen through the hole 4 provided at the bottom of the perforated tray.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Also in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 5</figref>, an edge 5a is formed by bending the aforementioned edge 5 one more time. The purpose of this is to more clearly show where to pinch the facial mask sheet 1 with fingers when removing only one facial mask sheet 1 from the facial mask sheet package 2 in which it is stored, and also to create a small ridge from additional folding that would catch the fingertips to provide a guide when pinching the facial mask sheet 1. By providing this edge 5a, removing the facial mask sheet 1 becomes easier under the present invention.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">It is also possible to color the edges 5, 5a so that they can be visually identified in a clear manner.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046"><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> shows a condition where the edge 5 of the facial mask sheet 1 pinched with fingers, and the hole at the bottom of the perforated tray, and at least the window provided in the pillow bag, must be large enough to allow the fingers to pinch the edge of the facial mask sheet. Although the facial mask sheet is pinched with a total of four fingers in two hands in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>, the present invention is not limited to this example, and the edge 5 of the facial mask sheet can be pinched with two fingers in one hand, for example.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0047" num="0047"><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> shows the stage of picking up from the facial mask sheet package a facial mask sheet 1 pinched with the fingers.
