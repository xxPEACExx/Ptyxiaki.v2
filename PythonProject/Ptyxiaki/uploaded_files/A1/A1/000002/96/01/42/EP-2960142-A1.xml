The rubber belt 12 of the present exemplary embodiment is an example of an endless belt shaped elastic body of the present invention.

The cores 20 of the present exemplary embodiment are formed from a metal material. In the present invention, the cores 20 may be configured from a material other than a metal material, as long as the cores 20 have adequate strength for the specifications of the rubber crawler 10. For example, the cores 20 may be formed from a resin material.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, each of the cores 20 is configured including a core central portion 22, a pair of core wings 24 respectively extending from both crawler width direction end portions of the core central portion 22 toward the crawler width direction outsides, and core projections 26 projecting out from a base side (a base portion in the present exemplary embodiment) of each core wing 24 toward the crawler inner peripheral side.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The core central portion 22 is a portion that bears load and drive force from the sprocket 100, and is therefore made thicker in the crawler in-out direction than the core wings 24. Although the core central portion 22 of the present exemplary embodiment is completely embedded within the rubber belt 12, the present invention is not limited to such a configuration, and a crawler inner peripheral side surface of the core central portion 22 may be exposed from the rubber belt 12.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A projection leading end portion side of each core projection 26 projects out from the rubber belt 12 toward the crawler inner peripheral side.

The pairs of core projections 26 are capable of restricting movement of the sprocket 100 and the idler 102 in the crawler width direction by making contact with the sprocket 100 and the idler 102. In other words, by making contact with the sprocket 100 and the idler 102, the core projections 26 are capable of suppressing displacement of the rubber crawler 10 (rubber belt 12) in the crawler width direction relative to the sprocket 100 and the idler 102.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the present exemplary embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, a straight line passing through the crawler width direction center of the core central portions 22 of the cores 20 (referred to below as the "core center line" as appropriate) is substantially aligned with a straight line passing through the crawler width direction center of the rubber belt 12 (referred to below as the "center line CL"). Note that the present invention is not limited to such a configuration, and the core center line of the cores 20 may be offset in the crawler width direction with respect to the center line CL of the rubber belt 12.

Specifically, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 8</figref>, tensile force in the crawler peripheral direction acts on the one end 32A side of the main cords 32 configuring the crawler inner peripheral side of the overlapping portions 36, and the plural curved portions 40 of the stretching and contracting portions 38 stretch in the crawler peripheral direction. The stretching and contracting portions 38 accordingly stretch in the crawler peripheral direction (the amplitude A decreases, and the wavelength λ increases in length). Accordingly, in the rubber crawler 10, the difference in bending rigidity between the overlapping portions 36 and other portions of the main cords 32 is reduced. Namely, the rubber crawler 10 can approach uniform bending rigidity in the crawler peripheral direction when entrained around the sprocket 100 or the idler 102.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">When the overlapping portions 36 of the main cord layers 30 are entrained around the sprocket 100 or the idler 102, excessive bending originating in the vicinity of boundaries<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> between the overlapping portions 36 and other portions of the main cord layers 30 (in the vicinities of the two ends 32A, 32B of each main cord 32) can accordingly be suppressed from occurring in the rubber belt 12.

In particular, the curved portions 40 curve gently, thereby enabling excessive bending to be suppressed from occurring in some of the curved portions 40 when the stretching and contracting portions 38 are compressed. Moreover, the wave profiles of stretching and contracting portions 38 adjacent in the crawler width direction have the same phase and the same amplitude as each other, thereby enabling the adjacent stretching and contracting portions 38 to approach uniform stretching and contraction amounts (stretching amounts in the present exemplary embodiment) along the crawler peripheral direction.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In the rubber crawler 10, each main cord 32 is configured by the linear portion 32C and the stretching and contracting portion 38, such that the tension of the main cord layer 30 is maintained by the linear portions 32C of each of the main cords 32, and low bending rigidity is maintained at the overlapping portion 36 of each main cord layer 30 by the stretching and contracting portions 38 of the respective main cords 32.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Moreover, in the rubber crawler 10, the one end 32A side of the main cords 32 formed with the stretching and contracting portions 38 are superimposed from the crawler outer peripheral side on the other end 32B side configured by the linear portions 32C, such that when the overlapping portions 36 are entrained around the sprocket 100 or the idler 102, the stretching and contracting portions 38 formed on the one end 32A side of the main cords 32 stretch in the crawler peripheral direction about the other end side of the main cord layer 30 as a reference.
