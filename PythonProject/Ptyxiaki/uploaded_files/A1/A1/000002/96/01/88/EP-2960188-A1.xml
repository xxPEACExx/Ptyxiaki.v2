The opening device further comprises a lid fitted to the neck, which is removed from the neck when the product has to be poured and is applied again to the neck to re-close the pouring opening.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The packaging material forming the package may comprise a so called prelaminated hole, which is a hole formed in the base layer only and covered by the other lamination layers, i.e. the layers of heat-seal plastic material and the layer of gas- and light-barrier material.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In this case the opening device is applied to the package at the prelaminated hole and is provided with a cutter which - when the package is opened for the first time - cuts the prelaminated hole to allow pouring of the product contained in the package. The cutter may be driven by the lid. In particular, opening devices are known in which the lid is initially screwed to the neck. When the lid is unscrewed for the first time a cam device, defined by the lid, the cutter and the neck, drives the cutter so that the cutter cuts the prelaminated hole.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The opening devices are applied to the packages by cap applicators that are arranged downstream of the above-mentioned packaging machines.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The cap applicators are provided with an applying<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> unit having a plurality of applying devices that apply the opening devices to the packages. In particular, the opening devices may be attached to the package by gluing.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The packages are advanced through the cap applicator in a line. Each opening device is carried by a respective applying device to a glue delivery station where a certain amount of glue is placed on the flange of the opening device. Subsequently, the applying device applies the opening device to the package, in particular at the prelaminated hole of the package, if present.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The cap applicator further comprises a plurality of pressing devices, each pressing device pushing the respective opening device onto the package until the glue sets and the opening device is permanently attached to the package.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The cap applicators further comprise a conveying unit that receives the packages from the packaging machines and conveys the packages towards the applying unit.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The conveying unit comprises a conveyor belt that supports the packages and conveys the packages along an advancing direction. The conveyor belt has the shape of a loop and is wound around pulleys, each pulley rotating around a substantially horizontal axis. The conveyor belt comprises an upper active branch, which receives and moves the packages, and a lower return<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> branch.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The conveying unit also comprises a so called belt brake, i.e. a device which interacts with the packages and releases the packages one at a time, so that the packages are substantially equally spaced along the conveyor belt. In other words, the belt brake creates substantially constant gaps between the packages. The packages, in fact, should be arranged at a pre-defined distance from each other in order that the applying devices of the applying unit can properly apply the opening devices.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The conveying unit further comprises a first conveying element and a second conveying element arranged on opposite sides of the conveyor belt.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The first conveying element comprises a first belt shaped as a loop and wound around pulleys, each pulley having a substantially vertical axis.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The first conveying element comprises a plurality of first fingers projecting from the belt.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The second conveying element comprises a belt shaped as a loop and wound around pulleys, each pulley having a substantially vertical axis.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The second conveying element comprises a plurality of second fingers projecting from the belt.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The first belt and the second belt comprise guiding branches facing each other.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The first conveying element is longer than the second conveying element and is arranged closer to the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> belt brake than the second conveying element. The first conveying element, therefore, interacts with the packages before the second conveying element.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">During operation, a package coming from the belt brake is accelerated by the conveyor belt unit to cause a front wall of the package to abut against a respective first finger of the first conveying element. Subsequently, a second finger of the second conveying element faces, or contacts, a rear wall of the package, opposite to the above-mentioned front wall. In this way, the package is received in a sort of compartment defined by the first belt, the second belt, the first finger and the second finger and is advanced towards the applying unit.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In order that the package abuts against the first finger and is kept in contact with the first finger the speed of the conveyor belt has to be grater than the speed of the first belt and the second belt.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In particular, the speed of the conveyor belt may be 15% greater than the speed of the first belt and the second belt and greater than 20 meters per minute.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">A drawback of the known conveying units is that since the conveyor belt moves at a very high speed, it may be difficult to control the position of the packages. In particular, if the conveyor belt is not sufficiently clean - for instance if the conveyor belt is dirty or wet - the packages may slide, or slip, on the conveyor belt. In one case, the package may be too<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> fast, and so bounce, on the respective first finger. In another case, the package may be too slow and so not able to reach the respective first finger.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Another drawback of the known conveying units is that, due to the high speed of the conveyor belt, the packages - especially in case they have a square or rounded cross section - may rotate around their longitudinal axis. In this way, the packages may be improperly positioned with respect to the applying unit.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">An object of the invention is to improve the conveying units for conveying packages, in particular the conveying units for conveying packages towards cap applicators that apply opening devices to the packages.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Another object of the invention is to provide a conveying unit for conveying packages and a method for conveying packages that allow a good control of the speed and the position of the packages.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">A further object of the invention is to provide a conveying unit for conveying packages and a method for conveying packages that allow reducing, or eliminating, the risk that the packages rotate around their longitudinal axis.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Still another object of the invention is to provide a conveying unit for conveying packages and a method for conveying packages in which the packages are guided in a more precise and reliable way than in the known conveying units.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a conveying unit for conveying packages as claimed in claim 1.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for conveying packages as claimed in claim 15.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">A preferred, non-limiting embodiment of the present invention will be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
