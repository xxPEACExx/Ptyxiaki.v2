Due to varying depth of water reservoirs, and recurring shallows, or varying depth specification of ports, the majority of boats are equipped with folded stabilizer fins or with fins that may be concealed in the hull structure.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Patent claim number <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20020040673A"><text>US 2002/0040673</text></patcit> specifies a boat structure which, apart from a stabilizer fin, is equipped with a wing which is permanently fixed to the rudder, which aims at additionally stabilizing the rudder and level the impact of waves and resistances acting on the rudder.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">High-speed floating units, such as hydrofoil boats utilize multiple stabilizer fins equipped with additional wings (hydro-wings). These wings are shaped like airplane wings, as a result of which they are sucked into water surface, elevating the hull of the floating unit above the water surface as the velocity of the water flowing around the fins increases.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Patent claim number <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6948441B"><text>US 6948441</text></patcit> specifies a floating unit hydro-wing structure, characterized in that the multiple fins are equipped with wings, out of which the lowest ones are directed horizontally, whereas the higher wings form a V shape, whereas the wings that are closest to the water surface are mobile and take on a vertical position after leaving water, in order not to create any additional resistance.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the case of floating units with sail drive only, dedicated to regatta competitions, the possibility of applying fixed or folded fins is very limited by class<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> regulations. For instance, class A regatta catamarans must be equipped with stabilizer fins which are entirely folded into the hull to ensure that they do not protrude from the hull outline, and their fragment directed towards the catamaran axis cannot extend into the water for more than 40 cm. Therefore, the objective was to develop a floating unit structure, particularly a multiple-hull one, which would observe all limitations enforced by class regulations, and which would allow for acquiring advantage in speed and maneuverability during regatta competitions.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The boat stabilizer fin with unique structure according to the invention guarantees improved performance while maintaining the requirements of class regulations.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The boat stabilizer fin with unique structure, particularly for a catamaran according to the invention comprises a fin box and at least two panels cooperating with the fin box, connected in their upper parts in a permanent and inseparable manner with the element filling the interior of the stabilizer fin box, and connected to two panels using a set of hydro-wings. In a beneficial embodiment of the invention, the surfaces of both panels are not parallel and are inclined so that their upper parts approach one another.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the case of applying a stabilizer fin box with round cross-section, the upper element of the fin, in its fully folded position, is secured against unfolding, however, thanks to the installation of at least one bearing between the stabilizer fin box and at least two streamlined panels, may freely move at 360°. The axes of vertical panel surfaces are slightly withdrawn in relation to the fin rotation axis. In a beneficial embodiment of the invention, at least 60% of their lateral surfaces is located outside the symmetry surface set by the rotation axis and the perpendicular to their lateral surface.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">At least two panels with streamline, symmetrical cross-section with a set of hydro-wings connected to them, all cooperating with the stabilizer fin box in a reciprocating motion, and, while in the completely unfolded or folded position, the vertical motion of the panels and the set of hydro-wings is blocked by a dedicated lock.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In a beneficial embodiment of the invention, at least two panels with streamline, symmetrical cross-section are performed as NACA 63-012 profile cross-section panels or panels of similar type.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Depending on the embodiment, the stabilizer fin box is rectangular or round in cross-section and allows for completely unfolding the fin from the stabilizer fin box.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the lower part, two vertical stabilizer fins are connected with an element, through which a link of the set of hydro-wings passes. The set of hydro-wings comprises the upper hydro-wing panel mounted to the rotating axis, to which, the lower hydro-wing is mounted using at least two, beneficially vertical links. A link running to the socket located in the upper part of the stabilizer fin is mounted to the upper surface of the upper hydro-wing. The socket area limits the range of motion of the link, which has direct control of the maximum lean of the hydro-wing surfaces. In a beneficial embodiment of the invention, the socket is equipped with a spring and/or an element muffling too abrupt changes in the angle of attack of the hydro-wings.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The link is equipped with an additional setting hydro-wing, non-connected to the remaining streamline panels.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Horizontally mounted hydro-wings may have symmetrical cross-section, e.g. in the NACA 63-012 or similar profile. When a need to generate larger forces arises, for instance when a given boat has been reaching lower velocities or when the boat is relatively heavier, then, depending on the needs, the hydro-wings may have non-symmetrical cross-section, e.g. NACA 63-112; 63-212; 63-312; 63-412 or similar. Horizontally, the mounted hydro-wings are contained within the stabilizer fin box outline and may thus be completely unfolded together with the entire fin system.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The boat stabilizer fin with unique structure according to the invention was presented in the figure, in which <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1a, b</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0002">c and d</figref> present a non-rotating version of the boat stabilizer fin, and <figref idrefs="f0003">fig. 2a, b</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0004">c, d</figref> present a rotating version of the boat stabilizer fin according to the invention.</p><heading id="h0001">Example I</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">The boat stabilizer fin with unique structure, particularly for a catamaran according to the invention comprises a fin box 1 and at least two panels 2 and 2' cooperating with the fin box, connected in their upper parts in a permanent and inseparable manner with the element 3 filling the interior of the stabilizer fin box 1, and<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> connected to two panels 2 and 2' using a set of hydro-wings 4.
