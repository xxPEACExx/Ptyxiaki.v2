The inverter-integrated motor 1 of the present embodiment is an electro-mechanical integrated device that integrates a motor 2 and the inverter 3. A rotary shaft 21, a stator 22, and a rotor 23 each being components of the motor 2 as well as a power module 31, a DC bus bar &amp; smoothing capacitor 32 (indicated by reference numeral 32 for the DC bus bar and the smoothing capacitor collectively) and a circuit board 33 each representing components of the inverter 3 are accommodated in a housing 4. Note that the inverter-integrated motor 1 in the present embodiment is intended to include an inverter-integrated motor-generator having a power generation function by regeneration, as well.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The housing 4 of the present embodiment includes a motor housing 41, an inverter housing 42 and a partition bracket 43. The motor housing 41, the partition bracket 43 and the inverter housing 42 are juxtaposed in the axial direction in the mentioned order and joined together at associated flanges by a fastening means such as screws or bolts (not shown). Thus, joining of the motor housing 41 and the inverter housing 42 separate from the motor housing 41, each constituting part of accommodating housing 4, is also referred to as integration. Further, constructing the motor housing 41 and the inverter housing 42 in a single housing member is also referred to as integration.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The motor housing 41 has a cylindrical body 411 with open end surfaces in the axial direction and a bracket 412 that closes one end of the cylindrical body 411 for passing through the rotary shaft 21 for rotatable support. The cylindrical body 411 and the bracket 412 are fixed together by fastening means (not shown) such as welding, caulking, bolts and the like. The cylindrical body 411 and bracket 412 can be formed of a material of aluminum or the like having excellent heat diffusion. Also, a plurality of radiating fins may be formed on the outer surface of the cylindrical body 411 so that the heat transmitted to the motor housing 41 from the power module 31 may be radiated to the outside.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The inverter housing 42 is integrally molded into a bottomed cylindrical shape so as to have a cylindrical main body 421 and a bracket portion 422 for closing one end of the cylindrical main body 421. The inverter housing 42 can be formed of a material of aluminum or the like having excellent heat diffusion. Further, a plurality of heat dissipating fins may be provided on the outer surface of the bracket 422 so that the heat<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> from the power module 31 transmitted to the inverter housing 42 may be dissipated to the outside. Note that the cylindrical main body 421 and the bracket portion 422 may be structured separately and fixed together by fastening means such as through welding, caulking, bolts, and the like. The other configurations of the inverter housing 42 will be described below.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The partition bracket 43 is interposed between the cylindrical body 411 of the motor housing 41 and the cylindrical main body 421 of the inverter housing 42 to serve as a bracket common to both the other bracket of the motor housing 41 and the other bracket of the inverter housing 42 so that dust in the motor housing 41 is prevented from entering into the inverter housing 42. In other words, the motor housing 41 and the inverter housing 42 are integrated in a position of this partition bracket 43. Note that the partition bracket 43 may be configured as part of the cylindrical body 411 of the motor housing 41, or, alternatively, part of the cylindrical main body 421 of the inverter housing 42.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A motor chamber 414 is formed in the motor housing 41, and an inverter chamber 424 is formed inside the inverter housing 42. In the center of the axial direction of these motor chamber 414 and the inverter chamber 424, the rotary shaft 21 is supported rotatably in both direction by bearings 413, 431. Further, the lower end of the rotary shaft 21 extends from the motor housing 41 to the outside, where the load is connected. As the load connected to the motor 2 in the present embodiment, a driving shaft of an electric vehicle or the like may be exemplified so that the motor is driven to output to the driving shaft, or the motor may be operative in a regenerative mode by receiving rotation of the driving shaft of the electric vehicle.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In the motor chamber 414, the stator 22 is fixed to the inner peripheral surface of the cylindrical body 411, and the rotor 23 is fixed to the rotary shaft 21 to be opposed to the inside of the stator with a gap.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The stator 22 is a stationary member that generates a rotating magnetic field, and includes a stator core for constituting a magnetic circuit, a stator coil wound on the stator core to generate the rotating magnetic field in response to AC power supplied from the inverter 3. The stator core, for example, is composed of a cylindrical magnetic body composed of a plurality of silicon steel sheets formed by stacking in the axial direction. The stator core is press-fitted to the inner peripheral surface of the cylindrical<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> body 411 and fixed thereto with the outer peripheral surface of the stator core being fitted. The stator coil is formed with phase coils of three-phase (u-phase, v phase, w phase) by the coil conductor wound around the stator core being electrically connected. The three-phase coils are configured to be star-connected (i.e. Y-connected). In star connection, one end of each phase coil is electrical connected to form a neutral point. Note that the number of phases of the motor is not limited to three phases.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Although not shown, a lead conductor is electrically connected to the end of each phase coil of the stator coil (the end opposite to the neutral point side). Each lead conductor is a flat elongated conductor which also serves as the input terminal of the motor 2 and is derived in the axial end portion of the partition bracket 43 of the stator 22, specifically led in the axial direction from the side of the partition bracket 43 of the coil end of the stator coil and stretched from the motor chamber 414 to reach the inverter chamber 424 through a through-hole in the partition bracket 43, and is electrically connected to the corresponding phase terminal of the inverter 3.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Thus, the terminals of the inverter 3 and the phase coils of the stator coil of the motor 2 are electrically connected in the same phase. When the inverter-integrated motor 1 functions as a motor, the AC driving power of each phase output from the terminal of the inverter 3 is introduced to the corresponding phase coil of the stator coil via the lead conductor of the corresponding phase. In addition, when the inverter-integrated motor 1 functions as a generator, the AC regenerative power of each phase output from the stator coil is guided to a terminal of corresponding phase of the inverter 3.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The rotor 23 is a component that rotates by magnetic action of the stator 22, and is structured by a plurality of permanent magnets embedded inside a cylindrical magnetic material formed by stacking a plurality of silicon steel plates in the direction of the rotary shaft 21, or is constituted by arranging a plurality of permanent magnets on the outer peripheral surface of the magnetic body. In this case, permanent magnets of different polarity are alternately arranged at equal intervals in the circumferential direction.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Besides the permanent magnet described above, as the rotor 23, the so-called tandem Lundell type rotor structure may be used, which is provided with a rotor core for forming a magnetic circuit, a rotor coil wound in the rotor core for receiving the field current supplied from the outside such as vehicle battery via a brush and slip ring, and<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> generating a magnetic flux in order to magnetize the claw-shaped magnetic poles, and permanent magnets disposed between the claw-shaped magnetic poles of different polarity of the rotor core.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Now, a description is made of the arrangement in the inverter chamber 424. In the inverter chamber 424, the heat diffusion member 44 is disposed in contact with the inner surface of the bracket portion 422 and the inner surface of the cylindrical main body 421 of the inverter housing 42. A power module 31 is mounted on the heat diffusion member 44, further a bus bar &amp; smoothing capacitor 32 and the circuit board 33 are respectively fixed in this order.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">It is preferable to form the heat diffusion member 44 from a high thermal conductively material of low cost, for example, metal material such as copper (398W / m · K) or aluminum (236W / m · K). The heat diffusion member 44 of the present embodiment is formed into a cup shape having a bottom surface 441 in contact with the bracket portion 422 of the inverter housing 42 and a side surface 442 in contact with the inner surface of the cylindrical main body 421. Between the inner surface of the bracket portion 422 and the bottom surface 441, adhesive or grease of small thermal resistance (these being indicated with X2) is interposed.
