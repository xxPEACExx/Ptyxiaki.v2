A valid digital signature gives a recipient a reason to believe that the message was created by a claimed sender, such that the sender cannot deny having sent the message and that the message was not altered whilst in transit. Digital signatures are therefore used to detect forgery, tampering or unauthorised interception of communications.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In some cases, an asymmetric key pair including a public and private key pair is required to generate and verify a digital signature. The use of an asymmetric key pair is often referred to as asymmetric encryption. The public key is generally available to anyone, whilst the private key is only known by the sender. When a sender wants to transmit data, for example a digital message, the digital signature is appended to the message in a step which is referred to as "digital signing" of the message. The digitally signed message is then transmitted to a receiver.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Upon receipt of the message, the receiver verifies the digital signature by decrypting it with the sender's public key and possibly performing additional calculations on it. If the decryption and additional calculations are successful and yield expected results, the receiver can be assured that the origin of the message is the sender with the private key associated with the public key, and that the message contents has not changed since its transmission.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In some instances, the calculation of a public and private key pair which is to be used on private devices, most notably mobile phones, is performed on behalf of the mobile device by a certificate authority; however, in communicating the key pair to a mobile device, the private key is exposed to possible interception by unscrupulous parties. One of the fundamental requirements of asymmetric encryption protocols is that the private key has to be kept secret to the device that uses it. If an unscrupulous party has access to a device's private key, they will be able to generate messages which will appear to originate from the sender.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">To ensure that public and private key pairs are cryptographically strong, an algorithm used for their generation requires a cryptographically strong random number as one of its inputs. A random number may be calculated by an algorithm; however, such an<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> algorithm again requires a random starting value, typically called a seed value, as input. Calculating a cryptographically strong random seed value to use as an input value to a random number generator requires significant computing power, which is generally only available in advanced computing devices.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It would accordingly be beneficial to have a system or method which could assist computing devices with limited computational capabilities to generate cryptographically strong random numbers.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">In accordance with the invention there is provided a method for generating a random number performed on a mobile device and including the steps of:

The system includes a mobile device (1010) of a user (1020) and a remote server (1030) of a certificate authority (CA). In the present embodiment, the mobile device (1010) is a mobile phone; however, other forms of mobile device may include a tablet computer, a laptop computer, a personal digital<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> assistant, or the like generally having limited computational capabilities.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">A user-side software application (1040) is installed on the mobile phone (1010). The mobile phone (1010) includes an encryption module (1050) which provides encryption functionality to the user-side software application (1040). It should be apparent that the encryption module (1050) may be compiled as part of the user-side software application (1040).</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The first time that the user-side software application (1040) requires an encryption operation or unique user identification, it is established that there is no digital user certificate currently installed on the mobile phone (1010). At this point, the application (1040) automatically connects to the remote server (1030) of the CA and validates that the server it is communicating with is indeed that of the CA, and not a rogue server. This is done by validating a CA certificate signature (1060) sent to the mobile phone (1010) by the CA against a CA certificate (1070) that comes distributed as part of the user-side software application. It should, however, be apparent that validation of the CA could be inherent if the user-side software application is capable of decrypting communication from the CA that has been encrypted with a CA private key. If the user-side software application (1040) is capable of decrypting the CA encrypted communication by using the CA public key, it follows that the CA is genuine.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">If the validation is successful, the server (1030) attempts to establish a secure, independent communication channel (1080) between it and the mobile phone (1010) by means of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange or similar protocol. If the secure communication channel (1080) is successfully established, the user-side software application requests a digital user certificate and a random seed value from the remote server (1030).</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The remote server (1030) generates a random seed value (1090) utilizing a purpose built or dedicated device for generating secure random seed values. The device may be a hardware random number generator including a hardware security module (HSM) which may use a physical process to obtain a random value as input value to a random seed value generating algorithm. In the present embodiment, the physical process measured is thermal noise although other physical processes may be used as described further below. Measuring a physical process should ensure a high level of randomness. The generated random seed value (1090) is transmitted to the user-side software application (1040) over the secure communication channel (1080).</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Upon receipt of the random seed value (1090), the user-side software application (1040) uses the random seed value as input to a random number generating algorithm, executes the algorithm, and obtains a random number (1100). Then, the user-side software application (1040) uses the random number (1100) as input value to an<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> asymmetric key pair generating algorithm, executes the algorithm, and obtains a user asymmetric key pair comprising a user public key (1110) and a user private key (1120).</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The cryptographic key pair is stored in an encrypted memory element of the mobile phone (1010). The memory element may be sandboxed to isolate it from other resources on the mobile phone (1010). Only authorized applications, including the user-side software application (1040) and the encryption module (1050) are able to access the key pair in the encrypted memory element.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The user-side software application (1040) then transmits the user public key (1110) to the remote server (1030). The server creates and issues a digital user certificate (1130) to the mobile phone over the secure communication channel (1080). The user certificate is a signed X.509 digital certificate that can be used to firstly identify the mobile phone (1010) on which the certificate is installed and also for sharing symmetrical keys with a third party remote server. Shared symmetrical keys may be used for data encryption between the mobile phone (1010) and a third party remote server. The digital user certificate (1130) includes the user public key (1110) and is signed with a private key associated with the CA, wherein a corresponding public key of the CA is known to a software application at the third party remote server utilizing a server side software application (1040) or server side encryption module (1040), enabling the third party remote server to decrypt the signature and verify that it was signed by the CA private key and is accordingly authentic.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">It will be appreciated that in the system set out above, the user private key is not transmitted over any communication network, but remains on the mobile phone (1010), in an encrypted memory element with limited exposure, at all times. This reduces the risk of an unscrupulous party obtaining access to the user private key, especially during its transmission from a remote location where it would alternatively have been generated.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">It should be noted that the random seed value generated by the remote server (1030) may be generated in any manner which ensures a sufficiently high level of randomness. A purely computational method (algorithm) may be used, or a physical process as above. Physical processes which may be used include, but is not limited to, thermal noise as above, the photoelectric effect, radioactive decay, shot noise, clock drift, timing of a hard disc read/write head, radio noise, or the like. Furthermore, more than one HSM may be used in the generation of the random seed value.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">A method performed on a mobile device (1010) is illustrated by a flow diagram (2000) shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>. Operation of the method is facilitated by a user-side software application (1040) installed on the mobile device (1010). In a first step (2010), the mobile device (1010) connects to a remote server (1030) of a CA, and validates that it is<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> connected to the intended remote server in a next step (2020).</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Once the remote server (1030) is successfully validated, a secure communication channel is established between the mobile device and the remote server through a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or any other similar exchange in a next step (2030). In a further step (2040), the application (1040) requests a random seed value and a digital user certificate from the remote server (1030).</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The mobile device receives a random seed value from the server in a next step (2050). In a next step (2060), the user-side software application uses the random seed value to generate a random number (1090), and in a further step (2070) uses the random number (1090) to generate an asymmetric key pair including a public key (1110) and a private key (1120).</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The mobile device then transmits the public key to the remote server (1030) in a next step (2080), and in a final step (2090) receives a digital certificate (1130) from the remote server (1030), the digital certificate (1130) including the public key (1110) and being signed with a private key of the CA.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> shows a flow diagram (3000) illustrating an embodiment of a method performed on a remote server (1030).

In addition to a user public key (6010) and a CA signature (6020), the certificate also contains an identifier (6030) which is uniquely associated with a mobile device to which the certificate (6000) is issued. The identifier (6030) may be any unique key which is issued by a CA. In the current embodiment, the identifier (6030) is a sequential number generated by the CA. It should be appreciated that due to the sequential nature of the identifier (6030), a one to one relationship exists between each certificate issued by the CA and a mobile device. In addition to the above, the certificate (6000) may also include other information such as, for example, a mobile phone number (6040) associated with a subscriber identity module (SIM) of the mobile device, the mobile device's international mobile station equipment identity (IMEI) (6050) and/or international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) (6060) numbers as well as a certificate expiry date (6070).</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">It should be appreciated that in the example described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, issuing and storing of the user certificate (1130) may happen completely in the background and automatically, without requiring any user intervention. Once the digital user certificate (1130) has been issued by the remote server (1030) of the CA, and stored in the encrypted memory module of the mobile device (1010), it may be used by the user-side software application (1040) and/or encryption module (1050) to identify the mobile device (1010), to authenticate communication channels between the mobile device (1010) and any other servers, and to encrypt communications between the mobile device (1010) and other servers.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">A system (7000) wherein a mobile device, in the present embodiment a mobile phone (7010), communicates with a third party remote server (7020) using a digital user certificate (7030) issued to the mobile phone (7010), through the system (1000) described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 7</figref>. The system (7000) includes the mobile phone (7010) and the third party server (7020). The mobile phone has a user-side software application (7040) installed thereon and includes an encryption module (7050), while the third party server (7020) has a server side software application (7060) installed thereon and also includes an encryption module (7070). The mobile phone (7010) has a user asymmetric key pair, including a user public key (7080) and a user private key (7090) stored in a secure memory element of the mobile phone (7010).</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The third party server (7020) is issued with a digital server certificate (7100) by a remote<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> server (7110) of a CA. The issuing of the server certificate (7100) may happen at any time, but normally upon request from the third party server (7020). This request may also come directly from the server side software application (7060) or server side encryption module (7070), typically when the server side software application (7060) is first installed on the third party server (7020). The format of the server certificate (7100) is similar to that of the user certificate (7030) and as described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref>, and includes its own server public key (7120). A corresponding server private key (7130) is saved in a secure memory element in the third party server (7020), from where it is only accessible by the third party server (7020). Unlike is the case with the user asymmetric key pair, the server asymmetric key pair is typically calculated by the third party server (7020) in its entirety, including a seed value and random number as input values with a high enough level of randomness, as the third party server (7020) typically possesses the processing power required to do so. The third party server (7020) will therefore send its public key (7120) to the remote server (7110) of the CA when requesting the server certificate (7100) and the remote server (7110) of the CA, in turn, will issue the server certificate (7100), including the server public key (7120), and sign it with the CA private key.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">If both the mobile phone (7010) and third party server (7020) have been issued with digital certificates, the certificates (7030, 7100) may be used to authenticate communication channels between them, to identify the mobile phone (7010) and/or third party remote server (7020) and also to encrypt communication between them. Each time the mobile phone (7010) connects to the third party remote server (7020), it will start a certificate exchange process, whereby its certificate (7030) is sent to the third party server (7020), and the certificate of the server (7100) is sent to the mobile phone (7010). Both parties will then validate the content of the received certificates, and the digital signature, to make sure that the details in the certificates was not tampered with. This validation is done by using a CA digital certificate (7140) that is part of both the user-side software application (7030) and server side application (7060) or their respective encryption modules (7050, 7070). Knowledge of the CA public key may, however, be sufficient to enable validation of the respective certificates to be conducted. It should be appreciated that the CA digital certificate (7140) will include a CA public key and that the user and server side applications will therefore use the CA public key to decrypt the respective signed certificates (7030, 7100). If the certificates are not capable of being decrypted with the CA public key, it will be apparent that they were not signed with a CA private key, and are accordingly not authentic.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">At this point, both parties can be sure they are talking to the intended recipients. The mobile phone (7010) and third party server (7020) can now share encryption keys (7150) by means of which further encryption of their communication may be done. The<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> shared encryption keys (7150) are typically symmetrical encryption keys. It should be appreciated that, after the certificate exchange, the mobile phone (7010) will be in possession of the third party server public key (7120) and the third party server (7020) will be in possession of the handset public key (7080). The encryption keys may therefore be encrypted by the handset using the server public key (7120), and by the server using the handset public key (7080), thus ensuring that only the receiving parties will be able to decrypt the communications using their respective private keys (7130, 7090).</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">An identifier included in the user certificate (7030) may also be used by the third party server (7020) to uniquely identify the mobile phone (7010) and, accordingly, a user (7150) that is the owner of the mobile phone. The third party server may have a database of all the identifiers issued by the remote server (7110) of the CA to third party server clients, and may choose to only communicate with handsets included in the database. The identifiers may also be linked by the third party server (7020) to other information relating to the user (7150). When the third party server (7020) therefore receives a user certificate (7030) from the mobile device (7010), it can firstly validate that the certificate is authentic and has been issued by the remote server (7020) of the CA, and secondly that the mobile phone (7010) is indeed associated with a registered user. The digital user certificate (7030) is therefore used not only to authenticate the communication channel between the mobile phone (7010) and the third party server (7020), but also to uniquely identify the mobile phone (7030) that is attempting to transact with the third party server (7020). In this way, the third party server (7020) may rely on communications received from the mobile phone and be confident that communication over the communication channel is secure.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">It should be appreciated that the user-side software application may also validate that the third party server is the rightful owner of the certificate it sent, simply by virtue of the fact that the user-side software application is capable of decrypting communication sent to it by the third party server and that has been encrypted by the third party server private key. Only communications encrypted with the third party server private key will be capable of being decrypted with the third party server public key.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">It is foreseeable that the CA may periodically issue new certificates to all the mobile devices and/or third party servers to which it has previously issued certificates. This may be done as frequently as required, but preferably on an annual basis. The issuing of new user certificates may then also include the calculation of random seed values as required by the mobile devices.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">It is also foreseeable that the system will be capable of issuing certificates that include keys with increasingly larger bit sizes. At the time of writing, the industry standard for public and private keys is 1024 bits. The system may, however, easily be adapted to<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> issue key pairs of 2048, 3072 and more bits.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The very first time the CA receives a request for a user certificate from a new mobile device, it will be appreciated that the CA may issue such a handset with a self-signed certificate. The CA may then communicate the request for the certificate, along with the purported identity of the new mobile device to the third party server which, in turn, may decide whether a legitimate user certificate may be issued to the handset. If the third party server decides that the mobile device should be issued with a legitimate user certificate it will communicate this decision to the CA who, in turn, will issue a legitimate, fully signed user certificate to the mobile device, as described previously. In this way, the third party server may keep record of the identities and number of legitimate certificates issued to its users by the CA.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purpose of illustration, and is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed.

The method is performed on a mobile device, and includes the steps of establishing a secure, independent connection with a remote server, of transmitting a request for a random seed value from the server, of receiving a random seed value from the server generated by a dedicated random seed device, and of generating a random number using the random seed as input to a random number generating algorithm. The random number may in turn be used to generate an asymmetric key pair, including a public key and a private key, which in turn may be used to encrypt communication. The public key may be communicated to a remote server, which in turn may provide the mobile device with a digital certificate to use when digitally signing messages.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0096" num="0096">Finally, the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and it may not have been selected to delineate or circumscribe the inventive subject matter.
