However, it may be difficult or expensive to build an element that keeps this delay sufficiently constant over time as production-related influences, such as changes due to lithographical variation during IC manufacturing and other significant chemical variation, and operating conditions, such as variations of temperature and voltage, affect the delay of delay element.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Further applications of a constant delay element include the control of a computer clock rate. Present day computer chips often use high clock rates. At high clock rates, production variations and operating conditions that influence the delay rate may affect the synchronisation of the electronic components.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">One specific example of digital circuit using a delay chain to delay a signal by a pre-determined amount of time is a delay locked loop (DLL). A DLL can be used to change the phase of a clock signal, usually to enhance the clock rise-to-data output valid timing characteristics of integrated circuits. DLLs can also be used for clock recovery (CDR).<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The main component of a DLL is a delay chain composed of many delay gates connected front-to-back. The input of the delay chain is connected to the clock that is to be negatively delayed. A multiplexer is connected to each stage of the delay chain and the selector of this multiplexer is automatically updated by a control circuit to produce the negative delay effect. The output of the DLL is the resulting, negatively delayed clock signal.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present specification discloses an improved feedback mechanism for compensating delay variations by measuring an actual delay and by adjusting the delay over time according to the measured delay. In particular, the feedback mechanism according to the present specification comprises a low frequency sampling, wherein an output signal and/or an input signal are sampled at a sampling period that may be large compared to an accuracy of a delay to be measured.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the present specification, a low sampling period may be used, among others to provide a low cost device with sufficient accuracy or to further enhance the accuracy of a delay measurement. In particular, for multimedia applications such as the transmission and display of video data a low cost device may provide a sufficient delay accuracy.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In particular, the signals to be compared, such as the input signal and the output signal of a delay chain, are provided by two digital signals having the same amplitude and having essentially the same rectangular shape or being composed of essentially the same rectangular pulses. The two signals follow the same input signal clock. Furthermore, the expected delay is always smaller than one clock period of the input signal clock and the delay does not change abruptly or by a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> large amount over time. Furthermore, the two samplings are not themselves subject to sampling delay or at least those delays are negligible and it is allowable to provide an estimation of the delay based on a large number of samples.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The delay chain may be realized, by way of example, with a tapped delay line that contains a number of cells with well-defined delay times. This may be realized for example with D-flip-flop cells with pre-determined delay times, which are connected in series.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Preferably, the sampling period is shorter than a clock period of the input signal or the minimum distance between two transitions of the input signal. In a further embodiment, the sampling period is at least slightly shorter than an expected delay. On the other hand, the sampling period may be much longer than an accuracy of the delay measurement to be achieved.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present specification discloses a computer implemented method for providing or generating a delay value of a communication electronic unit with a delay chain.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A digital input signal and its corresponding delayed output signal of the communication electronic unit are sampled at a sampling interval of a pre-determined length, especially with a long sampling period that is comparable to or at least not much shorter than an expected delay.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">An amplitude or a voltage level of the sampled input signal is compared with an amplitude of the sampled output signal and a mismatch counting value M is incremented each time when the amplitude of the sampled input signal is not equal to the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> amplitude of the sampled output signal within a pre-determined tolerance.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A signal transition counting value N is incremented each time the input signal transitions, wherein a transition of the input signal may also be derived from a transition of the output signal.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The signal delay value between the input signal and the output signal is generated as a value that is also referred to as probabilistic value. The generated signal delay value is directly proportional to the mismatch counting value M, directly proportional to the length of the sampling intervals and inversely proportional to the signal transition counting value N.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In one embodiment, the sampling is performed simultaneously as the sampling of an input signal and an output signal of a delay chain.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In particular, the sampling may be performed by one or more one-bit samplers for sampling a signal with two voltage levels.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In one embodiment, the sampling is triggered regularly using a reference clock, wherein a sampling period of the reference clock is different from a clock period of the digital input signal. Thereby, the pulses of the reference clock shift relative to the clock pulses of the digital input signal and the alignment of the reference clock pulses is made independent of the alignment of the clock pulses of the digital input signal.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In particular, in one embodiment, a period of the reference clock is chose such that a multiple of a sampling period of the reference clock that is closest to one clock period of the input signal is offset against a clock period of the input signal by no more than 10% of the clock period of the input signal. Thereby, the reference clock pulses are only shifted by a small amount each time with respect to the input clock pulses. This can provide a finer time resolution.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to one embodiment, the transitions of the input signal are detected at the input signal, in particular by detecting transitions of the input signal at an input of a delay chain. Thereby, the detection of input signal transitions is synchronized with a detection of the input signal value.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to another embodiment, the transitions of the input signal are detected at the output signal, in particular by detecting transitions of the input signal at an output of the adjustable delay element. The relationship between the input and output signal is such that a transition is followed by an inversion of the levels or values of the input signal and the output signal.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In one embodiment, the probabilistic delay value is determined from a time period that is equal to a time between the input signal transition and an inversion of input and output values.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In particular, the probabilistic delay value D can calculated according to the equation D = T_ref * M/N, wherein the quotient is computed with a pre-determined accuracy and wherein T_ref is a sampling period between two consecutive sampling<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> times, M is the mismatch counting value and N is the transition counting value.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to the present specification various criteria maybe applied to determine when a sufficient accuracy has been reached. According to a one embodiment, an integration interval after which the delay value is calculated depends on a pre-determined number of input signal transitions. According to another embodiment, an integration interval after which the delay value is calculated depends on a pre-determined number of mismatches. According to yet another embodiment, an integration interval is bounded by a pre-determined integration time. These criteria may also be combined.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to a further embodiment, the probabilistic delay value is calculated based on the signal mismatches and transitions that occur within a sliding time window. By way of example, a sliding time windows may be realized with a shift register or the like, by reading in new values at the beginning and discarding old values at the end of a queue.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to a further embodiment, the method comprises adjusting of a delay according to the probabilistic delay value by deactivating or activating components of a delay chain. Therein, the number of components to be activated or deactivated depends on the delay. In particular, the number may be proportional to the delay.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Furthermore, the present specification discloses a delay generator for providing a pre-determined delay of a digital input signal The delay generator comprises an adjustable delay element, such as a delay chain. The adjustable delay element<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> comprises with a signal input for receiving an input signal and a signal output for outputting a delayed output signal.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A reference clock is provided for synchronizing a sampling of the input signal and the output signal. A signal comparing unit, for example in the form of two one-bit samplers and an XOR gate or other electronic components for comparing two digital input signals, is provided for comparing the input signal with the output signal at pre-determined sampling times and for counting a number of mismatches between the input signal and the output signal. The pre-determined sampling times of the signal comparing unit are provided by the reference clock.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">A transition detecting unit, for example in the form of an edge detector for a digital signal such as a flip-flop or other electronic component, is provided in a signal path of the input signal. The transition detecting unit is operative to detect signal transitions and to count a number of the signal transitions.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">A delay estimation unit is connected to the signal comparing unit and to the transition detection unit. The delay estimation unit is provided for receiving a number of mismatches from the signal comparing unit, for receiving a number of signal transitions from the transition detecting unit and for computing an estimated delay. By way of example the delay estimation unit can be provided by a computation unit such as an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) comprising electronic components such as adders and memory registers.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The estimated delay of the delay estimation unit, which is also referred to as probabilistic delay value or delay value,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> is proportional to the number of mismatches and inversely proportional to the number of transitions.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The delay generator further comprises a controller that is connected to the delay estimation unit and to the adjustable delay element. In particular, the delay estimation unit may comprise the controller. The delay generator provides a control signal to the adjustable delay element, the control signal depending on the estimated delay.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In one particular embodiment, the controller of the adjustable delay element is operative to adjust the delay by activating and by deactivating individual electronic components of the adjustable delay element. In particular, activating and deactivating may refer to switching the electronic components on and off.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">According to one embodiment the signal comparing unit comprises a first one-bit sampler and a second one-bit sampler. In particular, the first one-bit sampler and the second one-bit sampler may be realized by one-bit samplers that comprise a flip-flop element.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In one particular embodiment, the signal comparing unit comprises an XOR gate for comparing a first signal that represents a first bit with a second signal that represents a second bit.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Moreover, the present specification discloses an integrated circuit with the abovementioned delay generator, wherein the delay generator is realized by semiconductor components of the integrated circuit.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Furthermore, the present specification discloses a communication electronic system with the integrated circuit.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">A delay compensation device according to the present specification does not require two matching variable delay chains. Thereby, power consumption can be reduced, as the power consumption of a delay chain is defined by the frequency of the input and each delay chain consumes power. Moreover, the delay compensation according to the present specification is not limited to a linear response of a delay cell to a control signal and can be used to account for nonlinearities.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In summary, a delay compensation device according to the present specification can be designed to require less area on the chip and to consume less power than a delay compensation device with two delay chains and it can be designed to accommodate nonlinearities of chain. Furthermore, by using a design with only one delay chain there is no mismatch delay between two delay chains.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In particular, according to the present specification a delay may be measured in increments that are much smaller than is feasible by using a direct measurement with an available reference clock. This is achieved by measuring the delay using a statistical accumulation of transitional events.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">According to the present specification, both the input signal and the delayed output signal are sampled at regular intervals. Every time a state is detected such that the input is not equal to the output, a mismatch counter M is incremented. Furthermore, a separate counter N counts the input signal transitions. An estimated delay between the input and output is computed that is directly proportional to the counting<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> value of the mismatch number M and inversely proportional to the number N of input signal transitions.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The subject of the present specification is now explained in further detail with respect to the following Figures, wherein

However, it is not possible to measure a 500ps delay within an accuracy of +/- 10ps in this way using a 1GHz clock, as events happen 100 times more frequently than the clock pulses of the 1GHz clock.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> shows a delay device 20 for generating a controlled delay according to a second embodiment.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The delay device 20 comprises an adjustable delay chain 21 and a delay measurement device 31.

According to another embodiment, the first and second comparators 38, 39 are part of the delay measurement device 31. The comparators 38, 39 and the adjustment module 41 are shown in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In the following, it is assumed that the input signal is a digital signal with a high level, referred to as "1" and a low level, referred to as "0". A transition from the high-level to the low level is referred to as "10" transition and a transition from the low level to the high level is referred to as "01" transition. However, this does not limit the subject of the present specification to a specific data encoding method. Among others, the transitions of the input signal may be used in different ways to encode a binary data stream or they may be used to represent a digital clock pulse.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In a more general embodiment, a delay measurement device 31, 31' according to the present specification may also be used to determine a delay for a digital signal with multiple levels, for example a digital audio signal before a digital/analog conversion.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">During operation, the input signal and the output signal of the delay chain are simultaneously sampled by the two single-bit<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> samplers. In one embodiment, the sampling is regular, using a reference clock that is independent of the input signal. An independent reference clock provides bit-samples with a good statistic that is independent from the input signal. In particular, it is advantageous if a period of the reference clock, or a multiple of the reference clock period, is slightly different from a multiple of a clock period of the input signal. From a sufficient number of samples, the approximate delay value can be derived.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">By way of example, if a sampling period, or a multiple of the sampling period, is slightly longer than a multiple of the input signal clock period, the locations of the sampling points behind successive signal transitions are slightly shifted with respect to each other. Thereby, an effective density of the sampling points can be increased. For example, in the example of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> five sampling periods are slightly longer than a minimum time between consecutive transitions of the input signal.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">The edge detector 25 detects transitions of the input signal. Every time a transition happens, it is followed by an inverse in input/output values when the input signal is not equal to the output signal due to the delay. This can be best seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>. This transitional state exists for a time period equal to the delay of the delay chain. Herein, it is assumed that the time delay is shorter than a minimum distance between two transitions of the input signal. This assumption is fulfilled for many applications.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">By sampling in regular intervals, the transitional state can be hit or missed. The probability of hit and miss is directly related to the value of delay. Hence, the delay value generated<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> by this proposal may be considered as a probabilistic delay value. Herein, it is assumed that the delay does not change or changes only very little during an evaluation time window during which the delay is determined. This is especially the case for a delay that is caused by slowly varying conditions such as the temperature or the chemical composition of the semiconductor material. The evaluation time window is also referred to as integration time.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Whenever a hit, or in, other words, a mismatch between the input signal and the delayed output signal, is detected, the mismatch counter M is incremented. A second counter, N, counts the number of input signal transitions and is incremented whenever an input signal transition is detected.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">According to the present specification, a total delay after N signal transitions is approximated by the mismatch counter M times the sampling period T_ref. Accordingly, the delay D after one signal transition is approximated by dividing the number M of mismatches between the input signal and the delayed output signal times the sampling period T_ref by the number N of signal transitions, which yields the formula <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><mi>D</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>T</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">ref</mi></msub><mo>*</mo><mfrac><mi>M</mi><mi>N</mi></mfrac></mrow></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="24" he="11" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Furthermore, an estimate of a relative delay may be derived from the delay value D, for example by dividing the estimate D of the delay by a clock time of the input signal or by the sampling period.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">When the delay does not change during an integration time or when the delay change is negligible, the transitional state<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> after a signal transition becomes a repetitive process even though the input signal itself may not be repetitive or even have a pre-determined sequence of transitions. According to the present specification, this effect is used to sample a plurality of transitional states at different sampling times after the corresponding signal transitions instead of sampling with a smaller sampling period after a given signal transition.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">The estimate D of the delay improves for a longer sampling window. Furthermore, it is advantageous if the sampling frequency, or a multiple thereof, is not a multiple of an input signal clock frequency but slightly different from a multiple of the input signal clock frequency. In particular, an estimate D of the actual delay t_D may be considered as sufficiently accurate for a predetermined minimum number of sampling pulses and/or for a predetermined minimum number N_min of input signal transitions.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">By using a count of signal transitions of the input signal according to the present specification it is not necessary to use a periodic test signal or even a test signal with a pre-determined pattern of transitions in order to determine the delay between the input signal and the delayed output signal, although such signals may be used if desired. The input signal only needs to have a sufficient number of transitions within an integration time. Thereby, the signal delay can be determined while information is transmitted over an input signal line.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">Signals with only a few transitions, which are less suitable for a delay determination, may be pre-processed. For example, a raw signal encoding a black and white line image usually<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> has long sequences of the same bit. These sequences can be made shorter by using a compression such as run length encoding. Furthermore, the distribution of 1s and 0s can be made more even with a signal scrambler. The pre-processing or encoding can be reversed on a decoding side by using a decompression unit and a descrambling unit.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">The integration time does not need to be fixed in advance but the mismatch count M can be incremented until a pre-determined number of transitions N of the input signal or a pre-determined number of mismatches M is reached.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> shows an example of calculating an estimate of the time delay between an input signal.

At the third sampling time, no mismatch between the input signal and the output signal is detected. Hence, the mismatch counter M is increased by one. Furthermore, a transition of the input signal is detected between the first and the second sampling time. Hence, the transition counter N is increased by one.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">At the sixth and seventh sampling time, a mismatch between input and output signal is detected but not at the eight sampling time.
