In order to improve the annual performance factor (APF), it has been desirable for a refrigerating apparatus such as an air conditioner to improve the efficiency in the middle to low speed operation range where the motor is mostly operated. Therefore, the motor tends to be designed so that the motor induced voltage (back electromotive force) becomes high in recent years.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, since the motor induced voltage (back electromotive force) is proportional to the rotating speed of a motor, the output voltage of an inverter becomes lower than the induced voltage of the motor by limitation of DC voltage in the range of high-speed operation, and the motor<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> cannot be normally driven in some cases. As a conventional countermeasure, there is a method such as field-weakening control. However, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 10</figref>, the losses of the motor and inverter are increased according to an increase in the reactive current of the motor, and the total efficiency of the system is deteriorated. Instead, it is effective that the DC voltage is boosted to increase the output voltage of the inverter in the case where the output voltage of the inverter is insufficient.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A circuit configuration of boosting after converting AC voltage to DC has been developed from a long time ago, and a plurality of methods have been proposed. For example, using a three-phase PWM converter configured using six semiconductor power devices, the harmonic reduction of input current and the boosting control of output DC voltage can be performed. However, a plurality of semiconductor power devices and complicated control devices are necessary, and thus the cost of the apparatus is significantly increased. The product cost is considered to be important for consumer and industrial apparatuses such as air conditioners and general-purpose inverters, and thus it has been desirable to use inexpensive boosting devices.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Further, as a simple boosting device, for example, Japanese Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP4937281B"><text>4937281</text></patcit> and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2010233439A"><text>2010-233439</text></patcit> describe a boosting<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> chopper circuit configured using a reactor, a semiconductor switching device, and a diode provided on the output side of a diode rectifier.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the boost circuit described in Japanese Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP4937281B"><text>4937281</text></patcit>, DC voltage can be adjusted by one boosting chopper. However, since the capacity of a three-phase power receiving apparatus is generally large, an increase in size and cost of the parts (power devices and reactors) configuring the boosting chopper is inevitable.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2010233439A"><text>2010-233439</text></patcit>, there is a method in which a plurality of boosting choppers are arranged in parallel to perform an interleave operation. Although the number of parts of the boosting chopper is increased, the capacity of each part is reduced. Thus, inexpensive general-purpose parts can be used. However, in order to control each boosting chopper, a current detection device and a control circuit are necessary for each boosting chopper, and the apparatus becomes complicated.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a boost circuit, a motor driving module, and a refrigerating apparatus that detect the current of each power device using one current detection device, and adjust the on width<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> of each power device to substantially equalize the current of each power device.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In order to address the above-described problems, the present invention provides a boost circuit including: a rectifying circuit for an AC power source; a plurality of reactors that are connected in parallel to the positive electric potential side of the rectifying circuit; a plurality of power devices that are connected in series to the plurality of reactors to turn on or off current; a single resistor that is connected between the plurality of power devices and the negative electric potential side of the rectifying circuit; and/or a control unit alternately controls the plurality of power devices so that the current flowing to the plurality of power devices is substantially equalized.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to the present invention, the current of each power device is detected using one current detection device, and the on width of each power device is adjusted, so that the current of each power device can be substantially equalized.

The boost circuit includes a diode rectifier 2 connected to an AC power source 1 and a power factor improvement reactor 3 that is provided on the DC side of the diode rectifier 2<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> and is connected to one end of an output terminal of the diode rectifier 2 to improve the power factor. The reactor 3 improves the input power factor from the AC power source. The reactors 3 is connected to the positive electric potential side of the diode rectifier 2 (rectifying circuit). Between the other end of the power factor improvement reactor 3 and the other end of the output terminal of the diode rectifier 2, arranged is a highfrequency noise suppressing capacitor 4 to suppress highfrequency noise generated from a boosting chopper circuit. Specifically, a low-pass filter (LPF) is configured. Only a common mode filter that can easily filter noise on the AC side may be installed.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In addition, two boosting reactors 5a and 5b are provided in parallel to the other end of the power factor improvement reactor 3 in the boost circuit of the embodiment. Further, power devices 6a and 6b (switching devices) that turn on or off current flowing to each of the boosting reactors 5a and 5b are provided in series to the boosting reactors 5a and 5b, respectively.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Fast recovery diodes (FRDs) 7a and 7b that perform fast recovery are arranged to the boosting reactors 5a and 5b on the side opposite to the power factor improvement reactor 3. Between the input side and the output side of the boosting chopper circuit configured by including the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> boosting reactors 5a and 5b and the power devices 6a and 6b, provided is a current bypass diode 8 to bypass the boosting chopper circuit.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">When the operation of the boost circuit stops, current of the boosting reactors 5a and 5b and the fast recovery diodes (FRDs) 7a and 7b can be allowed to bypass through the current bypass diode 8 that is a general-purpose rectifying diode. Thus, a conduction loss when the boosting operation stops can be reduced.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the embodiment, one current detection device 9 is provided between the power devices 6a and 6b (switching devices) that turn on or off current and the other end of the diode rectifier 2. Specifically, one current detection device 9 is provided between the emitter terminal or the source terminal of each of the power devices 6a and 6b and the negative electric potential terminal of input voltage. The current detection device 9 employs a current sampling resistor and an amplifying circuit 9a to reduce the cost as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. In place of the current sampling resistor, a current detection device such as a current sensor configured using hall elements may be used.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Between the output side of the fast recovery diodes (FRDs) 7a and 7b and the other end of the diode rectifier 2, provided is a voltage dividing resistor 10 for voltage detection, and a smoothing capacitor 11 for output voltage<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> is provided in parallel to the voltage dividing resistor 10 for voltage detection. A controller 12 of the boost circuit is configured using a semiconductor arithmetic device such as an analog circuit, a microcomputer, or a DSP (Digital Signal Processor), and processes DC voltage signals and boosting target voltage from a voltage detection device of the voltage dividing resistor 10. Further, the controller 12 generates an on/off control signal for each of the power devices 6a and 6b. In this case, voltage signals are detected by the inexpensive voltage dividing resistor 10 to reduce the cost. However, in place of the voltage dividing resistor, a device such as a DC voltage sensor may be used.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the embodiment, the boosting chopper circuits are connected in parallel using two boosting reactors 5a and 5b. However, the boosting chopper circuits may be configured by arranging two or more boosting reactors in parallel according to boosting voltage and output power capacity.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the embodiment as described above, the number of parts is increased because a plurality of boosting reactors 5a and 5b are provided in parallel. However, the current is equally dispersed, and thus the current flowing to one boosting chopper circuit can be reduced. Accordingly, inexpensive general-purpose components can be used for the power devices 6a and 6b and the power factor improvement<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> reactor 3. Especially, the power factor improvement reactor 3 is a large part in size, and the cost thereof is high.
