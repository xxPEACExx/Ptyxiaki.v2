Prior art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Nowadays, a house is equipped with many electronic devices. Some electronic devices are often grouped together, for instance because they may be used for similar purpose (like a tuner and a CD player, both performing music rendering), or because they need to be used together. For example, a tuner, controlling the video input of a TV, of a set-top-box and of a DVD player for example, may be grouped with the TV, the set-top-box and the DVD player. Each device is often delivered to a customer with several cables (for power supply, for data exchange,...). Thus, the grouping of electronic devices results in a huge amount of cables. As a consequence, it becomes very difficult for a user to find the "good cable", when he needs to update or remove one of the grouped device. Furthermore, because of the number and the many twists and turns of the cables, many dust may be accumulated in close vicinity of the cables. This may cause a security problem (for instance, it may cause a fire departure in case of an electrical spark).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">So, there's a need to provide a user with a more ergonomic and /or safety way of grouping electronic devices.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>3.

It may also be used when the device is part of a group of interconnected devices, notably a group of stacked devices. In such an embodiment, the invention may notably permit to reduce the number of power supply cables needed. Indeed, when each device of a set of stacked devices (or all devices of the set except one) is equipped with a power supply element according to at least an embodiment of the invention, only one power supply cable is needed for the whole group of devices.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Some embodiments, in which the power supply element is fixedly coupled to the device, for example with a permanent assembling, permit to make sure that the power supply element will stay in the device, even if the device is used as a standalone device during a long time, and even if the device is frequently displaced.</p><heading id="h0007"><u>5.2 Detailed description of a particular embodiment</u></heading><p id="p0042" num="0042">A particular embodiment will now be presented, in association with <figref idrefs="f0001">figures 1 and 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows a perspective view of a power supply element 100 according to a particular embodiment, the power supply element 100 comprising a retractable module (not shown) in a retracted position.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">According to the particular illustrated embodiment, the power supply element 100 comprises a housing 110.

An embodiment with a retractable module 140 being totally retractable inside the power supply element may also permit, when the power supply element 100 is mounted on the basement of an electronic device 402 (as illustrated by <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 4</figref>), to keep the device comprising the power supply element on an horizontal plan when the electronic device 402 is used as a standalone. An adaptable length of the extension of the retractable module, when the power supply element 100 is mounted on the basement of an electronic device, may also permit to obtain an external length of the extended retractable module similar to the length of the feet of the device.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Similarly, when the power supply element is mounted on the top of an electronic device, a retractable module with several extended positions may permit to help keeping another device stacked on the top of the electronic device comprising the power supply element on an horizontal plan.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0001">figures 1 and 2</figref>, the retractable module 140 is a sliding module. In other embodiments, it may be a pivoting module for instance.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">figures 2 and 3</figref>, the retractable module 140 may comprise at least a power supply male connector, with at least an electrical contact (142, 144). It may also comprise data connectors 146 in order to permit data emission and/or reception.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In the illustrated embodiments, the power supply element 100 also comprises first invalidation means 150, which prevent, at least partially, access to the first power supply male connector 122 of the first module 120 when the second module is in an extended position. The first invalidation means 150 may let some electrical contact still accessible. For example, a power supply connector with two electrical contacts is secured when at least one of its electrical contacts is not accessible, even if an electrical contact is still accessible.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In other embodiments, eventually complementary, as represented by <figref idrefs="f0001">figures 2 and 3</figref>, the first invalidation means 150 may also entirely invalidate the access to the first power supply male connector 122. Such an invalidation position may offer, not only an electrical protection of the connector but also a mechanical protection of the connector.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The first invalidation means 150 may for instance comprise a safety panel, like a sliding or pivoting panel, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">figures 2 and 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In some embodiments, the first invalidation means may be commanded by the commuting means 130. Such an embodiment may permit to ensure that the first power supply connector is automatically protected when the second module is in an extended position. In other embodiments, an extension of the second module may not be commanded when the first invalidating means have not been activated before. For example, a protuberance laterally located on an extremity (like a distal extremity) of the safety panel 150 may block the commuting means of the second module 140 when the safety panel 150 is not in its safety position.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0055" num="0055"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 3</figref> shows a power supply element with a retractable module in an extended position, according to a second embodiment. In this second embodiment, the power supply element notably differs from the one presented in association with <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 2</figref>, because of shapes of the second power supply module and of the housing.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The power supply element 100 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 3</figref> may also comprise blocking means 160, enabling the second module to be maintained in its extended and/or retracted position. Those blocking means may be activated automatically and/or manually. Depending upon embodiments, such blocking means may belong, at least partially, to the second power supply module or may belong, at least partially, to a separate module.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 5A and 5B</figref> illustrate such blocking means 160, 500, 510 according to two different embodiments. In both figures, the second power supply module 140 is in a retracted position. <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 5B</figref> shows a partial cross section represented by section B-B in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 3</figref>, in a side view, of a power supply element 100 according to an embodiment, compatible with the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 3</figref>. The power supply element 100 comprises a housing 110 including a back face, a second power supply module 140 and blocking means 500, comprising a button 160 and a spring 170 mounted on the back face of the housing 110.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 5A</figref> shows a partial cross section represented by section A_A in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 5B</figref>, in a bottom view of a power supply element 100 according to another embodiment, which notably differs from the power supply element of <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 5B</figref> because of the absence of spring.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In the illustrated embodiments of <figref idrefs="f0002">figures 5A and 5B</figref>, the blocking means are situated partially on the second power supply module 140 (first blocking means 510), and partially an a separate module 500 (second blocking means 500), the first and second blocking means being adapted to cooperate together. The first blocking means may for instance be a protrusion 510, located above the second blocking means 500. The second blocking means notably comprise a button 160. As illustrated, the shapes of<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> first and second blocking means 510, 500 may be adapted to prevent the second power supply module 140 to move from a retracted position to an extended position (and/or vice-versa), even if commutation means are actuated, and to liberate the second power supply module 140 when the button 160 is pressed.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">According to the particular embodiments illustrated by <figref idrefs="f0002">figures 5A and 5B</figref>, the second blocking means 500 surround the second power supply module 140, with a gap 520 between the inner wall of the second blocking means 500 and the wall of the second power supply module at the opposite side of the protrusion 510. Because of the protrusion 510, the second blocking means 500 prevent the second power supply module 140 from moving to an extended position. When the button 160 is pressed, the gap 520 disappears and a new gap is created under the protrusion 510 thus releasing the second power supply module 140. Similarly, as illustrated, the protrusion 510 and the second blocking means 500 may prevent the second power supply module 140 to retract once in an extended position. Such an embodiment may permit for instance to ensure that the retractable module 140, when in its extracted position, will withstand an insertion load during an assembly with a female power connector and not move back in the housing.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In some embodiments, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 5B</figref>, the second blocking means may comprise a spring, with an extremity mounted on the back face of the housing for instance. Such embodiments offer the advantage of ensuring the return of the second blocking means in their blocking position, when the button 160 is released.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In other embodiments, the blockings means may be adapted to be engaged with said commuting means so as to prevent the movement of said commuting means in at least a direction of displacement, thus preventing the extension and/or retraction of the second power supply module.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The power supply element 100 may also comprise second invalidation means 600, as illustrated by <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 6A to 6C</figref>, in order to prevent, at least partially, access to the second power supply male connector when the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> second module 140 is in its retracted position. Such second invalidation means may invalidate access to at least one contact 142, 144 of the second power supply connector.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Depending upon the embodiments, and similarly to the first invalidation means 150, the second invalidation means 600 may invalidate partially and/or totally the access to all the electrical contacts 142, 144 of the second power supply male connector. Such an embodiment may notably permit a compliance of the power supply element with safety standards, for instance by passing safety tests such as pin gauge insertion test.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">In some embodiments, the second invalidation means 600 may be commanded by the commuting means 130. Such an embodiment may permit to ensure that the access to the second power supply connector is invalidated when the second power supply connector is in its retracted position. In other embodiments, the second invalidation means may be activated regardless of the commutation means. For example, in some embodiments, as illustrated by <figref idrefs="f0003">figures 6B to 6C</figref>, the second invalidation means may comprise a second safety panel (for example a sliding panel 600 as illustrated by <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 6C</figref> or a pivoting panel 600 as illustrated by <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 6B</figref>), the panel 600 being mobile between an opening position and a closing position, in which the second safety panel 600 prevents access to at least some of the contacts of the second power supply connector. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure6C</figref>, the second safety panel 600 is spring-mounted, in order for the safety panel to automatically come back in its closing position, when no obstacle (like a part of the second power supply module) prevents the closure of the safety panel. The compression spring 610 may be adapted to permit the opening of the safety panel under the force applied by the end of the second power supply module during its extension.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">In some embodiments, notably in the particular embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 6C</figref>, the second power supply module and the safety panel may present face to face beveled sides (620, 630). Those face to face beveled sides (620, 630) may facilitate the opening of the safety panel 600 under the force applied by the end of the second power supply module 140 during its extension.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0067" num="0067">In some embodiments, the power supply element 100 may also comprises at least a power supply female connector, notably a standard female connector and/or a female connector adapted to cooperate with a power supply element according to at least one embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">In some embodiments, when the power supply element comprises several safety panels, several or all safety panels may be in a closing position at the same time.
