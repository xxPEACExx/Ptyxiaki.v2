The apparatus for supplying electric power needs to use a wireless power transmission technique that enables efficient power transmission even in seawater, because the surrounding area of the apparatus is seawater. The wireless power transmission technique needs to be a technique that does not require the power supply metal plugs to be exposed, and that has no possibility of shorting even in seawater, which has an electric conductivity of approximately 4S/m.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In general, a transmission apparatus that wirelessly transmits/receives electric power has a coil formed by a conductor wire wound thereon several times. Application of alternating current power to this coil produces a magnetic flux that interlinks with the coil.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> As a result of this magnetic flux interlinking with the coil of the receiving apparatus, induced current is generated in the coil of the receiving apparatus, and thereby power transmission is performed.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Regarding the wireless technique, for example, Patent Document 1 discloses a technique in which a terminal device main body and a removable electronic device such as a memory card, perform electromagnetic induction type communication using wireless millimeter wave signals.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent Document 2 discloses a technique that uses electromagnetic induction in which an inductance value between the transmission apparatus and the receiving apparatus is increased to thereby increase the distance of electric power transmission.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Patent Document 3 discloses a technique that uses electromagnetic induction in which resonance (magnetic field resonance) is made at the same frequency, using a coil of a high Q value, to thereby improve mutual inductance between the transmission apparatus and the receiving apparatus, and increase the distance of electric power transmission.</p><heading id="h0003">[Prior Art Documents]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Patent Documents]</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007"><ul><li>[Patent Document 1] <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2011022640A"><text>Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2011-022640</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 2] <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP4772744B"><text>Japanese Patent Publication No. 4772744</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 3] <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2012504387W"><text>Published Japanese Translation No. 2012-504387 of the PCT International Publication</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><heading id="h0006">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, in order to perform electric power transmission efficiently in the wireless power transmission techniques of Patent Document 1 through Patent Document 3 that use electromagnetic induction technology, it is necessary to have the coil of the transmission apparatus and the coil of the receiving apparatus distanced from each other such that they are in almost intimate contact. For example, here is assumed a case where a submarine is the target of electric power transmission in seawater. In this case, when supplying electric power to the submarine, positioning between the submarine and the electric power supply apparatus needs to be performed at a high level of precision. Therefore, it is difficult to perform stable electric power supply.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Moreover, it is a known fact that only a limited level of electric power transmission efficiency can be achieved even if the techniques for increasing power transmission distance disclosed in Patent Document 2 and Patent Document 3, which are techniques for increasing in-air power transmission distance, are applied to power transmission in seawater. The reason for this is that electric conductivity and dielectric permittivity significantly differ between air and seawater, and the power transmission mechanisms in a medium differ between in-air power transmission and in-seawater power transmission. The electric conductivity of air is 0S/m and the relative permittivity is approximately 1. On the other hand, the electric conductivity of seawater is approximately 4S/m and the relative permittivity is approximately 81.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Here is briefly described the point of physical difference between the case where wireless electric power propagates through air and the case where it propagates through<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> seawater.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the case of electric power transmission through air, there is almost no power consumption associated with the medium (air) itself. The factors of reduced electric power transmission efficiency in this case mainly includes conductor loss in the coil, consistency loss between the transmission apparatus and the receiving apparatus, reflection loss such as magnetic flux leakage, and radiation loss. Particularly in the technique disclosed in Patent Document 2, a coil of a high Q value is used, and a non-radiative phenomenon, in which energy is accumulated in close proximity to the transmission/receiving apparatuses, is created, to thereby effectively suppress this radiation loss.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the case of electric power transmission through seawater, the medium (seawater) has a certain level of electric conductivity, and therefore, electric power consumption associated with the medium becomes an energy loss. The contributing factor to this energy loss is based on the electric conductivity of the seawater and the electric field generated in the seawater. That is to say, a potential gradient in proportion to the product of this electric conductivity and electric field is generated in the seawater, and a loss occurs as a result. Moreover, since the electric conductivity of seawater is high, if non-directional energy output is made from the transmission apparatus in this seawater, it will not reach the opposing receiving apparatus, and energy loss increases. Therefore, in order to efficiently perform electric power transmission in seawater, directionality needs to be provided so as to connect the coil planes that oppose each other, and an energy flow substantially perpendicular to both of the coil planes needs to be formed.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The coil plane here refers to a plane that includes, as an outer shape, the loop that is formed by electric current flowing through the coil.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Taking into consideration the difference between the in-air energy propagation mechanism and the in-seawater energy propagation mechanism, it is particularly difficult, with use of the technique disclosed in Patent Document 1, to transmit millimeter wave signals through a good conductor medium such as seawater. For example, in the case of a 60 GHz millimeter wave, the distance at which energy decays to a quarter in propagation through seawater is 100 µm or less. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to perform propagation of 10 cm or more in seawater.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the case of increasing the distance of electric power supply through seawater with use of the technique disclosed in Patent Document 2 that uses magnetic bodies and resonance, the magnetic flux increases. On the other hand, the electric field component that radiates into seawater also increases, in association with the increased magnetic flux. As a result, the electric power transmission efficiency will not increase. Furthermore, the technique disclosed in Patent Document 2 that uses magnetic bodies and resonance is a technique that uses the non-radiative phenomenon. Accordingly, it is fundamentally difficult to realize an increase in the distance of electric power transmission within a highly conductive medium.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Moreover, in the case of the relevant magnetic field resonance technique disclosed such as in Patent Document 3, efficient energy transmission can be performed only by having an equal resonance frequency in the transmission apparatus and the receiving apparatus. However, since the relative permittivity in seawater is 81, which is significant, the resonance frequency is influenced significantly by the impedance of the medium between the transmission apparatus and the receiving apparatus. Therefore, it is difficult to perform energy transmission by simply using the resonance phenomenon of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> transmission/receiving apparatuses. Furthermore, the magnetic field resonance technique is a technique that uses the non-radiative phenomenon, and it is therefore fundamentally difficult to realize an increase in the distance of electric power transmission within a highly conductive medium.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Various types of media such as the ones shown in the table of <figref idrefs="f0029">FIG. 35</figref> also have comparatively high electric conductivity and relative permittivity. Therefore, similar problems may occur also in the case of performing electric power transmission wirelessly in these types of media in addition to seawater.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The techniques disclosed in Patent Document 1 through Patent Document 3 are techniques for performing only either one of electric power transmission and communication. There is a demand for a technique that enables both electric power transmission and communication.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">An exemplary object of the present invention is to provide a power transmission system, a transmission apparatus, a receiving apparatus, and a power transmission method that solves the above problems.</p><heading id="h0007">Means for Solving the Problem</heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">A power transmission system according to a first exemplary aspect of the present invention includes a transmission apparatus and a receiving apparatus.
