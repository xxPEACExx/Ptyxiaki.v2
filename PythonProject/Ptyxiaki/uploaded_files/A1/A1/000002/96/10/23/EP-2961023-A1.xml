Therefore, small-capacity electricity storage elements equivalent to the number of necessary voltage stages are connected in series and a plurality of the electricity storage element rows are connected in parallel. When a part of the electricity storage elements are broken down, only the electricity storage element row to which the broken-down<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> electricity storage elements belong is disconnected to avoid the interruption of the power supply to the apparatus connected to the electricity storage system. By replacing only the broken-down electricity storage element row, it is possible to reduce life cycle costs of the electricity storage system.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, if a large number of electricity storage elements are connected in series and in parallel and used, because of variation during manufacturing of the electricity storage elements and a difference in an environment of use (e. g. , an ambient temperature), an internal short-circuit sometimes occurs only in a part of the electricity storage elements. Consequently, an electric current equal to or larger than an allowable current flows to a part of the electricity storage elements and the electricity storage elements abnormally generate heat and are easily broken down. Therefore, it is anticipated that the electricity storage element row to which the broken-down electricity storage elements belong is disconnected (paralleled off) from the parallel-connected electricity storage system using a switch and replaced with other electricity storage elements. However, in the case of an electricity storage system for the purpose of suppressing power fluctuation, it is necessary to replace electricity storage elements without stopping charging and discharging. Therefore, it is necessary to reconnect (parallel on) the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> electricity storage element row after the replacement in a state in which the parallel-connected electricity storage system is performing the charging and discharging. However, when paralleling on the electricity storage element row, if there is a voltage difference between the parallel-connected electricity storage system and the electricity storage element row after the replacement, an electric current equal to or larger than the allowable current sometimes flows to a part of the electricity storage elements.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For example, Patent Literature 1 proposes an electricity storage system that switches on only an electricity storage element row having a predetermined voltage difference.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Citation List</b></heading><heading id="h0004"><b>Patent Literature</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent Literature 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2009033936A"><text>JP-A-2009-33936</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005"><b>Summary of Invention</b></heading><heading id="h0006"><b>Technical Problem</b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, in the technique disclosed in Patent Literature 1 as well, it is likely that variation in an electric current occurs among the electricity storage element rows and an<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> excessively large current flows to a part of the rows.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">For example, a case is examined in which the electricity storage element rows are switched on when battery remaining powers of the electricity storage element rows are equal. The manner of the flow of an electric current at this point is shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10</figref>. When it is assumed that all power deterioration states in the electricity storage element rows are equal, if battery remaining powers are equal, battery open-circuit voltages are equal. However, among the electricity storage element rows already switched on and the electricity storage element rows not switched on yet, there is a voltage difference due to wiring resistance caused by a bus bar or the like for connecting batteries in series and in parallel. Therefore, if the electricity storage element rows are switched on when the battery remaining powers are equal (T=T0), there is a problem in that a large current flows to the switched-on electricity storage element rows.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Next, a case is examined in which both end voltages of a parallel-connected switch 101 are equal. The manner of the flow of an electric current at this point is shown in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 11</figref>. In this case, immediately after switch-on (T=T1), a voltage difference is substantially zero between the parallel-connected electricity storage system and the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> electricity storage element row after the replacement. Therefore, an electric current hardly flows from the electricity storage element row after the replacement and gradually starts to flow in a relaxation time τ. However, when sudden fluctuation (T=T1') of charging and discharging currents of the entire parallel-connected electricity storage system occurs while such large current variation occurs in among the electricity storage element rows in the parallel-connected electricity storage system, there is a problem in that an excessively large current flows to the electricity storage element row after the replacement.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is an object of the present invention to prevent an excessively large current from flowing to a part of electricity storage elements when a part of electricity storage battery rows in a parallel-connected electricity storage system are paralleled on after being paralleled off.</p><heading id="h0007"><b>Solution to Problem</b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">In order to attain the object, the present invention provides a parallel-connected electricity storage system in which a plurality of chargeable and dischargeable electricity storage elements are connected in series as an electricity storage element row and a plurality of the electricity storage<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> element rows are connected in parallel, the parallel-connected electricity storage system including: an electricity storage-element-voltage measuring device that measures an electricity storage element voltage of each of the electricity storage elements;
