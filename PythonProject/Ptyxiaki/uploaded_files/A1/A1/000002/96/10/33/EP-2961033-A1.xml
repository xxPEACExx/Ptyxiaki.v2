For example, PTL 1 discloses an electric vehicle having a power-receiving device arranged above a floor surface of the vehicle and a rectifier and a power storage device arranged in a space apart from the power-receiving device, and discloses a system for supplying power from a power-supplying device in a power supplying position to the power-receiving device in the electric vehicle when the electric vehicle is moved to the power supplying position.

Arrangement positions for devices are not a significant concern in a relatively large device such as the electric vehicle of PTL 1, as they are easily ensured. In cases of portable devices required to be downsized such as the portable computers of PTL 2 on the other hand, there are only limited positions available to avoid influences from the generated heat and magnetism at the time of power supply. Therefore, how each device is arranged is extremely crucial matter for further downsizing.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In view of the above, an object of the present invention is to a portable device and a charging device therefor, and a portable device charging system, which enables further downsizing of the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> portable device.</p><heading id="h0007">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">An aspect of the present invention is a portable device, comprising: an outer wall member exposed to outside; a power-receiving module at least partially arranged along a surface shape of the outer wall member, which receives power supplied by means of a resonance phenomenon; and an electronic device disposed in a magnetic field space formed by the resonance phenomenon so as to have a magnetic field strength weaker than that in other portions.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the above structure, the portable device has the power-receiving module receiving power supplied by means of a resonance phenomenon.

The formation of<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> the space portion at the desired position is realized by setting power supply conditions such as a positional relation with the charging device 2, a power-supplying state, and an internal structure.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">For example, the portable device 1 may be arranged such that, when power is supplied by the resonance phenomenon from the power-supplying resonance coil 211 of the power-supplying module 21 of the charging device 2 to the power-receiving resonance coil 111 of the power-receiving module 11, a magnetic field space having a magnetic field strength lower than the magnetic field strengths in parts other than the desired position is formed as the space portion, at a desired position between the power-supplying resonance coil 211 of the power-supplying module 21 and the power-receiving resonance coil 111 of the power-receiving module 11. In this case, the space portion is created in a position nearby the power-receiving module 11, closer to the charging device 2. Therefore, the leading end portion side of the outer wall member 12 is ensured as the position for arranging the electronic device 13, by slightly shifting towards back side the position for arranging the power-receiving module 11 from the leading end portion of the outer wall member 12 on the side of the charging device 2.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">A method of forming the space portion will be detailed. When power<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> is supplied from the power-supplying resonance coil 211 of the power-supplying module 21 of the charging device 2 to the power-receiving resonance coil 111 of the power-receiving module 11 of the portable device 1 by the resonance phenomenon, for example, the frequency of the power supplied to the power-supplying resonance coil 211 of the power-supplying module 21 is set in such a way that the direction of the current flowing in the power-supplying resonance coil 211 of the power-supplying module 21 is opposite to the direction of the current flowing in the power-receiving resonance coil 111 of the power-receiving module 11.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In the formation method above, when power transmission using the resonance phenomenon is performed, the coupling coefficient indicating the strength of the coupling between the power-supplying resonance coil 211 and the power-receiving resonance coil 111 is increased as the power-supplying resonance coil 211 of the power-supplying module 21 and the power-receiving resonance coil 111 of the power-receiving module 11 are disposed to be close to each other. When a transmission characteristic "S21" (which is an index of the power transmission efficiency in the power transmission from the power-supplying resonance coil 211 to the power-receiving resonance coil 111) is measured while the coupling coefficient is high as above, the analyzed waveform of the transmission characteristic "S21" has separate peaks; one<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> on a low frequency side and another on a high frequency side. As the frequency of the power supplied to the power-supplying resonance coil 211 is set at a frequency around the peak on the high frequency side, the direction of the current flowing in the power-supplying resonance coil 211 is arranged to be opposite to the direction of the current flowing in the power-receiving resonance coil 111, and hence the magnetic field generated on the inner circumference side of the power-supplying resonance coil 211 and the magnetic field generated on the inner circumference side of the power-receiving resonance coil 111 cancel each other out, with the result that an influence of the magnetic field is reduced on the inner circumference sides of the power-supplying resonance coil 211 and the power-receiving resonance coil 111. With this, the magnetic field space having a magnetic field strength lower than the magnetic field strengths in parts other than the inner circumference sides of the power-supplying resonance coil 211 and the power-receiving resonance coil 111 is formed as the space portion.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In another method of forming the space portion, for example, when power is supplied from the power-supplying resonance coil 211 to the power-receiving resonance coil 111 by the resonance phenomenon, the frequency of the power supplied to the power-supplying resonance coil 211 is set so that the direction of the current flowing in the power-supplying resonance coil 211<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> is identical with the direction of the current flowing in the power-receiving resonance coil 111.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">According to the method above, when power transmission using the resonance phenomenon is performed, the coupling coefficient indicating the strength of the coupling between the power-supplying resonance coil 211 and the power-receiving resonance coil 111 is increased as the power-supplying resonance coil 211 and the power-receiving resonance coil 111 are disposed to be close to each other. When the coupling coefficient is high in this manner, the measurement of the transmission characteristic shows that a measured waveform has two separated peaks on the low frequency side and the high frequency side, respectively. As the frequency of the power supplied to the power-supplying resonance coil 211 is set at a frequency around the peak on the low frequency side, the direction of the current flowing in the power-supplying resonance coil 211 is arranged to be identical with the direction of the current flowing in the power-receiving resonance coil 111, and hence the magnetic field generated on the outer circumference side of the power-supplying resonance coil 211 and the magnetic field generated on the outer circumference side of the power-receiving resonance coil 111 cancel each other out, with the result that an influence of the magnetic field is reduced on the outer circumference sides of the power-supplying resonance coil 211 and the power-receiving<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> resonance coil 111.

For example, the size of the magnetic field space is increased by relatively weakening the magnetic coupling between the power-supplying resonance coil 211 and the power-receiving resonance coil 111. In the meanwhile, the size of the magnetic field space is decreased by relatively strengthening the magnetic coupling between the power-supplying resonance coil 211 and the power-receiving resonance coil 111.

In this case, as the power-supplying resonance coil 211 and the power-receiving resonance coil 111 are arranged to have desired shapes, a magnetic field space having a relatively low magnetic field strength is formed with a desired shape corresponding to the shapes of the coils.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In addition to the above, the size of the space portion may be set in such a way that at least one of the 1st distance between the power-supplying resonance coil 211 and the power-supplying coil 212 and the 2nd distance between the power-drawing coil 112 and the power-receiving resonance coil 111 is used as an adjustment parameter, and the size is set based on this adjustment parameter.
