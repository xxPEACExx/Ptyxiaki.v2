The connector is mateable with a mating connector along an upper-lower direction, wherein the mating connector is attached to another case. The connector is a so-called floating connector. In detail, the connector comprises an outer housing, spring members, an inner housing, a terminal and two sealing members, namely, an upper sealing member and a lower sealing member. The outer housing is fixed to the case. The spring member is attached to the outer housing. The inner housing is supported by the spring members and is movable relative to the outer housing. The terminal is partially accommodated within the inner housing. The lower sealing member prevents water from invading between the outer housing and the case. The upper sealing member prevents water from invading between the outer housing and the mating connector under a state where the connector is mated with the mating connector.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The lower sealing member of Patent Document 1 is pressed downward by the mating connector to seal a gap between the outer housing and the mating connector. Accordingly, when a pressing force of the mating connector is insufficient, the gap between the outer housing and the mating connector is not completely prevented from water. Moreover, since the inner housing of Patent Document 1 needs to be movable relative to the outer housing, the inner housing cannot be fixed to the outer housing by using the existing sealing member shown in <figref idrefs="f0019">Fig. 37</figref>. Accordingly, between the outer housing and the inner housing, there might be another gap which cannot be<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> prevented from water. If water invades through the gap between the outer housing and the mating connector, the water might reach the terminal within the inner housing.</p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a waterproof connector which is a floating connector comprising a first housing and a second housing movable relative to the first connector, and which can prevent water from invading between the first housing and the second housing.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">One aspect of the present invention provides a waterproof connector mateable with a mating connector along a mating direction. The waterproof connector comprises a first housing, a second housing and a primary sealing member. The second housing is movable relative to the first housing in a plane perpendicular to the mating direction. The primary sealing member has a first fixed portion, a second fixed portion and a middle portion. The first fixed portion is fixed to the first housing, and the second fixed portion is fixed to the second housing. The first fixed portion is connected to the second fixed portion via the middle portion with no break in a cross-section in parallel to the mating direction. The middle portion is looped with no break in a plane perpendicular to the mating direction.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the present invention, the first fixed portion is connected to the second fixed portion with no break via the middle portion having no break, wherein the first fixed portion and the second fixed portion are fixed to the first housing and the second housing, respectively. This structure prevents water from invading between the first housing and the second housing. Moreover, a movement of the second housing relative to the first housing is not affected, for example, when the sealing member is wholly made of elastomer.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">An appreciation of the objectives of the present invention and a more complete understanding of its structure may be had by studying the following<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> description of the preferred embodiment and by

Under the attached state where the waterproof connector 10 is fixed to the case 60, the lower surface 226 is brought into contact with or close to the upper surface 62 of the case 60 and, therefore, the outer part of the secondary sealing member 290 is pressed against the upper surface 62 by the pressing portion 228. Accordingly, the secondary sealing member 290 is resiliently<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> deformed to seal a gap between the pressing portion 228 and the upper surface 62.
