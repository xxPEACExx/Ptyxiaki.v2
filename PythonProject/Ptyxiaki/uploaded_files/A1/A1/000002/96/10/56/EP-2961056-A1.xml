In the past, an inductive coupling system using coils has been widely used as a system of a non-contact power feed device. However, an electrostatic-coupling system in which a capacitor is formed by electrodes facing each other so as to be spaced apart from each other also has been used in recent years. In addition, a magnetic field resonance system and the like also have been examined. In the non-contact power feed device, power is generally supplied by an AC voltage having a high frequency higher than a general commercial frequency. Particularly,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> since the impedance of the capacitor is inversely proportional to the frequency in the electrostatic-coupling system, it is preferable to reduce the impedance by increasing the frequency that is used to supply power in a non-contact manner.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Meanwhile, an AC power supply device which generates a high-frequency AC voltage usually includes a DC power supply unit and an inverter unit that includes bridge-connected switching element. The switching loss of a switching element increases substantially in proportion to the frequency, and loss to the outside through leakage also increases as the frequency increases. Accordingly, it is preferable to reduce loss by reducing the frequency that is used to supply power in a non-contact manner. In consideration of these two contrary frequency conditions, a high frequency AC voltage from 100 kHz to an order of MHz is used in electrostatic-coupling non-contact power feed devices. Further, an AC power supply device is provided with radiation fins and the like as necessary in order to reduce the temperature rise that is caused by switching loss. One technical example of this kind of high-frequency AC power supply device is disclosed in PTL 1.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The high-frequency power supply device disclosed in PTL 1 is a power supply device that uses a high-frequency inverter performing the on/off control of a DC voltage by a switching<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> element, and includes an intermediate electric potential generating circuit that divides a DC voltage, and the same number of inductors as the number of output terminals. The inductors are connected between the output terminals and an intermediate electric potential. PTL 1 discloses as follows. In this device, a bias current always flows in a coil, an output current can be delayed relative to an output voltage in phase, and a soft switching function can always be maintained. Accordingly, it is possible to greatly contribute to the reduction of the size and loss of the device.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">PTL 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004064907A"><text>JP-A-2004-64907</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">PTL 1 discloses that a switching loss can be made zero by soft switching when the output current is delayed relative to an output voltage in phase. However, a switching loss is not made zero in an actual circuit. Since a switching operation time of a certain degree is required in an actual switching operation, a switching loss depending on the internal<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> resistance of the switching element, a voltage to be applied, and a current to flow during the switching operation time is generated. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the technique of PTL 1 is necessarily an effective means for reducing the size and loss of the device.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The invention has been made in consideration of problems of the background art, and an object of the invention is to provide an AC power supply device that reduces a switching loss, which is generated when a switching operation is performed, by a simple circuit configuration and achieves a reduction of the size and weight of the device by the simplification of radiation fins and the like.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, according to claim 1, there is provided an AC power supply device including: a DC power supply unit that outputs a DC voltage; an inverter unit that includes at least four bridge-connected switching elements, a pair of input terminals connected to the DC power supply unit, and an output terminal group connected to an external load, and that converts the DC voltage, which is input to the pair of input terminals from the DC power supply unit, into a single-phase or three-phase<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> AC voltage, and outputs the single-phase or three-phase AC voltage to the external load from the output terminal group; a switching control unit that controls the opening/closing of the switching elements; and an efficiency improvement coil that is connected between terminals of the output terminal group and is connected in parallel to the external load.</p><heading id="h0008">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the invention of the AC power supply device according to claim 1, the efficiency improvement coil is connected in parallel to the external load, a coil current delayed in phase overlaps a load current and forms a total current, and the switching elements of the inverter unit open/close the total current. Here, since the coil current has a negative value during a conduction operation in which the switching elements are changed to a conduction state from a cutoff state, the total current decreases. Accordingly, a switching loss per conduction operation significantly decreases. Meanwhile, the total current may increase during a cutoff operation in which the switching elements are changed to a cutoff state from a conduction state. However, since a cutoff operation time is generally shorter than a conduction operation time, a switching loss per cutoff operation does not significantly increase. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce a switching loss per unit<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> time, which is generated when the conduction operation and the cutoff operation are repeated, by a simple circuit configuration to which the efficiency improvement coil not provided in the circuit in the related art is merely added. Further, since the amount of heat generated from the switching elements decreases, radiation fins and the like can be simplified. As a result, it is possible to reduce the size and weight of the device.</p><heading id="h0009">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1] Fig. 1</figref> is a diagram showing the configuration of an AC power supply device according to a first embodiment of the invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2] Fig. 2</figref> is a circuit diagram schematically showing the circuit configuration corresponding to one switching element of a switching control unit.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3] Fig. 3</figref> shows temporal waveforms illustrating the outline of an operation of the AC power supply device according to the first embodiment.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4] Fig. 4</figref> shows temporal waveforms schematically illustrating a conduction operation of a switching element of the AC power supply device according to the first embodiment.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5] Fig. 5</figref> shows temporal waveforms schematically illustrating a conduction operation of a switching element of<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> a circuit in the related art.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6] Fig. 6</figref> shows temporal waveforms schematically illustrating a cutoff operation of the switching element of the AC power supply device according to the first embodiment.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7] Fig. 7</figref> shows temporal waveforms schematically illustrating a cutoff operation of a switching element of a circuit in the related art.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 8] Fig. 8</figref> is a diagram showing the configuration of an AC power supply device according to a second embodiment and a non-contact power feed device as an external load.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010">Description of Embodiments</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">A first embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">Figs. 1 to 7</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a diagram showing the configuration of an AC power supply device 1 according to the first embodiment of the invention. The AC power supply device 1 is a device that outputs a single-phase AC voltage to an external load 9. The AC power supply device 1 includes a DC power supply unit 2, an inverter unit 4, a switching control unit 5, an efficiency improvement coil 6, and the like. Conventional techniques can be appropriately applied to components other than the efficiency improvement coil 6, that is, components 2 to 5.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> The DC power supply unit 2 outputs a DC voltage of a power supply voltage Vs from a positive terminal 21 and a negative terminal 22. The positive terminal 21 is connected to an input terminal 41 of the inverter unit 4. The negative terminal 22 is grounded to an earth E that is common to the device 1. For example, a rectifier circuit that rectifies a commercial-frequency AC voltage and outputs a DC voltage, a battery, or the like can be used as the DC power supply unit 2.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The inverter unit 4 includes an input terminal 41 connected to the positive terminal 21 of the DC power supply unit 2 and a ground terminal 42 electrically connected to the earth E, as a pair of input terminals. The inverter unit 4 includes first and second output terminals 43 and 44 as a pair of output terminals. The external load 9 is connected between the first and second output terminals 43 and 44. The inverter unit 4 is formed by the bridge connection of four switching elements 31 to 34. Three-terminal field effect transistors (FET) are used as the switching elements 31 to 34 in this embodiment, and other types of semiconductor elements may be used.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Bridge connection will be described in detail. The first switching element 31 and the third switching element 33 are<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> connected in series between the input terminal 41 and the ground terminal 42 of the inverter unit 4. A drain terminal D of the first switching element 31 is connected to the input terminal 41. A source terminal S of the first switching element 31 is connected to a drain terminal D of the third switching element 33 and the first output terminal 43. A source terminal S of the third switching element 33 is connected to the ground terminal 42. Meanwhile, in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, reference characters of the terminals of the first switching element 31 are shown and reference characters of terminals of the second to fourth switching elements 32 to 34 are not shown.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Likewise, the second switching element 32 and the fourth switching element 34 are connected in series between the input terminal V41 and the ground terminal 42 of the inverter unit 4. A drain terminal D of the second switching element 32 is connected to the input terminal V41. A source terminal S of the second switching element 32 is connected to a drain terminal D of the fourth switching element 34 and the second output terminal 44. A source terminal S of the fourth switching element 34 is connected to the ground terminal 42.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Each of the switching elements 31 to 34 is provided with a diode diod that allows a current to flow to the drain terminal D from the source terminal S and prevents a current from flowing<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> to the source terminal S from the drain terminal D. A gate terminal G of each of the switching elements 31 to 34 is connected to the switching control unit 5. The opening/closing of each of the switching elements 31 to 34 is controlled by a gate control signal input to the gate terminal G, that is, a gate voltage VG (a voltage relative to the source terminal S of the gate terminal G). When the gate voltage VG reaches a predetermined high level or more, each of the switching elements 31 to 34 is in a conduction state in which the internal resistance between the drain terminal D and the source terminal S is substantially zero. Further, when the gate voltage VG reaches a predetermined low level or less, each of the switching elements 31 to 34 is in a cutoff state in which the internal resistance is substantially infinite. Furthermore, when the gate voltage VG transiently reaches an intermediate level between the high level and the low level, the internal resistance of each of the switching elements 31 to 34 is changed to a finite value.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The above-mentioned predetermined high level corresponds to a first level of the invention and the predetermined low level corresponds to a second level of the invention. The levels are not limited thereto, and the first level may be lower than the second level. That is, a semiconductor element which is in a cutoff state when the gate<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> control signal is high and is in a conduction state when the gate control signal is low may be used.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the inverter unit 4, at a certain time, the first and fourth switching elements 31 and 34 are controlled into a conduction state in synchronization with each other and the second and third switching elements 32 and 33 are controlled into a cutoff state at the same time. Further, at a subsequent time, the first and fourth switching elements 31 and 34 are controlled into a cutoff state in synchronization with each other and the second and third switching elements 32 and 33 are controlled into a conduction state at the same time.
