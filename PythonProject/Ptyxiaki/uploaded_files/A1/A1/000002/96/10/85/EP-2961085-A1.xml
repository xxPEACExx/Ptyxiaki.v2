Further, the invention relates to an optical monitoring device for monitoring an optical point-to-point transmission link and to an optical monitoring device for monitoring a plurality of optical point-to-point transmission links comprising the features of the pre-characterizing portion of claims 6 and 8, respectively.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In optical fiber networks there is the demand for low-cost monitoring of the physical fiber links of a transmission link as well as the monitoring of the presence of an optical signal supplied to the fiber link at its far end. Monitoring is to be effected at a near end of the transmission link or the physical fiber link, respectively.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Monitoring the physical fiber link including monitoring of reflections and attenuation as a function of the fiber length can be done by using an optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR). This method is widely used in optical fiber networks and also in passive optical networks (PONs). However, for multiple dedicated access lines, an optical switch is required to selectively monitor a predetermined one of the access lines, as providing a dedicated OTDR for each access line is inacceptable with respect to costs. Additional monitoring of the presence of the far-end signal would require further equipment.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Integrating an OTDR functionality in the transceivers used for the transmission links, which is generally possible, requires access to the transceivers, which might not be possible, e.g. for providers of the physical fiber-optic network.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It is further known to use fiber-optic taps having an asymmetrical splitting ratio in order to tap off a small portion, e.g. 1 to 3 %, for monitoring the far-end signal presence as well as signal parameters of the far-end signal. However, the fiber-optic tap introduces<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> an undesired attenuation into the fiber-optic link even at times at which no signal monitoring is required.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide an optical coupler device, especially for monitoring purposes in an optical point-to-point (PtP) transmission link, which can be used to realize a monitoring device which makes it possible to controllably monitor the presence or parameters of a far-end optical signal and the fiber-optic link with respect to at least one predetermined fiber parameter by using a monitoring signal having a wavelength different from the far-end optical signal or the fiber-optic link, only. These two monitoring tasks can be effected simultaneously. Of course, a selected one of these two tasks may be carried out at a time, only.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is a further object of the invention to provide monitoring devices for monitoring a single and a plurality of optical point-to-point transmission links comprising a single and a plurality of such optical coupler devices, respectively.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">These objects are achieved by the subject-matter of the independent claims. Preferred embodiments are defined in the sub-claims.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">An optical coupler device according to the present invention is a controllable optical three-port device having two states which in the following are designated as the first and second work modes. It comprises a first, a second and a third optical port and is configured to transmit a first optical signal received at the first optical port to the second optical port and to transmit a second optical signal received at the second optical port to the first and third optical port according to a monitoring split ratio with respect to the optical power of the second optical signal, the first and second optical signal having a wavelength lying in a first optical band. The optical coupler device is further configured to transmit a third and a fourth optical signal received at the third and the second optical port to the respective other optical port, the third and fourth optical signal having a wavelength lying in a second optical band. According to the invention, the optical coupler device is controllable with respect to the monitoring split ratio and it comprises a control means adapted to receive a control signal and configured to control the optical coupler device with respect to the monitoring split ratio in such a way that in a first work<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> mode the second optical signal is transmitted to the first optical port, only, and in a second work mode a major portion of the optical power of the second signal is transmitted to the first optical port and a minor portion of the optical power of the second signal is transmitted to the third optical port.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Of course, the first and second optical signals as well as the third and fourth optical signals having wavelengths comprised by the first and second optical band, respectively, may be identical or different.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In general, it has been common knowledge that the split ratio of an optical coupler or splitter is dependent on other parameters, e.g. the temperature. However, resulting from this knowledge, as the only reaction efforts have been made to avoid negative effects produced by these dependencies, e.g. by stabilizing the temperature of the optical coupler. The invention, however, intentionally uses the dependency of the split ratio of a wavelength-dependent optical coupler device in order to provide a device which can be controlled to work in two work modes.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to an embodiment of the invention, the optical coupler device comprises a wavelength-dependent 1x2 coupler. The optical coupler may be realized in polymer technology or as fused-silica coupler, but, of course, an expert in the field of designing wavelength-dependent optical couplers may decide to realize a coupler according to the invention in any other known and suitable technology.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In a preferred embodiment, the wavelength-dependent 1x2 coupler may be realized as a temperature-sensitive coupler and the control means may be realized as a heating and/or cooling device, which is thermally coupled with the temperature-sensitive coupler and adapted to switch the optical coupler device between the two work modes depending on the control signal received.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to an embodiment of the invention, the optical coupler device may be realized by using simpler components, e.g. comprising a wavelength-independent preferably asymmetrical optical power splitter having a common port and a first and a second splitting port, the optical power splitter being controllable with respect to the splitting<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> ratio, and a first and a second optical diplexer each having a WDM port and a first and a second band port, each optical diplexer being configured to receive an optical signal in the first and second optical band at the first and second band port, respectively, and to output the optical signals at the WDM port, and to output optical signals in the first and second optical band which are received at the WDM port at the first and second band port, respectively, wherein the first splitting port of the optical power splitter is connected to or defines the first optical port of the optical coupler device, wherein the second splitting port is connected to the first band port of the first optical diplexer, wherein the common port of the optical power splitter is connected to the first band port of the second optical diplexer, wherein the second band port of the second optical diplexer is connected to the second band port of the first optical diplexer, wherein the WDM port of the second optical diplexer is connected to or defines the second optical port of the optical coupler device and wherein the WDM port of the first optical diplexer is connected to or defines the third optical port of the optical coupler device.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In this embodiment, the optical coupler device according to the invention comprises a simple wavelength-independent optical power splitter instead of a wavelength-dependent power splitter. Such a wavelength-independent optical power splitter (i.e. wavelength-independent within a given wavelength range, which is not too broad) is much easier to design and manufacture than a more complex wavelength-dependent coupler having the property that a variation of a control parameter, e.g. the temperature, merely influences the split ratio in a first band, whereas in a second band, which comprises the wavelength of the monitoring signal, essentially the total optical power of a respective optical signal is transmitted to the respective port irrespective of the work mode defined by the control means.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As mentioned above, the controllable optical power splitter may be realized as a temperature-sensitive power splitter and the control means may be realized as a heating and/or cooling device, which is thermally coupled with the temperature-sensitive power splitter and configured to switch the optical coupler device between the two work modes depending on the control signal received.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">An optical monitoring device according to the invention for monitoring an optical point-to-point<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> transmission link comprises an optical coupler device according the invention as described above, the first and second port of the optical coupler device being connected to or defining a first and a second port of the monitoring device; an optical transmitter adapted to create an optical monitoring signal at a wavelength lying in the second optical band of the optical coupler device; an optical receiver capable of receiving signals lying in the first and second optical bands; and a passive optical splitter/combiner having a common port and a first and a second splitting port, the common port being connected to the third port of the optical coupler device, the first splitting port being connected to an optical output port of the optical transmitter and the second splitting port being connected to an optical input port of the optical receiver, the passive optical splitter/combiner being configured to transmit to the common port at least a portion of the optical power of the optical monitoring signal created by the optical transmitter and supplied to the first splitting port and to transmit to the second splitting port at least a portion of the optical power of an optical signal supplied to the common port. The passive splitter/combiner may be e.g. realized as 3dB coupler or as optical circulator.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The first and second ports of the optical monitoring device are adapted to be connected to a first end, e.g. a near end, and to a second end, e.g. a far end of an optical point-to-point transmission link to be monitored.
