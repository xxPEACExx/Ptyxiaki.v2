At first mobile phones were used extensively for making voice calls. As technology has developed and made high bandwidth data communication possible, the use of mobile devices for data transfer has increased to such extent that mobile data transfer may be even more common than voice calls. The use of modern data services, including email and social media, often require almost continuous connection to networks. The users of user terminals may have enabled the user terminals to connect to network on their own without active user intervention.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Furthermore, the mobile communication devices communicate with communications networks using radio frequency transmissions. The effect of electromagnetic radio frequency radiation on users has been studied in recent years but no conclusive results on the harmful effects have yet been discovered. All radio communication devices must fulfil government issued safety criteria regarding radiation properties.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Many users of mobile communication devices are young people. Parents may want to monitor the use of user terminals of their children. Parent may want to protect the children from excessive use of electronic devices such as mobile communication devices which may be used as gaming devices in addition to communication devices.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention.

Although the specification may refer to "an", "one", or "some" embodiment(s) in several locations, this does not necessarily mean that each such reference is to the same embodiment(s), or that the feature only applies to a single embodiment. Single features of different embodiments may also be combined to provide other embodiments. Furthermore, words "comprising" and "including" should be understood as not limiting the described embodiments to consist of only those features that have been mentioned and such embodiments may also contain also features, structures, units, modules etc. that have not been specifically mentioned.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The protocols used, the specifications of communication systems, servers and user terminals, especially in wireless communication, develop rapidly. Such development may require extra changes to an embodiment. Therefore, all words and expressions should be interpreted broadly and they are intended to illustrate, not to restrict, embodiments.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Many different radio protocols to be used in communications systems exist. Some examples of different communication systems are the universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) radio access network (UTRAN or E-UTRAN), long term evolution (LTE®, known also as E-UTRA), long term evolution advanced (LTE-A®), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN, WiFi) based on IEEE 802.11 stardard, worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Bluetooth®, personal communications services (PCS) and systems using ultra-wideband (UWB) technology. IEEE refers to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. LTE and LTE-A are developed by the Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Embodiments of the invention are applicable to apparatuses in communication system or any combination of different communication systems that support required functionalities.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> illustrates an example of an access architecture based on a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> long term evolution advanced (LTE Advanced, LTE-A) system. The LTE-A system is one example of a system where embodiments of the invention may be applied.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> illustrates a simplified view of a communication environment only showing some elements and functional entities, all being logical units whose implementation may differ from what is shown. The connections shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> are logical connections; the actual physical connections may be different. It is apparent to a person skilled in the art that the systems also comprise other functions and structures. It should be appreciated that the functions, structures, elements and the protocols used in or for communication are irrelevant to the actual invention. Therefore, they need not to be discussed in more detail here.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows an eNodeB 100 connected to an Evolved Packet Core EPC 102 of a communication system. The eNodeB's form a part of the radio access network (RAN) of the communication system.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The eNodeB 100, that may also be called a base station of the radio system may host the functions for Radio Resource Management: Radio Bearer Control, Radio Admission Control, Connection Mobility Control, Dynamic Resource Allocation (scheduling). Depending on the system, the counterpart on the EPC side can be a serving gateway (S-GW, routing and forwarding user data packets), packet data network gateway (P-GW, for providing connectivity of user devices (UEs) to external packet data networks), and/or mobile management entity (MME), etc. The MME (not shown) is responsible for the overall user terminal control in mobility, session/call and state management with assistance of the eNodeBs through which the user terminals may connect to the network.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The communication system is also able to communicate with other networks, such as a public switched telephone network or the Internet 104. It should be appreciated that eNodeBs or their functionalities may be implemented by using any node, host, server or access point etc. entity suitable for such a usage.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The user terminal UT 106 (also called user device, user equipment, terminal device, etc.) illustrates one type of an apparatus which communicates 108 with the communication network. The communication may comprise both voice calls and data traffic, such as a data connection to a network server 112, for example.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The user terminal typically refers to a portable computing device that includes wireless mobile communication devices operating with or without a subscriber identification module (SIM), including, but not limited to, the following types of devices: a mobile station (mobile phone), smartphone and personal digital assistant (PDA), for example.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The user terminal is configured to perform one or more of user equipment functionalities. The device may also be called a subscriber unit, mobile station, remote terminal, access terminal, user equipment (UE) just to mention but a few names or apparatuses.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Further, although the apparatuses have been depicted as single entities, different units, processors and/or memory units (not all shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>) may be implemented</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The user terminal 106 may be in radio connection with one or more external transceivers. One type of the external transceiver is the eNodeB 100. In addition to the eNodeB 100, the user terminal 106 may be in connection with one or more wireless network base stations or nodes 110. The base stations 110 may be WLAN or WiFi base stations or routers, for example. In addition, the user terminal may have a Bluetooth connection with another device.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The radio connections between user terminals and base stations or eNodeBs utilise various frequency bands which are standardised and controlled by international treaties and local authorities. For example, GSM systems typically utilise 450, 900 and 1800 MHz frequency bands, UMTS systems typically utilise 800, 1900 and 2100 MHz frequency bands and WLAN or WiFi typically utilise various frequency bands between 2,4 GHz and 5,9 GHz. The mentioned frequency bands are merely illustrative examples as also other frequency bands may be used by the systems in different countries.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Effects of the electromagnetic radiation on users caused by mobile communication devices have been studied since wireless communications systems have been taken into use. The transmitted power levels of the communication devices vary according to propagation effects and the distances between the transceivers. A user terminal situated at a border of the service area of a base station may transmit using considerably greater transmit power compared to a user terminal situated close to the base station. To ensure that health hazards are avoided governments have issued certain limits to the allowed transmit powers of both user terminals and base stations. User terminals are manufactured and communication systems are designed taking<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> these limitations into account.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Modern user terminals have efficient processors which may be multi-core processors. In addition, they may comprise a separate graphic processor, a relatively large display, a large random-access memory and memories for storing applications and data. Thus, in practice modern user terminals are nothing but efficient portable computers. The user terminals may be capable of running applications of many types, such as recreational graphic intensive games and other applications which may utilise communication resources of the user terminal.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Controlling the use of a group of user terminals has become an interesting topic. For example, there may be a need for parents to control the use of the user terminals of children, for example. In addition, companies may want to limit the use of some particular apps in the user terminals of the employees.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In an embodiment a solution is provided where a given apparatus, such as a user terminal, may be configured to monitor the use a set of other apparatuses, such as other user terminals. <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref> illustrates an embodiment. A so called main user 200 may be configured to monitor and control 208 a set of group users 202, 204, 206. The main user and the group users may be mobile user terminals, for example. The main user 200 may set 210 given limits to different operations executable by the group users and receive 212 information from the group users. In an embodiment, the information is related to the usage of a group user, the information comprising data on the use of given applications or data connections in the group user.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 3</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example of an embodiment. The example describes the operation of the apparatus or main user 200 which may be a user terminal.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In step 300, the apparatus is configured to store information on a group of user terminals. The information may be stored in the memory of the apparatus. In an embodiment, the information may be stored in an external memory or server to which the apparatus has access.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In step 302, the apparatus is configured to transmit control information to one or more user terminals of the group. The control information may limit the use of given applications or the use of data connections of the one or more user terminals of the group.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In step 304, the apparatus is configured to receive from one or more<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> user terminals of the group information on the usage of the user terminal. The information may comprise data on the use of given applications or data connections in the one or more user terminals. The apparatus may be configured to request the information from the user terminals of the group or the user terminals may send the information by themselves for example periodically.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The process ends in step 306.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In an embodiment, the steps 302, 304 above may be performed in alternative order and/or repeatedly.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In an embodiment, the user terminals of the group may be configured to determine the amount of electromagnetic radiation the user of the user terminal is exposed to. The amount may be determined on the basis of given measurements which be detailed below. The apparatus 200 may receive from a user terminal of the group information on the amount of electromagnetic radiation the user of the user terminal is exposed to. The apparatus 200 may control a user interface to display the information received from the user terminal of the group.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The apparatus 200 may be configured to transmit control information to a user terminal of the group, the control information setting a limit on the amount of electromagnetic radiation the user of the user terminal is exposed to. The user of the apparatus may select suitable limits for each user terminal of the group.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Likewise, user of the apparatus may receive information on the use of given applications run in the user terminal of the group and select suitable limitations for each user terminal. The apparatus 200 may be configured to transmit control information to a user terminal of the group, the control information limiting or allowing the use of given applications or data connections at predetermined time intervals. For example, a user terminal of the group may be controlled to limit the use of data connections and given applications during certain time instants. Thus, the user terminal may be controlled to limit the use of data connections during school hours or dinner time, for example. Also the use of given applications, such as applications which utilise data connections (social media applications, for example) may be limited during certain time instants.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example of an embodiment. The example describes the operation of the apparatus or main user 200 which<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> may be a user terminal.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In step 400, the apparatus is configured to transmit a request to a user terminal to join a group.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In step 402, the apparatus is configured to receive from the user terminal an acknowledgement regarding the request.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In step 404, the apparatus is configured to add the user terminal to a group of user terminals. The information regarding group of user terminals may be stored in the memory of the apparatus. In an embodiment, the information may be stored in an external memory or server to which the apparatus has access.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The process ends in step 406.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 5</figref> illustrates an embodiment. A main user or main user terminal 200 may be configured to monitor and control 208 a set of group users 202, 204, 206. In the example of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 5</figref>, the communication between the main user 200 and the user terminals 202, 204, 206 belonging to a group of user terminals is realized using a server 112. The communication may be realized with messages transmitted between the user terminals and the server. The user terminals 200, 202, 204, 206 may be running software which is configured to communicate with the server 112 which is running suitable software.

The user terminals of the group may be configured to determine the amount of electromagnetic radiation the user of the user terminal is exposed to and transmit information on this amount to the main user. The control information transmitted by the main user may transmit control information which comprises limitations to the use of the user terminal and thus limiting the amount of electromagnetic radiation the user of the user terminal is exposed to. The limitations may reduce the data traffic of the user terminal by allowing data traffic only for given time instants, for example.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In an embodiment, the main user sets a limit to the amount of electromagnetic radiation the user of the user terminal is exposed to and transmit the limit to the user terminal. The user terminal is configured to determine cumulative amount of radiation and when the limit set by the main user is reached, the usage of the user terminal is controlled. The user terminal may be configured to limit the usage of some applications, such as games,<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> social media and set time limits to the use of data traffic.

The example illustrates how the user terminal belonging to a group may determine the amount of radiation the user of the user terminal is exposed to. In an embodiment, the apparatus of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref> may be the user terminal or a part of a user terminal running suitable software configured to control the execution of following steps. The example starts at step 700.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In step 702, the apparatus is configured to determine the model of the user terminal, transmit a query to a network server regarding the properties of the user terminal and receive from the server information on the properties of the user terminal. The information may comprise the specific absorption rate (SAR) value of the user terminal. The network server may be the same server handling the communication between user terminals of a group or it may be another network server.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The SAR value is used as measure of the rate at which energy is absorbed by a human body when exposed to a electromagnetic field caused by radio communication. Each user terminal type is tested and a SAR value for each type of user terminal is published. In an embodiment, a network server is configured to store SAR values of different types of user terminals. A user terminal may transmit a query to the server, the query comprising the type of the user terminal and receive as a response the SAR value of the user terminal type.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">This step may be performed once or at given time intervals. The step is optional as the user of the apparatus might as well type the SAR value manually.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">In step 704, the apparatus is configured to receive information on the power level of signals at least one radio transceiver of a user terminal has received from one or more external transmitters. In an embodiment, the controller of the apparatus may query from the radio modem or radio modems of the transceiver of the user terminal the strength of the signal or signals received from base stations or eNodeB's the user terminal is connected to.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In step 706, the apparatus is configured to determine information on the call connection and data transfer status of the user terminal. The apparatus may determine whether there is a voice call and/or data transfer presently on-going.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">In step 708, the apparatus is configured to determine information on the power level of the signals transmitted by at least one radio transceiver of the user terminal. In an embodiment, the controller of the apparatus is configured to determine the information based on measurements made from the outputs of the radio modem or modems of the transceiver of the user terminal. In an embodiment, the controller of the apparatus is configured to estimate the information based on the power level of the signals received by the user terminal and information on the system the user terminal is communicating with and the user terminal propertied. The call connection and data transfer status may be taken into account.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In step 710, the apparatus is configured to receive information from one or more sensors of the user terminal. Examples of the one or more sensors of the user terminal comprise proximity, acceleration, location and temperature sensors. The use of sensors is explained further below.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In step 712, the apparatus is configured to determine an estimate for the amount of electromagnetic radiation on the basis on the received and determined information and the properties of the user terminal. The SAR value of the user terminal may be utilised in the determination. In an embodiment, the determined amount electromagnetic radiation may comprise information on the radiation originating from the external transmitter and the radio transceiver of the user terminal. Thus, powers of both the received and transmitted signal may be taken into account.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">In step 714, the apparatus is configured to determine an estimate for the user radiation exposure. In an embodiment, the information received from the sensors may be utilised in determining the estimate for the user radiation exposure on the basis of estimate for the amount of electromagnetic radiation. The sensors may be used to determine where the user terminal is located in relation to the user of the terminal. If the sensors indicate that the terminal is located away from the user it may be determined that the amount of radiation the user is exposed to is small compared to the amount of electromagnetic radiation. This is due to the attenuation due to distance. This may be the case when there is an on-going data transfer but the proximity and<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> acceleration sensors indicate that the terminal is stable, for example on a table. The sensors may also indicate that the user terminal is in a pocket, for example. If the user terminal is held by the ear of the user, as may be the case when there is an on-going call and no hands-free equipment is in use, the amount of radiation is greater as the distance between the user terminal antenna and user is shorter.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">The location sensor may comprise a satellite location receiver such as GPS (Global Positioning System) or Glonass, for example. The location of the user terminal may be determined and stored in connection with the amount of electromagnetic radiation experienced by the user.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">In step 716, the apparatus is configured to store the determined amount of electromagnetic radiation experienced by the user in memory. In addition, the apparatus may determine and store the time instant of the determination. The location of the terminal and identification of the user terminal may be stored as well. In an embodiment, the user terminal identification comprises the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) and the type of the user terminal.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The determined amount of electromagnetic radiation experienced by the user may be shown on the display of the apparatus. In addition, the apparatus may display cumulative radiation values. The displaying of the radiation values may be a user selectable option.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">In step 718, the apparatus is configured to control the transmission of the information on the determined amount. The information may be sent to the main user of the group the apparatus belongs to. In an embodiment, the user terminal identification, location of the terminal and time instant of the determination may be transmitted as well. In an embodiment, the information may be stored on a network server. In an embodiment, the user terminal identification comprises the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) and the type of the user terminal.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">The embodiment ends in step 720.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">In an embodiment, the apparatus may be configured to determine the amount of electromagnetic radiation experienced by the user of the user terminal only when the user terminal is closer than a predetermined distance to the user.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">In an embodiment, the above described procedure may be executed continuously. For example, the information on the received and transmitted<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> power may be read at given time intervals. In an embodiment, the interval is 1 to 2 seconds. The call connection status and data transfer status and information from the sensors may as well be monitored continuously or at given time intervals.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">The radiation value may be determined continuously or at given time intervals. The determined value may be shown on the display of the apparatus and stored in the memory of the apparatus. In an embodiment, storing frequency is not the same as the determination and display frequency. For example, radiation values may be stored in memory less frequently than determined and shown.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">There are various ways for determining and storing radiation related data. In an embodiment, cumulative values may be determined and stored in the memory (and in the network server). In some embodiments, only cumulative values are stored. For example, the apparatus may be configured to determine cumulative radiation values one per each hour, i.e. the radiation experienced by the user during each hour is determined and stored.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">In addition, values related to radiation based on received signal powers and transmitted signal powers may be determined stored independently. Furthermore, radiation values related to different external transmitters may be determined and stored independently. Thus, radiation values related to cellular communication and values related to WLANM/iFi communication may be stored determined and separately.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">In an embodiment, radiation values related to voice calls and values related to data transfer may be determined and stored separately. This is based on the call connection and data transfer status information.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">The apparatus may be configured to continuously estimate the radiation the user is exposed to. The radiation values vary depending on the usage of the user terminal. The user may be aware of the radiation caused by voice calls as the user terminal is actively used by the user. However, data traffic may be performed by the user terminal independently without user intervention. The terminal may be configured to check email and social media updates continuously or at given time intervals. This usage causes radiation exposure which the user may not be aware of. The cumulative radiation exposure values determined by the apparatus and shown to the user may help the user to use the user terminal safely.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">In an embodiment, the above mentioned values are stored in the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> user terminal memory and transmitted to the main user (and the network server) at given time intervals.
