The connector 500 receives an object (relay) 501 along a receiving direction (RD). The connector 500 ejects the object 501 along an ejecting direction (ED) opposite to the receiving direction when an operation member 502 is operated. The connector 500 has terminals (not shown). The object 501 has mating terminals 503. Since contact forces between the terminals (not shown) and the mating terminals 503 are large, it might be difficult to directly pull the object 501 out from the connector 500. Even in that case, because the operation member 502 uses a principle of lever, the object 501 can be pulled out therefrom by operating the operation member 502 with a small force.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, the connector 500 of Patent Document 1 has a drawback that the object 501 might be released off the connector 500 when the operation member 502 is operated to pull object 501 out from the connector.</p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a connector which prevents the object from being released off the connector when an operation member is operated in order to pull the object out from the connector.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">One aspect (first aspect) of the present invention provides a connector receivable an object along a receiving direction. The connector ejects the object along an ejecting direction opposite to the receiving direction. The object has a mating terminal, a pressed portion and a regulated portion. When the object is moved in the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> receiving direction, the regulated portion is moved in the receiving direction together with the object. When the object is moved in the ejecting direction, the regulated portion is moved in the ejecting direction together with the object. The connector comprises a holding member, a terminal and an operation member. The terminal is held by the holding member. When the connector receives the object, the terminal is connected with the mating terminal. The operation member is supported by the holding member so as to be movable between a first position and a second position. When the connector receives the object, the operation member is positioned at the first position. The operation member includes a press portion and a regulating portion. When the operation member is operated to be moved from the first position toward the second position, the press portion presses the pressed portion in the ejecting direction to move the object in the ejecting direction. At the latest until the operation member reaches the second position, the regulating portion enters into an ejecting path to regulate a movement of the regulated portion in the ejecting direction so that the regulating portion prevents the object from being released off the connector in the ejecting direction. The ejecting path is a movement path on which the regulated portion passes when moved in the ejecting direction.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Another aspect (second aspect) of the present invention provides a connector device comprising the connector of the first aspect and a mating connector as the object. The mating connector comprises a mating holding member which holds the mating terminal.

In detail, as understood from <figref idrefs="f0005">Figs. 8 and 9</figref>, when the connector 100 receives the mating connector 200, the two connection portions 240 of the mating terminal 230 are inserted into the two terminals 120, respectively, and the contact portions 122 are then brought into contact with the linear portions 232 of the connection portions 240 of the mating terminal 230, respectively. Thus, the two terminals 120 are connected with each other through the mating<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> terminal 230 so that current can be carried from one of the terminals 120 to a remaining one of the terminals 120.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figs. 10</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">15</figref>, the holding member 110 is formed with a support portion 112 and guide portions 114. The support portion 112 is an elongated protrusion which extends in the ejecting direction and is rounded at an end, or a positive Z-side end, thereof in the ejecting direction. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, each of the guide portions 114 is a ditch which extends in an up-down direction, i.e. receiving direction and ejecting direction. As understood from <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 7</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0005">8</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">10</figref>, the holding member 110 is formed with two of the guide portions 114.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2 and 3</figref>, the operation member 130 includes an operation portion 132, guided portions 134, a supported portion 136, a press portion 138, a regulating portion 140 and a reinforcing portion 150. The operation portion 132 is a portion which is operated when the mating connector 200 (see <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref>) received in the connector 100 is moved in the ejecting direction. The operation portion 132 has a block-like shape. The guided portions 134 are protrusions which outwardly extend from the operation portion 132 toward orientations opposite to each other in the thickness direction. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">Figs. 1 to 3</figref>, only one of the guided portions 134 is illustrated in those Figures. A remaining one of the guided portions 134 is formed behind the operation portion 132. In other words, the number of the guided portions 134 of the present embodiment is two. As understood from <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the guided portions 134 are guided by the guide portions 114 of the holding member 110, respectively. Thus, the operation portion 132 can be essentially moved only in the up-down direction, i.e. ejecting direction and receiving direction, while pivoting on the guided portions 134.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figs. 10</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">15</figref>, the supported portion 136 is supported by the support portion 112 of the holding member 110. In detail, the supported portion 136 can be moved to be slid on the support portion 112 while an angle thereof with respect<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> to the up-down direction is changed. In addition, as described above, the guide portions 114 and the guided portions 134 (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) regulate a movement of the operation portion 132 so that the operation portion 132 is moved only in the up-down direction while an angle thereof is changed. Accordingly, the operation member 130 is moved in a swinging motion as a whole. In other words, since the supported portion 136 is supported by the support portion 112, the operation member 130 is swingable.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The operation member 130 of the present embodiment is movable between a first position and a second position. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 7</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0005">8</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">10</figref>, the first position is a position of the operation member 130 when the connector 100 receives the mating connector 200. In other words, when the connector 100 receives the mating connector 200, the operation member 130 is positioned at the first position. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figs. 12, 13</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">15</figref>, the second position is another position of the operation member 130 when the operation portion 132 is operated to be pressed downward so that the mating connector 200 is pushed up to a position where the mating connector 200 can be easily pulled out from the connector 100.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">As understood from <figref idrefs="f0006">Figs. 10</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">15</figref>, when the operation member 130 is operated to be moved from the first position toward the second position, the press portion 138 presses the pressed portion 215 in the ejecting direction to move the mating connector 200 in the ejecting direction.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As understood from <figref idrefs="f0006">Figs. 10, 11</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0008">15</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">16</figref>, an operation of the operation member 130, more specifically, a pressing operation against the operation portion 132, causes the press portion 138 to press the pressed portion 215 so that the island-like protrusion 212 is moved in the ejecting direction. At that time, the regulated portion 220 is moved in the ejecting direction together with the island-like protrusion 212. When the regulated portion 220 is moved in the ejecting direction, the regulated portion 220 passes on a movement path. The movement path is referred to as "ejecting path". The regulating portion 140 of the present embodiment is provided so<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> as to enter into the ejecting path at the latest until the operation member 130 reaches the second position. The entering of the regulating portion 140 regulates a movement of the regulated portion 220 in the ejecting direction. Specifically, when the mating connector 200 is pushed up to the position where the mating connector 200 can be easily pulled out from the connector 100, the regulating portion 140 is positioned on the ejecting path of the regulated portion 220. Accordingly, even if the mating connector 200 is nearly released off the connector 100 with force, the regulated portion 220 abuts the regulating portion 140 so that the mating connector 200 is prevented from being released off the connector 100 in the ejecting direction.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In particular, according to the present embodiment, when the mating terminal 230 (see <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 13</figref>) is positioned away from the terminals 120, force by which the connector 100 holds the mating connector 200 is rapidly decreased. Accordingly, if the connector 100 does not comprise the regulating portion 140, the mating connector 200 might be released off the connector 100 when the operation portion 132 continues to be pressed downward. Thus, the regulating portion 140 of the present embodiment is configured to enter into the ejecting path of the regulated portion 220 before the mating terminal 230 is positioned away from the terminals 120. More specifically, as understood from <figref idrefs="f0005">Figs. 9</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0006">11</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0008">14</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">16</figref>, the regulating portion 140 is provided so as to be positioned on the ejecting path of the regulated portion 220 when the mating terminal 230 is moved in the ejecting direction so that the contact portions 122 of the terminals 120 are positioned away from the linear portions 232, respectively.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figs. 11</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">16</figref>, the regulating portion 140 of the present embodiment has a contact surface 142 and a retraction surface 144. The contact surface 142 intersects with the ejecting direction. The retraction surface 144 intersects with the receiving direction.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figs. 15</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">16</figref>, when the operation member 130 is positioned at<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> the second position, the regulating portion 140 and the regulated portion 220 are brought into contact with each other at the contact surfaces 142, 222. Accordingly, the mating connector 200 can be pulled out from the connector 100 when the operation of the operation member 130 is stopped. In detail, under a state where the operation portion 132 is operated to be pressed downward, the regulating portion 140 stays on the ejecting path of the regulated portion 220 so that the mating connector 200 cannot be pulled out from the connector 100. In a case where the mating connector 200 is about to be pulled out from the connector 100 after the operation of the operation member 130 is stopped, the contact surface 222 presses the contact surface 142 in the ejecting direction. Each of the contact surface 222 and the contact surface 142 intersects with the ejecting direction. Accordingly, when the contact surface 222 presses the contact surface 142 in the ejecting direction, the regulating portion 140 is moved to an outside of the ejecting path. Thus, the mating connector 200 can be easily pulled out from the connector 100. In the present embodiment, the regulating portion 140 and the regulated portion 220 are provided with the contact surface 142 and the contact surface 222, respectively, and each of the contact surfaces 142, 222 intersects with the ejecting direction. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, if at least one of the regulating portion 140 and the regulated portion 220 is provided with the contact surface 142, 222 which intersects with the ejecting direction, the mating connector 200 can be easily pulled out from the connector 100 when the operation of the operation member 130 is stopped.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As understood from <figref idrefs="f0008">Figs. 15</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">16</figref>, if the operation member 130 is positioned at the second position under a state where the mating connector 200 is pulled out from the connector 100, the regulating portion 140 is positioned on a receiving path before the mating connector 200 is inserted into and mated with the connector 100, i.e. before the connector 100 receives the mating connector 200. The receiving path is another movement path on which the regulated portion 220 passes<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> when moved in the receiving direction. In the aforementioned situation, when the mating connector 200 is inserted into and mated with the connector 100, the regulated portion 220 abuts the regulating portion 140 in the receiving direction. At that time, the regulating portion 140 and the regulated portion 220 are brought into contact with each other at the retraction surfaces 144, 224 each of which intersects with the receiving direction, so that the regulating portion 140 is retracted from the receiving path. Accordingly, the connector 100 can smoothly receives the mating connector 200. Although the regulated portion 220 and the regulating portion 140 of the present embodiment are provided with the retraction surface 224 and the retraction surface 144, respectively, and each of the retraction surfaces 224, 144 intersects with the receiving direction. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, if at least one of the regulated portion 220 and the regulating portion 140 is provided with the retraction surface 224, 144 which intersects with the receiving direction, the connector 100 can smoothly receives the mating connector 200 even if the regulating portion 140 is positioned on the receiving path of the regulated portion 220 when the connector 100 receives the mating connector 200.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the operation member 130 has a first distance from the supported portion 136 to the regulating portion 140, and the operation member 130 has a second distance from the supported portion 136 to the press portion 138. Since the first distance is longer than the second distance, the regulating portion 140 can be largely moved when the press portion 138 is moved. Thus, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 15</figref>, the regulating portion 140 surely regulates the regulated portion 220 while the regulating portion 140 can be prevented from unnecessarily inhibiting a movement of the regulated portion 220. In addition, the regulating portion 140, the supported portion 136 and the press portion 138 are triangularly positioned in a plane, or the XZ-plane, including the ejecting direction. Accordingly, the connector 100 can be prevented from having an increased size in the predetermined direction, or the X-direction.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As understood from <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, in the present embodiment, each of the press portion 138 and the regulating portion 140 has a predetermined thickness in the thickness direction. Furthermore, the reinforcing portion 150 has a thickness same as the predetermined thickness and couples the press portion 138 with the regulating portion 140. The operation of the operation member 130 causes the press portion 138 and the regulating portion 140 to receive large loads so that the operation member 130 might be damaged. However, the operation member 130 is provided with the reinforcing portion 150 so that the operation member 130 is prevented from being damaged.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Although the present invention has been described with specific examples, the present invention is not limited thereto.
