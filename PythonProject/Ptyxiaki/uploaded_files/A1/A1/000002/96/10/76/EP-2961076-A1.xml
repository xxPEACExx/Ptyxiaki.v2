All the transmission power spectrum density masks of xDSL systems are standardized by ITU-T organization and published in its recommendations (G.990-G.999: Metallic access networks). The power spectrum density mask is generally intended to reduce cross-talk noise and to limit power consumption by limiting excessive radiation at frequencies beyond the necessary bandwidth. Attenuation of these spurious emissions is usually done with a band-pass filter, tuned to allow through the correct center frequency of the carrier wave, as well as all necessary sidebands.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">An xDSL system, as represented on <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>figure 1</b></figref><b>,</b> consists in a central office CO, comprising for example a DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer), connected by a bundle of copper cables 10 connected to a plurality of customer premises equipments CPE<sub>i</sub>, i ∈ {1, ..., N}.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In order for the xDSL system to work properly, it is desirable that the central office CO and the customer premises equipment CPE have their respective transmissions power spectrum density levels below the scope of the power spectrum density mask.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It is therefore important to measure the transmission power density spectrum of both the central office CO and the customer premises equipment CPE in order to check that these transmission power spectrum density levels are below the standardized power spectrum density mask.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Figure 2</b></figref> represents a system used to measure the transmission power spectrum density levels and compare them with the standardized power spectrum density masks.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Such a system comprises a DSLAM connected through a line simulator 20 to a CPE. In order to measure the transmission power spectrum density levels of the DSLAM or of the CPE, the CPE or the DSLAM has to be replaced by an impedance 21 while the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> measurement is being done. The value of the impedance 21 is equal to the input impedance of the DSLAM or the CPE. The impedance 21 is switched to the line simulator 20 instead of the CPE while the DSLAM transmission power spectrum density level is measured and instead of the DSLAM while the transmission power spectrum density level of the CPE is measured. The impedance 21 avoids a reflection of the DSL signal which may disrupt the measuring of the transmission power spectrum density.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A transmission is initiated between the DSLAM and the CPE. Once the transmission is initiated and a signal is transmitted between the DSLAM and the CPE, the measuring of the transmission power spectrum density levels can be executed.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In order to measure the transmission power spectrum density of the DSLAM, a technician disconnects the CPE from the line simulator 20 and connects the impedance 21 instead. The signal transmitted by the DSLAM is then captured by the spectrum analyzer 22.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Once the CPE is disconnected from the line simulator 20, the DSLAM continues to transmit a signal for a few seconds before cutting the transmission. This is due to the fact that the DSLAM no longer communicates with the CPE.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The same goes for the measuring of the transmission power spectrum density of the CPE. In order to measure the transmission power spectrum density of the CPE, the technician disconnects the DSLAM from the line simulator 20 and connects the impedance 21 instead. The signal transmitted by the CPE is captured by the spectrum analyzer 22. Once the DSLAM is disconnected from the line simulator 20, the CPE continues to transmit a signal for a few seconds before cutting the transmission. This is due to the fact that the CPE no longer communicates with the DLSAM.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Thus the technician only has a few seconds for disconnecting the DSLAM and the CPE from the line simulator 20 and connecting the impedance 21 instead in order to capture the transmission power spectrum density levels.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Such a method is time consuming and has a high probability of mistakes in the measuring of the transmission power spectrum density because the technician has only a few seconds to connect the DSLAM or the CPE to the spectrum analyzer 22, and therefore may have to try several times to capture an exploitable spectrum.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">It is an objective of the present invention to overcome disadvantages and/or make improvements in the prior art.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In that respect, the present invention relates to a device enabling the measurement of the transmission power spectrum density of at least one transceiver in a DSL system, said device comprising :
