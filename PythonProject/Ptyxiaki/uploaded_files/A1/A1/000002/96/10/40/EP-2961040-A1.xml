load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">Technical Field</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an interior permanent magnet motor.</p><heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In a general interior permanent magnet motor, as many magnet insertion holes as the number of poles are formed in advance in an axial direction through a rotor core formed by laminating and fixing a plurality of magnetic steel sheets punched into a predetermined shape. When the rotor is assembled, permanent magnets are inserted into corresponding magnet insertion holes. When the electric motor is operated, forces caused by the change in attracting force between the magnet and a tooth leading end and by the acceleration and deceleration act on the magnet, and hence the magnet may move laterally in a circumferential direction inside the magnet insertion hole. A large amount of movement of the magnet inside the magnet insertion hole causes vibration and noise, which further causes wearing, cracking, and chipping of the magnet. Therefore, in the vicinity of the lateral ends of the magnet insertion hole, steps or projections are often formed as lateral magnet stoppers against the movement of the magnet.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">On the other hand, when the magnet stoppers are formed<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> in the magnet insertion hole, the distance between the edges of the hole is reduced in this part, and thus the magnetic flux passes across the magnet more easily as compared to the case in the periphery thereof. Therefore, there has been a problem in that, when the magnet is exposed to a magnetic field caused by a winding current of a stator, the magnet tends to demagnetize in the vicinity of the magnet stoppers of the magnet insertion hole.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In a normal case, the lateral magnet stoppers against the movement of the magnet are not necessary in all of the laminated steel sheets, and it is sufficient that the lateral magnet stoppers be formed in only at least two steel sheets spaced apart in the axial direction. The necessary number thereof depends on the force of the magnet that tries to laterally move and the strength of the magnet stopper per sheet. In view of this, in order to reduce the demagnetization to be caused when the magnet stoppers are formed, the following method is conceivable. The magnet stoppers are formed in, among the plurality of magnetic steel sheets forming the rotor core, only at least two steel sheets spaced apart in the axial direction, and the magnet stoppers are not formed in the other steel sheets. In this manner, the use number (ratio) of steel sheets that may easily cause the demagnetization of the magnet is reduced.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As the configuration relating to such a method, for example, there is known a configuration disclosed in Patent Literature 1. In the configuration of Patent Literature 1, two types of steel sheets, that is, a steel sheet having a magnet insertion<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> hole with a large lateral width in the circumferential direction (referred to as "steel sheet A") and a steel sheet having a magnet insertion hole with a small lateral width in the circumferential direction (referred to as "steel sheet B") are prepared, and the position of the magnet is regulated by two or more steel sheets B.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">[PTL 1] <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP4005988B"><text>JP 4005988 B2</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, in the configuration of Patent Literature 1, at the time of assembly of the rotor, when the magnet is inserted into the magnet insertion hole, the magnet is slightly inclined within a range of a gap between the magnet and the magnet insertion hole of the steel sheet B. Even with a slight inclination, when the interval between the steel sheets B in the lamination direction is long, the positional misalignment of the corner of the magnet leading end is increased due to the inclination, and it is not easy to insert the corner of the magnet leading end without interfering with the edge of the magnet insertion hole. Further, when the interval between the steel sheets B in the lamination direction is set short, the insertability of the magnet is improved, but on<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the other hand, the number of the steel sheets B is increased, which may reduce the demagnetization resistance of the electric motor. In Patent Literature 1, no disclosure is made on at what interval the steel sheets B are required to be arranged in order to reduce the use number thereof and suppress the reduction in demagnetization resistance.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention has been made in view of the above, and has an object to provide an interior permanent magnet motor capable of improving the insertability of the magnet into the magnet insertion hole and further suppressing the reduction in demagnetization resistance of the electric motor while reducing the movement of the magnet to reduce the noise and reduce the risk of wearing, cracking, and chipping of the magnet.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">In order to achieve the object described above, according to one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an interior permanent magnet motor, including: a rotor; a stator installed so as to be opposed to the rotor with an air gap; and a plurality of permanent magnets respectively inserted into a plurality of magnet insertion holes formed in a rotor core of the rotor, the rotor core being formed by laminating a plurality of magnetic steel sheets, the plurality of magnetic steel sheets including first magnetic steel sheets each not having a magnet stopper in the magnet insertion hole, and second magnetic steel sheets each<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> having magnet stoppers at both end portions of the magnet insertion hole, the rotor core including a laminate of the magnetic steel sheets in a lamination mode in which, when H<sub>n</sub> represents a distance between an upper end surface of the second magnetic steel sheet that comes first when only the second magnetic steel sheets are sequentially counted in a lamination direction from an upper side of the rotor core and an upper end surface of the n-th second magnetic steel sheet, a progression of differences of H<sub>n</sub> is a geometric progression.</p><heading id="h0008">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to the one embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to improve the insertability of the magnet into the magnet insertion hole and further suppressing the reduction in demagnetization resistance of the electric motor while reducing the movement of the magnet to reduce the noise and reduce the risk of wearing, cracking, and chipping of the magnet.</p><heading id="h0009">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a vertical sectional view for illustrating a schematic configuration of an interior permanent magnet motor according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a lateral sectional view of a rotor core in a steel sheet not having a magnet stopper.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a lateral sectional view of the rotor core in a steel<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> sheet having the magnet stoppers.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> is a vertical sectional view of the rotor core taken along the line Z-Z of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2 and FIG. 3</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref> is a view in the same mode as <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> for illustrating a specific example of an arrangement mode of the magnetic steel sheets having the magnet stoppers.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6</figref> is a view for illustrating a relationship of abutment between a permanent magnet and a magnet stopper in an interior permanent magnet motor according to a second embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 7</figref> is a view in the same mode as <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6</figref> according to a third embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 8</figref> is a view in the same mode as <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6</figref> according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 9</figref> is a view in the same mode as <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref> according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010">Description of Embodiments</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">Now, an interior permanent magnet motor according to embodiments of the present invention is described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

An interior permanent magnet motor 100 according to the first embodiment includes a rotor 1, a stator 2, a frame 3, and a bracket 4.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The rotor 1 includes a rotor core 5, a shaft 6, a plurality of permanent magnets (for example, rare-earth magnets) 7, and a pair of upper and lower end plates 8. The rotor core 5 is formed by, for example, laminating and fixing a plurality of magnetic steel sheets punched into a predetermined shape. The rotor core 5 has, for example, a substantially annular shape as viewed in a rotary shaft direction. The rotor core 5 has a plurality of magnet insertion holes 9 formed in parts of the outer periphery thereof. The plurality of magnet insertion holes 9 are formed as many as the number of poles, and are arranged at, for example, equal intervals in a circumferential direction.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Each of the magnet insertion holes 9 extends in the rotary shaft direction of the rotor core 5 (direction in which the shaft 6 extends), and is opened at both end surfaces thereof in the rotary shaft direction. The permanent magnet 7 having a substantially cuboid shape is inserted into each of the magnet insertion holes 9.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The end plates 8 are mounted on both the end surfaces of the rotor core 5 in the rotary shaft direction. The pair of end plates 8 at least partially covers the openings of the plurality of magnet insertion holes 9 in both the end surfaces of the rotor core 5 (in the illustrated example, the pair of end plates 8 entirely<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> covers the openings), and plays a role of a retainer for the permanent magnets 7.

The shaft 6 extends along the rotary shaft direction in the rotor core 5, and has one end side rotatably supported by the frame 3 through intermediation of a bearing 10, and the other end side rotatably supported by the bracket 4 through intermediation of a bearing 11. On the bearing surface of the bearing 10, a wave washer 12 for applying a preload is arranged. The shaft 6 has, for example, a circular shape in lateral cross section, and in this case, the shaft fitting hole is also formed into a circular shape in accordance therewith.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The stator 2 includes a stator core 13 and a winding 14. The stator core 13 is formed by, for example, laminating and fixing a plurality of magnetic steel sheets punched into a predetermined shape. The stator core 13 has, for example, a substantially annular shape as viewed in the rotary shaft direction. In parts of the stator core 13 closer to the inner periphery thereof, a plurality of teeth (not shown) are formed. The teeth are positioned at, for example, substantially equal intervals in the circumferential direction. The winding 14 is wound around those teeth via an insulator (not shown).

Note that, the sixth embodiment is similar to the case of the above-mentioned first embodiment except for the part to be described below.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">When the total number of the magnetic steel sheets forming the rotor core is determined, and when the breakdown of<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> the magnetic steel sheets and the lamination positions (lamination order) of the magnetic steel sheets having the magnet stoppers are determined based on the rule of Expression (8) described above, the magnetic steel sheet having the magnet stoppers may not be always arranged at the lower end surface of the rotor core. Regarding this point, in the sixth embodiment, the rotor core is configured as follows. There is provided a laminate of magnetic steel sheets in a lamination mode based on the rule of Expression (8) described above except for the magnetic steel sheet arranged at the lower end surface of the rotor core, and the magnetic steel sheet arranged at the lower end surface of the rotor core is always set to the magnetic steel sheet having the magnet stoppers regardless of the rule of Expression (8) describedabove. <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 9</figref> is an example thereof. That is, the total number of magnetic steel sheets forming the rotor core is determined as 30. From the first sheet to the twenty-ninth sheet, there is provided a laminate of magnetic steel sheets in the lamination mode based on the rule of Expression (8) described above. In the thirtieth sheet, according to the rule of Expression (8) described above, the magnetic steel sheet 17a not having the magnet stopper 16 is originally required to be arranged, but instead, the magnetic steel sheet 17b having the magnet stoppers 16 is arranged.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Note that, in other words, the sixth embodiment can be regarded as one aspect of the above-mentioned fifth embodiment by interpreting the sixth embodiment as a mode in which the rotor core partially includes the laminate of the magnetic steel sheets in<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> the lamination mode based on the rule of Expression (8) described above, and one magnetic steel sheet having the magnet stoppers is added under the laminate.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">According to the sixth embodiment, in addition to the effects of the above-mentioned first embodiment, the following advantages can be obtained. That is, when the rotor core is formed only of the laminate of the magnetic steel sheets in the lamination mode based on the rule of Expression (8) described above, under such a condition that, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 9</figref>, the lowermost magnetic steel sheet 17b is distanced from the lower end surface of the rotor core 5 (condition that the lowermost magnetic steel sheet 17b is separated by 15t from the lower end surface of the rotor core 5), as represented by reference symbol X in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 9</figref>, the permanent magnet 7 may be significantly inclined.
