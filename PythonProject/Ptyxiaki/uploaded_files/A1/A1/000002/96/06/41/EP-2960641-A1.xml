Next, a light having a specific wavelength emitted from a light emitting device is transmitted to the measured solution, and one portion of the light is absorbed in the measured solution, and then, the transmitted light is received by a light receiving device, and a strength of the transmitted light at that time is measured. Next, a value of the absorbance is calculated from the strength of the transmitted light measured at that time and another measured strength of a transmitted light of, for example, a light having a specific wavelength relative to a transparent solution. Then, the concentration of the dissolved substance in the sample is<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> calculated using the value of the absorbance, and a calibration curve created beforehand with respect to the dissolved substance, i.e., a diagram showing a relation between the value of the absorbance and a value of the concentration of the dissolved substance.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">On the other hand, a light including a visible light region is transmitted to the measured solution, and within the transmitted light thereof, the light of the visible light region is divided into nearly three portions to obtain a red region component light, a green region component light, and a blue region component light, and a value of an absorbance with respect to any of the aforementioned region component lights, or a plurality of region component lights of a combination of the aforementioned region component lights, are calculated to measure the concentration of the specific dissolved substance in the sample as well (Patent Document 1).</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Document</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2010181150A"><text>Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2010-181150</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Problems to be Solved by Invention</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">When the concentration of the dissolved substance in the sample is measured using the absorptiometry, however, there is a case wherein the reagent is not added in a necessary quantity to the sample due to a breakdown of a reagent pump, a blockade of a supply channel of the reagent, a deviation of a supply tube of the reagent, depletion of the reagent, or the like.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> This frequently occurs in a case wherein the concentration of the dissolved substance in the sample is automatically measured.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In such a case, regardless of the presence of the dissolved substance which becomes a detection object in the sample, there can occur a problem wherein the concentration of the dissolved substance is not detected at all, or the concentration of the dissolved substance is detected only for a value matching a quantity of the reagent which is less than the concentration of an actual dissolved substance so that proper concentration of the dissolved substance in the sample is not measured. Also, this problem can occur even in a case wherein the concentration of the dissolved substance is measured using the three region component lights of red, green, and blue.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In view of the above-mentioned problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for measuring concentration of a dissolved substance which can judge whether or not the reagent in the necessary quantity for a measurement is added to the sample when the concentration of the dissolved substance in the sample is measured using the absorbance of the three region component lights of red, green, and blue.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The first invention of the present invention comprises a reagent preparation step of making a reagent including a coloring agent by adding the coloring agent, which allows a measured solution to develop a color transmitting a region component light for a dissolved-substance concentration measurement selected from any of a red region component light, a green region component light, or a blue region component light obtained by transmitting a light including a visible<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> light region to the measured solution colored by addition of a reagent to a sample, and dividing a light in the visible light region within a transmitted light thereof into roughly three portions, or selected from a plurality of the region component lights of a combination of the red, green, and blue region component lights, without being absorbed, to the reagent; a concentration measurement step of measuring concentration of a specific dissolved substance in the sample by calculating an absorbance of the region component light for the dissolved-substance concentration measurement based on the transmitted light from the measured solution to which the reagent including a coloring agent is added; and a judgement step of carrying out a judgement whether or not the reagent is added in a necessary quantity by calculating an absorbance of another region component light other than the region component light for the dissolved-substance concentration measurement based on the transmitted light from the measured solution to which the reagent including the coloring agent is added to determine a value of an absorbance of another region component light resulted only from the coloring agent, and by comparing the value of the absorbance with a value of a standard absorbance.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the present invention, in a case wherein the measured solution colored by the dissolved substance absorbs, for example, all of three region component lights, among the three region component lights, the region component light having a linear relation between the value of the absorbance and a value of the concentration of the dissolved substance is selected as the region component light for the dissolved-substance concentration measurement. Also, any coloring agent may be used provided that the measured solution colored by the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> coloring agent transmits the region component light for the dissolved-substance concentration measurement without being absorbed. For example, for the coloring agent, there can be used the coloring agent allowing the measured solution to develop the same color as the region component light for the dissolved-substance concentration measurement. The measured solution colored by the coloring agent transmits the region component light for the dissolved-substance concentration measurement without being absorbed, so that the concentration of the specific dissolved substance in the sample can be easily obtained from a calibration curve created beforehand using the value of the absorbance of the region component light for the dissolved-substance concentration measurement.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Also, among the three region component lights, if the region component light for the dissolved-substance concentration measurement is, for example, the green region component light, the region component lights other than the green region component light, i.e., any one of either the red region component light or the blue region component light, for example, the red region component light transmits through the measured solution so as to show a value A3 of the absorbance resulted only from the coloring agent, or show a value A1 of the absorbance resulted from the coloring agent and the specific dissolved substance. In a case wherein the red region component light shows the absorbance resulted from the coloring agent and the specific dissolved substance, the concentration of the specific dissolved substance is known, so that a value A2 of the absorbance of the red region component light resulted only from the concentration of the specific dissolved substance is easily calculated from the calibration curve created<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> beforehand. Therefore, in that case, the value A3 of the absorbance of the red region component light resulted only from the coloring agent is calculated using a formula of A3 = A1 - A2. The value A3 of the absorbance becomes a value corresponding to a quantity of the reagent added to the sample, so that in a case wherein the value A3 of the absorbance is smaller than a value A0 of the standard absorbance, the quantity of the reagent added to the sample is judged as being insufficient. Incidentally, the value of the standard absorbance represents the value of the absorbance of the region component light resulted only from the coloring agent in a case wherein the reagent in only the exactly necessary quantity is added to the sample.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As for a second invention of the present invention, in the case of the first invention, in a case wherein two kinds of the reagents are added to the sample, in the reagent preparation step, a first coloring agent, allowing the measured solution to develop a color transmitting the region component light for the dissolved-substance concentration measurement and one of the remaining region component lights among three of the region component lights without being absorbed, is added to one of the reagents to make a reagent including the first coloring agent. Also, a second coloring agent, allowing the measured solution to develop a color transmitting the region component light for the dissolved-substance concentration measurement and the other of the remaining region component lights without being absorbed, is added to the other of the reagents to make a reagent including the second coloring agent.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The coloring agent transmitting two region component lights, for example, the red region component light and the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> green region component light without being absorbed may be any coloring agent provided that the coloring agent allows the measured solution to develop the same color as a complementary color light of the blue region component light. Similarly, the coloring agent transmitting the red region component light and the blue region component light without being absorbed may be any coloring agent provided that the coloring agent allows the measured solution to develop the same color as a complementary color light of the green region component light, and the coloring agent transmitting the green region component light and the blue region component light without being absorbed may be any coloring agent provided that the coloring agent allows the measured solution to develop the same color as a complementary color light of the red region component light.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Therefore, as for the region component light for the dissolved-substance concentration measurement, for example, in a case wherein the red region component light is used, for the first coloring agent, for example, the coloring agent allowing the measured solution to develop the same color as the complementary color light of the green region component light is used, and for the second coloring agent, the coloring agent allowing the measured solution to develop the same color as the complementary color light of the blue region component light is used. The red region component light is not absorbed into the measured solution in which only the first coloring agent and the second coloring agent have developed a color, so that the concentration of the specific dissolved substance in the sample can be easily obtained from the calibration curve created beforehand using the value of the absorbance of the red region component light.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Also, the green region component light is not absorbed into the measured solution in which only the second coloring agent has developed a color so as to show a value B3 of the absorbance resulted only from the first coloring agent, or show a value B1 of the absorbance resulted from the first coloring agent and the specific dissolved substance. Also, the blue region component light is not absorbed into the measured solution in which only the first coloring agent has developed a color so as to show a value C3 of the absorbance resulted only from the second coloring agent, or show a value C1 of the absorbance resulted from the second coloring agent and the specific dissolved substance. In a case wherein the green region component light and the blue region component light show the absorbance resulted from the coloring agent and the specific dissolved substance, values (B2 and C2) of the absorbances of the green region component light and the blue region component light resulted only from the specific dissolved substance can be read from the calibration curve created beforehand respectively. Therefore, the value B3 of the absorbance of the green region component light resulted only from the first coloring agent is calculated using a formula of B3 = B1 - B2, and the value C3 of the absorbance of the blue region component light resulted only from the second coloring agent is calculated using a formula of C3 = C1 - C2. Then, in a case wherein the values (B3 and C3) of the absorbances are smaller than values (B0 and C0) of the standard absorbance determined with respect to each of the first reagent and the second reagent, an addition quantity of each reagent added to the sample is judged as being insufficient.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As for a third invention of the present invention, in the case of the first invention, in a case wherein the measured solution develops a color in such a way as to change the color with a change in the concentration of the specific dissolved substance, and two of the region component lights are used as the region component light for the dissolved-substance concentration measurement, in the reagent preparation step, a coloring agent, allowing the measured solution to develop a color transmitting the two of the region component lights without being absorbed, is added to the reagent to make a reagent including a coloring agent.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the invention, in a case wherein two reagent component lights for the dissolved-substance concentration measurement are, for example, the blue region component light and the green region component light, there is used a coloring agent allowing the measured solution to develop the same color as the complementary color of the region component light other than the blue region component light and the green region component light, i.e., the red region component light. The two region component lights for the dissolved-substance concentration measurement are unaffected by the coloring agent in the measured solution, so that the concentration of the specific dissolved substance is calculated by the values of the absorbances of the two region component lights for the dissolved-substance concentration measurement.

Therefore, the concentration of the dissolved substance is calculated based on the value of the absorbance of the red region component light when the concentration of the dissolved<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> substance is between 0 and 30, and the concentration of the dissolved substance is calculated based on the value of the absorbance of the green region component light when the concentration of the dissolved substance exceeds 30.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">In that case, for the coloring agent added to the reagent T0, there is used the coloring agent allowing the measured solution S2 to develop the same color as the complementary color of the blue region component light and transmit the red region component light and the green region component light without being absorbed. Therefore, in a case wherein the blue region component light shows, for example, the absorbance resulted from the coloring agent and the specific dissolved substance, the value of the absorbance of the blue region component light resulted only from the coloring agent is calculated, and if the value of the absorbance is smaller than the value of the standard absorbance, the addition quantity of the reagent T0 to the sample solution S1 is judged as being insufficient.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">Namely, the measured solution S2 changes a color from the first color to the second color according to the concentration of the specific dissolved substance, so that in a case wherein the concentration of the dissolved substance is required to be obtained using absorbances of two region component lights for the dissolved-substance concentration measurement, the coloring agent, allowing the measured solution S2 to develop the same color as the complementary colors of the remaining region component lights, may be added to the reagent T0 to make the reagent T0c including a coloring agent. Then, the value of the absorbance resulted only from the coloring agent is calculated from the values of the absorbances of the<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> remaining region component lights, and based on the value of the absorbance, whether or not the reagent T0 is sufficiently added to the sample solution S1 may be judged.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">Incidentally, the computing portion 71 of the computing processing apparatus 7 includes the function of proceeding the operation of the equipment as explained in the above.</p><heading id="h0016">Explanation of Symbols</heading><p id="p0103" num="0103"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>1</dt><dd>a concentration measuring apparatus</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>a measuring cell</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>a light receiving/emitting portion</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>a sample supply line</dd><dt>5, 5A, and 5B</dt><dd>reagent supply lines</dd><dt>6</dt><dd>a solution discharge line</dd><dt>7</dt><dd>a computing processing apparatus</dd><dt>8</dt><dd>an output apparatus</dd><dt>9</dt><dd>a control apparatus</dd><dt>31</dt><dd>a light emitting device</dd><dt>32</dt><dd>a light receiving device</dd><dt>S0</dt><dd>a preparing solution</dd><dt>S1</dt><dd>a sample solution (a sample)</dd><dt>S2</dt><dd>a measured solution</dd><dt>A0</dt><dd>a value of a standard absorbance of another region component light</dd><dt>A3</dt><dd>a value of an absorbance of another region component light resulted only from a coloring agent</dd><dt>T0, T1, and T2</dt><dd>reagents</dd><dt>T0c, T1c, and T2c</dt><dd>reagents including a coloring agent</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90459660" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A method for measuring concentration of a dissolved substance, comprising:
