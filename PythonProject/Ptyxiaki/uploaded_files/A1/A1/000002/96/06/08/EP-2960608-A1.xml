In the course of operation of the melting chamber, the fire-resistant lagging gradually breaks up (wears out) due to high temperatures, chemical corrosion and mechanic erosion of fire-resistant material.

Heat is absorbed rapidly from those parts of the melting chamber body only, that experience maximum heat loads because the liquid metal coolant fills only that part of the hermetically sealed cavity which goes around the free space, the slag bath and the upper part of the lagged metal bath. Slag lining builds up on the melting chamber walls protecting the outer walls of the body<br/>
and reducing heat losses through the walls. Heat in the lower part of the metal bath is not absorbed as rapidly, so it keeps the metal in the bath from getting overcooled.

On the side of the outer wall 4 of the heat exchanger 21 positioned on the body of the melting chamber 20, there are pipe sleeves 17 for supplying cold gaseous coolant and pipe sleeves 18 for recovering heated gaseous coolant.

<ul><li>The body of the melting chamber 20 is heated by switching on the combined oxy-fuel burners-tuyeres 11 at a lower power mode. The body walls 8 and 9 are heated to 200-250°C, liquid metal coolant being heated in the reserve tank by a special heating system and then pumped into the upper part of the cavity 10 between the body walls 8 and 9 of the melting chamber 20. After that the power input into the melting chamber 20 produced by the combined burners-tuyeres 11 is increased, and cold gaseous coolant is supplied to the heat exchanger 21 to cool the liquid metal coolant.</li></ul>
Low-melting metal charge mixture, for instance, iron chips, is loaded into the melting chamber 20 through the hole 13.<br/>
It is melted and used to fill the metal bath 1 to protect the fire-resistant lagging 16 from aggressive impact of the melted slag. After that, standard charge mixture is loaded at required speed through the furnace charge pre-heater heated by stack gas (not shown schematically), and the melting chamber 20 then works on a continuous basis without interruptions. After the slag bath 2 is filled up, the slag taphole14 is opened, and excessive slag drains down the gutter 15 into a slag pot or a slag granulation facility.<br/>
The slag should be drained at maintained speed ensuring<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> that when the charge mixture is loaded on a continuous or periodic basis, the level of the melted slag in the melting chamber changes only slightly or remains the same. Melted metal piling up in the metal bath 1 is regularly drained from the melting chamber 20 through the metal tap-hole 5 down the lagged gutter 6 into a casting ladle, making sure that the level of the melted metal never drops by more than 150-250 mm.<br/>
Due to rapid heat absorption by the liquid metal coolant from the inner body wall 9 of the melting chamber, a layer of slag lining made of slag, dust and unmolten charge mixture, builds up on the wall surface in the free space 3 and in the melted slag zone (the slag bath 2). It protects the wall from destruction and reduces heat losses from the chamber. By cooling the upper and the most vulnerable part of the fire-resistant lagging of the metal bath by liquid metal coolant, and the rest of the metal bath lagging by cold gaseous coolant, the lagging 16 service life increases dramatically. With that, there are no problems with draining metal from the melting chamber.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Therefore, the proposed inventions provide opportunity for running a continuous uninterrupted melting process or processing different furnace charge materials without having to stop the melting chamber for lagging maintenance.
