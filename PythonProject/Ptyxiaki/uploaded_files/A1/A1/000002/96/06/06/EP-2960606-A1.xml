Further, in PTL 2, as a method of separating the carbon dioxide from the exhaust gas, a chemical absorption method, a physical adsorption method, a membrane separation method, and a cryogenic separation method are described. Among them, with respect to the chemical absorption method, the physical adsorption method, and the membrane separation method, an expensive absorbent, an adsorbent, and a polymer membrane are required in order to separate carbon dioxide. Further, in the cases of the chemical absorption method, the physical adsorption method, and the membrane separation method, because of a restriction on an increase in the size of the system, the exhaust gas to be treated is limited.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">With respect to the chemical absorption method, the physical adsorption method, and the membrane separation method described above, carbon dioxide is recovered as a gas. The carbon dioxide recovered as a gas is made to be in a high-pressure state when performing transportation or storage. As a method of obtaining the carbon dioxide in a high-pressure state, there is a method of increasing the pressure of recovered low-pressure gaseous carbon dioxide in a gaseous state, or a method of liquefying gaseous<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> carbon dioxide in the middle of pressure-increasing and then increasing the pressure of the carbon dioxide with a pump. Energy for increasing pressure in a liquid is generally much smaller than energy for increasing pressure in a gas, and therefore, by increasing the pressure of liquefied carbon dioxide with a pump, it becomes possible to reduce energy.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, when liquefying the above-described gaseous carbon dioxide, a large amount of energy for cooling the gaseous carbon dioxide is required, and therefore, it is desired to lower energy related to liquefaction of the gaseous carbon dioxide.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Therefore, in PTL 2 described above, a technique of attaining a reduction in energy related to the liquefaction of gaseous carbon dioxide by providing an absorption refrigerator which is driven by using exhaust heat of an exhaust gas of a fuel cell is proposed.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">On the other hand, as a carbon dioxide recovery device for removing carbon dioxide in a coal gasification gas, there is a carbon dioxide recovery device using a chemical absorption method. However, also in the chemical absorption method, a large amount of carbon dioxide recovery power is required, and thus a situation in which<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> improvement in the efficiency of the entire system is difficult is caused. Therefore, in PTL 3, a technique of liquefying carbon dioxide in a coal gasification gas by cooling the coal gasification gas by using liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen produced by a cryogenic separation device for producing gaseous oxygen which is used for combustion in a gasification furnace is described.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further, in a carbon dioxide liquefaction plant, a structure provided with a device for separating a synthesis gas stream which includes carbon dioxide and hydrogen into a hydrogen vapor stream and a liquid carbon dioxide stream is known.

Therefore, in PTL 4, in a gas-liquid separation system for cooling a synthesis gas having an increased pressure in a heat exchanger, thereby separating the synthesis gas into a high-pressure hydrogen vapor stream and liquid carbon dioxide, a technique of obtaining power of a compressor or the like by expanding the high-pressure hydrogen vapor stream by an expander and performing heat exchange between a hydrogen vapor stream with a temperature lowered by expansion and a synthesis gas stream is described.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010"><ul><li>[PTL 1] <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2009270753A"><text>Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2009-270753</text></patcit></li><li>[PTL 2] <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2011141967A"><text>Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2011-141967</text></patcit></li><li>[PTL 3] <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2010184994A"><text>Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2010-184994</text></patcit></li><li>[PTL 4] <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2011529434W"><text>PCT Japanese Translation Patent Publication No. 2011-529434</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">Incidentally, among plants which are provided with an oxygen-blown gasification furnace or a boiler, in a plant which obtains high-pressure carbon dioxide by compressing gaseous carbon dioxide after separation and recovery of the carbon dioxide, the carbon dioxide is compressed by using a gas compressor. A large amount of compression power is required in order to compress the carbon dioxide into a gaseous state.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">On the other hand, in a case where a cold heat source needed to liquefy the carbon dioxide is present, it is possible to cool and liquefy the carbon dioxide by using the cold heat source after recovered gaseous carbon<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> dioxide is compressed to a liquefaction pressure, and compress the liquefied carbon dioxide to a required pressure with low power by a pump. For this reason, it is possible to attain a further reduction in power than in a case of using the gas compressor.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">However, in general cooling water, a temperature is high, and thus it cannot be used as a cold heat source for liquefying recovered carbon dioxide. For this reason, in a case of increasing the pressure of liquid carbon dioxide with a pump, in order to obtain a low-temperature cold heat source, it is necessary to prepare a new cold heat source plant or use the existing cold heat source plant. However, in a case of manufacturing a cold heat source by preparing a new cold heat source plant, a large amount of manufacturing energy is required, and therefore, it is difficult to attain a reduction in power consumption. Also in a case of using the existing cold heat source plant, in general, a cold heat source necessary for the cooling of carbon dioxide is newly manufactured, and therefore, a large amount of energy is required, and thus it is difficult to attain a reduction in power consumption. In addition, even in a case where the cold heat source having been discarded in the existing cold heat source plant can be used as a cold heat source for liquefaction<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> of carbon dioxide, recently, further energy saving has been desired.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances and has an object to provide a carbon dioxide liquefaction device in which it is possible to attain a reduction in power consumption.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">A first aspect of a carbon dioxide liquefaction device according to the present invention includes: a carbon dioxide liquefaction unit which liquefies carbon dioxide separated and recovered from a gas containing carbon dioxide, by performing heat exchange with a portion of a cold heat source in a gaseous state, which is used and manufactured in a cold heat source production plant, as a refrigerant; and an energy recovery unit which expands a gaseous refrigerant having performed heat exchange with the carbon dioxide in the carbon dioxide liquefaction unit, thereby extracting energy and at the same time, lowering a temperature of the gaseous refrigerant, wherein the energy recovery unit returns the gaseous refrigerant having a lowered temperature to the cold heat source production plant.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> In a second aspect of the carbon dioxide liquefaction device according to the present invention, the energy recovery unit in the first aspect may lower the temperature of the gaseous refrigerant to a temperature needed in order to use the gaseous refrigerant in the cold heat source production plant.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In a third aspect of the carbon dioxide liquefaction device according to the present invention, the cold heat source production plant in the first or second aspect may be provided with an air cryogenic separation unit which can separate raw material air into at least oxygen and nitrogen.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In a fourth aspect of the carbon dioxide liquefaction device according to the present invention, the air cryogenic separation unit in the third aspect may be provided with a heat exchange unit which performs heat exchange by using the gaseous refrigerant having a temperature lowered by the energy recovery unit.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In a fifth aspect of the carbon dioxide liquefaction device according to the present invention, in the carbon dioxide liquefaction device according to the fourth aspect, a plurality of sets of combinations of the energy recovery<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> unit and the heat exchange unit may be provided to be connected in series.</p><heading id="h0008">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to the carbon dioxide liquefaction device related to the above aspects of the present invention, it is possible to attain a reduction in power consumption.</p><heading id="h0009">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a diagram showing a schematic configuration of a carbon dioxide liquefaction device in an embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a diagram showing the configuration of the carbon dioxide liquefaction device in the embodiment.

Carbon dioxide which is supplied to the carbon dioxide liquefaction unit 2 is supplied from a carbon dioxide separation and recovery device (not shown). The carbon dioxide separation and recovery device separates and recovers the carbon dioxide from, for example, a mixed gas in which the carbon dioxide is contained.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Here, in order to obtain the carbon dioxide in a high-pressure state described above, it is necessary to compress low-pressure carbon dioxide recovered in the carbon dioxide separation and recovery device to a high-pressure state. However, in a case of trying to compress<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the carbon dioxide in a gaseous state by a compressor, thereby making the carbon dioxide be in a high-pressure state, a large amount of power is required. For this reason, in the carbon dioxide liquefaction device 1 of this embodiment, after the pressure of the low-pressure gaseous carbon dioxide recovered in the carbon dioxide separation and recovery device is increased to a carbon dioxide liquefaction pressure by a gas compressor (not shown), the carbon dioxide is liquefied by the carbon dioxide liquefaction unit 2, and thereafter, the pressure of the liquefied carbon dioxide is increased to a high-pressure state by a booster pump (not shown). Due to this, it becomes possible to increase the pressure of the carbon dioxide with less power than that increasing pressure to a high-pressure state by a gas compressor.
