This device detects acceleration components of the ground motion in three directions (vertical, east-west, and north-south), calculates an acceleration by vector-synthesizing these acceleration components, and calculates an index value indicating the intensity of<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> earthquake shaking from this acceleration, to thereby measure the intensity of earthquake shaking in real time.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In addition, presently, a device is also known that predicts the intensity of earthquake shaking at the time of initial tremor of the ground motion (Patent Document 2).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Among the above-described acceleration components of the ground motion in the three directions, the vertical acceleration component has properties of getting larger than the other acceleration components.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Thus, this device predicts the intensity of earthquake shaking by detecting the vertical acceleration component of the ground motion and calculating the index value indicating the intensity of earthquake shaking corresponding to this acceleration component.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the meantime, the inventions set forth in the above-described Patent Documents 1 and 2 have been created in Japan, and thus, a seismic intensity scale defined by the Japan Meteorological Agency is adopted as the ground motion index in the both inventions.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale is internationally used as the ground motion index, and thus, the devices set forth in the above-described Patent Documents 1 and 2 cannot be used abroad as they are.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Therefore, when the respective devices set forth in the above-described Patent Documents 1 and 2 are used abroad, it is one option to replace, as the ground motion index, the seismic intensity scale defined by the Japan Meteorological Agency with the MMI scale. However, the MMI scale is a ground motion index determined<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> on the basis of human bodily sensation or investigations of the damage situation after the earthquake, and thus, the MMI scale is hardly suited to instrumental measurement, and such replacement is not easy.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Nevertheless, some proposals for using the MMI scale in instrumental measurement have been made.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">For example, Wald et al. have proposed a method for estimating the index value on the MMI scale from the acceleration or the velocity of the ground motion (Non-patent Document 1) and, in Japan too, Nakamura has proposed a method for actually measuring the intensity of earthquake shaking using the MMI scale as the ground motion index (Non-patent Document 2).</p><heading id="h0003">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT DOCUMENTS</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: Publication of <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP4472769B"><text>Japanese Patent No. 4472769</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2009068899A"><text>Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2009-068899</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">NON-PATENT DOCUMENTS</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><ul><li>Non-patent Document 1: "<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Relationships between Peak Ground Acceleration, Peak Ground Velocity, and Modified Mercalli Intensity in California" David J.

However, whether such a prediction is possible is uncertain.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Thus, in an earthquake prediction device according to one aspect of the present invention, the MMI scale is used as the ground motion index, and the intensity of earthquake shaking is predicted early at the time of initial tremor of the ground motion, taking velocity of the ground motion into consideration.</p><heading id="h0008">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">An earthquake prediction device according to a first aspect of the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> present invention comprises a vertical acceleration acquisition unit (10, S10), a vertical velocity calculation unit (12, S14), and a predicted value calculation unit (16, S14).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The vertical acceleration acquisition unit (10, S10) sequentially acquires vertical acceleration information indicating a vertical acceleration component of a ground motion from a sensor that detects the ground motion, when the sensor starts detecting the ground motion.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The vertical velocity calculation unit (12, S14) sequentially calculates vertical velocity component of the ground motion from the vertical acceleration information acquired by the vertical acceleration acquisition unit.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The predicted value calculation unit (16, S14) calculates a predicted value (MMIvp) indicating an intensity of earthquake shaking by an index value on the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale, using a maximum absolute value among absolute values of the velocity component sequentially calculated by the vertical velocity calculation unit as a maximum velocity value (Vumax), using a prediction formula below.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The prediction formula is: MMIvp=αvlog<sub>10</sub>(Vumax)+βv.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the formula, αv and βv are regression coefficients calculated in advance by regression analysis using a maximum absolute value among absolute values of vertical velocity component of the ground motion of each of a plurality of earthquakes that occurred in the past as an explanatory variable (X) and using an index value indicating each intensity of earthquake shaking on the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale as a dependent variable (Y).<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">For example, when the regression analysis is performed using the K-NET as a database in which the earthquakes that occurred in the past are recorded (see <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>), Y=3.67log<sub>10</sub>X+3.72 is obtained. Thus, in the above prediction formula, αv may be set at 3.67, and βv may be set at 3.72.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to a proposal in Non-patent Document 1 by Wald et al., when a maximum absolute value among absolute values of velocity of the ground motion is referred to as Vmax, a calculated value (MMIv) indicating an intensity of the earthquake shaking on the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale can be obtained by using a calculation formula below.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The calculation formula: MMIv=αlog<sub>10</sub>(Vmax)+β</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In this calculation formula, α is 3.47, and β is 2.35.<br/>
When the predicted value (MMIvp) and the calculated value (MMIv) respectively derived from the prediction formula and the calculation formula are compared with each other, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5B</figref>, it has been found that, at the time of initial tremor of the earthquake, the predicted value (MMIvp) increases earlier than the calculated value (MMIv).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Accordingly, with the earthquake prediction device of the present invention, the intensity of earthquake shaking can be predicted early at the time of initial tremor of the earthquake by using the MMI scale as the ground motion index.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Moreover, the earthquake prediction device of the present invention predicts the intensity of the earthquake shaking taking velocity of<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the ground motion into consideration.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Thus, the earthquake prediction device of the present invention is most suitable as a device for predicting a ground motion in the railway or the like having a lot of earth structures such as embankments, for example.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Accordingly, the earthquake prediction device of the present invention enables reduction of accidents, such as a rollover of a train due to collapse of embankments or the like, by stopping the train early using an automatic train stop device at occurrence of an earthquake.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Furthermore, in the earthquake prediction device of the present invention, prediction of an earthquake that is easy to understand globally is possible because the MMI scale is used as the ground motion index.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Next, in the earthquake prediction device according to a second aspect of the present invention, in addition to the configuration of the earthquake prediction device according to the first aspect, an adjustment factor setting unit (22) that adjusts an adjustment factor (γv) may be provided, and a prediction formula below, in which the adjustment factor (γv) is added, may be used as a prediction formula.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The prediction formula is: MMIvp=αvlog<sub>10</sub>(Vumax)+βv+γv.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">When the intensity of earthquake shaking is predicted and a warning thereabout is issued using the earthquake prediction device of the present invention, following two demands from users are expected,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> for example.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">One demand expected is that a warning be issued in every case when occurrence of an earthquake causing a destructive shaking that requires caution is predicted even if there are some cases in which the prediction turns out to be incorrect, regardless of whether an earthquake causing a destructive shaking that requires caution is actually occurring. In this case, increase in the warning success rate is desired.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The other demand expected is that a warning not be issued when an earthquake causing a destructive shaking that requires caution is not occurring even if there are some cases in which no warning is issued when an earthquake causing a destructive shaking that requires caution is occurring. In this case, decrease in a cry-wolf false warning rate is desired. Here, a cry-wolf false warning means a too sensitive warning issued for a minor shaking.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Thus, in the earthquake prediction device of the present invention, the predicted value (MMIvp) to be calculated is adjusted by adding γv in the prediction formula, and the above two demands can thereby be met.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">For example, when a warning reference value is set at level 5.5 on the MMI scale and γv is set at -1, the cry-wolf false warning rate is closer to 0%, and in contrast, when γv is set at 1, the warning success rate is closer to 100%, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">That is, when γv is set at 1, when occurrence of an earthquake causing a destructive shaking that requires caution is predicted, a warning is issued without exception regardless of whether the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> earthquake causing a destructive shaking that requires caution is actually occurring.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">On the other hand, when γv is set at -1, there are some cases in which no warning is issued when an earthquake causing a destructive shaking that requires caution is occurring, whereas no case arises in which a warning is issued when an earthquake causing a destructive shaking that requires caution is not occurring.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Consequently, with the earthquake prediction device of the present invention, a prediction that meets the users' demands is enabled in addition to the effects of the earthquake prediction device according to the first aspect.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Next, in the earthquake prediction device according to a third aspect of the present invention, a warning unit (18, S22-S24) may be provided that compares the predicted value (MMIvp) calculated by the predicted value calculation unit and the warning reference value set in advance with each other and issues a warning when the predicted value (MMIvp) is larger than the warning reference value.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In this earthquake prediction device, the warning is issued only when the predicted value (MMIvp) is larger than the warning reference value set in advance, and thus, a useless warning issued when an earthquake that does not require a warning is occurring can be inhibited.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In the earthquake prediction device according to a fourth aspect of the present invention, an earthquake occurrence determination unit (20) that determines occurrence of an earthquake by presence/absence of the ground motion may be provided, and the warning<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> unit may issue the warning when the earthquake occurrence determination unit determines that the earthquake is occurring.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">For

In this case, decrease in the cry-wolf false warning rate is desired.</p><p id="p0142" num="0142">Thus, in the earthquake prediction device 1 of the present embodiment, the predicted value (MMIvp) to be calculated is adjusted by adding γv in the prediction formula, and the above two demands can thereby be met.</p><p id="p0143" num="0143">For example, when the warning reference value is set at level 5.5 on the MMI scale and γv is set at -1, the cry-wolf false warning rate is closer to 0%, and in contrast, when γv is set at 1, the warning success rate is closer to 100%, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>.</p><p id="p0144" num="0144">That is, when γv is set at 1, if occurrence of an earthquake that requires caution is predicted, a warning is issued without exception regardless of whether the earthquake that requires caution is actually occurring.</p><p id="p0145" num="0145">On the other hand, when γv is set at -1, there are some cases in which no warning is issued when an earthquake that requires caution is occurring, whereas no case arises in which a warning is issued when an earthquake that requires caution is not occurring.</p><p id="p0146" num="0146">Consequently, the earthquake prediction device 1 of the present embodiment enables a prediction that meets the users' demands.<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --></p><heading id="h0021">(Correspondence Relationships)</heading><p id="p0147" num="0147">The information relating to the vertical acceleration component of the ground motion indicated by the analog signal outputted from the vertical acceleration sensor 30 of the above embodiment corresponds to one example of vertical acceleration information of the present invention.</p><p id="p0148" num="0148">The process executed by the acceleration acquisition unit 10 in the process of S10 in the above embodiment corresponds to one example of a vertical acceleration acquisition unit set forth in the claims.</p><p id="p0149" num="0149">The process executed by the vertical velocity calculation unit 12 in the process of S14 in the above embodiment corresponds to one example of a vertical velocity calculation unit set forth in the claims.</p><p id="p0150" num="0150">The process executed by the predicted value calculation unit 16 in the process of S14 in the above embodiment corresponds to one example of a predicted value calculation unit set forth in the claims.

If it is determined that an earthquake is occurring (S25: YES), a process for issuing a second warning, which is different from the early warning of the above embodiment,<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> is executed in S26.</p><p id="p0159" num="0159">The functions 10 to 26 of the respective units constituting the earthquake prediction device 1 of the present embodiment can be fulfilled by a computer to which the acceleration sensor device 3 and the external warning device 5 are connected by using a program stored in the ROM 1a.
