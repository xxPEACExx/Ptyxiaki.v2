As a result, a problem arises in that the temperature of air blowing into a vehicle interior rises and the comfortability is degraded. In order to solve this problem, there is disclosed a heat storing heat exchanger that includes a heat medium passage which causes a heat medium to flow therethrough and a heat storage material chamber which receives a heat storage material therein are integrated by a double tube structure, and a passage of a fluid which exchanges heat with the heat medium is formed outside the tube of the double tube structure (for example, see Patent Literature 1). In the heat exchanger disclosed in Patent Literature 1, a cold storage material is cooled in advance by the cooling capability of an evaporator during the operation of an engine and a compressor, and the cooling capability of air is maintained by the latent heat of the cold storage material<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> during the stop of the engine, thereby suppressing degradation in cooling feeling. Further, in Patent Literature 1, paraffin having a melting point of about 6°C is exemplified as a cold storage material. Then, a change in phase of the cold storage material is used.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">There is disclosed a heat exchanger including a tube structure including a plurality of tubes which circulates the heat transfer fluid and a reservoir for a heat storage material contacting the tubes so that heat is exchanged between the heat storage material and the heat transfer fluid, and the tube structure improves the heat exchange efficiency between the heat storage material and the heat transfer fluid, the cooling efficiency for an outer fin by the heat transfer fluid, and the cooling efficiency for the outer fin by the heat storage material (for example, see Patent Literature 2).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Incidentally, there is disclosed a technique of a heat exchanger used for a cooling operation and a warming operation by employing a structure of changing a cooling medium flow direction for a cooling/dehumidifying operation and a cooling medium flow direction for a warming operation (for example, see Patent Literature 3).</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005"><ul><li>Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2000205777A"><text>JP-A) No. 2000-205777</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Literature 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2008522133A"><text>Japanese Patent Application National Publication (Laid-Open) No. 2008-522133</text></patcit> (for example, <figref idrefs="f0020">Fig. 20</figref>)<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></li><li>Patent Literature 3: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (<patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2000343923A"><text>JP-A) No. 2000-343923</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Since the heat storing heat exchanger disclosed in Patent Literature 1 has a structure in which the heat medium passage is surrounded by the cold storage material chamber, a problem arises in that the outer fin is not efficiently cooled by the cooling medium. Further, since the tube structure disclosed in Patent Literature 2 is used, a cooling operation may be efficiently performed. However, although the heat storage material is provided in both Patent Literature 1 and Patent Literature 2, an appropriate amount of the heat storage material and a heat storage material adjustment unit are not disclosed. For this reason, for example, when the heat storage material is charged too much, a problem arises in that the warming operation and the cooling operation are not immediately performed and the weight and the cost increase.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Further, Patent Literature 1 discloses the heat exchanger that uses a change in phase of the heat storage material, but only one heat storage material is used. If only one heat storage material is used, a problem arises in that a heat storage effect obtained by a latent heat may not be exhibited in the cooling operation or the warming operation even when a structure of using the heat storage material is employed in the heat exchanger used for both the cooling operation and the warming operation as shown in, for example, Patent Literature 3.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> An object of the invention is to provide a method of easily producing a heat exchanger which charges a heat storage material into a part of charging spaces or a heat exchanger which charges different kinds of heat storage materials thereinto.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">In a production method for a heat exchanger according to the invention, the heat exchanger includes a laminated body obtained by alternately laminating tubes and outer fins, each tube has a structure in which a first closing plate and a second closing plate are stuck to each other or a structure in which at least one intermediate plate is sandwiched between the first closing plate and the second closing plate, one tank portion is provided at one end portion of the tube in the longitudinal direction, the other tank portion is provided at the other end portion of the tube in the longitudinal direction, the tube includes a cooling medium passage communicating with the one tank portion and the other tank portion, two or more tubes include a storage portion capable of storing a heat storage material and not communicating with the cooling medium passage, the production method for the heat exchanger for a vehicle air condition, comprising: a charging space forming step of laminating the tubes with the outer fins interposed therebetween so as to form a plurality of charging spaces including the storage portion and not communicating with each other; and a charging step of charging a heat storage material into at least one of the charging spaces.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the production method for the heat exchanger according to the invention, it is preferable that the charging step includes a releasing step of decreasing the pressure of the charging spaces, and a step of charging the heat storage material into the charging spaces of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> which the pressure becomes a negative pressure by the releasing step.

The heat storage material is called a cold storage material when the keeping temperature is equal to or lower than a room temperature or is generally called a heat storage/cold storage material. The heat storage material of the invention includes the cold storage material and the heat storage/cold storage material. The heat storage material is, for example, a sensible heat storage material which uses specific heat, a latent heat storage material which uses a change in phase such as melting and freezing, or a chemical heat storage material which uses absorbing and generating of heat caused by a chemical reaction. Among these, it is preferable to use the latent heat storage<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> material in that the amount of heat generated per unit mass is larger than that of the sensible heat storage material and the chemical stability is higher than that of the chemical heat storage material. The latent heat storage material is, for example, paraffin. The paraffin is a material containing a chain state hydrocarbon compound of which a general formula is C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub> or a cyclic hydrocarbon compound of which a general formula is C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub> (here, n ≥ 3). In the embodiment, since the chemical stability of the paraffin is higher, it is preferable that the paraffin mainly contains a chain state hydrocarbon compound. The melting point (the freezing point) of the paraffin is different depending on the carbon number (the number of n in the general formula) or the carbon chain structure having a straight shape, a branched shape, or a ring shape. For this reason, it is possible to arbitrarily select paraffin having a phase change temperature in response to a target holding temperature. As a structure of disposing the heat storage materials having different phase change temperature values in the charging spaces, for example, a heat exchanger capable of conducting both a cooling operation and a warming operation may be realized by the combination of the low melting point paraffin (for example, the melting point: 3 to 10°C) and the high melting point paraffin (for example, the melting point: 77 to 85°C) having a melting point higher than the low melting point paraffin.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089"><figref idrefs="f0024">Figs. 29(A) and 29(B)</figref> are diagrams to describe an example of a structure without the intermediate plate among the modified examples of the first tube.
