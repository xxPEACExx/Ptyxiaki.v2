The system 200 is used to collect and/or analyze particles from a particle producing device 202.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Particle producing device 202 is any device the produces, generates, or otherwise is a source of a particle or particles 204 of interest. For example, in some implementations, particle producing device 202 is a manufacturing tool (e.g., a saw, a milling machine , a drill, a multi-axis machine tool, a machining center, a portable drilling system, a grinding center, etc.) that cuts, drills, mills, routs, shapes, grinds, machines, etc. a work piece. The process performed by particle producing device 202 removes some of the material of which the work piece is made creating particles 204 (e.g., dust). In other implementations, particle producing device 202 is any other device that produces particles 204 that may be collected and/or analyzed. Particles 204 may be a byproduct of the process performed by particle producing device 202 or may themselves be the end product of the process performed by particle producing device 202. System 200 specifically collects particles from a particle generating source (not shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>) of particle producing device 202. For example, if particle producing device 202 is a saw, the particle generation source is the saw blade. The location of particle generation (also referred to as the particle production location) is the location of the particle source on/in the particle producing device 202.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">System 200 includes an enclosure 206 attached to particle producing device 202. In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, enclosure 206 substantially surrounds particle producing device 202. In other implementations, enclosure 206 substantially surrounds the location of particle generation by, for example, surrounding the particle source or a volume of space surrounding the particle source. The enclosure 206 may substantially surround the location of particle generation by itself, or cooperatively with one or more portions of particle producing device 202, another structure (such as a wall or floor), or another device. For example, enclosure 206 and a table (not shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) of particle producing device 202 may cooperatively define a substantially sealed volume enclosing the particle source.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Enclosure 206 may be made of any suitable material for substantially enclosing a volume around the location of particle generation. For example, enclosure 206 may be made of wood, metal plastic, rubber, glass, fiberglass, acrylic materials, laminated materials, etc. Moreover, enclosure 206 may be made of a combination of materials. For example, a portion of enclosure 206 may be made of a rigid or semi-rigid material, while another portion of enclosure 206 is made of a flexible material. In particular, some implementations include a flexible portion in the enclosure to permit the enclosure to move with a moving component of particle producing device 202, such as a cutter head, an X-Y table, etc. The flexible portion may be specifically configured for the type of machine being studied. For example, a different configuration may be used for a two dimensional device with a fixed cutter and a moving work piece table that would be used for a drill press with a bit (cutter) that moves relative to a fixed work piece. Moreover, the amount of movement of a work piece, cutter, or other components of particle producing device 202 may affect the desired configuration of enclosure 206.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Enclosure 206 includes an inlet 208 and an outlet 210. Outlet 210 includes a nozzle (not shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>) for extracting particles 204 from enclosure 206. In the exemplary implementation, the nozzle is a flexible, anti-static nozzle that is positioned close to the particle source to provide efficient particle removal. Any suitable type of nozzle, including a nozzle integral to particle producing device 202 may be used. Other implementations do not include a nozzle. Particle counters or "sniffers" (not shown) can be used to verify the efficiency of capture through the nozzle. Inlet 208 is coupled to a filter 212 to supply filtered air into a volume 207 (only two dimensions of which are shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>) defined, at least in part by enclosure 206. In the exemplary implementation, filter 212 is a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. In other implementations, filter 212 may be any other suitable filter for providing filtered air to enclosure 206. A blower 214 is coupled in flow communication with inlet 208 via filter 212 to provide the filtered air to enclosure 206. In the exemplary implementation, blower 214 is a blower output of a vacuum device, such as a shop vacuum. Alternatively, blower 214 may be a dedicated blower or any other device suitable for providing a stream of air into the volume 207 defined by enclosure 206. In some implementations, blower 214 also includes a built in filter, which can be a HEPA filter or any other suitable type of filter, configured and coupled to filter the air exhausted by blower 214.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">A vacuum source 216 is coupled in flow communication with the outlet 210 to extract air and particles 204 from inside enclosure 206 to generate a stream (e.g., an aerosol stream or flow of air and/or particles 204) from enclosure 206 to vacuum source 216. In the exemplary implementation, vacuum source 216 is a vacuum, such as a shop vacuum. Alternatively, vacuum source may be any other suitable source of vacuum and/or airflow. In some implementations, vacuum source, 216 also includes a filter, which may be a HEPA filter or any other suitable type of filter, configured and coupled to filter its exhaust air.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A sampling tower 218 is coupled between vacuum source 216 and outlet 210 such that the stream from enclosure 206 to vacuum source 216 passes through sampling tower 218. Sampling tower 218 is made of a conductive pipe or tube (e.g. aluminum) having a circular cross section of a known constant diameter, such as between 4 and 10 inches. In other implementations, sampling tower 218 may have any other suitable diameter, whether larger or smaller, and/or may be made from any other suitable material. Moreover, in some implementations, sampling tower 218 has a cross-section that is not circular. Sampling tower 218 is vertically oriented to facilitate movement of larger particles (sometimes referred to as "boulders"), e.g. greater than about 50 micrometers, to vacuum source 216 by gravity. In other implementations, sampling tower 218 is horizontally oriented.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Sampling tower 218 includes a nozzle 220 that extends into sampling tower 218 to permit sampling of the stream from enclosure 206 to vacuum source 216. Although a single nozzle 220 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, system 200 may include any suitable number of nozzles 220. In the exemplary implementation, nozzle 220 is an isokinetic nozzle. In other implementations, sampling tower 218 includes any other suitable type of nozzle. Nozzle 220 is positioned generally centered within sampling tower 218 and parallel with the flow direction of the stream from enclosure 206 to vacuum source 216, so that air and particles 204 in the stream may enter nozzle 220. In some implementations, sampling tower 218 includes one or more additional sensors or detectors, such as pitot tubes, differential pressure sensors, anemometers, etc.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Nozzle 220 is coupled to a detection system 222. The detection system 222 includes a detection instrument and/or a computing device (neither separately shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>). The detection instrument is any suitable detection instrument for use with nozzle<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> 220, such as a cascade impactor, a particle counter, a mass concentration monitor, a single stage impactor, etc. The computing device may be, for example, computing device 100, or any other suitable computing device. Detection system 222 detects at least one characteristic of the stream and/or particles 204 within the stream. The detected characteristics can include concentration of particles 204 in the stream, sizes of particles 204, numbers of particles, concentrations of different size particles, masses of particles 204, composition of particles 204, etc.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">To satisfy isokinetic sampling conditions, the velocity at nozzle 220 should equal the velocity in the sampling tower 218. This may be achieved in system 200 by measuring the velocity in tower 218 using pitot tubes or an equivalent method and selecting the correct diameter nozzle 220 determined by the flow rate of the detection instrument, generally between .7 and 28 lpm. In some embodiments, the flow rate (velocity) through the sampling tower 218 or the detection instrument is adjusted to achieve the required velocity in nozzle 220 for isokinetic sampling conditions.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The length 221 of sampling tower 218 is determined to facilitate isokinetic sampling conditions based on the required ratios of the nozzles 220 and/or the requirements of other sensors/detectors included in sampling tower 218. For example, for a pitot tube, it is suggested that sampling tower 218 have a length upstream of the pitot tube that is 8.5 times the diameter of the tower 218 and a length downstream that is at least 1.5 times the diameter of the tower 218. Thus, for a 4 inch diameter sampling tower 218, the minimum length 221 of sampling tower (based only on a pitot tube) is 40 inches.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Nozzles 220 permit, in conjunction with detection system 222, for direct reading, real-time monitoring of the characteristics of the stream from enclosure 206 to vacuum source 216 and/or particles 204. Additionally, nozzles 220 and detection system 222 may be used for later monitoring of characteristics the stream and particles 204. For example, collected data may be transferred to a computing device 100 for subsequent review or analysis. Moreover, some detection instruments may produce data that requires subsequent analysis or interaction (which may not be accomplished in real time) to produce data describing the characteristic being monitored by the detection instrument. The output of the analysis, e.g., the output of detection system 222, may include a normalized particle count distribution graph, a total counts and concentration graph, mass of collected material per filter (when multiple filters are used), a normalized particle mass<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> distribution chart, an indoor air quality analysis, a particle size probability chart, and/or any other suitable analysis result.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Vacuum source 216, sampling tower 218, and outlet 210 are coupled together in flow communication by ducts 224. The exemplary ducts 224 are flexible, antistatic or conductive, vacuum hose. Conductive or anti-static vacuum ducts limit the likelihood of particles sticking to the walls of duct 224. Alternatively, any other suitable ducting may be used to guide the stream from enclosure 206 to vacuum source 216 via sampling tower 218.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In general, system 200 operates by capturing particles 204 using vacuum. Outlet 210 is configured to provide sufficient suction for representative operations to attempt to ensure that all or most particles 204 are collected. Enclosure 206 is positioned around the particle source and lightly pressurized with HEPA filtered purge air from blower 214 via filter 212. The filtered air maintains a purge in enclosure 206 to isolate outside contaminants so that only the generated particles 204 of interest are captured and subsequently analyzed. In some implementations, the air delivered into enclosure 206 is diffused, such as via a diffuser, so it does not interfere with particle extraction. The flow into enclosure 206 from blower 214 is approximately equal to the flow out of enclosure 206 to vacuum source 216 for balance. In implementations in which enclosure 206 includes a flexible portion, balancing the purge air and the vacuum flow rates facilitates maintaining enclosure 206 lightly inflated to avoid interference with operation of particle producing device 202. The generated particles 204 pass through the antistatic ducts 224 to isokinetic sampling tower 218. Some of the particles 204 in the stream are captured by nozzle 220 and provided to detection system 222, which determines at least one characteristic of the particles 204 and/or the stream.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> is a diagram of a system 300 for use in particle collection and analysis.

Machining tool 302 has a work table 304 on which a work piece 306 is mounted. A z-axis column 308 with a cutting tool 310 mounted to it is positioned above work table 304.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> Cutting tool 310 is tool for cutting work piece 306, such as a drill bit, milling bit, etc. When cutting tool 310 operates (i.e., cuts) on work piece 306 particles of the material(s) from which work piece 306 is made are generated. Thus, cutting tool 310 may be considered a particle source and the area around cutting tool 310 may be considered a particle production location 311 (also referred to sometimes as a location of particle production generation). Work table 304 moves in the X and Y directions (left-right and in-out of the page as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>) to move work piece 306 relative to the column 308 (and the cutting tool 310), which remains in a fixed position relative to the X and Y directions.

Alternatively, first portion 312 and second portion 314 may both be made from materials that are flexible. Enclosure 206 is firmly attached to machining tool 302 such that, except for inlet 208 and outlet 210, volume 207 is substantially sealed. The method of attachment and sealing may be varied to suit the particular particle producing device 202 and the particular installation desired (e.g., permanent vs. temporary/removable). For example, enclosure 206 may be mounted and or sealed to machining tool 302 using tape, glue, caulking, flexible sealant, screws/fasteners, welding, etc. The flexible second portion 314 permits the enclosure 206 to move and remain substantially sealed to machining tool 302 when column 308 and/or work table 304 move during an operation on work piece 306. The material for enclosure 206, and second portion 314 in particular, may be varied for different particle producing devices 202 with different directions of movement and amounts of movement to ensure enclosure 206 maintains a substantially sealed volume 207 around the particle production location 311. Moreover, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, enclosure 206 may be sized to completely surround the particle producing device 202, which implementations may not need any flexible second portion 314.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Outlet 210 includes an adjustable outlet nozzle 316.

Because nozzle 316 is attached to column 308, nozzle 316 will move with column 308 and will maintain a substantially fixed relationship with cutting tool 310 and particle production location 311. Thus, the particle source does not change its distance from outlet nozzle 316, which may change the efficiency of particle collection.

Moreover, the balancing valve 410 helps maintain the input flow to enclosure 206 at about the same rate as the outlet flow from enclosure 206.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5</figref> is a flow chart of a method 500 of designing a system for use in particle collection and analysis, such as systems 200, 300, and/or 400. In particular, the method 500 is described with respect to a system using sampling tower 218 and/or ducts 224 with a round cross sectional geometry. Method 500 may be used for systems with ducts and sampling towers having different geometries (e.g., square, hexagonal, etc.) with appropriate changes to the formulas used in the method.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">At 502, the minimum required vacuum capacity is determined. The minimum required vacuum capacity (e.g. HP, flow rate (cfm)) is determined by the minimum requirements to capture a satisfactory percentage of generated particles at the source. This determines the size of vacuum source needed. In some implementation, the system may already be in place and the vacuum capacity may be determined by the installed system. Particle capture efficiency can be determined by testing and the flow measured via pitot tube, anemometer, etc. An extension tube from the source may be used to provide constant flow and diameter for determining acceptable flow.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The instruments used for testing are identified at 504. Instruments are selected based on desired output, e.g. particle count distribution, particle mass distribution, etc. Some instruments have fixed flow rates for all ranges. Others may adapt to different flow rates for different analysis ranges. For example, one known portable aerosol spectrometer outputs particle size concentration and particle mass distribution and requires an air flow of 1.2 liters per minute (lpm). A known ultrafine particle counter requires an airflow of 0.7 lpm. Another known aerosol monitor measures mass concentrations of particles and requires an airflow between 1.5-8 lpm, depending on particle size range. Some known cascade impactors require a flow of 9 lpm. Given the variability on the flow requirements for different detection instruments, the particular data desired and the particular instruments to be used to acquire that data must be determined in order to determine the air flow requirements.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">At 506, the method includes determining the sampling duct (e.g. sampling tower 218) diameter. The diameter is determined based on the number of sampling probes to be used, including pitot tubes, vacuum source flow rate, and the available pipe/tube sizes for<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> the sampling tower. Depending on the instruments selected, a target velocity in the duct may be between approximately 2 and 25 lpm. Should any manufacturer have an existing isokinetic nozzle, the velocity may be targeted for that nozzle. Duct diameter is generally determined by: <maths id="math0001" num="(1)"><math display="block"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Q</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>VA</mi></mrow></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="104" he="14" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> where Q = flow rate, V = velocity, A = area, and by: <maths id="math0002" num="(2)"><math display="block"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">A</mi><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">π</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi mathvariant="normal">D</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></msup><mo>/</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">4</mn></mrow></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="85" he="7" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> where D is the duct diameter. The selected diameter also needs to be large enough that there is sufficient clearance for the nozzles/tubes in the duct.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The length of sampling tower 218 is determined at 508. The length is determined based on required, recommended, or desired ratios of upstream and downstream requirements for nozzles 220 and/or other sensors, detectors, etc. For example, pitot tubes have a minimum required ratio of upstream and downstream sections with longer sections desired for greater accuracy. The location of placement of nozzles 220 in sampling tower 218 may also affect the length of the sampling tower. As a rule of thumb, sampling nozzles 220 should not be closer to the inlet of sampling tower 218 than four times the diameter of sampling tower 218. If the system is intended to be portable, the length of sampling tower 218 should be kept as short as possible, while still meeting the requirements of the nozzles 220 and other devices, to facilitate moving the sampling tower 218 between particle producing devices.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">At 510 the diameters for nozzle holes are determined based on the instruments selected, the sampling tower diameter, and the target velocity in the sampling tower. For isokinetic conditions, nozzle diameters are calculated from equations (1) and (2) above, where V is the nozzle velocity and the velocity in the sampling tower, Q is the required flow rate of the instrument to which the nozzle will be coupled, and D is the diameter of the nozzle hole.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The nozzle tubes and nozzle tube outer diameters are determined at 512. <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref> is a view of an example nozzle 220. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>, nozzles 220 include a tube 600 and a tip 602 that is attached to the tube. For maximum flexibility and portability, nozzle tips<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> are designed to be interchangeable. This is accomplished by using a threaded nozzle tip. The diameter of the nozzle tubes are sized from the nozzle hole diameter determined at 510, the available minor and major thread diameters, and the available tubing sizes. In the exemplary implementation, for nozzles 220 (including tubes 600 and tips 602) are made of 316 stainless steel. Alternatively, nozzles 220 may be made of any suitable material. The nozzle hole (i.e., the hole in the nozzle tip) should be smaller than the minor diameter of the thread and the major diameter of the thread must fit into the nozzle tube. The nozzle tube diameter should be kept as small as possible to limit interference with the particles in the sampling tower.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The arrangement of nozzles 220 within sampling tower 218 is determined at 514. <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7</figref> is a cross sectional view of sampling tower 218 taken along the line A-A shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>. Nozzles 220 and pitot tube 330 are arranged in sampling tower 218 staggered around the circumference of the sampling tower 218 to avoid interference to particle flow. Nozzles 220 should be arranged to permit maximum flow in sampling tower 218 and should have the tips 602 positioned as close as possible to the center 700 of the sampling tower 218. Nozzles 220 may be spaced longitudinally (e.g., along length 221 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">3</figref>) along sampling tower 218. An upstream nozzle 220 should not block a downstream nozzle 220, which can happen if they are staggered around the circumference of the sampling tower 218.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">At 516, if further optimization is desired, method 500 returns to 502 after the arrangement of nozzles 220 has been determined. When further optimization is not desired, the purge air source is selected at 518. A purge air source (e.g., blower 214) may be, for example, a blower from a shop vacuum, a dedicated blower, etc. The selected purge air source should be capable of providing at least as much air as is being withdrawn from enclosure 206 by the selected vacuum source.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">If the designed system is intended to be a portable system, the system design may need to be adjusted when the system is moved to a different device. To use the same isokinetic sampling tower 218 for a particle producing device 202 other than the particle producing device 202 for which it was designed, the velocity in the sampling tower 218 when connected to the new particle producing device 202 is calculated or measured, such as by use of pitot tubes and a differential pressure gage. Once the new sampling tower 218 velocity is known, the nozzle tips 602 on the nozzle tubes 600 can be replaced (if the<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> new velocity differs from the old velocity) with nozzle tips 602 that result in the velocity in the nozzle being equal to the new velocity in the sampling tower 218. The new tips 602 may be selected as described at 510. If the new velocity differs from the original velocity, a new purge air source may need to be selected, or the source may need to be adjusted, as described with reference to 518.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The exemplary systems and methods described herein permit quantification and characterization of substantially all of the particles produced by a particle producing device. Accurately quantifying, the size, distribution, and quantities of particles produced from manufacturing aids the study of processing techniques and health and safety. Understanding the size, count, and distribution of total particles produced can help improve efficiency of capture, optimize cutting tool design, study new material systems, and create productive and safe processes.

The systems can use a wide variety of detection/sampling instrumentation. The exemplary systems have relatively low costs and are relatively easy to setup. The use of filtered air as a purge helps limit contaminants to ensure that only particles produced by the device being studied are analyzed. Moreover, the exemplary systems can coupled to existing vacuum lines and/or existing dust extraction systems to minimize disturbance to existing systems, simplify installation, enhance system portability, and minimize costs. Through use of the methods and systems described herein, it is possible to understand and characterize particles produced from material removal processes. The knowledge about the particles produced may be useful for protecting worker health and safety, minimizing environmental impact, improving cutting tool design, improving the removal process (e.g., the order of steps, depth of cut per pass, etc.), and improving dust extraction system design. Use of the exemplary systems provides an improved understanding of material fracture under different processing conditions through particle analysis. Possible safety concerns regarding new material systems and efficiencies of new machines may be studied, and the understanding of current systems may be improved.
