The tubes are spaced to allow the circulation of coolant between them, and then the heat exchange. A condenser may be divided into passes, made of several tubes, the fluid flowing successively from one pass to the other in serpentine way thanks to baffles located in the headers. In normal way, refrigerant flows from top to bottom and the last pass is located on the condenser bottom. The last pass can be, for instance, a subcooling pass for the refrigerant.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is also known to integrate a receiver in the condenser. The receiver has several functions among which to constitute a reserve of refrigerant fluid. It is generally located on a side of the heat exchanger core along one of its headers. It collects the refrigerant fluid coming from the condensing part of the core and distributes it back to the core in the subcooling pass.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Several solutions to attach the receiver to the core and to establish a communication for the refrigerant fluid there between are known.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to a first solution, the receiver is attached to the core by brackets and the condenser comprises hoses between the receiver and the header it is attached to. Thanks to such solution the receiver can be positioned according to a great variety of packaging constraints. Nevertheless, it requires many assembling operations leading to long cycle times and high costs.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to a second solution, the receiver can be brazed to the header together with the condenser core. The assembling costs are hence decreased but such solution generates other difficulties linked to brazing complexity.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to a third solution, the header is provided with a socket or flange which is brazed thereto and the receiver is attached to such flange. The flange further integrates channels establishing a communication between the core and the receiver for the fluid refrigerant. Such solution is an interesting compromise between the first and second solutions presented above.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Nevertheless, the receivers proposed today in that view remains rather heavy, especially as regards the bottom part of the receiver which is used to attach it to the flange.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The invention aims to overcome such drawbacks and proposes a receiver for a heat exchanger, especially a condenser of a refrigerant system, said receiver comprising a hollow body and a closure closing said body, said body defining an internal volume configured to receive a fluid flowing through said heat exchanger, said closure being adapted to establish a communication of said fluid between said internal volume and a flange of said heat exchanger, said closure being removable from said flange and detachably coupled to said body.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">By providing a detachable closure to said receiver body, the receiver design is simplified. In deed, because such part does not need any more to resist to the mounting operations used in the prior art, like clinching, to assemble the bottom part of the receiver to its body, it is not necessary to have components provided with a massive design. Moreover, by having a less massive component, more design flexibility can be given to the closure, especially as weight and/or assembling operations direction are concerned.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to further features of the invention which can be used together or separately:

The heat exchanger comprises a core 2 which is configured to enable a heat exchange between a first fluid flowing in said core 2 and a second fluid flowing through said core 2. The core 2 is here made of a plurality of parallel tubes 4 configured to form a circuit for the first fluid, and which are spaced between them to allow the flow of the second fluid. Said tubes 4 are held at their both ends by manifolds 6, 8 in which the first fluid coming from or going into the tubes 4 flows.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The tubes 4 are made for instance of aluminum and/or aluminum alloy. They are advantageously flat tubes having two opposite parallel flat faces laterally linked<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> by radius. The tubes 4 can be multi-channel tubes. They are for instance extruded tubes. In another embodiment they are folded tubes internally equipped with an internal fin separating the channels. External fins, not shown, can be provided between the tubes 4 to enhance heat exchange with the second fluid.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The manifolds 6, 8 can comprise a collecting plate and a cover, not detailed on the drawings. The collecting plate comprises slits in which the extremities of the tubes are inserted. The cover closes the volume of the manifold 6, 8 in which the first fluid flows, together with baffles located at each of their longitudinal ends.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In case of applications as condenser, the first fluid flowing in the tubes is a refrigerant and the second fluid flowing between them is ambient air. According to another embodiment, the second fluid can be a coolant, such as a fluid including water. The condenser transforms the gas coming from a compressor into liquid along the circuit.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The core may be obtained by brazing which consists in heating up a preassembly of the heat exchanger components, to a molten temperature of a provision metal. The components fixation is fulfilled by capillarity diffusion on the components surface of the provision metal.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The heat exchanger according to the invention further comprises a receiver 10. Said receiver 10 is in fluid communication with said core 2 through a flange or socket 12, as far as the first fluid is concerned. The receiver 10 advantageously defines a reserve of first fluid. It can also be configured to remove moisture and/or impurities from the first fluid. In case of applications as condenser it can improves condensing efficiency through gas-liquid separation.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The receiver 10 is here located along a first 6 of said headers 6, 8. The flange 12 extends transversally from said header 6. It is provided with one or several internal passages to establish the communication for said first fluid between the core 2 and said receiver 10. Said flange 12 is advantageously brazed to the first header 6.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The core 2 may have multiple passes to let the first fluid flowing in a serpentine way from one header 6, 8 to the other. In that view, the headers may comprise further baffles 14 located internally.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In case of applications as condenser, the core 2 may especially comprise a first zone with one or several passes, here three passes 16a, 16b, 16c, dedicated to gas/liquid transformation of the first fluid upstream the receiver 10 and a second zone with at least one pass 18 dedicated to a subcooling of the first fluid downstream the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> receiver 10. In other words, in such case, the first fluid enters the receiver 10 from said first header 6, as shown by 20 and exits the receiver 10 toward said first header 6 as shown by 22. The flange 12 is then advantageously provided with two channels, one inlet channel to let the first fluid entering the receiver 10 from said first header 6 and another channel to let the first fluid exiting the receiver 10 toward said first header 6.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The illustrated embodiments correspond to the case mentioned above.
