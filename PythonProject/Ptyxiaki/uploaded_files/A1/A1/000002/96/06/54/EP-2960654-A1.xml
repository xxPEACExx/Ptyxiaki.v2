Miscarriage occurs in about 15 to 20% of recognized pregnancies. The probability of a further miscarriage increases with the number of miscarriages. Underlying causes are often not found for recurrent miscarriages. There are some risk factors like increased maternal age or genetic abnormalities; immunological reasons, thrombophilia, infections, anatomical conditions can be further reasons.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Miscarriage is very cumbersome for the concerned parents and it is highly desirable to find causes for miscarriage and possible treatment regimes. Investigations have shown that antiphospholipid antibodies could be associated with early miscarriages and maternal mortality and it has been proposed to screen women for inherited thrombophilias including factor V Leiden, factor II (prothrombin) gene mutation and protein S.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Reasons for habitual abortion can be chromosomal causes, for example translocations, hormonal or metabolic abnormalities, like hyperprolactinaemia, thyroid dysfunction, luteal phase defect, hyperanthrogenaemia, PCO syndrome.

In a study it was determined that 15 to 30% of patients with RSA have EP3 autoantibodies.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Thus, the present invention provides a method for assessing the risk for miscarriages and habitual abortions by determining if anti-EP3 antibodies are present in the serum of a patient. In case anti-EP3 antibodies are found, prevention of abortion and treatment of such women becomes possible, for example by dosing acetylsalicylic acid and/or heparin.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">An assumption is that EP3 antibodies have an influence in the thrombotic system, in particular in the inhibition of the digestion of fibrin clots in the spiral arteria of the decidua which is counteracted by antithrombotica.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Without being bound by theory, an explanation for the link between EP3 autoantbodies and abortions could be that EP3 inhibits cAMP synthesis and has influence to the synthesis of progesteron and hCG and that the binding of EP3 autoantibodies to the EP3 receptor is a cause for abortion because of inhibition of hCG and progesteron synthesis.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">EP3 is one of the four G protein-coupled E prostanoid receptors which can bind prostaglandin E2, a member of the autacoid family of lipid mediators. Prostaglandin E2 plays a major role in the arachidonic acid metabolism, it has various functions and is expressed in renal vessels, uterine, collecting duct. From <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20110130347A1"><text>US 2011/0130347 A1</text></patcit> it was known that the activity of EP3 can be modulated to treat reproduction disorders.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As EP3 is highly expressed in tissues of the male and female reproduction system, in tissues which are involved in inflammatory processes, in cardiac tissue, in the thrombotic system and other tissues, anti-EP3 autoantibodies might be involved in other pathogenic conditions and, therefore, it is another object of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> invention, to provide an assay for detecting the presence of EP3 antibodies in samples and tissues of subjects, in particular humans as a diagnostic tool.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As EP3 has a function also outside the reproduction system, for example it is involved in the inflammatory process and with clot and plaque formation and dissolution, the determination of EP3 autoantibodies may also play a role in the diagnostic of other diseases. Therefore, according to the present invention also a method for assessing the presence of anti-EP3 activity and/or EP3 autoantibodies is provided.</p><heading id="h0001"><u>Definitions</u></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">EP3 is a receptor for human prostaglandin E2. In the present application the term "EP3" or "EP3 protein" is used for the full length protein as well as fragments having immunological property. The sequence is known and can be found in gene databases, such as GenBank.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The term "immunologically active fragment" of EP3, when used in the present application refers to fragments of EP3 that have immunological activity, i.e. are bound by EP3 antibodies, in particular EP3 autoantibodies. Fragments of EP3 are in particular those proteins or peptides comprising at least one epitope of EP3, for example sequences having at least 6, in particular at least 8, preferable at least 15 or more, preferred at least 25 contiguous amino acids that form an epitope. The epitope can be flanked on either or both sides by further amino acids of EP3 or neutral or enhancer sequences. Methods to identify and prepare immunologically active fragments of EP3 are known to the skilled artisan, for example by providing a protein or fragment having a sequence of at least 6, preferably 12 to 50 or more amino acids of human EP3 and by testing the fragment for its binding properties. A test for identifying immunologically active fragments can comprise contacting a fragment with an EP3 antibody and analyzing if binding occurs at least with the same selectivity and strength as with natural EP3.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Any EP3 that is available and has immunological properties as natural EP3 can be used for the present invention, it can be obtained from natural sources but normally is recombinant EP3 or an immunologically active fragment thereof.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Immune complex between an autoantibody and EP3 refers to any complex between autoantibodies to be detected and an epitope of EP3, which can be present on a full length protein or an immunologically active fragment thereof, such as a peptide comprising at least one EP3 epitope.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The terms "miscarriage" and "abortion" are used interchangeably in the present application. Miscarriage or abortion means the premature end of a pregnancy with fetal loss which occurs within the 20 to 24 first weeks of pregnancy. Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is usually defined as the loss of three or more consecutive pregnancies at less than 20 to 24 weeks of pregnancy.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">"EP3 autoantibody" is an antibody produced by the immune system of a subject, preferably a mammal, in particular a human being which binds to EP3.

Typically a sample as used in the present invention is any type of solution, solid or tissue to be tested, in particular a body liquid such as blood, lymph, serum, urine, liquor, cells, tissue. Particularly serum, plasma, blood, urine, renal or uterine cells are used for the detection of EP3 autoantibodies.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The terms "determination" or "detection" of the presence of EP3 autoantibodies when used in the present application include quantitative and/or qualitative methods.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The term "marker" or "label" refers to any substance that is detectable and/or measurable by physical, chemical, biochemical, or immunological means.

Many formats for such tests are available und suitable methods are well-known to the skilled person. Generally suitable is any method that allows the visualization of a complex formation. Detection can be achieved by either labelling one of the partners of the complex, such as the EP3 protein or fragment, or, by labelling another ligand, that specifically binds to one of the partners of the complex.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Labels or markers that are easily detectable are well-known and include for example radioactive labels, such as radioactive isotopes of sulfur, phosphor, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen etc.; fluorescent groups, such as fluorescein, or fluorescent proteins; chemoluminescent groups; metal colloids such as gold or silver; and enzymes such as horse radish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase or other suitable enzymes.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The binding partner - EP3 protein or a fragment thereof - can be in solution or in immobilized form, i.e. bound to a solid phase which can be a carrier, support or matrix such as the surface of a microplate or a microparticle or nanoparticle.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The immobilization is done as is known to the skilled person, usually via a binding group. Many methods for immobilization are known and available.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">For the method of the present invention, EP3 protein can be used as full-length protein. The protein is commercially available. Furthermore, it is possible to use an immunologically active fragment of EP3, i.e. a fragment, that binds with EP3 autoantibodies in a strength and a specificity that is comparable to the binding of EP3 protein with autoantibodies that can be obtained from samples. Fragments can be sequences that comprise at least one epitope of EP3.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Many formats of diagnostic methods for the determination of an antibody or an autoantigenic activity are available. Suitable methods are for example blotting methods such as dot blot or western blot, flow cytometry, or immunometric methods like sandwich methods, such as enyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) etc.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">One embodiment of the diagnostic method of the present invention comprises a dot blot method. In a dot blot method generally EP3 protein of full length or an immunologically active fragment thereof is dotted on a carrier or support, such as a membrane, for example a nitrocellulose membrane. Then, the sample obtained from the subject is added and incubated for a period that allows antibodies contained in the sample to bind to the EP3 protein or fragment on the membrane. The binding is then detected by adding a detection agent for a qualitative and/or quantitative assessment. Washing steps are usually carried out before adding the detection agent, to avoid unspecific signals.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The detectable ligand can be any substance that binds specifically with the partner of the complex to be detected, i.e. the autoantibody and has a detectable part or provides a binding site for a detectable label. In a preferred embodiment, therefore, the detectable ligand is a labelled or labelable antibody that binds to the FC part of the autoantibody. In case of a human sample, preferably the ligand is antihuman IgG and/or IgM. Fragments of such antibodies can also be used as is known in the art, for example Fv-, F<sub>ab</sub>- or F(ab')<sub>2</sub>-fragments. The detectable part of the ligand or detectable label is a label that is detectable with well-known methods as outlined above.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In a preferred embodiment a label enhancing the signal, such as an enzyme, is used, which can be coupled to the detectable ligand by a linking unit, for example a biotin-streptavidin bridge.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">When an enzyme is used, for detection, a substrate for the enzyme is added which is detectable after reaction with the enzyme. Suitable substrates for enzymes that are used in immunoassays are well-known in the art. In one preferred embodiment, alkaline phosphatase is used as enzyme and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) is used as substrate which produces a blue-purple precipitate when added. This substrate is particularly useful because it provides a very high sensitivity and has sustained light emission characteristics. In another embodiment horseradish peroxidase is used as enzyme, a suitable substrate in this case is 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB).</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The dot blot method can comprise further blocking and washing steps, as is known. Blocking agents and washing solutions and buffers are well-known in this field.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In one embodiment after having loaded the membrane with EP3 protein or fragments thereof, a blocking agent can be added to saturate reminding binding sites. Inhibitory agents for this use are very well-known in the art, casein being an example.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In a further embodiment anti EP3 activity or EP3 autoantibodies can also be detected using a Western blot method. Western blot methods are well-known in the art. This method is particularly useful for a qualitative assay. In a Western blot method, samples are loaded on a gel, EP3 or a fragment thereof is added and the formation of a complex is detected via a detectable label.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">A further method for detecting anti EP3 activity in a sample is flow cytometry. A suspension comprising particles carrying EP3 protein or fragments thereof which have been reacted with a sample such that antibodies present in the sample could bind to EP3 and wherein the formed complexes are labeled with fluorescent dyes are subjected to a flow cytometric analysis. Various immunoflurescent dyes are known for this technology and can be used in known manner. The sample suspension is fed to a tube or flow cell and when entering the flow channel, the particles pass through a focused laser beam one particle at a time. Light scatter and fluorescence light are captured and converted to electrical signals.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Furthermore, any type of immunometric assay can be used to determine the presence and amount of EP3 autoantibodies in a sample. One example is an assay wherein capture units are immobilized EP3 proteins or fragments as defined above and wherein measurable labels are preferably conjugates of anti human IgG and/or IgM or fragments thereof and enzymes as defined above.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The detection of EP3 autoantibodies can be carried out in any type of sample. For detection of a risk for miscarriage preferably the immunoassays carried out with a sample of a non-pregnant woman. This allows to carefully monitor the course of pregnancy and treatment at the necessary time, if antibodies and, thus, a risk are detected.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The method for detection of EP3 antibodies is useful for assessing the risk for any EP3 related disease. Thus, the sample can be a sample from any human being where a risk for an EP3 antibody dependent disease shall be assessed. As EP3 is involved in male and female reproduction system in general, in inflammatory processes, in clot and plaque formation and dissolution, atheriosclerotic processes, antiphospholipid syndrome etc., the determination of EP3 autoantibodies may also play a role in the diagnostic of dysfunctions or diseases in this regard. The method of the present invention, therefore, provides a valuable tool for the diagnosis of diseases related to or involved with inflammatory processes, diseases or dysfunctions of the reproduction system, diseases and dysfunctions of the thrombotic system, diseases related to or involved with atherosclerotic processes and other EP3 related conditions and pathogenicities. Therefore, according to the present invention also a method for assessing the presence of anti-EP3 activity and/or EP3 autoantibodies is provided, wherein a signal is a hint to an EP3 related disease, dysfunction or condition.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In a further embodiment the present invention provides a kit for carrying out a detection assay for EP3 antibodies in a sample. The kit comprises at least one or more EP3 proteins or fragments thereof, a conjugate comprising an antibody binding unit, such as antihuman IgG and/or antihuman IgM, and a detectable unit, such as an enzyme, and optionally buffer and/or wash solutions. In case the detectable unit comprises an enzyme, substrate for the enzyme is also included.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Furthermore, a kit for assessing a risk for miscarriage or premature birth is provided which comprises one or more EP3 proteins or immunologically active fragments thereof, a conjugate comprising an antibody binding unit and a detectable unit and optionally buffer and/or wash solutions.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Preferably the antibody binding unit used in the kits defined above is antihuman IgG and/or antihuman IgM or a fragment thereof. The detectable unit is preferably an enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase or horse radish peroxidase. If an enzyme is used as detectable unit, the kit further comprises a substrate for the enzyme that creates a detectable signal by reaction with the enzyme.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The present invention provides a method and a kit for detecting anti EP3 activity and EP3 antibodies.
