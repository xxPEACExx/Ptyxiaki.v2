measuring device and a wear measuring method. Specifically, the present invention belongs to the field of overhead wire inspection and measurement in which the wear of a trolley wire is measured by capturing an image of the width of the lower surface of the trolley wire from the roof of a train and processing this image. In particular, the present invention is characterized by obtaining a wear measurement value while taking into consideration the tilt angle of a pantograph. Note that "deviation" and "displacement" are defined as follows. Specifically, deviation refers to "in railway terminology, the position at which a pantograph comes in contact with a trolley wire or the distance thereto from the center of the pantograph" whereas displacement refers to "a general physical amount and the amount of movement from an original position."</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A current wear measuring technique will be described.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a wear measuring camera 2 installed on the roof of a train 1 captures an image of the lower surface of a trolley wire 3. The trolley wire 3 is suspended along rails 4 on which the train 1 travels, and the wear measuring camera 2 is installed at an upward angle to face the trolley wire 3 above. A pantograph 5 which comes in contact with the trolley wire 3 is installed on the roof of the train 1 as well.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As illustrated in Part (a) of <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>, the lower surface of the trolley wire 3 wears into a flat shape as a result of contact with the pantograph 5. Thus, a captured image of the lower surface of the trolley wire 3 is processed to measure the wear width, and the wear width of the trolley wire is converted into the remaining diameter of the trolley wire. In sum, conversion is done from the reflection width to the wear width to the remaining diameter. Part (a) of <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref> illustrates a cross section of the trolley wire 3 in a non-tilted state.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An accurate wear measurement value can be obtained if the lower surface of the trolley wire 3 faces straight to the camera 2 as illustrated in Part (a) of <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>, that is, if the lower surface of the trolley wire 3 is horizontal. This is obvious because, in Part (a) of <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>, illuminating light a illustrated by a vertically upward arrow is reflected at the lower surface of the trolley wire 3 and turns into reflected light b illustrated by a vertically downward arrow. In Part (a) of <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>, a broken line c in the drawing indicates a wear limit.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Meanwhile, there have been techniques to measure vibration of a vehicle (the roll angle of the vehicle) as described in Patent Documents 1, 2.

num="0083">As specifically described above based on this embodiment, the embodiment brings about an advantageous effect in which the advantageous effects of Embodiments 1 and 2 are combined. Specifically, in the conventional technique, the lower surface of a trolley wire is tilted by the upper surface of a pantograph due to the tilt angle of the whole pantograph and the tilt angle of the pantograph shape at the deviating position, and the wear width of the trolley wire appears narrower to a camera which captures an image of the worn surface of the trolley wire from immediately below, thereby causing an error in the wear measurement value. However, this embodiment brings about such an advantageous effect that this error can be corrected based on a tilt angle obtained by adding the tilt angle of the pantograph shape at the deviating position of the trolley wire to the tilt angle of the whole pantograph 5.</p><heading id="h0014">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading><p id="p0084" num="0084">The present invention is industrially widely applicable to the field of overhead wire inspection and measurement in which the wear of a trolley wire is measured by capturing an<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> image of the width of the lower surface of the trolley wire from the roof of a train and processing this image.</p><heading id="h0015">EXPLANATION OF THE REFERENCE NUMERALS</heading><p id="p0085" num="0085"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>1</dt><dd>train</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>wear measuring camera</dd><dt>2a</dt><dd>wear measuring-deviation measuring camera</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>trolley wire</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>rail</dd><dt>5, 50</dt><dd>pantograph</dd><dt>5a, 50a</dt><dd>contact strip</dd><dt>5b, 50b</dt><dd>horn</dd><dt>6, 7</dt><dd>pantograph image capturing camera</dd><dt>8, 9</dt><dd>marker</dd><dt>10, 20, 30</dt><dd>image processing unit</dd><dt>11</dt><dd>height level measuring part</dd><dt>12</dt><dd>wear measuring part</dd><dt>12a</dt><dd>wear measuring-deviation measuring part</dd><dt>13</dt><dd>processing memory</dd><dt>14</dt><dd>whole pantograph tilt angle calculating part</dd><dt>15, 17, 18</dt><dd>trolley wire wear width correction calculation part</dd><dt>16</dt><dd>deviating position pantograph shape tilt angle calculating part</dd><dt>40</dt><dd>pantograph upper surface shape storing unit</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90459681" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A wear measuring method in which an image of a lower surface of a trolley wire in contact with a pantograph is captured with a wear measuring camera installed on a roof of a train, and image processing is performed on the captured image of the lower surface of the trolley wire to measure a wear width of the trolley wire, <b>characterized in that</b> the wear measuring method comprises the step of finding an actual wear width by correcting the wear width in accordance with a tilt angle of the trolley wire tilted by an upper surface of the pantograph.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0002" num="0002"><claim-text>The wear measuring method according to claim 1, <b>characterized in that</b> a tilt angle of the whole pantograph is used as the tilt angle of the trolley wire.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0003" num="0003"><claim-text>The wear measuring method according to claim 1, <b>characterized in that</b> a tilt angle of a shape of the pantograph at a deviating position of the trolley wire is used as the tilt angle of the trolley wire.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0004" num="0004"><claim-text>The wear measuring method according to claim 1, <b>characterized in that</b> a tilt angle obtained by adding a tilt angle of a shape of the pantograph at a deviating position of the trolley wire to a tilt angle of the whole pantograph is used as the tilt angle of the trolley wire.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0005" num="0005"><claim-text>A wear measuring device in which a wear measuring camera configured to capture an image of a lower surface of a trolley wire in contact with a pantograph is installed on a roof of a<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> train, and which includes an image processing unit configured to measure a wear width of the trolley wire by performing image processing on the image of the lower surface of the trolley wire captured by the wear measuring camera, <b>characterized in that</b> the image processing unit includes a correction calculation part configured to find an actual wear width by correcting the wear width in accordance with a tilt angle of the trolley wire tilted by an upper surface of the pantograph.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0006" num="0006"><claim-text>The wear measuring device according to claim 5, <b>characterized in that</b><br/>
