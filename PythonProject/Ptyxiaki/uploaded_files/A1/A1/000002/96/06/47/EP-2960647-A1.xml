In general MS<sup>2</sup> analysis, first a target ion having a specific mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) is selected from the unknown compound to be analyzed as a precursor ion (parent ion) and the selected precursor ion is fragmented through collision induced disassociation (CID) so as to generated fragmented ions. The manner in which the ion fragments depends on the chemical structure and, therefore, the MS<sup>2</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound (information<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> on the chemical structure) can be acquired through mass spectrometry of the fragmented ions that have been generated through fragmentation.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In recent years, unknown compounds to be identified, such as of a medicine, of a pesticide or of a protein, have a large molecular weight and also have a complicated chemical structure. Therefore, in some cases, ions do not fragment into fragmented ions having a sufficiently small mass using only a one-step fragmenting operation depending on the type of the unknown compound. In such a case, the fragmenting operation is repeated a number of times and, thus, mass spectrometry is carried out on the generated fragmented ions through MS<sup>n</sup> analysis.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A pattern matching process using a data base has been carried out as an analysis process for estimating the chemical structure of the unknown compound from the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum gained through the above described MS<sup>n</sup> analysis (see Patent Document 1 and Non-Patent Document 1). The data base includes the names and the chemical structures of a great number of compounds (known compounds) and the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of these known compounds. In the pattern matching process the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of the known compounds and the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of an unknown compound are compared so as to find the respective scores indicating similarities between the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound and the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of the great number of known compounds using weighted inner products and the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> probabilities of occurrences of peaks. As a result, the unknown compounds are aligned in the descending order of scores and, thus, the person conducting the measurement identifies the unknown compound.</p><heading id="h0003">Prior Art Documents</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Document</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2005201835A"><text>Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 2005-201835</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">Non-Patent Document</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Non-Patent Document 1: <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>Stephen E.

That is to say, in MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra the peak ion intensity I, the positions of the peaks (m/z) and the existence of peaks easily change. Therefore, in the above described pattern matching process the ion intensity I may change greatly, the positions of the peaks may shift or a peak that is supposed to occur may not occur, which lowers the score. As a result, the similarities between the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> compound and the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of a great number of known compounds may not be evaluated correctly.</p><heading id="h0008">Means for Solving Problem</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">In order to solve the above described problem the present inventor examined a search method for correctly evaluating similarities between the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of an unknown compound and the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of a great number of unknown compounds. It was found that in the pattern matching process as described above, the fact is not taken into consideration that the ion intensities I of the peaks, the positions of the peaks (m/z) and the existence of peaks easily change in MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra and, thus, the scores are lower. Thus, a search method was found wherein the fact is taken into consideration that the ion intensities I of the peaks, the positions of the peaks (m/z) and the existence of peaks easily change in MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra when similarities between the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of an unknown compound and the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of a great number of known compounds are evaluated.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">That is to say, the data processing device according to the present invention is provided with: a data base storage region for storing MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of a great number of known compounds in advance; an acquisition unit for acquiring the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of an unknown compound; and a score calculation unit for finding respective scores indicating similarities between the MS<sup>n</sup> mass<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> spectrum of the unknown compound and MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of the great number of known compounds, and is further provided with: an intensity score calculation unit for classifying the peaks in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound and the peaks in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of the known compounds into intensity scores of several ranks depending on the dimensions of the ion intensities, respectively; a neutral loss calculation unit for finding a peak of the neutral loss in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound; and a position score calculation unit for finding the respective position scores indicating error in the mass-to-charge ratio for each peak on the basis of the difference between the mass-to-charge ratio of each peak that includes the peak of the above described neutral loss in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of the known compounds and the mass-to-charge ratio of the corresponding peak in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound, wherein the above described score calculation unit adds up the intensity score of each peak in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of a known compound, the intensity score of the corresponding peak in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound and the position score, and calculates as a score the sum total of the values that have been added up for all peaks.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Here, the "MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of an unknown compound" is gained when the unknown compound may be MS<sup>n</sup> analyzed, and the "MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of the known compounds" may be gained when the known compounds are<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> MS<sup>n</sup> analyzed under the same conditions for the unknown compound (ionization method, fragmentation method, and the like), or may be gained when the known compounds are MS<sup>n</sup> analyzed under conditions that are different of those for the unknown compound or may be calculated from the chemical structures of the known compounds.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the data processing device according to the present invention, first &lt;1&gt; the ion intensities I of peaks are processed as follows. Though the ion intensities I of peaks easily change, the peaks of great ion intensities I are considered to be the peaks of fragmented ions that are easily gained from the compound to be analyzed. Therefore, each peak in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound is categorized into several ranks (upper rank, middle rank, lower rank, for example) depending on the degree of the ion intensity I and, at the same time, each peak in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of the known compound is categorized into several ranks (upper rank, middle rank, lower rank, for example) depending on the degree of the ion intensity I, respectively. As a result, similar peaks can be found even when the ion intensity I differs.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In addition, whether or not a peak exists easily changes and, therefore, peaks that are in a relationship of neutral loss with each other may exist in some cases even when no peaks exist in the same position (mass-to-charge ratio) in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound and the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of the known compounds. Thus, the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> neutral loss calculation unit finds a peak of neutral loss from the position of the peak and the mass of a precursor ion for the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound. As a result, peaks can be made to correspond to each other even when a peak that is supposed to exist in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound does not occur. Here, it is assumed that the ion intensity I of the peak of neutral loss to be added in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum has the same ion intensity I as of the original peak.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Next, &lt;2&gt; the position of a peak (m/z) is processed as follows. The positions of peaks in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound shift to a certain degree. Therefore, the positions of peaks in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of a known compound are set as references, and the position score "1.0" is made to correspond to the positions of the peaks within the precision range of the mass spectrometer (-1.0 to 1.0 in the mass spectrometer, -0.005 to 0.005 in the TOF, -0.5 to 0.5 in the tandem quadrupole, for example), and the position score that gradually approaches the position score "0.0" out of the precision range is made to correspond so that a similar peak can be found even if the position of the peak differs.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As described above, the intensity score of each peak in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of a known compound, the intensity score of the corresponding peak in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound and the position score are added up so that the sum total of the value<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> that has been added up for all of the peaks is calculated as a score.</p><heading id="h0009">Effects of the Invention</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">As described above, in the data processing device according to the present invention similarities between the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of an unknown compound and the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of a great number of known compounds can be correctly evaluated even when the ion intensities I of peaks in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound and the positions of peaks (m/z) and the existence of peaks change.</p><heading id="h0010">(Other Means for Solving Problem and Effects Thereof)</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">The data processing device according to the present invention may also be provided with a peak score calculation unit for finding a peak score indicating the degree of matching on the basis of the degree of matching found from the number of matching pairs regarding the mass-to-charge ratio of each peak in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of a known compound and the mass-to-charge ratio of the corresponding peak in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound, wherein the above described score calculation unit adds the above described peak score to the above described score.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the data processing device according to the present invention &lt;3&gt; the degree of matching of a peak/neutral loss pair is process as follows. A peak score indicating the degree of matching is found from the number of pairs that have matched regarding the mass-to-charge ratios of the peaks in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of the known<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> compounds and the mass-to-charge ratios of peaks (including a peak of neutral loss) in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound ((number of matching peaks/number of peaks in MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of known compounds) × 100, for example).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In addition, in the data processing device according to the present invention, the above described intensity score calculation unit may classify each peak in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound and each peak in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of the known compounds into intensity scores of three or several ranks, respectively, depending on the ion intensity or the log value transformed from the ion intensity.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Furthermore, in the data processing device according to the present invention, the above described intensity score calculation unit classifies each peak in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound and each peak in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of the known compounds into intensity scores of several ranks, respectively, depending on the degree of the ion intensity and the value of the mass-to-charge ratio of the peak.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the data processing device according to the present invention the degree of uniqueness of a peak increases in proportion to the mass-to-charge ratio in an MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum while a peak having a large mass-to-charge ratio has a small ion intensity in some cases and, therefore, similarities between the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of an<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> unknown compound and the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of a great number of known compounds can be correctly evaluated by weighting the ion intensities in accordance with the mass-to-charge ratios (the intensity I of a certain peak is weighted as I = M × (I)<sup>1/2</sup> when the ion intensity is I and the mass-to-charge ratio is M, for example).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Moreover, in the data processing device according to the present invention the above described intensity score calculation unit may remove a peak of which the degree of ion intensity is of a threshold value or less from the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the data processing device according to the present invention, a score can be gained by focusing only on appropriate peaks and, thus, a search having a high reliability can be carried out.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In addition, in the data processing device according to the present invention the above described position score calculation unit may set the mass-to-charge ratio of a peak in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectra of the known compounds as a reference value and may, respectively, find a position score of which the value is lower as the position is further away from the reference value for each peak in the MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectrum of the unknown compound.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the data processing device according to the present invention an appropriate distribution function wherein the mass-to-charge ratio of a peak in the MSn mass spectrum of a known<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> compound is set as a reference and the value lowers as the position is farther away from the reference, an approximation function wherein the mass-to-charge ratio of a peak in the MSn mass spectrum of a known compound is set as a reference and the value attenuates to the position score "0" with an appropriate inclination, a step function wherein the mass-to-charge ratio of a peak in the MSn mass spectrum of a known compound is set as a reference and the value equals the position score within a specified range and equals the position score "0" outside of the specified range, or a combination of these may be used to, respectively, find the position score for each peak. Here, the mass-to-charge ratio of a peak in the MSn mass spectra of a known compound that is set as a reference is not necessarily a constant value but may be a variable value on the basis of the existence probability or the bonding force found through the calculation of the molecular orbital in the structural formula.
