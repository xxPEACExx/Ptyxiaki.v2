the support member is in contact with the film mirror and has a curved face which is convexed outward in a horizontal direction with respect to an opening face of the support member; and the curved face has a radius of curvature of not less than 8 mm.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Here, the "peripheral edge" of the film mirror refers to the portion supported by the support member (portion coming into contact with the support member). The width of the peripheral edge is not particularly limited because it varies depending on the width of the support member and the length of the end portion of the film mirror that is to be bonded to the support member, but, for example, in the case of a rectangular (square or oblong) film mirror, the width is preferably from about 1/2 to about 1/100 of the length of a side (the long side if oblong) of the film mirror.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The "opening face" of the support member refers to a hypothetical face that constitutes an opening portion surrounded by the frame-shaped support member.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Additionally, "outward in a horizontal direction (with respect to an opening face of the support member)" means "in the direction toward the outside of the frame that constitutes the support member."</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the reflecting mirror of the present invention having such a configuration, the heat resistance is excellent, the warpage of the film mirror is slight, and the specular reflectivity and light-collecting characteristics are good.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The above advantages are based on an absolutely new finding that, during the application of tension to the film mirror using the curved face of the support member, the relationship between the film thickness of the film mirror and the counterforce (i.e., the amount of warpage) of the film mirror also depends on the radius of curvature of the curved face, and the mechanism thereof as surmised by the present inventor is as follows.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Specifically, it is thought that the heat resistance (particularly suppression of deformation over time (of heating)) is made good by the use of a film mirror with a prescribed film thickness, and adhesion between the film mirror with a prescribed film thickness and the support member is improved and the amount of warpage of the film mirror is reduced by applying tension to the film mirror via the support member having a curved face of a specified radius of curvature, and as a result, specular reflectivity and light-collecting characteristics are also made good.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The amount of warpage of the film mirror refers to the distance (µm) between the opening face of the support member and the film mirror at a point where they are farthest from each other.
