As shown<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a DS-SS radar 10 in the embodiment of the present invention includes a code generator 21, a mixer 22, an amplifier 23, an antenna 24, a re-arranger 31, an oscillator 32, an antenna 41, an amplifier 42, a mixer 43, an LPF 44, an A/D converter 45, a correlator 46, and a re-arranger 47.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The code generator 21 continuously generates an M sequence code. The oscillator 32 generates a carrier frequency signal for carrying a signal. The mixer 22 modulates the carrier frequency signal, generated by the oscillator 32, with the M sequence code, generated by the code generator 21, for generating a sending signal. The amplifier 23 amplifies the power of the sending signal generated by the mixer 22. The antenna 24 sends the sending signal, amplified by the amplifier 23, to the outside of the DS-SS radar 10.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The antenna 41 receives the sending signal, reflected by an object external to the DS-SS radar 10, as a received signal. The amplifier 42 amplifies the power of the received signal received by the antenna 41. The mixer 43 converts the frequency of the received signal, amplified by the amplifier 42, using the carrier frequency signal generated by the oscillator 32. The LPF 44 excludes high-frequency components, included in the output of the mixer 43, to output the baseband signal.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The A/D converter 45 samples the baseband signal, extracted via the mixer 43 and the LPF 44, with the period of the width of Nsp x chip, to generate sampling data where "chip" is one element of the code. The width of one chip is the time during which the code (0 or 1) of one chip is generated. As will be described later, Nsp is an integer that is equal to or smaller than N and is a power of 2, where N is the code length of the code.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The re-arranger 31 re-arranges the M sequence code, generated by the code generator 21, at an interval of Nsp to generate the reference code that is used for the correlation processing by the correlator 46. The property of the M sequence code is that the code generated by re-arranging an M sequence code at an interval of Nsp is equal to the code generated by cyclically shifting the original M sequence code and, therefore, the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> code generated by cyclically shifting the original M sequence code may be used as the reference code for the correlation processing used by the correlator 46.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The correlator 46 calculates the correlation between the sampling data, sampled by the A/D converter 45, and the reference code for correlation processing, generated by the re-arranger 31, and outputs the correlation output data.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The re-arranger 47 re-arranges the correlation output data, output by the correlator 46, at an interval of (N + 1)/Nsp and outputs the rearranged correlation output data as the radar output.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The operation of the DS-SS radar 10 in this embodiment is described below. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the code generator 21, oscillator 32, mixer 22, amplifier 23, and antenna 24 repeatedly send the M sequence coed as the sending signal (S11).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The A/D converter 45 samples the received signal, received via the antenna 41, amplifier 42, oscillator 32, mixer 43, and LPF 44, with a period of the width of Nsp x chip where Nsp is a number equal to or smaller than the code length N and is a power of 2 (S12).</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The re-arranger 31 re-arranges the M sequence code, generated by the code generator 21, at an interval of Nsp to generate the reference code for the correlation processing. The code generated by re-arranging the M-sequence code at an interval of Nsp is equal to the code that is generated by cyclically shifting the original code. The correlator 46 calculates the correlation between the sampling data, sampled by the A/D converter 45, and the reference code for the correlation processing, generated by the re-arranger 31, and outputs the correlation output data (S13). As a result, though the list of the correlation output should be arranged in the distance order of "0" to "14" when Nsp = 4 and N = 15, the correlation output data is a list of correlation outputs re-arranged at an interval of Nsp such as that shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The re-arranger 47 re-arranges the correlation output data, output by the correlator 46, at an interval of (N + 1)/Nsp for outputting as the radar output (S14). For example, when Nsp = 4 and N = 15, the radar output in this case is a list of output, such<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> as the that shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3B</figref>, generated by re-arranging the correlation output data, shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref>, at an interval of (N + 1)/Nsp = 4. In this manner, the correlation output (=detection result), which is arranged in the order of "0" to "14", is reproduced.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In this embodiment, the DS-SS radar 10 detects an object in the following way. That is, the code generator 21, oscillator 32, and antenna 24 repeatedly send the sending signal modulated with the predetermined-frequency code generated by the code generator 21, the A/D converter 45 samples the code, included in the reflected wave of the sending signal reflected by an object, with a sampling period equal to or lower than the period of the code, and the correlator 46 calculates the correlation between the reference code, generated by re-arranging the code from the code generator 21 at an interval of Nsp, and the sampling data converted by the A/D converter 45. This processing reduces the time required to acquire all data included in the reflected wave during equivalent time sampling, allowing an object to be detected more quickly.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, a conventional DS-SS radar 1 sends the sending signal phase-modulated using the code generated by the code generator 21. The correlator 46 calculates the correlation between the received signal, reflected by an object T1, and the code used for the modulation. This calculation gives the distance r1 between the object T1 and the DS-SS radar 1 based on the time difference between the code, included in the sending signal, and the code included in the received signal. The code generator 21, which generates code having good autocorrelation characteristics, separates a plurality of objects T1 to T3, if present as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, to calculate each of the distances r1 to r3 between each of the objects T1 to T3 and the DS-SS radar 1.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">For example, for code having the code length of N = 7 and arranged in the order of the code elements "1" to "7" as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, equivalent time sampling is performed conventionally with a period of the width of (code period + width of one chip) = (N + 1) x chip = 8 x chip. This allows a code string to be restored even by low-speed sampling. However, in the conventional sampling method, sampling must be performed with a period of the width of (N + 1) x chip while repeatedly sending the code with the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> code length of N.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Therefore, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>, this sampling method requires the time with the width of (N + 1) x N x chip to acquire all data. The longer the code is, the higher the spread gain is and the higher the detection performance of the DS-SS radar is. However, in the conventional equivalent time sampling, the time for acquiring all data is increased in proportion to about the square of the code length N, meaning that, if the code length N of the code is long, the time for acquiring all data becomes extremely long.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">On the other hand, the time required for acquiring data necessary for detecting an object can be reduced in this embodiment to the time with the width of Nsp x N x chip. Moreover, in addition to reducing the time for acquiring data, the speed of an object can be detected at the same time in this embodiment. The DS-SS radar 10 detects the speed relative to an object using the phase change (frequency) in the received signal caused by the Doppler shift. In this embodiment, because the processing can be performed without re-arranging the array of acquired data until the correlation processing is performed by the correlator 46, the continuity of the phase change can be maintained and the speed of an object can be detected. In addition, sampling can be performed in this embodiment with a sampling period compatible with the performance of the A/D converter 45 that is used. This maximizes the performance of the A/D converter 45.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The code used in this embodiment is an M sequence code. This means that, by using the sampling period as a period calculated by multiplying Nsp, which is equal to or smaller than the code length and is a power of 2, by the width of one chip of the code, the sampling data, sampled with the sampling period, and the reference code, generated by re-arranging the code with the sampling period, become equal to the code generated by cyclically shifting the original code. Therefore, acquiring sampling data with such a sampling period can reduce the time required to acquire all data included in the reflected wave and, in addition, calculating the correlation between the acquired sampling data and the reference code allows an object to be detected more quickly.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In addition, the re-arranger 47 in this embodiment re-arranges the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> correlation output data, which is acquired by calculating the correlation between the reference code and the sampling data, at an interval of (N + 1)/Nsp to produce the radar output. This allows the correlation output data to be output as a list of data in the order of the distance.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The present invention is not limited to the embodiment described above, but various modifications are possible. For example, in the above embodiment, the re-arranger 21 directly re-arranges the code, actually generated by the code generator 21, for generating the reference code for the correlation processing. However, if the code length N and the sampling interval Nsp are designed as fixed values, a reference code generator 51 may be provided as shown in a DS-SS radar 11 in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>. This reference code generator 51 generates the reference code, corresponding to the data generated by re-arranging the code, which is generated by the code generator 21 and has the code length of N, at a sampling interval of Nsp, separately from the code generator 21 and the re-arranger 21. The correlator 46 can detect an object in the same manner as in the above embodiment by calculating the correlation between the reference code from the reference code generator 51 and the reflected wave.</p><heading id="h0011">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading><p id="p0039" num="0039">According to the radar and the object detection method in one embodiment of the present invention, the time required for acquiring all data included in a reflected wave can be reduced to detect an object more quickly.</p><heading id="h0012">Description of the Reference Numerals</heading><p id="p0040" num="0040"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>1</dt><dd>DS-SS radar</dd></dl><dl id="dl0002" compact="compact"><dt>10, 11</dt><dd>DS-SS radar</dd><dt>21</dt><dd>Code generator</dd><dt>22</dt><dd>Mixer</dd><dt>23</dt><dd>Amplifier<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></dd><dt>24</dt><dd>Antenna</dd><dt>31</dt><dd>Re-arranger</dd><dt>32</dt><dd>Oscillator</dd><dt>41</dt><dd>Antenna</dd><dt>42</dt><dd>Amplifier</dd><dt>43</dt><dd>Mixer</dd><dt>44</dt><dd>LPF</dd><dt>45</dt><dd>A/D converter</dd><dt>46</dt><dd>Correlator</dd><dt>47</dt><dd>Re-arranger</dd><dt>51</dt><dd>Reference code generator</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90459626" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A radar comprising:
