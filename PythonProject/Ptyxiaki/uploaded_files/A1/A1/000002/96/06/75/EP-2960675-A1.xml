INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A passive radar device implements detection and tracking of a target, such as an airplane or a ship, by using, as a transmission source, an existing radio source used for communications, broadcast, etc. without radiating a radio wave for itself, and receiving and processing a radio wave radiated from the radio source and a radio wave reflected by the target. A part, which directly reaches a receiver, of a radio wave radiated from the transmission source is called a direct wave, and a radio wave reflected by the target is called a reflected wave. The passive radar device then calculates a cross correlation between the direct wave and the reflected wave, and performs detection and tracking of the target by detecting a peak of the cross correlation. An antenna, the receiver, etc. that receive the direct wave are called a reference system, and an antenna, a receiver, etc. that receive the reflected wave are called a survey system.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The existing radio source that serves as a radiation source in the passive radar has a plurality of frequency bands in many cases, and an improvement in the detection tracking performance can be provided by performing a coherent synthesis on the frequency bands. The following patent reference 1 is provided as an example of a passive radar using a radio wave having a plurality of frequency bands.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">According to this patent reference 1, a signal having a plurality of frequency bands is received by a wide band receiver, the Doppler frequency of a received signal of a reference system is compensated for, and a correlation process with a received signal of a survey system is performed to calculate a two-dimensional cross correlation of a delay/Doppler frequency. Then, a target is detected by detecting a peak of the correlation.</p><heading id="h0003">RELATED ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent reference</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent reference 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (Translation of PCT Application) No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2005517190PCT"><text>2005-517190</text></patcit> Nonpatent reference</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Nonpatent reference 1:<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text> K.S.

Further, because the number of sample data after A/D conversion also increases, the amount of computations of the cross correlation increases.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The second problem is that because the Doppler frequency differs for each frequency band, when the Doppler frequencies of the signal having the plurality of frequency bands are simultaneously compensated for by using one Doppler frequency, the compensation cannot be performed precisely and a loss in the cross correlation process occurs.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Hereafter, the second problem will be explained.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">There is a relation, given by the following equation (1), between a bistatic Doppler speed V of the target (the sum of a target-to-transmitter direction component and a target-to-receiver direction component of a target speed) and a transmission carrier frequency. <maths id="math0001" num="(1)"><math display="block"><mrow><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>d</mi></msub><mfenced><mi>n</mi></mfenced><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mi>V</mi><mi>c</mi></mfrac><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>c</mi></msub><mfenced><mi>n</mi></mfenced></mrow></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="50" he="10" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In this equation, fd(n) denotes the Doppler frequency in the n-th frequency band, fc(n) denotes the carrier frequency of a signal in the n-th frequency band, and c denotes the speed of light.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the passive radar, in order to extend a detecting distance, a long-time cross correlation process is used generally. When a cross correlation time is expressed by T,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> a frequency resolution Δfd after the cross correlation process can be expressed by the following equation (2). <maths id="math0002" num="(2)"><math display="block"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>d</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi>T</mi></mfrac></mrow></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="36" he="10" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">For example, considering a case in which a CS broadcast signal (clockwise polarized wave) is used as the transmission source, Δfd=1Hz when T=1 second. By assuming the bistatic Doppler speed V=300 m/s, and taking into consideration fc(n)=12.291GHz+(n-1)×40MHz, it can be seen that a Doppler frequency difference occurring between the frequency bands of the CS broadcast signal is (V/c) ×40MHz=40Hz, and easily exceeds a Doppler frequency resolution of 1 Hz. More specifically, when the signal in each frequency band is simultaneously compensated for by using one Doppler frequency, the compensation is not implemented precisely and a cross correlation loss occurs.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The present invention is made in order to solve the above-mentioned problems, and it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a passive radar device that can prevent an integration loss which is caused by a difference in the Doppler frequency between a plurality of frequency bands.</p><heading id="h0007">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a passive radar device including: a survey system receiving antenna that receives a reflected wave transmitted from a radio source and reflected by a target;
