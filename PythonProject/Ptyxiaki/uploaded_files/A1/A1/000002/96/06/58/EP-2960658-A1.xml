Based on the test results, the ICs may be sorted to make them available for packaging or other applications. To do so, contactor bodies are needed that have contacting tips which contact the corresponding contact areas of an IC. Test signals are send via the contactor body and the contactor tips to the IC and response signals are received in return.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">These contactor bodies are manufactured according to the prior art by forming individual contactor elements and thereafter placing them in a socket. This has to be done with a sufficient accuracy, in particular such that the contactor tips can contact the contacting areas / contacting points of the ICs at the same time. Although each contactor element is formed such that the end portions thereof with the contacting tip have a spring characteristic within a predefined range of contact force, however, it has turned out that spread in contacting force due to minute differences of the position of the contactor tips may lead to wrong test results, specifically when abrasion of material leads to increased contact resistance such that contacting sites with relatively smaller contacting forces may fail.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">This is disadvantageous and causes problems because of dead time of the testing apparatus for cleaning purposes or for replacing the contactor bodies.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><b>Description of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The problem underlying the present invention in view of the prior art is to provide a method of manufacturing a contactor body that is more reliable and/or that has an increased operation period and a contactor body manufactured according to the method of the invention.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The above-mentioned problem is solved by the method according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The invention provides a method of manufacturing a contactor body having contact tips configured for temporarily contacting respective contact areas of a semiconductor device, in particular a die, a wafer or an integrated circuit component, the method of manufacturing the contactor body comprising the steps of stacking a plurality of semi-finished contactor elements to form a stack, wherein each of the semi-finished contactor elements is formed of an electrically conductive material; and the step of simultaneously shaping the semi-finished contactor elements in the stack to form portions of respective shaped contactor elements having the respective contact tips of the contactor body.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">This method according to the invention has the advantage that a fixed stack of semi-manufactured element is formed first, and thereafter the whole stack is finished to form at the same time the final form of the contacting elements, in particular with the regions including the contacting tips. Accordingly, the precise forming of the contact tips is performed in exactly the same way for all contactor elements. Therefore, during operation of the contactor body in a testing apparatus for testing ICs, the force, specifically the spring force, between the contact tips and the corresponding contact areas of an IC will be much more homogeneous, i.e., with a reduced variation, than according to the prior art method of manufacturing a contactor body.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The inventive method can be developed such that the step of simultaneously shaping the stacked plurality of semifinished contactor elements may comprise electrical discharge machining the stacked plurality of semifinished contactor elements simultaneously. This is a particularly efficient and exact way of shaping the semifinished contactor elements. Although the method of electrical discharge machining as such is know in the art and is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> also called synonymously as spark machining, spark eroding, wire cutting, and wire erosion, it has turned out that this method of forming the contact tips is preferable over other methods that are possible, in principle, for example Laser cutting. The latter, however, may lead to small but constantly increasing offsets of the position of the contact tips due to laser beam divergence. Electrical discharge machining such as wire cutting has the advantage that during the process of forming the contact tips no or only a very small mechanical force is applied to the semifinished contactor elements in the stack, with the consequence that displacements, twisting and stresses are avoided.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to another development, the step of stacking the plurality of semifinished contactor elements may further comprise the step of permanently fixing the stacked plurality of semifinished contactor elements, in particular by adhesion. This has the advantage that the contactor elements are already permanently fixed before the contact tips are formed, such that the whole assembly of contactor elements thereafter be easily handled without risk of accidental displacement of the individual parts.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In a further development the step of stacking the plurality of semifinished contactor elements may comprise the step of placing the plurality of semifinished contactor elements in a base body. This has the advantage that a base body that is pre-formed can be used to fix the stack of semifinished contactor elements. Specifically, the base body may be configured to fit into a testing site of a particular IC testing apparatus. Further, such base bodies including the stack of semifinished contactor elements may be manufactured and stored. The step of shaping the contact tips may be performed at later point in time and the desired characteristic of the contact tips may then be realized. These characteristics may include spring characteristics such as elastic force, the exact position of the contact tips and the range of movement of the contact tips during contacting the contact areas of the semiconductor device, in particular perpendicular to movement in the contacting direction.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to a preferred development thereof, the step of placing the plurality of semifinished contactor elements in the base body may comprise the step of placing each of the plurality of semifinished contactor elements in respective preformed reception regions of the base body. This allows for easy placing the semifinished contactor elements in the base body.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">It is moreover preferred that the preformed reception regions of the base body are spaced such that neighbouring contactor elements are not in contact with each other, in particular, wherein neighbouring preformed reception regions of the base body are spaced from each other with a constant spacing. This has the advantage that further provisions to electrically isolate the contactor elements from each other are not required.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Alternatively or additionally, the step of stacking the plurality of semifinished contactor elements may comprises the step of alternately stacking the plurality of semifinished contactor elements with spacing elements, in particular, wherein the spacing elements are formed of a material that is not electrically conductive. This isolates the contactor elements from each while being in a fixed position relative to each other in the stack.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to another development, the step of stacking the plurality of semifinished contactor elements may comprise stacking the plurality of semifinished contactor elements in electrical contact with each other, in particular in direct contact with each other. This is useful in case the semiconductor device has a relatively larger contact area that shall be contacted by the plurality of contact tips simultaneously. Further, if the contact area is not planar an electrical contact is provided with at least one or some of the plurality of contact tips.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to another development, the material of the contactor elements may provide mechanical spring characteristics to the portions of the respective shaped contactor elements having the respective contact tips. This has the advantage that possibly still remaining differences in the positions of the contact tips can be adjusted by minute deformations of the portions of the respective shaped contactor elements having the respective contact tips during contacting corresponding contact areas / contact points of an IC.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In another development each semifinished contactor element may be formed from a sheet element. This has the advantage that the contactor elements can be easily stacked due to the two plane sides of each sheet or plate-like element.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The above-mentioned problem is further contactor body according to claim 11.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Therefore, the invention further provides a contactor body having contact tips configured for temporarily contacting respective contact areas of a <u>semiconductor devices,</u> the contactor body being manufactured according to the method of the invention or according to one or more of its developments.

The invention provides a method 100 of manufacturing a contactor body 250 having contact tips 216 configured for temporarily contacting respective contact points of integrated circuit components.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In this embodiment of the method 100 according to the invention, the first step 110 is the step of stacking a plurality of semifinished contactor elements 210 to form a stack 220. Each of the semifinished contactor elements 210 is formed of an electrically conductive<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> material. For example, this material may comprise hardened CuBe. The second step 120 is the step of simultaneously shaping the semi-finished contactor elements 210 in the stack 220 to form portions 215 of respective shaped contactor elements 210 having the respective contact tips 216 of the contactor body 250.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The step 110 of stacking the plurality of semifinished contactor elements 210 according to this embodiment involves the step of placing the plurality of semifinished contactor elements 210 in a base body 230. This has the advantage that a base body 230 that is pre-formed can be used to fix the stack 220 of semifinished contactor elements 210. Specifically, the base body 230 may be configured to fit into a testing site of a particular IC testing apparatus. Further, the plurality of semifinished contactor elements 210 is preferably placed in respective preformed reception regions 235 of the base body 230.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The step 110 of simultaneously shaping the stacked plurality of semifinished contactor elements 210 is in this embodiment performed by using electrical discharge machining of the stacked plurality of semifinished contactor elements 210 simultaneously, i.e. by wire eroding, typically performed by submerging the workpiece, the stack 220 in the present case, in an insulating liquid such as oil, while an electrode and the workpiece are connected to a power supply generating a voltage between the electrode and the workpiece. When the electrode is close to the workpiece, dielectric breakdown in the liquid causes a plasma channel with sparks to be generated.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">This method has the advantage that a fixed stack 220 of semi-manufactured element 210 is formed first, and thereafter the whole stack 220 is finished to form at the same time the final form of the contacting elements 218, in particular with the regions including the contacting tips 216. Accordingly, the precise forming of the contact tips 216 is performed in exactly the same way for all contactor elements. Therefore, during operation of the contactor body 250 in a testing apparatus for testing ICs, the force, specifically the spring force, between the contact tips 216 and the corresponding contact points of an IC will be homogeneous with a reduced variation, than according to the prior art method of manufacturing a contactor body.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Moreover, the semifinished contactor elements in the stack are fixed at the same location points (e.eg. boreholes) as they are fixed in the final contactor body used for contacting<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the contact areas of the semiconductor devices. Therefore, the chain of tolerances (imprecision) during production of the contactor bodies can be shortened as compared to the prior art production method.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The embodiments describe the invention by way of example only, while the full scope of the invention is defined by the claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90459643" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Method of manufacturing a contactor body having contact tips configured for temporarily contacting respective contact areas of a semiconductor device, the method of manufacturing the contactor body comprising the steps of:
