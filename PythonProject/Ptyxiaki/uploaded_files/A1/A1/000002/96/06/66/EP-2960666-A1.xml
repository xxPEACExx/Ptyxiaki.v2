Specifically, the present invention relates to a sensor system and a method for sensing a physical quantity, in particular a magnetic field and a time dependency of a magnetic field.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Magnetic sensor systems are increasingly important in various industries. For instance in the automotive industry various sensor systems such as parking sensors, angular sensors e.g. in throttle valves, ABS (Automatic Braking System) sensors and tire pressure sensors can be found in modem vehicles for improving comfort and safety. Magnetic sensor systems are particularly important in automotive applications, because magnetic fields penetrate easily through most materials. Magnetic sensors are also highly insensitive to dirt, unlike for example optical sensors.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Several different magnetic sensor technologies are currently available, such as magneto transistors (MT), sensors based on the Hall Effect and sensors based on the magnetoresistive effect such as anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) and giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensors. The sensing principle of AMR sensor systems is based on the physical phenomenon that the electric resistance of a ferromagnetic material depends on the angle between the magnetization and the direction of the electric current within an AMR sensing element. Hall sensors and MTs, which rely on the Lorenz force, have a comparatively low sensitivity and consequently also a low accuracy.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Known ABS applications are using AMR sensor systems in order to detect a magnetic field change of an encoder wheel being mechanically connected to a vehicle wheel or vehicle tire. A typical AMR sensor system comprises a Wheatstone full-bridge configuration built with magnetoresistive sensing elements (e.g. NiFe resistor stripes). In response to detected magnetic field changes caused by a rotation of the encoder wheel a speed-pulse information can be generated. Additionally, the recognition of the rotation direction of the encoder wheel may be possible by using the spatial difference of the two half-bridges of the Wheatstone full-bridge configuration. It is mentioned that encoder<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> wheels can be realized as a magnetically passive or a magnetically active structure. A magnetically active encoder wheel comprises at least some portions with a permanent magnet. A magnetically passive encoder wheel, which is always used in connection with a biasing magnet, disturbs and/or changes the magnetic field which is generated by the biasing magnet and which is detected by the AMR sensor system. A rotating active or passive encoder wheel periodically changes the detected magnetic field.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Some known AMR sensor systems additionally have a reference bridge, which comprises resistive reference elements, which are not sensitive to an external magnetic field. However, such AMR sensor systems suffer from output signals which have only low amplitudes and which are typically very noisy.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">More sophisticated AMR sensor systems comprise two Wheatstone full-bridge configurations each being built up with at least four AMR sensing elements. However, such AMR sensor systems are suffering from an additional effort in size, current consumption and costs.</p><heading id="h0003">OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">There may be a need for providing a sensor system and a method for sensing a physical quantity, which on the one hand produce are reliable and low-noise signal output and on the other hand require low costs for production and/or operation.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">This need may be met by the subject matter according to the independent claims. Advantageous embodiments of the present invention are described by the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a sensor system for sensing a physical quantity. The sensor system comprises (a) a first sensor path comprising a first first sensing element and a second first sensing element being connected in series between a first supply terminal and a second supply terminal and a first intermediate node being provided in between the first first sensing element and the second first sensing element; (b) a second sensor path comprising a first second sensing element and a second second sensing element being connected in series between the first supply terminal and the second supply terminal and a second intermediate node being provided in between the first second sensing element and the second second sensing element; (c) a third sensor path comprising a first third sensing element and a second third sensing element being connected in series between the first supply terminal and the second supply terminal and a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> third intermediate node being provided in between the first third sensing element and the second third sensing element; and (d) a signal processing device, which is connected with the first intermediate node, the second intermediate node and the third intermediate node and which is configured for processing, based on (d1) a first electric variable being given at the first intermediate node, (d2) a second electric variable being given at the second intermediate node, and (d3) a third electric variable being given at the third intermediate node, an output signal being indicative for the sensed physical quantity.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The described sensor system is based on the idea that a sensor system comprising three half-bridges, wherein respectively one half bridge is realized by means of one of the three sensor paths, may provide some redundant measurement signals respectively information to the signal processing device, which can be used for a reliable sensing of the physical quantity, while at the same time the apparatus effort for the described sensor system is still comparatively small. Therefore, by contrast to a sensor system comprising two separate full-bridge sensor configurations, which of course also would allow for a precise and redundant measurement of the physical quantity, the effort and the costs for realizing the described sensor system is much smaller.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The redundant measurement signals, upon a suitable signal processing, can be used to obtain a plurality of pieces of information with regard to the sensed physical quantity and/or with regard to the operational state of the described sensor system. The following non-exclusive list presents some cases, which normally with prior art sensor systems would lead to wrong measurement results:
<ul><li>(A) In case of a so-called signal flipping a fault detection can be realized. Further, it may be possible to reduce the number faults, which affect the measurement quality of the described sensor system.</li><li>(B) In case of unwanted vibrations also a fault detection can be realized. In many cases the negative effects of such vibrations can be suppressed or at least reduced significantly.</li><li>(C) A fault detection can also be carried out with respect to a short circuit and/or an open circuit within the circuitry of the sensor system. Further, unwanted drifts in particular because of a lifetime fading of the sensor system can be detected. As a consequence, lifetime failures can be precluded and, if possible, a new calibration of the sensor system can be triggered.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The described fault detection can be realized in particular by comparing two output signals with each other. Thereby, one output signal may be associated with the first electric variable and the second electric variable and the second output signal may be associated with the second electric variable and the third electric variable.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The described electric variables being used as the three input signals for the signal processing device may be in particular voltage levels. The output signal may be any type of signal. Apart from a voltage or a current signal even an optical signal may be possible.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to an embodiment of the invention the sensor system further comprises a probe device, which coupleable to a moving component, the movement of which is supposed to be measured. The probe device (i) is spatially located with respect to the three sensor paths and (ii) is configured in such a manner that a movement of the probe device causes a variation in time of the three electric variables.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The probe device may be of any physical structure, which upon movement causes a variation of the physical quantity to be sensed by the described sensor system. The physical properties of the probe device depend on the type of sensing elements. This means that each sensing element must be configured in order to detect the physical quantity respectively a change of the physical quantity which is provided by (a movement of) the probe device.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The probe device may be for instance a structure, which has a spatial variation of optical properties. In this context an optical parameter may be for instance the degree of reflectivity and/or the colour of a certain portion of the probe device. As a consequence, the sensing elements must be configured for detecting (a change of) these optically properties. A person skilled in the art will know a plurality of types of sensing elements which are capable of detecting optically quantities. Thereby, it might be necessary to use an appropriate light source which may illuminate the respective portions of the probe device.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The probe device may have at least partially a linear extension. This means that in a preferred application of the described sensor system upon a movement of the moving component, to which the probe device has been mechanically connected in a direct or in an indirect manner, linear movements or changes in the spatial position of the moving component can be sensed.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Due to the above described redundancy of the three electric variables, wherein each one represents one sensing signal, missing speed pulses may be detected and/or predicted<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> by the signal processing device by means of an appropriate (redundant) signal processing. As a consequence, missing speed pulses may be virtually added. Further, also the appearance of too many speed pulses may be detected and the signal processing can be configured to suppress additional speed pulses.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to a further embodiment of the invention the probe device is an encoder wheel which is coupleable to a rotating component, the rotation of which is supposed to be measured.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The encoder wheel may be connectable to the rotating component in a direct or in an indirect manner and rotational movements or changes in the rotational position of the rotating component can be sensed. This may allow for using the described sensor system in a plurality of applications such as e.g. for ABS (Automatic Braking System) applications. A further possible application for the described system, also in the automotive field, is the detection of the rotational position and/or the rotational speed of a crank shaft in a combustion engine.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">It is mentioned, that these two (automotive) applications are also not exclusive and the described system can be used principally for measuring the rotational movement of any rotating component as long as there is enough space available for placing the sensor configuration in the vicinity of the encoder wheel, wherein the sensor configuration comprises or consists of the three sensor paths and the sensing elements being associated thereto.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to a further embodiment of the invention with respect to a predefined axis (a) the first sensor path is located at a first position, (b) the second sensor path is located at a second position, and (c) the third sensor path is located at a third position. This means that within a (cartesian) coordinate system being defined by the predefined axis and a further (perpendicular) axis all sensing elements being assigned to one and the same sensor path have the same coordinate value with respect to this predefined axis.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In case of a probe device having at least partially a linear extension and being mechanically coupled to the component moving along the moving direction this moving direction corresponds to the direction of the predefined axis. In case of a probe device being a rotatable encoder wheel the predefined axis may correspond to a tangent of the encoder wheel. This means that the rotational axis of the encoder wheel is oriented perpendicular to this predefined axis.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">It is mentioned that due to the distance along the predefined axis between the first position, the second position, and the third position, the time dependencies of the three electric variables exhibit respectively a phase difference with respect to each other. Depending on the specific application of the described sensor system this phase difference can be used for obtaining important measurement information.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to a further embodiment of the invention at least one of the sensing elements is a magnetic sensing element. This means that the described three half-bridge sensor system is a magnetic sensor system.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Preferably, the magnetic sensing element is a magnetoresistive sensing element. This may allow for obtaining magnetic field measurements in a highly precise manner. In particular, the at least one magnetoresistive sensing element may be an AMR sensing element the operation of which relies on the known anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) effect. It is mentioned that also other sensing elements may be used which rely e.g. on the known effect of giant magnetoresistance (GMR), colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and/or tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In case of measuring the rotational movement of a rotating component by means of the above described encoder wheel the encoder wheel may comprise in particular a plurality of magnetic elements or a spatially varying magnetization.
