Accordingly, there is a likelihood that jamming occurs when the detection convex portions get stuck on a tape delivery port while being ejected to the outside of a cartridge case from the tape delivery port or the light sensor falsely detects a label position due to insufficient light-shielding performance.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention has an object of providing a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> tape cartridge that smoothly delivers a tape-shaped member having detection convex portions from a tape delivery port.

Therefore, the tape-shaped member having the detection convex portions is smoothly delivered from a tape delivery port. In addition, since the detection convex portions are constituted by the backing convex portion and the non-label portion affixed to the backing convex portion, the light-shielding performance of the detection convex portions can be increased compared with a case in which the detection convex portions are constituted only by the backing convex portion. Thus, a ratio at which detection light from a light sensor is shielded by the detection convex portions can be increased. Accordingly, the detection convex portions can be prevented from being falsely detected.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In this case, the cartridge case preferably has an exposed area in which the plurality of detection convex portions is exposed one after another as the tape-shaped member is paid out by the platen roller.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to the configuration, since the cartridge case has the exposed area, the detection convex portions can be exposed in the exposed area.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In this case, the cartridge case preferably has a tape delivery port,

Therefore, even if a tensional force is applied in the length direction of the tape, for example, when the label tape 101 is wound on the tape core 121, the label tape 101 can be prevented from being torn.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">Unlike the tape cartridge 100 of the embodiment, <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 15A</figref> shows a case in which the label tape 101, where only the plurality of label portions 105 is affixed to the backing surface 107a of the backing tape 107, is accommodated in the cartridge case 104. In this case, there is a likelihood that the label portions 105 overlaps with the edge portion of the tape delivery port 124 when seen from the exit side of the tape delivery port 124 at a timing at which the spots between the label portions 105 pass through the tape delivery port 124. If the label tape 101 is paid out in this state, the label tip-ends 105a are likely to get stuck on the edge portion of the tape delivery port 124 when the label portions 105 pass through the tape delivery port 124.</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 15B</figref>, the print tape 106 has the non-label portions 120 provided on both the<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> lateral sides with respect to the plurality of annular exposed portions 154 in the width direction of the tape in the tape cartridge 100 of the embodiment. Thus, the label portions 105 are prevented from overlapping with the edge portion of the tape delivery port 124 when seen from the exit side of the tape delivery port 124 at the timing at which the spots between the label portions 105 pass through the tape delivery port 124 after the label tape 101 is paid out. Therefore, the label tip-ends 105a hardly get stuck on the edge portion of the tape delivery port 124 at the timing at which the respective label portions 105 pass through the tape delivery port 124. Accordingly, the label tape 101 having the plurality of label portions 105 is smoothly delivered from the tape delivery port 124.</p><p id="p0114" num="0114">Note that in the embodiment, the non-label portions 120 are provided on both the side of the first lateral portion 151 and the side of the second lateral portion 152 with respect to the plurality of annular exposed portions 154. However, the same effects can be obtained in a case in which the non-label portions 120 are provided on only one of the side of the first lateral portion 151 and the side of the second lateral portion 152.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">Note that when the print tape 106 does not have the annular exposed portions 154 and the non-label portions 120 are provided in contact with the label portions 105, the<!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --> upper and lower ends of the label portions 105 may run onto the inner peripheral edge portions 120a of the non-label portions 120. That is, in a case in which the shape of the label portions 105 is, for example, a circle, the label portions 105 hardly deform when a tensional force in the length direction of the tape (a force to pull the tape in the length direction) is applied to wind the label tape 101 on the tape core 121. In this regard, the non-label portions 120 expand in the length direction of the tape as a whole, and the respective inner peripheral edge portions 120a deform from a circular shape to a substantially elliptic shape long in the length direction of the tape. Therefore, the upper and lower ends of the label portions 105 run onto the inner peripheral edge portions 120a of the non-label portions 120 (see <figref idrefs="f0016">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>). In this case, ink is not satisfactorily transferred to the upper and lower ends of the label portions 105 run onto the non-label portions 120, whereby rimless printing cannot be appropriately performed. On the other hand, in the label tape 101 of the embodiment, the print tape 106 has the annular exposed portions 154. Therefore, even if a tensional force in the length direction of the tape is applied, the upper and lower ends of the label portions 105 do not run onto the inner peripheral edge portions 120a of the non-label portions 120. As a result, rimless printing<!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --> can be appropriately performed.</p><heading id="h0014">[(4) Drawing Prevention Portion 138]</heading><p id="p0116" num="0116">As described above, the tape cartridge 100 has the platen roller 103 contacting the side of the backing tape 107 of the label tape 101 and the drawing prevention portion 138 provided upstream of the platen roller 103 in the paying-out direction and contacting the side of the print tape 106 of the label tape 101. Moreover, in a conventional tape cartridge 100 in which a normal label tape 101 without a plurality of detection convex portions 109 is accommodated, a drawing prevention portion 138 has a length engaging with a top wall portion 115 of an upper casing 113 and contacts the label tape 101 over the whole tape width (see <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 17</figref>). Therefore, in the conventional tape cartridge 100, the label tape 101 is curved like an "S"-shape in a front and rear direction over the whole tape width on a feed path from the drawing prevention portion 138 to a platen roller 103 (see <figref idrefs="f0018">FIG. 18</figref>).</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">In the tape cartridge 100 in which the label tape 101 of the embodiment is accommodated, the respective detection convex portions 109 enter the light sensor 206 in a state of being curved like an "S"-shape in the front and rear direction if the drawing prevention portion 138 contacts the respective detection convex portions 109. Therefore, compared with a case in which the respective<!-- EPO <DP n="51"> --> detection convex portions 109 enter the light sensor 206 in a state of being formed into a linear shape, there is a likelihood that the respective detection convex portions 109 cannot appropriately enter the area between the light-emission element 216 and the light-reception element 217.</p><p id="p0118" num="0118">In this regard, in the tape cartridge 100 of the embodiment, the portion of the label tape 101 contacting the drawing prevention portion 138, i.e., the side of the second lateral portion 152 of the label tape 101 is curved like an "S"-shape in the front and rear direction, while the respective detection convex portions 109 do not contact the drawing prevention portion 138 and are formed into a substantially linear shape, for example, a gentle arc shape (see <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>).</p><p id="p0119" num="0119">Accordingly, the respective detection convex portions 109 enter the light sensor 206 in a state of being formed into a substantially linear shape. Thus, compared with a case in which the respective detection convex portions 109 enter the light sensor 206 in a state of being curved like an "S"-shape, the respective detection convex portions 109 can appropriately enter the area between the light-emission element 216 and the light-reception element 217 without changing their entering path for each time. Therefore, since the passage position of the detection convex portions 109 in the direction in which the light-emission<!-- EPO <DP n="52"> --> element 216 and the light-reception element 217 of the light sensor 206 face each other is secured, a change in output voltage at the passage due to a change in the passage position is reduced, whereby the light sensor 206 can appropriately detect the passage of the detection convex portions 109. In addition, in this case as well, since the side of the second lateral portion 152 of the label tape 101 is held between the platen roller 103 and the drawing prevention portion 138 when the platen roller 103 moves to the upstream side in the paying-out direction as the label tape 101 is drawn, the tip end of the label tape 101 can be prevented from getting in the cartridge case 104.

Therefore, the upper side of the label tape 101 can be further linearly shaped.
