Further, an amount of air may be injected into the cavity to make it bulge slightly. This may help leading out air that could otherwise be trapped between the active surface and the blank and cause e.g. optical defects. The bulging thus may help achieving an improved process yield. A problem associated with such systems is nevertheless how to improve the yield further.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary</u></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">One object of the present disclosure is therefore how to improve the production further, such that the finished products to a greater extent fulfill desired quality requirements. This object is achieved by a system as defined in claim 1 and a method as defined in claim 7. More specifically, in a system of the initially mentioned kind, the fluid filled cavity is then connected via a conduit to a reservoir, and a control arrangement is used which is adapted to maintain desired levels of pressure in the reservoir during the production cycle. This may be used to control the way the contact surface between a tool half and a blank expands so as to provide a small tensile stress over the surface of the blank as pressing/embossing begins. This has shown to be useful to prevent so called blotches on the blank surface, and may therefore improve the quality of the finished product.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The reservoir may be in the form of a cylinder having a moveable piston dividing the cylinder into a first compartment and a second compartment, and the first compartment may be in fluid connection with the fluid filled cavity. The control arrangement may be adapted to maintain desired levels of pressure in the second compartment during the production cycle. This is an efficient way of achieving the control pressure, which may further allow a pressure difference between the two halves.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Both tool halves may have such an arrangement with a fluid filled cavity connected to a control arrangement.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A limiter may be set to allow only a maximum volume of fluid to enter the cavity, such that the pressure in the second compartment can exceed the pressure in the first compartment.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Typically, the first compartment may be filled with a liquid and the second compartment may be filled with a gas.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A substantially constant pressure may be maintained in the cavity as the tool halves are pressed together.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In a corresponding method for embossing/pressing, fluid is let out of a cavity during pressing via a conduit to a reservoir and a control arrangement maintains desired levels of pressure in the second compartment during the production cycle.

The tool has two halves 1,3, and a blank 5 is inserted between the halves to be embossed.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">During a phase of the production cycle, the blank 5 will be pressed between the halves 1,3 and optionally, the halves may be actively heated during that phase to wholly or partially melt the blank or at least to make the blank deform plastically more easily.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The embossing replicates patterns disposed on either or both active surfaces 7, 9 of the halves, i.e. the surfaces that come into contact with the blank during the pressing.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">One example of a product that can be produced in this way is a lightguide plate that is used in a flat screen TV. A flat or slightly wedge-shaped rectangular and transparent blank is embossed with a fine pattern over one of its flat surfaces to form the lightguide plate. When one edge of the finished plate is lighted by means e.g. of light emitting diodes, LEDs, the plate conveys the introduced light by total reflection, but light leaks out of the plate evenly and in a predetermined fashion over one of its surfaces, thanks to the embossed pattern, to backlight e.g. an LCD display.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In order to make the production cycle quicker, the tool halves may also be actively cooled, e.g. by a fluid medium, once the pattern has been replicated.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The tool halves may generally be designed as described in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2013002703A1"><text>WO-2013/002703-A1</text></patcit> where coils are used to inductively heat the active surfaces during one part of the cycle, and the tool halves are cooled by means of a fluid cooling medium during another part of the cycle. That document also describes providing a fluid filled cavity 11 in either, or as illustrated, both tool halves. The cavity 11 serves to equalize the pressure applied during pressing over the active surface and and to make sure that shear forces are not conveyed<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> by the tool. This is done e.g. to improve optical properties of produced optical articles.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The cavity is suggested to extend beneath the greater part of the active surface, and may be e.g. about 4-5 mm thick. The above mentioned document also suggests pumping some air into the cavity to cause an overpressure that makes the active surface bulge slightly as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig 2</figref>. This bulging serves mitigate the risk of pockets of air being trapped in between the blank and an active surface of the tool half. When the tool halves 1, 3 are pressed together, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig 3</figref>, the mid section of the blank is pressed first, and any air between the blank and either active surface is transported away towards the edges of the blank 5. It is further possible to provide a pressure sensor in contact with the fluid to provide a feedback signal indicating the applied pressure. In <figref idrefs="f0001">fig 4</figref>, full pressing takes place, which compensates for the overpressure in the cavity 11.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The present disclosure provides improved means for achieving the above mentioned bulging of the active surface. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig 5</figref> shows a front view of an active surface 7 of a tool half. Indicated dashed in the centre is an initial surface of contact 13 which is first pressed by the tool half. The surface of contact then expands gradually outwards, as indicated by the arrows and further, outer dashed lines, while the pressing proceeds, until the entire active surface presses the blank. This has shown to apply a small tensile stress in the blank that is directed perpendicularly to the indicated dashed lines. The applied tensile stress can compensate for local compression stresses, caused by imperfections in the tool or blank, that could otherwise cause blotches or spots in the finished product. By controlling how the pressing takes place with a higher degree of precision, a higher quality/yield can be achieved in the process.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig 6</figref> illustrates schematically an pressing/embossing device connected to an arrangement for controlling the pressure in a fluid filled cavity of a tool half. In <figref idrefs="f0002">fig 6</figref> only a controlling arrangement for the bottom tool half is shown, but it is understood that the upper tool half may be connected to a similar or identical arrangement.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The cavity 11 of the bottom tool half 1 is connected via a conduit 15 to a cylinder 17, which is divided by a piston 19 into a wet part 21 and a dry part 23. The conduit 15 is connected to the wet part, and the cavity 11 and the wet part are filled with a liquid fluid such as water. The dry part 23 of the cylinder 17 is connected to a compressor 25 or another device for creating an overpressure. As long as the piston 19 moves freely, the pressure in the wet and dry parts 21, 23 of the cylinder will be the same. Therefore, when an overpressure is applied in the dry part 21, the cylinder moves and pushes fluid into the cavity 11, thereby making it bulge. A limiter 27 may be used, that limits the amount of fluid that can be pushed into the cavity 11, e.g. to 0.3 litres. The limiter 27 may simply restrict the movement of the piston 19. At this point, the piston 19 is stopped, no further fluid is pushed into the cavity 11, and the pressure may rise higher in the dry side 23 than in the wet side 21 of the cylinder 17, if more compressed air is provided. The limiter 27 may be adjustable to provide for different amounts of fluid to be pushed into the cavity depending on the application. A very precise and more or less temperature independent bulging is provided in this way. Further, a much higher pressure can be obtained on the dry side, a pressure that would make the active surface bulge too much if air with that pressure had been injected into the cavity.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">When subsequently pressing takes place, the pressure rises in the cavity and consequently in the wet side 21 of the cylinder 17. When the pressure in the wet side 21 of the cylinder 17 exceeds the pressure in the dry side 23, the piston 19 moves, allowing fluid to leave the cavity 11 which begins to flatten. The pressure may be kept constant during this phase by means of a pressure regulator 27 which maintains the pressure at a predetermined value, e.g. at 0.3 MPa. Thanks to this arrangement, the surface of the blank will be subjected to comparatively uniform tensile stresses as the affected area expands outwards as indicated with consecutively greater dashed boundaries in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig 5</figref>. It is possible to vary the pressure to which the regulator 27 is set during the pressing.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">However, depending e.g. on the active surface and the application, it may be desired to change the pressure in the cavity 11 in accordance with<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> other schemes. For instance, it may be desired to allow the pressure to rise initially. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig 6</figref>, by closing a first valve 29 downstreams of the pressure regulator 27, in the direction that fluid is pushed out of the cavity 11 during pressing, and opening a second valve 31 upstreams of the pressure regulator 27, a higher pressure than the pressure that the regulator 27 is set to is allowed in the dry part 23 of the cylinder 17. A higher pressure may thus be fed to the cylinder as determined by another pressure regulator 33. When this pressure is attained, the second valve 31 may be closed. It may then be possible to let the pressure rise even further in the cavity by applying the pressing of the tool halves. There exists a number of different options for varying the pressure throughout the production cycle.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The present disclosure is not limited to the described embodiment, and may be altered and varied in different ways withing the scope of the appended claims. For instance, even if the reservoir above is embodied as a cylinder with a moveable piston, another option would be to use a vertical tank which is partly filled with liquid and where the cavity is connected to the bottom part of the tank. The upper part of the tank could be filled with an air volume, and the pressure in that air volume could be controlled.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90460255" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Embossing/pressing system comprising a first (1) and a second (3) tool half, between which a plastic blank may be embossed/pressed during a production cycle in order to provide the blank with a desired shape or a desired surface pattern, wherein at least one of the tool halves has a fluid filled cavity (11) which extends beneath at least a part of its active surface that faces the blank, <b>characterized by</b>
