described below with reference to the drawings.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a schematic view of the robot control system 100 according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. The robot control system 100 includes a robot 1, a robot controller 2 connected to the robot 1, a workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3, and an information communication module 4.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The robot 1 used here is an articulated robot that is also called a manipulator. The robot controller 2 controls and drives the robot 1 in accordance with a predetermined program solely or in cooperation with an upper-level controller connected to the robot controller 2.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 and the information communication module 4 are incorporated in one hardware body in this embodiment. Here, the hardware body incorporating the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 and the information communication module 4 is provided by a general-purpose computer. The general-purpose computer functions as the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 and the information communication module 4 with running of software on the computer. A computer program causing the computer to function as the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3, and a computer program causing the computer to function as the information communication module 4 are separate program modules and are operated to run on the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> computer independently of each other.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 is an image processor that is connected to a camera 5, and that recognizes a position and a posture of a workpiece 6 (hereinafter referred to as a "workpiece position and posture") based on image data captured by the camera 5. The camera 5 captures an image of a pallet 7 on which many workpieces 6 are piled. Here, the workpiece position and posture are information including at least coordinates and orientation of the workpiece 6 as a target. In this embodiment, the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 detects a three-dimensional shape of the workpiece 6 by employing a three-dimensional scanner of the so-called structured light type in which many slit lights are projected to the workpieces 6 on the pallet 7 by a slit light projector 8 and the slight lights are captured by the camera 5. As a matter of course, a method for detecting the three-dimensional shape is not limited to the structured light method, and another suitable method, such as stereoscopic image capturing method, can also be used. From the obtained three-dimensional shape, the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 recognizes the position and posture of the workpiece 6 through appropriate information processing. As illustrated, the many workpieces 6 are piled on the pallet 7. Therefore, when many data of<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> workpiece positions and postures are obtained, the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 outputs the workpiece positions and postures in a preset priority order, e.g., in an order starting from the position and posture of the workpiece at the top of a pile, or an order of easiness in grasping the workpiece by the robot 1 as described later.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The information communication module 4 is interposed between the robot controller 2 and the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3, and it has roles of absorbing differences in communication protocols therebetween, causing the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 to recognize the workpiece position and posture in accordance with a request from the robot controller 2, and transmitting the obtained workpiece position and posture to the robot controller 2. In this embodiment, with the presence of the information communication module 4, there is no necessity of changing the specifications of one of the robot controller 2 and the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 in conformity with the communication protocols of the other. Furthermore, when the specifications of one of the robot controller 2 and the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 are changed, communication feasibility between both the parties is ensured just by changing the specifications of the information communication module 4<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> without changing the protocols of the other. Accordingly, this embodiment can facilitate connection between the robot controller 2 and the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3, and can increase a degree of freedom in selection of the robot controller 2 and the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 depending on specifics of work.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The robot control system 100 according to this embodiment operates in such a way that the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 recognizes the workpiece position and posture of each of the workpieces 6, which are randomly piled on the pallet 7 without being arrayed in order, and that the robot 1 performs appropriate work on the workpiece 6. In this embodiment, the robot 1 grasps the workpieces 6 individually and transfers the grasped workpiece 6 to a downstream step, for example.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a block diagram of hardware of a computer providing a hardware body in which the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 and the information communication module 4 are incorporated. The computer used here may be a general computer. This embodiment employs a general computer including a CPU (Central Processing Unit) 10, a RAM (Random Access Memory) 11, an external storage device 12, a GC (Graphic Controller) 13, an input device 14, and an I/O (Input/Output) 15, which are interconnected<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> through a data bus 16 such that electric signals can be transferred among them. The external storage device 12 is a device capable of statically recording information, such as a HDD (Hard Disk Drive) or an SSD (Solid State Drive). A signal from the GC 13 is output to a monitor 17 on which a user can visually recognize an image, such as a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) or the so-called flat panel display, and is displayed as an image on the monitor 17. The input device 14 is a device through which the user inputs information, such as a keyboard, a mouse, or a touch panel. The I/O 15 is an interface through which the computer transfers information with respect to an external device. The GC 13 includes a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) 13a and a VRAM (Video RAM) 13b. The GPU 13a is a processor particularly adapted for image processing, and it has a parallel arithmetic processing capability higher than that of a general processor, e.g., the CPU 10. The VRAM 13b is featured in that, when the VRAM 13b is accessed from the GPU 13a, data can be read and written at a higher speed than in the case of accessing the RAM 11 because there is no necessity of passing through the data bus 16 in the former case.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The computer programs causing the computer to function as the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 and the information communication module 4 are<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> installed in the external storage device 12 and are read out into the RAM 11 to be executed by the CPU 10 as appropriate. In particular, the computer program causing the computer to function as the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 is coded such that processing related to image recognition is executed by the GPU 13a.

The robot control section 20, the workpiece recognition command sending section 21, and the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> workpiece recognition result receiving section 22 are implemented by software operated to run on a digital processor that is incorporated in the robot controller 2, and by an interface provided in the robot controller 2.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Here, the term "workpiece recognition command" implies information sent from the robot controller 2 to the information communication module 4, and represents a command for recognizing the types and the number of the workpieces 6 used in the operation of the robot 1 and for requesting the workpiece position and posture per workpiece. Therefore, the workpiece recognition command contains at least information related to the number of the workpieces 6. The term "workpiece recognition result" implies information received by the robot controller 2 from the information communication module 4, and includes the workpiece position and posture of the recognized workpiece 6. One workpiece recognition result may contain plural data of the workpiece positions and postures. Therefore, the workpiece recognition result contains at least information related to the number of the workpieces 6.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 includes an image processing section 30 that recognizes the requested workpiece 6 by executing appropriate information processing on image information obtained with the camera 5, and that detects the workpiece<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> position and posture of the requested workpiece 6, and a workpiece information storing section 31 that stores workpiece information, i.e., information related to the workpiece 6 and used in the image processing executed by the image processing section 30. Here, the term "workpiece information" implies information that is employed to identify the presence, the position, and the posture of the workpiece 6 in the image captured by the camera 5. The workpiece information is made up of, for example, information of a three-dimensional shape of the workpiece 6 per type, reference coordinates, and a reference direction vector. An example of the processing executed by the image processing section 30 is to check matching between a three-dimensional shape obtained from the image information and a three-dimensional shape of the demanded workpiece 6, and to output, when the presence of the workpiece 6 is determined, a position in the reference coordinates and a direction of the reference vector of the relevant workpiece 6 in accordance with a coordinate system set on the pallet 7 (or a coordinate system set on the robot 1). The position in the reference coordinates and the direction of the reference vector of the workpiece 6, which are obtained with the above-mentioned processing, are one example of the term "workpiece position and posture" used in this Description.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In this embodiment, the image processing section<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> 30 and the workpiece information storing section 31 are implemented by the GC 13 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>). More specifically, the image processing section 30 is practiced with the predetermined software operated to run on the GPU 13a, and the workpiece information storing section 31 is practiced with operation of storing the necessary workpiece information in the VRAM 13b. The reason is that, because the GPU 13a is suitable for image processing and information is sent and received between the GPU 13a and the VRAM 13b at a higher speed as described above, the workpiece position and posture can be detected at a high speed by executing, on the GC 13, both the processing in the image processing section 30 and holding of information used in that processing. Alternatively, the processing in the image processing section 30 may be executed in the CPU 10, and the workpiece information may be stored in the RAM 11. Anyway, the workpiece information storing section 31 is practiced by storing the workpiece information in a medium that allows high-speed access to the workpiece information held therein, such as a temporary storage represented by a DRAM.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">A workpiece information accumulating section 32 is a section where the workpiece information possibly used later is accumulated in advance. The workpiece information accumulating section 32 is practiced by storing various kinds of workpiece information in the external storage<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> device 12. The workpiece information accumulated in the workpiece information accumulating section 32 is read by a workpiece information reading section 33 from the workpiece information accumulating section 32 in accordance with a workpiece information reading command from the information communication module 4, and is written and stored into the workpiece information storing section 31 (such operation is called "read of the workpiece information"). The workpiece information stored in the workpiece information storing section 31 is released from the workpiece information storing section 31 by a workpiece information releasing section 34 in accordance with a workpiece information release command from the information communication module 4 (such operation is called "release of the workpiece information"). Here, the term "release of the workpiece information" implies processing to release assignment of a storage area, which has been assigned to the relevant workpiece information, and to set the storage area into a state capable of storing other information. The released workpiece information is lost from the workpiece information storing section 31.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Thus, the necessary workpiece information is stored in the workpiece information storing section 31 as appropriate, and the unnecessary workpiece information is released from the workpiece information storing section 31.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> The reason is that there is a limit in storage capacity of the workpiece information storing section 31, and that it is not feasible in some cases to previously accumulate all the workpiece information possibly used later.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The information communication module 4 includes a workpiece position and posture request sending section 40 that sends a workpiece position and posture request to the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 in accordance with the workpiece recognition command from the robot controller 2, and a workpiece recognition result sending section 41 that sends a workpiece recognition result to the robot controller 2 in accordance with the workpiece position and posture from the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Here, the workpiece recognition command received from the robot controller 2 and the workpiece position and posture request sent to the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 are sometimes not matched with each other in format. The workpiece recognition command contains information related to the number of the workpieces 6 to be recognized, while the workpiece position and posture request requests the workpiece position and posture for a single workpiece. In some cases, therefore, the workpiece position and posture request sending section 40 sends one workpiece recognition command to the workpiece position and posture<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> recognizing device 3 after converting the command into a plurality of workpiece position and posture requests. Similarly, the workpiece position and posture received from the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 and the workpiece recognition result sent to the robot controller 2 are sometimes not matched with each other in format. The workpiece position and posture is related to one workpiece, while the workpiece recognition result may contain plural data of workpiece positions and postures and hence it contains information regarding the number of the workpieces 6 having been recognized. In some cases, therefore, the workpiece recognition result sending section 41 sends plural data of workpiece positions and postures to the robot controller 2 after converting them into one workpiece recognition result. In such a manner, the information communication module 4 absorbs differences in communication protocols between the robot controller 2 and the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The type of the workpiece 6 to be recognized in the robot control system 100 is not necessarily to be one. It is assumed that two or more types of the workpieces 6 are piled on one pallet 7, or that the type of the workpiece 6 is different per pallet 7 or per lot. In this embodiment, therefore, the workpiece recognition command sent from the robot controller 2 contains workpiece identification<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> information. The workpiece identification information is information that is arbitrarily set to identify the type of the workpiece 6, and that may be, for example, a number assigned per type of the workpiece 6, or a name designating the specific type of the workpiece 6.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The information communication module 4 further includes a workpiece identification information storing section 42 that stores the workpiece identification information contained in the workpiece recognition request, which has been received from the robot controller 2. Thus, the workpiece identification information storing section 42 stores the workpiece identification information regarding the types of the workpieces 6 used in the past. When the workpiece identification information contained in the newly-received workpiece recognition command is not stored in the workpiece identification information storing section 42, a workpiece information read instructing section 43 sends a workpiece information read instruction to the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3. The workpiece information read instructing section 43 receives, from the workpiece information reading section 33, a notice indicating that read of the workpiece information has succeeded, and permits sending of the workpiece position and posture request from the workpiece position and posture request sending section 40.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">As described above, the information communication module 4 operates, with respect to the workpiece 6 for which the workpiece information has already been read, to send just the workpiece position and posture request, and with respect to the workpiece 6 for which the workpiece information has not yet been read, to send the workpiece information read instruction prior to sending the workpiece position and posture request for the first time, thereby causing the workpiece information to be read. Accordingly, the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 can read the necessary workpiece information as appropriate, while wasteful duplicate read of the workpiece information having been already read is avoided.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">However, as mentioned above, there is an upper limit in the storage capacity of the workpiece information storing section 31, and the workpiece information is not read and stored infinitely beyond the limit. In other words, if, as a result of reading the workpiece information, the remaining capacity of the workpiece information storing section 31 becomes smaller than the capacity used to read further workpiece information, new workpiece information is not read any more. In such a case, a workpiece information release instructing section 44 sends, to the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3, a workpiece information release instruction that instructs release of<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> the workpiece information having been read.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">More specifically, when the workpiece information read instructing section 43 receives, from the workpiece information reading section 33, a notice indicating a failure of the read of the workpiece information, the workpiece information read instructing section 43 commands the workpiece information release instructing section 44 to release the workpiece information. Upon receiving the command, the workpiece information release instructing section 44 determines which part of the workpiece information having been read is to be released, and sends the workpiece information release instruction to release the determined workpiece information. At that time, which part of the workpiece information having been read is to be released is determined optionally. Here, the workpiece information to be released is determined depending on a preset priority order, or frequency of the workpiece recognition command per type of the workpiece 6. The preset priority order is set, for example, by a user in consideration of importance per type of the workpiece 6. The frequency is obtained by checking the number of times at which the workpiece recognition command has been received from the robot controller 2 per type of the workpiece 6, or by counting the number of the workpieces 6 which have been requested to be recognized. The smaller the number of times<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> or the counted number (i.e., the lower the frequency), the lower is the priority order. The workpiece information to be released is determined successively starting from the workpiece information having the lowest frequency. The preset priority order or the frequency of the workpiece recognition command per type of the workpiece 6 is stored in or counted by a priority order storing section / frequency counting section 45 to be referred by the workpiece information release instructing section 44 as appropriate.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">With the configuration described above, the workpiece positions and postures can be detected for multiple types of the workpieces 6 without preparing the workpiece information storing section 31 with a very large capacity. Moreover, since the priority order in releasing the workpiece information is preset, or since the workpiece information to be released is determined in accordance with the frequency of the workpiece recognition command per type of the workpiece 6, the workpiece information having higher frequency in use is held without being released, and reduction of processing efficiency caused by frequent read of the workpiece information is avoided.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In this embodiment, the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 and the information communication module 4 are implemented by operating respective software modules independently of each other to<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> run on a general-purpose computer that provides one hardware body.

In this embodiment, the workpiece position and posture request contains two types of requests, i.e., a first candidate request and a second candidate request, which are handled by the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 in different ways. The first candidate request is to request that the image processing is executed by the image processing section 30 and one of already obtained plural data of the workpiece positions and postures<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> is sent, the one having the highest priority order. On the other hand, the next candidate request is to request sending of one of the already obtained plural data of the workpiece positions and postures, the one having the highest priority order except for the data having been already sent.

After receiving a workpiece position and posture 143 from the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3, the workpiece recognition result sending section 41 sends a workpiece recognition result 144, which contains the workpiece position and posture 143 and the number "1" of the<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> recognized workpiece, to the robot controller 2.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071"><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> is a flowchart of a robot control method executed by the robot control system 100 according to the embodiment, which has been described above in connection with the practical examples.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">In the illustrated flow, first, a workpiece recognition command is sent from the workpiece recognition command sending section 21 of the robot controller 2 in step ST1. The workpiece recognition command is received by the information communication module 4, and whether the received workpiece recognition command is the first workpiece recognition command or the second workpiece recognition command is determined in step ST2.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">When the received workpiece recognition command is the first workpiece recognition command, determination is made in step ST3 as to whether the workpiece identification information contained in the first workpiece recognition command is stored in the workpiece identification information storing section 42. If the workpiece identification information is stored, the flow advances to step ST4 where a first candidate request is sent from the workpiece position and posture request sending section 40 of the information communication module 4. In next step ST5, the image processing section 30 of the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 executes image processing<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> in accordance with the first candidate request to recognize the workpiece position and posture.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">In step ST6, determination is made as to whether there is a candidate of the detected workpiece position and posture except for the candidates having been already sent. If there is such a candidate, the flow advances to step ST7 where the relevant workpiece position and posture is sent from the image processing section 30. In step ST8, determination is made as to whether the number of the data of the workpiece positions and postures received by the information communication module 4 reaches the number demanded by the workpiece recognition command. If the number of the received data of the workpiece positions and postures does not reach the demanded number, the flow advances to step ST9 where the next candidate request is sent from the workpiece position and posture request sending section 40. Thereafter, the flow returns to step ST6 to repeat sending of the next candidate request until the candidate of the detected workpiece position and posture is not present any more, or until the number of received candidates of the workpiece positions and postures reaches the demanded number.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">If it is determined in step ST6 that there is no candidate of the detected workpiece position and posture except for the candidates having been already sent, or it is<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> determined in step ST8 that the number of received candidates of the workpiece positions and postures reaches the demanded number, the flow advances to step ST10 where the workpiece recognition result is sent from the workpiece recognition result sending section 41 of the information communication module 4. The robot controller 2 receives the workpiece recognition result by the workpiece recognition result receiving section 22, and controls the robot 1 in accordance with the received workpiece recognition result in step ST11.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">On the other hand, if it is determined in step ST3 that the workpiece identification information contained in the first workpiece recognition command is not stored in the workpiece identification information storing section 42, the flow advances to step ST12 where the relevant workpiece identification information is stored in the workpiece identification information storing section 42. In next step ST13, the workpiece information read instruction is sent from the workpiece information read instructing section 43. Then, in step ST14, the workpiece information is read by the workpiece information reading section 33 of the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">In next step ST15, determination is made as to whether the read of the workpiece information has succeeded. If the read of the workpiece information has succeeded, the<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> flow advances to step ST4 to execute control in the same manner as per described above. On the other hand, if the read of the workpiece information has failed, the flow advances to step ST16 where the workpiece information release instruction is sent from the workpiece information release instructing section 44 of the information communication module 4. At this time, as described above, the workpiece information to be released is selected depending on the preset priority order or the frequency of the workpiece recognition command per workpiece by referring to the priority order storing section / frequency counting section 45. Upon receiving the sent workpiece information release instruction, the workpiece information releasing section 34 of the workpiece position and posture recognizing device 3 releases the workpiece information in step ST17.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">In next step ST18, determination is made as to whether the release of the workpiece information has succeeded. If the release of the workpiece information has succeeded, the flow returns to step ST13 where the workpiece information read instruction is sent again. In such a way, the release of the workpiece information and the re-instruction for the read of the workpiece information are repeatedly executed until the read of the workpiece information succeeds. If the release of the workpiece information has failed in step ST18, this implies the<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> occurrence of a state where the release of the workpiece information is now allowed, or the read of the necessary workpiece information is not allowed for any reason. Accordingly, an error is notified in step ST19, and the control is ended.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">If it is determined in step ST2 that the workpiece recognition command is the second workpiece recognition command, the flow advances to step ST20 where the next candidate request is sent from the workpiece position and posture request sending section 40 of the information communication module 4. In next step ST21, as in step ST6, determination is made as to whether there is a candidate of the detected workpiece position and posture except for the candidates having been already sent. If there is such a candidate, the flow advances to step ST22 where the relevant workpiece position and posture is sent from the image processing section 30 as in step ST7. In step ST23, as in step ST8, determination is made as to whether the number of data of the workpiece positions and postures received by the information communication module 4 reaches the number demanded by the workpiece recognition command. If the number of the received data of the workpiece positions and postures does not reach the demanded number, the flow returns to step ST20 to repeat sending of the next candidate request, as in the above-described case, until the candidate<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> of the detected workpiece position and posture is not present any more, or until the number of received candidates of the workpiece positions and postures reaches the demanded number.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">If it is determined in step ST21 that there is no candidate of the detected workpiece position and posture except for the candidates having been already sent, or that the number of candidates of the workpiece positions and postures received in step ST23 reaches the demanded number, the flow advances to step ST10 where the workpiece recognition result is sent from the workpiece recognition result sending section 41 of the information communication module 4.
