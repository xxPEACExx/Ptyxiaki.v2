In order to reduce such deformation, a method of increasing thickness of the rubber on the tire side section, in particular, the rubber on the bead section side is employed. However, if the thickness of rubber is increased, heat is likely to be generated by the deformation of the rubber. The heat generation in the tire side section promotes degradation of the rubber, leading to deterioration of durability of a tire, and therefore, a tire which reduces a temperature increase in the tire side section has been desired.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In order to solve such a problem, there has been proposed a method of providing a turbulence-generating protrusion, which projects outward in a tire width direction from an outer surface of the tire side section, in a portion of the tire side section to generate<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> turbulence of air on the outer surface of the tire side section, and, thus, to reduce the temperature increase (for example, see Patent Literature 1).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In tires for heavy load, since thickness of rubber in a tire side section is larger than thickness of a tire for passenger car, although the provision of the turbulence-generating protrusion gives a cooling effect on an outer surface of the tire side section, an inside of the tire cannot be cooled, so that the effect of reducing the temperature increase may not be obtained 14 sufficiently.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Thus, in recent years, there has been considered that a circumferential recessed section depressed inward in a tire width direction is formed in a portion of a tire side section along a tire circumferential direction, and, at the same time, a turbulence-generating protrusion is provided in a region where the circumferential recessed section is formed, whereby the temperature increase is more efficiently reduced.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Patent Literature 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2009084634A"><text>WO 2009/084634 A</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, the thickness of rubber in the region where the circumferential recessed<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> section is formed is smaller than that in the other regions. When the turbulence-generating protrusion is formed in a region where the thickness of rubber is small, a carcass section provided in a tire may be deformed during manufacturing of the tire. Specifically, a carcass cord constituting the carcass section may sometimes project and be recessed in a tire width direction due to flowing of rubber upon the formation of the turbulence-generating protrusion. There is a problem that such deformation of the carcass section causes deterioration of tire durability.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Namely, although the provision of the turbulence-generating protrusion in the region where the circumferential recessed section is formed can efficiently reduce the temperature increase, the tire durability is apt to be deteriorated, and therefore, measures are thus required.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a tire which simultaneously achieves reduction of a temperature increase in a tire side section and improvement of tire durability.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As a result of intensive studies made by the present inventors in terms of simultaneous achievement of reduction of a temperature increase in a tire side section and improvement of tire durability, the inventors found that if a tire thickness is within a predetermined range, the effect of reducing the temperature increase can be increased, and an influence on deformation of a carcass section can be reduced during manufacturing of a tire.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A feature of the present invention is summarized as a tire (pneumatic tire 1)<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> including a tread section (tread section 10) in contact with a road surface, a tire side section (tire side section 20) continuous to the tread section, a bead section (bead section 30) continuous to the tire side section, and a carcass section (carcass section 40) extending throughout the tread section, the tire side section, and the bead section, wherein the carcass section has a carcass body section (carcass body section 41) provided ranging from the tread section to a bead core in the bead section through the tire side section and a folded section (folded section 42) folded at the bead core, the tire side section includes a circumferential recessed section (circumferential recessed section 100) recessed inward in a tire width direction and extending in a tire circumferential direction, the circumferential recessed section is provided with a plurality of turbulence-generating protrusions (turbulence-generating protrusion 110) projecting outward in the tire width direction, and in a tire cross section along the tire width direction and a tire radius direction, when a distance between an inner surface on the inside in the tire width direction of the carcass body section and a rim-separation point in contact with a standard rim is specified as a tire reference thickness (tire reference thickness T0), and when a distance between an inner surface on the inside in the tire width direction of the folded section and a tire outer surface of the circumferential recessed section is specified as a tire thickness (tire thickness T1), the plurality of turbulence-generating protrusions are provided in a region where the tire thickness is 20% or more and 60% or less of the tire reference thickness.</p><heading id="h0007">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a partially exploded perspective view of a pneumatic tire 1 according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing the pneumatic tire 1 according to the first embodiment of the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(a)</figref> is a partially enlarged perspective view of the pneumatic tire 1 according to the first embodiment of the invention, <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(b)</figref> is a partially enlarged side view of the pneumatic tire 1 according to the first embodiment of the invention, and <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(c)</figref> is a cross-sectional view along a line A-A shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(b)</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is an enlarged view of a circumferential recessed section of the cross-sectional view shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5(a)</figref> is a partially enlarged cross-sectional view of a pneumatic tire according to an example, <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5(b)</figref> is a partially enlarged cross-sectional view of a pneumatic tire according to a conventional example, and <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5(c)</figref> is a partially enlarged cross-sectional view of a pneumatic tire according to Comparative Example 1.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0008">Description of Embodiments</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">Next, embodiments according to the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.

Namely, it is preferable that all of the first turbulence-generating protrusions 111, the second turbulence-generating protrusions 112, and the third turbulence-generating protrusions 113 are formed to satisfy the relationships of 1 ≤ P2/h ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ (P2 - w)/w ≤ 100.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">(P2 - w)/w represents a ratio of the width w of the turbulence-generating protrusion 110 to the pitch P2.

The turbulence-generating protrusion 110 is formed from rubber, and, thus, since the<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> effect of improving heat radiation due to an increase of a surface area cannot be expected; therefore, a minimum value of (P2 - w)/w is specified to be 1.0.

Specifically, since the turbulence-generating protrusion 110 is arranged in the circumferential recessed section 100, rubber flows in forming a boundary between the circumferential recessed section 100 and the tire outer surface in a region other than the circumferential<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> recessed section 100 or in forming the turbulence-generating protrusion 110, whereby the carcass section may be deformed at several portions. If the carcass section 40 is thus deformed, distortion concentrates on the carcass section 40 to be likely to cause tire failures such as peeling of the carcass section 40 and rubber, so that tire durability is deteriorated.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">Meanwhile, if the turbulence-generating protrusion 110 is provided in a region where the tire thickness T1 is more than 60% of the tire reference thickness T0, although the cooling effect on the outer surface of the tire side section 20 is obtained, an inside of a tire cannot be cooled, so that the effect of reducing a temperature increase may not be sufficiently obtained.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">According to the pneumatic tire 1 of this embodiment, since the turbulence-generating protrusion 110 is provided in the region where the tire thickness T1 is 20% or more and 60% or less of the tire reference thickness T0, reduction of a temperature increase in the tire side section 20 and improvement of the tire durability can be achieved simultaneously.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Moreover, in the pneumatic tire 1 according to this embodiment, the formation of the circumferential recessed section 100 reduces the volume of the rubber used for the tire side section 20 compared with the case where no circumferential recessed section 100 is formed. In other words, in the tire side section 20, an amount of rubber to be deformed with the rotation of the pneumatic tire 1 is reduced. Thus, heat generation due to the deformation of the rubber in the tire side section 20 can be suppressed. Furthermore, since the amount of rubber for producing the pneumatic tire 1 can be<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> reduced, manufacturing cost for the pneumatic tire 1 can be reduced.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">It is preferable that a portion of the turbulence-generating protrusion 110 is formed to project on the outer side in the tire width direction Tw by a predetermined projection height than the virtual circular arc curve Vc1. According to the pneumatic tire 1, air flowing along the outer surface of the tire side section 20 collides with the projecting portion of the turbulence-generating protrusion 110 to easily flow inward of the circumferential recessed section 100.
