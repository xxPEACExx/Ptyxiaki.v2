id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for producing a tire vulcanizing mold and, in particular, a method for producing a high-precision tire vulcanizing mold at low cost and by fewer operational processes.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">It is known that, in a tire vulcanizing apparatus, an unvulcanized tire (green tire) is enclosed by side molds surrounding the side regions of the unvulcanized tire and a plurality of sector molds surrounding the crown region of the unvulcanized tire, and pressure is applied to the mold interior from outside while a heating medium is supplied to thereby promote the vulcanizing.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Also, known as the methods for producing these molds are primarily die-casting and in recent years rapid prototyping.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Of these methods, die-casting comprises a number of processes including the fabrication of a prototype model and a rubber mold, the fabrication of a mold, and the casting, using<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> a number of intermediate materials. In comparison with this, rapid prototyping has an edge over the die-casting in being able to produce a metal mold based on a 3D model of the metal mold in a short period of time. However, it has a problem of greater likelihood of deformation by thermal strain due to its specificity that each layer is produced by repeating heating and sintering and stacked together. Also, the rapid prototyping is disadvantageous compared to the die-casting in that the cost rises dramatically with the volume of the mold to be produced.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Also, disclosed in Patent Document 1 in particular is a method for producing a sector mold in a short time and at low cost, in which a pattern molding segment made of a thermoplastic resin molded by rapid prototyping is heated, pressurized and assembled on a base segment of an aluminum alloy to produce the sector mold. According to this producing method, however, because the pattern molding segment is made of a resin, the pattern molding segment is easy to wear and deform by the repeated use of the vulcanizing apparatus and thus it is concerned that the durability would be inferior.</p><heading id="h0003">RELATED ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT DOCUMENT</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2006256240A"><text>Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2006-256240</text></patcit><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></li><li>Patent Document 2: International Publication <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2004048062A"><text>WO2004/048062</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">To solve the above-described problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a tire vulcanizing mold capable of obtaining a tire vulcanizing mold having excellent durability, low cost, and high precision and to provide a tire vulcanizing mold.</p><heading id="h0007">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">Aa a method for producing a tire vulcanizing mold to solve the above-described problems, there is provided a method for producing a tire vulcanizing mold by assembling a pattern molding segment produced by rapid prototyping on a metal base segment, the method including a step of producing a pattern molding segment from a metal based on a shape of a surface layer part including a pattern shaping surface in a basic model of the tire vulcanizing mold.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is to be understood that the foregoing summary of the invention does not necessarily recite all the features essential to the invention, and subcombinations of all these features are intended to be included in the invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0008">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a vulcanizing apparatus.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> is an overall perspective view showing a sector mold.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic representation showing a basic model for a mold and a model after division.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view (taken along line A-A in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>) of the sector mold. <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a sector mold according to another embodiment.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 6</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a sector mold according to another embodiment.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a sector mold according to another embodiment.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 8</figref> is an overall perspective view of a sector mold according to another embodiment.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 9</figref> is a side view of a sector mold according to another embodiment.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIGs. 10A and 10B</figref> are schematic illustrations exaggerating stacking level differences.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 11</figref> is a graph showing the measurements of widthdeformation in the width direction of a pattern mold.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0009">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">The invention will now be described based on embodiments which do not intend to limit the scope of the claims of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> invention but exemplify the invention. All of the combinations of the features described in the embodiments are not necessarily essential to the solving means of the invention.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a vulcanizing apparatus 1. As shown in this sectional view, the vulcanizing apparatus 1 includes a lower-side mold 2, which shapes a side region S1 below of a green tire T before vulcanizing (hereinafter referred to simply as a tire) placed horizontally in the apparatus with the rotation axis of tire extending vertically, an upper-side mold 3, which is located opposite to the lower-side mold 2 and shapes a side region S2 above of the tire T, and a plurality of sector molds 4, which are disposed along a circumferential direction of the tire T between the lower-side mold 2 and the upper-side mold 3 vertically opposite to each other and shape a predetermined pattern (tread pattern) on a circumferential surface of a crown region C1 of the tire T.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The tire T is, for example, an unvulcanized tire shaped on a not-shown tire building drum. The tire T includes components such as a not-shown carcass toroidally extending astride a pair of beads Tb, Tb vertically spaced apart from each other in the illustration, a plurality of belts stacked on the carcass in the crown region C1, and a tread rubber.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> The lower-side mold 2 is a disk-like mold with an opening in the midsection thereof. With the tire T placed thereon, a shaping surface 2A comes in contact with the side region S1 extending from the vicinity of the lower-positioned bead Tb, Tb toward the crown region C1, thereby shaping the side region S1. Also, the lower-side mold 2 is disposed on a base 5, which has a heat insulating function.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The upper-side mold 3, in the same way as the lower-side mold 2, is a disk-like mold with an opening in the midsection thereof. With the tire T placed thereunder, the shaping surface 3A comes in contact with the side region S2 extending from the vicinity of the upper-positioned bead Tb, Tb toward the crown region C1, thereby shaping the side region S2. Also, the upper-side mold 3 is disposed on the underside of an outer ring 7 having a heat insulating function, which can be moved up and down along with the rising and lowering movement of a center post 6. At the end of a vulcanizing process, the tire T is removed from the mold by raising the center post 6 and thereby separating the upper-side mold 3 joined with the outer ring 7 upward from the lower-side mold 2.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A plurality of sector molds 4 are mold segments that surround the crown region C1 of the tire T in a ring form along the circumferential direction of the crown region C1 when they are combined with each other in engagement with the lower-side mold<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> 2 and the upper-side mold 3. The sector mold 4 is, for instance, divided into 8 segments along the circumferential direction of the tire T. Also, a pattern shaping surface 42 of the sector mold 4 coming in contact with the outer periphery of the crown region C1 has an uneven surface for shaping a predetermined tread pattern on the circumferential surface of the crown region C1. This allows the shaping of a tread pattern with inverted unevenness on the circumferential surface of the crown region C1.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The plurality of sector molds 4 surrounding the crown region C1 of the tire T along the circumferential direction are held by a plurality of segments 9 having a heat insulating function and disposed in a radially expandable and contractible manner along a slider mechanism disposed on the base 5. At the completion of the vulcanizing process, the tire T is removed from the mold by canceling the hold by the arm portion 11 of the outer ring 7 holding the outer periphery of the segments 9 by raising the center post 6 and thereby allowing the segments 9 to expand radially.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Inside the vulcanizing apparatus 1, a bladder 10 is placed on the inner periphery of the tire T which is surrounded by the plurality of molds. The bladder 10 is an expandable receptacle which can be expanded by a pressurized and heated gas supplied from outside the vulcanizing apparatus 1. When expanded, the bladder 10 comes into close contact with the inner periphery of the tire T and presses the outer periphery of the tire T against<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the above-described lower-side mold 2, the upper-side mold 3, and the sector mold 4.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The lower-side mold 2, the upper-side mold 3, and the bladder 10 are sealed by a bead ring 5A and a clamp ring 12A disposed on the lower-side mold 2 side and a bead ring 5B and a clamp ring 12B disposed on the upper-side mold 3 side. With the bladder 10 expanded, the vulcanizing of the tire T progresses under a sealed condition.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view showing a single sector mold 4 out of a plurality of sector molds 4, which are part of a main construction of the present embodiment. Also, <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a width direction of the sector mold. It is to be noted that in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref>, the width direction, the circumferential direction, and the radial direction are the directions with reference to the tire T placed in the vulcanizing apparatus 1 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, a sector mold 4 according to the present embodiment is constituted by a base mold 20 as a base segment and a pattern mold 30 as a pattern molding segment which is detachably assembled on the base mold 20.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The base mold 20 is made of a metal, such as aluminum, produced by casting, machining, or both based on a basic model, such as 3D CAD data, of a sector mold 4 to be discussed later.

Also, it is not necessary that the base mold 20 and the pattern mold 30 are made of the same metal, but they may be made of different metals or alloys as long as their thermal expansion rates are the same or close to each other. Hereinbelow, a description is given of the specific shapes and producing processes of the base mold 20 and the pattern mold 30.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic representation showing a mold model M1 configured of 3D CAD data or the like. The mold model M1 is basic design data for design in agreement with the total shape of the sector molds 4 after assembly.

Thus, a pattern mold 30 that can withstand repeated use can be obtained.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">It is to be noted that the thickness D1 is not limited to 3 mm. Rather, the choice of any other thickness is acceptable as long as the deformation, if any, can be corrected when the pattern mold 30 is assembled on the base mold 20.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Next, a detailed description is given of the method of assembling together the base mold 20 and the pattern mold 30, which constitute the sector mold 4. The joint portion 35 of the pattern mold 30 as the pattern shaping segment is first brought to face the joint portion 25 of the base mold 20 as the base segment, so that the pattern mold 30 is placed on the base mold 20. Then the<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> plurality of bolt holes 23A opened in the base mold 20 and the plurality of bolt holes 44 opened in the pattern mold 30 are aligned with each other.

That is, the pattern mold 30 produced by rapid prototyping tends to warp inwardly in the width direction and the circumferential direction due to thermal strain occurring during the fabrication. Therefore, the shape immediately after the fabrication has a shape slightly different from the shape of the pattern-side mold model M3.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Therefore, in the producing process of the sector mold 4 according to the present embodiment, by placing and assembling the pattern mold 30 of thin thickness having deformation due to thermal strain on the base mold 20 having a precisely formed joint portion 25, the deformation having occurred in the pattern mold 30 is corrected. With the correction of the deformation of the pattern mold 30, the joint portion 25 and the joint portion 35 are held in close contact with each other whereby the inhibition of thermal conduction at the boundary is reduced. Also, the shape<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> of the pattern shaping surface 42 that defines the shape of the tread pattern of the tire T is in agreement with the design shape of the pattern shaping surface MP of the pattern-side mold model M3. Therefore, it is possible to obtain a sector mold 4 capable of precisely producing a tire T having a tread pattern true to the design.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">As have been described thus far, according to the method for producing a sector mold 4 in the present embodiment, the base mold 20 is produced precisely by machining or the like in accordance with the base-side mold model M2, which is a division of the mold model M1. And the pattern mold 30 is produced by rapid prototyping in accordance with the pattern-side mold model M3 such that the pattern mold 30 is of thin thickness but at least includes the pattern shaping surface 42. Then the base mold 20 and the pattern mold 30 are assembled together into a unified body while the deformation in the pattern mold 30 is corrected. Therefore, compared with a case in which the whole sector mold 4 is produced by die-casting, it is possible to obtain the sector mold 4 with high durability and high precision having the pattern shaping surface 42 true to the mold model M1. As a result, the number of processes in the manufacture can be reduced substantially. Also, compared with a case in which the whole sector mold 4 is produced by rapid prototyping, the cost of manufacture can be reduced markedly because of reduced volume. Also, the pattern mold 30 produced by rapid prototyping is thin enough to allow<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> correction of deformation. Accordingly, the deformation resulting from thermal strain during the rapid prototyping can be corrected in the process of fastening to the base mold 20.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Moreover, the base mold 20 and the pattern mold 30 are produced in accordance with the base-side mold model M2 and the pattern-side mold model M3, respectively, divided by the shared virtual division line L1 from the mold model M1.

In contrast, the dislocation of the pattern mold 30 after it is assembled is seen converging on as little as 0.1 mm or less over the whole width direction range.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">As is clear from the above results, according to the method of producing in the present embodiment, in which the pattern mold 30 of thin thickness produced by rapid prototyping, which is<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> liable to be deformed due to thermal strain, is assembled on the separately produced base mold 20, it is possible to produce at low cost the mold featuring high durability and excellent precision comparable to when the whole mold is produced by casting.

It is to be noted that this example shows two circumferentially divided segments, but the number of division is not limited to two.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">The base mold 20 and the pattern molds 30A, 30B in this example have not-shown bolt holes 23A and bolt holes 44 in the four corners, respectively. The pattern molds 30A, 30B are fastened by not-shown bolts screwed into the bolt holes 23A and the bolt holes 44.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Regarding the sector mold 4 in this example, the area of the joint portion 35 per unit is smaller than that in the foregoing examples, and the respective pattern molds 30A, 30B are fastened by a plurality of individually provided fastening means. Hence, the shape of the pattern molds 30A, 30B can be corrected more closely, and the close contact between the joint portion 25 and the joint portion 35 can be further improved.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">Also, if the circumferentially divided pattern molds 30 are assembled on the base mold 20, the individual pattern molds 30 can be corrected with greater precision. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain a mold featuring uniform thermal conductivity over the whole range.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 9</figref> is a side view showing circumferential connection between the sector molds 4 of a structure in the foregoing examples. In this figure, 4A represents a sector mold disposed on one<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> circumferential side, and 4B a sector mold adjacent to the sector mold 4A and disposed on the other circumferential side.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">As shown in the figure, the circumferential end faces 26 of the base mold 20 in this example protrude toward the circumferential direction side than the circumferential end faces 36 of the pattern mold 30 fixed thereon. The arrangement is such that the circumferential end faces 36 of the pattern mold 30 are butted against each other when the sector molds 4A, 4B are connected to each other.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">In this manner, if the circumferential end faces 36 are butted against each other between the neighboring sector molds 4A, 4B, then a gap g is created between the circumferential end faces 26, 26 of the pattern mold 30 in contrast to the case where the circumferential end faces 26, 36 are in the same plane as in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> or in the case where the circumferential end faces 26 only are butted against each other. This prevents the direct contact between the pattern molds 30 formed with thin thickness. And this reduces the possibility of damage to or deformation of the end portions of the pattern molds 30 belonging to the neighboring sector molds 4A, 4B.</p><heading id="h0010">Description of Reference Numerals</heading><p id="p0091" num="0091"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>1</dt><dd>vulcanizing apparatus</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>lower-side mold<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --></dd><dt>3</dt><dd>upper-side mold</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>sector mold</dd><dt>10</dt><dd>bladder</dd><dt>20</dt><dd>base mold</dd><dt>21</dt><dd>outer periphery</dd><dt>22</dt><dd>pattern-side joint surface (base mold)</dd><dt>23</dt><dd>end-side joint surface (base mold)</dd><dt>23A</dt><dd>bolt hole</dd><dt>25</dt><dd>joint surface (base mold)</dd><dt>26</dt><dd>circumferential end face</dd><dt>30</dt><dd>pattern mold</dd><dt>32</dt><dd>pattern-side joint surface (pattern mold)</dd><dt>33</dt><dd>end-side joint surface (pattern mold)</dd><dt>35</dt><dd>joint surface (pattern old)</dd><dt>36</dt><dd>circumferential end face (pattern mold)</dd><dt>42</dt><dd>pattern shaping surface</dd><dt>43</dt><dd>end-side joint surface</dd><dt>44</dt><dd>bolt hole</dd><dt>50</dt><dd>joint projection</dd><dt>51</dt><dd>joint recess</dd><dt>60</dt><dd>air-bleeding hole</dd><dt>61</dt><dd>fixing pin</dd><dt>70</dt><dd>bolt receiver</dd><dt>75</dt><dd>mating portion</dd><dt>76</dt><dd>bolt insertion hole</dd><dt>77</dt><dd>bolt</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90460261" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A method for producing a tire vulcanizing mold by assembling a pattern molding segment produced by rapid prototyping on a metal base segment, the method comprising:
