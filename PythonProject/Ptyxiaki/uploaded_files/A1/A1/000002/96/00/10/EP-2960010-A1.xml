a deburring machining section for performing deburring is provided on the inner circumferential surface of the recess. A preferred embodiment of the first aspect is as described in aspects 2 to 12.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In order to achieve the secondary object, in the present invention (the invention according to a thirteenth aspect),<br/>
a deburring device which is used in a machining apparatus which, on condition that a machining object has a stem portion and an expanded diameter portion which is integrated with one end side of the stem portion, so as to expand its diameter larger than the stem portion, includes a cutting device that cuts the stem portion of the machining object, a grinding device that grinds the stem portion of the machining object, and a pair of carrier members which are disposed so as to extend with a space between the cutting device and the grinding device, the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> pair of carrier members carry the machining object from the cutting device to the grinding device, the machining apparatus in which, when the pair of carrier members carry the machining object, the expanded diameter portion of the machining object is made to stride over the pair of carrier members, and the stem portion of the machining object is suspended downward from between the pair of carrier members,<br/>
a pair of pinching members which pinch the stem portion of the machining object when the machining object is carried to a predetermined machining position on the pair of carrier members, and a deburring tool which is disposed lower than the pair of pinching members, to perform deburring with respect to the stem portion of the machining object pinched by the pair of pinching members are disposed under the pair of carrier members,<br/>
the deburring tool has a recess for insertion of the stem portion of the machining object pinched by the pair of pinching members so that an opening of the recess faces the other end face of the stem portion of the machining object, and is capable of a displacement motion in an axis extension direction of the recess while rotating around an axis of the recess,<br/>
an inner circumferential surface of the recess in the deburring tool is formed so as to reduce its diameter as an inner diameter of the recess partitioned by the inner circumferential surface of the recess goes from an opening side of the recess toward an internal side of the recess, and<br/>
a deburring machining section for performing deburring is provided on the inner circumferential surface of the recess.</p><heading id="h0008">Effects of the Invention</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --><p id="p0010" num="0010">In accordance with the present invention (the invention according to the first aspect), after cutting the stem portion of the machining object by the cutting device, the machining object is carried to the grinding device by the pair of carrier members serving as carrier means, at the time of carrying the machining object, the expanded diameter portion of the machining object is made to stride over the pair of carrier members, and the stem portion of the machining object is suspended downward between the pair of carrier members. Therefore, when the deburring tool is moved up after the stem portion of the machining object is pinched by the pair of carrier members, the stem portion of the machining object enters into the recess in the deburring tool, and the burr on the cut end face rim portion of the stem portion (the other end face rim portion of the stem portion) in the machining object is eliminated by the deburring machining section on the inner circumferential surface of the recess in the deburring tool. Therefore, it is possible to eliminate the burr on the cut end face rim portion of the stem portion (the other end face rim portion of the stem portion) in the machining object by the pair of pinching members and the deburring tool disposed under the pair of carrier members, that is, in the same way as conventionally, it is possible to perform deburring without increasing a machining line length between the cutting device to the grinding device. In accordance therewith, the rubbing stone in the grinding device does not perform deburring, which makes it possible to prevent generation of abnormal wear in the rubbing stone in the grinding device.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In addition, in this case, the inner circumferential<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> surface of the recess in the deburring tool is formed so as to reduce its diameter as an inner diameter of the recess partitioned by the inner circumferential surface of the recess goes from an opening side of the recess toward an internal side of the recess, and the deburringmachining section for performing deburring is provided on the inner circumferential surface of the recess. Therefore, as the deburring tool is moved up, the burr on the cut end face rim portion of the stem portion in the machining object comes into contact with the deburring machining section on the inner circumferential surface of the recess opening side in the deburring tool to the deburring portion at the recess internal inner circumferential surface sequentially, to be eliminated, that is, in any case, deburring is not performed intensively on a specific area of the deburring machining section. Therefore, even when deburring is performed by use of a deburring tool in place of the rubbing stone in the grinding device, it is possible to prevent the deburring tool from being incapable of exceptionally-fast deburring.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In accordance with the invention according to the second aspect, the pair of pinching members are provided so as to be capable of a displacement motion in a displacement motion direction of the deburring tool, and biasing means is associated with the pair of pinching members so as to increase repulsion force as the pair of pinching members approach the pair of carrier members. Therefore, it is possible to keep pressing force per unit displacement applied to the stemportion of the machining object constant at the time of deburring, and it is possible to acquire the desired machining quality with respect to the stem portion (the cut end face rim portion) of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the machining object. That is, because it is possible to increase repulsion force of the biasing means according to an increase in displacement motion of the deburring tool, it is possible to prevent an excessive displacement motion of the deburring tool, and it is possible to suppress overload at the time of deburring.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In accordance with the invention according to the third aspect, the invention further includes displacement motion detecting means for detecting a displacement motion of the pair of pinching members, and control means for controlling the deburring tool to stop deburring machining with respect to the stem portion of the machining object pinched by the pair of pinching members when it is detected that the pair of pinching members make a displacement motion from a reference position at which external force for making a displacement motion is not applied, to a predetermined displacement motion position based on information from the displacement motion detecting means. Therefore, it is possible to keep an amount of machining (an amount of deburring) with respect to the stem portion (the cut end face rim portion) of the machining object constant, which makes it possible to manufacture products with constant quality.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In accordance with the invention according to the fourth aspect, the invention further includes a first stopper which is capable of selecting a movement restriction mode of restricting the machining object at a predetermined machining position on the pair of carrier members from moving from the predetermined machining position to a carrying downstream side, and a movement allowable mode of releasing the movement<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> restriction mode to allow the machining object to move, and which switches to the movement allowable mode when the pair of pinching members pinch (hold) the machining object at the predetermined machining position, and switches to the movement restriction mode when the pair of pinching members release pinching (holding) of the machining obj ect at the predetermined machining position, and a second stopper which restricts a movement of the machining object at a predetermined standby position on a carrying upstream side from the predetermined machining position on the pair of carrier members, and on the other hand, when the first stopper selects the movement restriction mode, releases only the movement restriction on a front machining obj ect among machining obj ects on the carrying upstream side from the predetermined standby position, to move the front machining object toward the first stopper. Therefore, even in the case where a machining object having a stem portion and an expanded diameter portion integrated with one end side of the stem portion so as to expand its diameter larger than the stem portion is carried from the cutting device toward the grinding device by use of the pair of carrier members, it is possible to securely position only one machining object to be machined at a predetermined machining position between the both devices sequentially according to machining timing.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In accordance with the invention according to the fifth aspect, the pair of carrier members are set as a pair of guide rails so that its height position becomes higher as it goes toward the carrying upstream side, and a machining obj ect carried by the pair of carrier members slides on the pair of carrier members under its own weight. Therefore, it is possible<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> to simplify the structure of the pair of carrier members (carrier means) by utilizing the own weight of the machining object, and even under the structure, it is possible to securely position only one machining object to be machined at a predetermined machining position sequentially according to machining timing.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In accordance with the invention according to the sixth aspect, the first stopper is set so as to enter a moving region of the stem portion of the machining object when the first stopper selects the movement restriction mode, and exit from the moving region of the stem portion of the machining object when the first stopper selects the movement allowable mode. Therefore, when the first stopper selects the movement allowable mode, the machining object is carried out of the predetermined machining position, and on the other hand, when the first stopper selects the movement restriction mode, the stem portion of the machining object comes into contact with the first stopper, and the expanded diameter portion of the machining object rotates to the carry-out side centering on the contact portion, and the carry-out side of the expanded diameter portion comes into contact with the pair of carrier members (the pair of guide rails). Thereby, it is possible to position the machining object in a stable state (in a posture that the stem portion of the machining object is perpendicular to the pair of carrier members) at the predetermined machining position by the pair of carrier members and the first stopper, and even in a simple structure in which the first stopper merely enters the moving region of the stem portion of the machining object, it is possible to securely stop carrying the machining object at the predetermined machining position by effectively<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> utilizing the pair of carrier members (the pair of guide rails) .

Therefore, not only it is possible to collectively attach the deburring tool and the pair of pinching members to the attachment substrate, thereby achieving consolidation and compactification of those, but also, even when the stem portion of the machining object is in a stable posture of being perpendicular to the pair of carrier members (a posture tilted to the vertical direction) at the predetermined machining position, it is possible to simply adjust the deburring tool into an optimum posture with respect to the stem portion (the cut end face) of the machining object from the standpoint of deburring due to adjustment in tilting motion of the attachment<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> substrate.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In accordance with the invention according to the eighth aspect, the pair of pinching members are attached to the attachment substrate so as to be capable of a displacement motion in an axis extension direction of the deburring tool, and the biapsing means is interposed between the pair of pinching members and the attachment substrate so as to increase repulsion force as the pair of pinching members approach the pair of carrier members. Therefore, it is possible to keep pressing force per unit displacement applied to the stem portion of the machining object constant at the time of deburring, and it is possible to acquire the desired machining quality with respect to the stem portion (the cut end face rim portion) of the machining object. That is, because it is possible to increase repulsion force of the biasing means according to an increase in displacement motion of the deburring tool, it is possible to suppress an excessive displacement motion of the deburring tool, and it is possible to suppress overload at the time of deburring.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In accordance with the invention according to the ninth aspect, the invention further includes pinching state detecting means for detecting a pinching state of the pair of pinching members with respect to the stem portion of the machining object at the predetermined machining position, first stopper mode change detecting means for detecting a mode change of the first stopper, and control means for switching the first stopper to the movement restriction mode when releasing pinching with respect to the stem portion of the machining object at the predetermined machining position to carry out the machining object based on information from the pinching state detecting<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> means, and for controlling the second stopper to release the movement restriction on the front machining object among machining objects on the carrying upstream side from the predetermined standby position when the mode of the first stopper is changed to the movement restriction mode based on information from the first stopper mode change detecting means. Therefore, it is possible to carry out a machining object finished with deburring machining at the predetermined machining position, and on the other hand, it is possible to feed a new machining object to be machined to the predetermined machining position in place of the carried-out machining object, and it is possible to precisely automate deburring onto the stem portion of the machining object.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In accordance with the invention according to the tenth aspect, the invention further includes machining object detecting means for detecting whether or not there is a machining obj ect at the predetermined machining position, and the control means controls the pair of pinching members so that the pair of pinching members pinch the stem portion of the machining object at the predetermined machining position when it is judged that there is a machining object at the predetermined machining position based on information from the machining object detecting means, and the control means moves the deburring tool toward the end face of the stem portion of the machining object when it is judged that the pair of pinching members pinch the stem portion of the machining object at the predetermined machining position based on information from the pinching state detecting means.
