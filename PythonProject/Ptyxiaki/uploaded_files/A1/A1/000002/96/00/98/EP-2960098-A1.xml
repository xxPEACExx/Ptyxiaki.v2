An infotainment system is commonly known to refer to hardware/software products and systems which are built into, or can be added to vehicles, in order to enhance the vehicle occupant experience when it comes to providing audio and visual entertainment, as well as automotive navigation systems. This includes for instance playing media such as media files, CDs, DVDs, and TV, as well as the incorporation of video game consoles into the vehicle. Infotainment systems of today are known to comprise one or several e.g. touch sensitive displays, also referred to as a touch screen, well known in the art. The touch sensitive displays are commonly utilized to display e.g. graphic, video, digital images, animations and text, and further utilized to display e.g. virtual buttons, menus, and other user-interface objects to thereby provide a user interface through which a vehicle occupant may interact with the infotainment system.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">On the other end, the use of handheld devices such as smart phones has increased rapidly in the last few years. Smart phones, for instance, may download various application programs ("applications", "apps") that operate on the phone. A user can utilize a user-interface of the phone to control the application and/or utilize the application in some way, such as watching the visual display or listening to the audio output.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Not surprisingly, extending applications from a handheld device to the vehicle has become a popular feature offered by various service providers and vehicle manufacturers.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> A handheld device connected to a vehicle is commonly referred to as a nomadic device, and includes all types of information and communication as well as entertainment devices that can be brought into the vehicle by the driver to be used while driving. Commonly, some of the applications, such as e.g. watching TV or a film, become unavailable should the vehicle speed exceed e.g. 4-8 km/h.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Current examples of nomadic devices include mobile phones, portable computers, Pocket PCs, PDAs, mobile navigation devices, iPods, DVD Players and multi-functional smart phones. Examples of extending applications from a nomadic device to the vehicle include the connection of MP3 players, iPods being connected via USB connections, and mobile phones such as smart phones being connected via e.g. wireless connections. All of these provide methods to bring content to and from the vehicle and allow a vehicle occupant to have some connectivity with the vehicle. As a result, the vehicle occupant can take advantage of better user interface components offered by the infotainment system of the vehicle, for instance a larger screen and a higher quality audio output.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Notwithstanding the advantages of pairing a nomadic device with the vehicle, the vehicle occupant may from time to time experience problems during his or her use of the nomadic device via the infotainment system. For instance, streaming of data may be interrupted or become slow, or a phone call may be dropped. The vehicle occupant may in such a scenario assume the problem to be caused by the infotainment system, or the connection thereto, although the root cause for the arisen problem may lay elsewhere, for instance in the nomadic device itself, or in the connection of the nomadic device to e.g. a cellular network.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2012047602A"><text>WO 2012/047602</text></patcit>, for instance, relates to operating mobile applications in a vehicle. The vehicle includes a computer that comprises a human machine interface (HMI) for control by a user of mobile applications executing on an application server. However, although vehicle-based operation of the mobile applications via the HMI is enabled, such that the user may take advantage of the better user interface components offered by the infotainment system, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2012047602A"><text>WO 2012/047602</text></patcit> does not consider the aforementioned dilemma of the vehicle being unfairly blamed for problems arising while utilizing functionality of the nomadic device through the infotainment system, which problems are not necessarily related to the infotainment system, but rather related to the paired nomadic device.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is therefore an object of embodiments herein to provide an approach of assisting a vehicle occupant in judging the cause of a problem which may arise while utilizing functionality of a nomadic device via an in-vehicle system.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to a first aspect of embodiments herein, the object is achieved by a method performed by a nomadic device paired with an in-vehicle system of a vehicle, for assisting a vehicle occupant utilizing functionality of the nomadic device via the in-vehicle system, in avoiding incorrectly assuming the in-vehicle system to be at fault rather than the nomadic device. The nomadic device determines, by means of a status determining unit, status data reflecting a current status associated with the nomadic device. The nomadic device furthermore provides, by means of a providing unit, status information to the in-vehicle system, which status information is based on the status data. Indicative information derived from the status information is adapted to be presented by the in-vehicle system.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Thereby, a vehicle occupant utilizing the nomadic device via the in-vehicle system may be notified of a current status associated with the nomadic device, through the in-vehicle system, in a convenient manner.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Accordingly, there is provided a solution according to which the vehicle occupant is assisted in judging whether an experienced e.g. problem may be related to the nomadic device rather than the in-vehicle system, subsequently reducing unnecessary e.g. phone calls to a vehicle support center.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Furthermore, an approach is suggested according to which, by informing, or alerting, the vehicle occupant of the current status associated with the nomadic device, via the in-vehicle system, resources of the in-vehicle system, such as display, loudspeakers and/or tactile signal-producing devices, may be utilized for the task. Accordingly, the indicative information may be presented in a user-friendly and/or safe manner to the vehicle occupant.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">For that reason, there is provided an approach of assisting a vehicle occupant in judging the cause of a problem which may arise while utilizing functionality of a nomadic device via an in-vehicle system.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The technical features and corresponding advantages of the above mentioned method will be discussed in further detail in the following.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">By introducing a method performed by a nomadic device paired with an in-vehicle system of a vehicle, for assisting a vehicle occupant utilizing functionality of the nomadic device via the in-vehicle system, in avoiding incorrectly assuming the in-vehicle system to be at fault rather than the nomadic device, an approach is provided which enables for a vehicle occupant to avoid unfairly blaming the vehicle end should the connected nomadic device be in a dysfunctional state. That is, by enabling for a vehicle occupant to judge whether a problem that has arisen while utilizing functionality of the nomadic device through the in-vehicle system, is likely to be related to the nomadic device end rather than the vehicle end, misplaced annoyance towards the vehicle and/or the in-vehicle system may be avoided. Furthermore, unnecessary e.g. calls to vehicle support centers may be avoided in that the vehicle occupant is made aware that the nomadic device is likely to be at fault rather than the vehicle and/or in-vehicle system.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The referred to "vehicle" may be represented by any arbitrary vehicle, for instance an engine-propelled vehicle, such as e.g. a car, truck, lorry, van, bus, tractor, military vehicle, scooter, motorcycle, air plane, vessel such as e.g. a ship, and/or golf cart. Alternatively, the "vehicle" may refer to a rail-bound vehicle, such as e.g. a train or tram. The "vehicle occupant" is intended to be interpreted in a broad manner, and may refer to any arbitrary person or persons being positioned within the vehicle, such as a potential driver or passenger(s) of the vehicle, or a person being positioned in the vicinity thereof.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The referred to "in-vehicle system", which may also be referred to as a built-in vehicle system, native in-vehicle control system or vehicle infotainment system, may refer to hardware/software products and systems which are permanently or temporarily built into, or can be added to the vehicle, in order to enhance the vehicle occupant experience when it comes to providing audio and visual entertainment, as well as automotive navigation systems. Accordingly, the in-vehicle system may comprise resources adapted for functionality control of the in-vehicle system, such as one or several displays,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> microphones, speakers, input/control devices such as physical push buttons, rocker buttons, dials, slider switches, sticks, and/or a touchpad.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Furthermore, the referred to "nomadic device" is a commonly known term for a handheld device, e.g. portable electronic device, connected/connectable to the vehicle, and may include all types of information, communication as well as entertainment devices that can be brought into the vehicle by the vehicle occupant with the intention to be used e.g. while driving. Current examples comprise mobile phones, portable computers, Pocket PCs, PDAs, mobile navigation devices, iPods, DVD Players and/or multi-functional smart phones. Other examples may include a surf plate, such as an iPad.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The nomadic device being "paired" with the in-vehicle system refers to the nomadic device being connected to the vehicle. Such a connection may for instance be accomplished physically, such as via USB connection, and/or wirelessly, such as via Bluetooth, WiFi, or the like. Possibly, in order to be paired, identification of the nomadic device may be necessary, and/or authentication of the vehicle occupant.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">While the nomadic device is paired, the vehicle occupant may utilize functionality of the nomadic device via the in-vehicle system. That is, the nomadic device may include various user application programs, e.g. either integrated into an operating system of the nomadic device, and/or stored in a memory thereof and executable by a processor thereof. Thus, user application programs may be hosted and run on the nomadic device while the vehicle occupant may interact with one or several of the user application programs through the in-vehicle system. Examples of user application programs include, for instance, applications available for the iPhone™ that are commercially available from Apple Computer, Cupertino, Calif., applications for phones running the Android™ operating system that is commercially available from Google, Inc., Mountain View, Calif., applications for BlackBerry devices, available from RIM, Ontario Canada, and/or applications available for Windows Mobile devices, available from Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash. Moreover, while the nomadic device is paired, the resources of the in-vehicle system may be utilized, such as e.g. microphones, speakers, displays and/or in-vehicle buttons for interacting with a selected user application program running on the nomadic device.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The expression "be at fault" is here intended to cover a scenario where the vehicle occupant experiences that e.g. a phone call or a user application running on the nomadic device, via the in-vehicle system, is not functioning properly. "Be at fault" may hence be interpreted in a broad manner, including an actual or perceived problem, fault, issue and/or misbehaviour experienced while utilizing the nomadic device via the in-vehicle system. For instance, a phone call may be dropped, or data traffic may be considered slow or even be interrupted. Insufficient 3G coverage may, for instance, result in interruptions in a song played from the nomadic device.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Since the nomadic device determines, by means of a status determining unit, status data reflecting a current status associated with the nomadic device, the nomadic device performs a status check, the result of which may indicate a potential problem, fault, issue and/or misbehaviour associated with the nomadic device. Accordingly, the nomadic device itself may assist in determining e.g. at least one status element, which subsequently may be of help in judging whether the experienced e.g. problem may be related to the nomadic device rather than the in-vehicle system.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The word "determining" may refer to learning of, reading, fetching, receiving and/or interpreting, and may take place periodically, substantially constantly or on request. The expression "status data" may refer to status related data, e.g. at least one status element. Furthermore, "reflecting" may refer to indicating, comprising and/or revealing, while "current" is intended to be interpreted in a broad manner, likewise including "essentially current". Moreover, the expression "associated with" may refer to "related to" or "connected to", and may hence refer to a potential e.g. problem of the nomadic device or, for instance, a radio connection to a radio communication network which the nomadic device is part of.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Accordingly, "determining status data reflecting a current status associated with the nomadic device" may hence refer to learning of, reading, fetching, receiving and/or interpreting at least one status element indicating, comprising and/or revealing an essentially current status related to or connected to the nomadic device itself or a radio communication connection thereof.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">For instance, the status data may be associated with five commonly known behaviours of a service: "Availability" (how much of the time is the service up and running?),<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> "Accessibility" (what is the likelihood that an attempt to use the service is successful?), "Retainability" (likelihood of successful completion), "Integrity" (how good is the service?), and "Utilization" (what is the service load?).</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Since the nomadic device furthermore provides, by means of a providing unit, status information to the in-vehicle system, which status information is based on the status data, information derived from the result of the status check is submitted to the in-vehicle system. Thereby, the in-vehicle system is informed of the outcome of the determined status data, which subsequently may be of help in judging whether the experienced e.g. problem may be related to the nomadic device rather than the in-vehicle system.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The expression "providing the status information" may refer to transmitting, submitting and/or sending the status information, e.g. comprised in a message or signal of a generic or customized format supported in the communication between the nomadic device and the in-vehicle system. "Status information" may refer to the determined status data as is, or information comprising the status data or a portion thereof, or the status data adjusted to comply with e.g. the communication protocol between the nomadic device and the in-vehicle system, or adjusted to comply with a format supported by the in-vehicle system. Furthermore, "based on" is throughout this disclosure intended to be interpreted to likewise include at least utilizing, considering, taking into account and deriving from.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Since indicative information derived from the status information is adapted to be presented by the in-vehicle system, the in-vehicle system may present information reflecting the previously discussed current status associated with the nomadic device. Thereby, a vehicle occupant utilizing the nomadic device via the in-vehicle system may be notified of said current status associated with the nomadic device, through the in-vehicle system, in a convenient manner. Accordingly, the vehicle occupant is assisted in judging whether an experienced e.g. problem may be related to the nomadic device end rather than the vehicle end, subsequently reducing unnecessary e.g. phone calls to a vehicle support center. Furthermore, by informing, or alerting, the vehicle occupant of the current status associated with the nomadic device, via the in-vehicle system, resources of the in-vehicle system, such as display, loudspeakers and/or tactile signal-producing devices, may be utilized for the task. Accordingly, the indicative information may be presented in a user-friendly and/or safe manner to the vehicle occupant, for instance visually, audibly and/or in a haptic manner, such as via vibration. Consequently, there would be no need<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> for the vehicle occupant to confront his or her nomadic device to learn of said current status, which has a potential to take the vehicle occupant's attention from driving.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The expression "indicative information derived from the status information" refers to the indicative information being based on the status information. The indicative information may hence be represented by the status information itself, or information comprising the status information or a portion thereof, or the status information adjusted to comply with the presentation means of the in-vehicle system. The "indicative information" may hence, for instance, refer to a visual output of one or a combination of e.g. letters, numbers, symbols, graphics, video, digital images, and/or animations, for instance visualized in a pop-up message. Additionally or alternatively, the indicative information may refer to an audible output, such as the indicative information being broadcasted as an acoustic message or signal.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">For instance, the indicative information may be represented by a visual output, such as a symbol, displayed on a display of the in-vehicle system e.g. situated in the center stack, in front of the driver in the dashboard, or represented by a head-up display projected on the wind screen. The symbol, for instance in the form of a triangle, may furthermore, take on a different color, such as green, orange or red, depending on the content of the status information. Furthermore, should the vehicle occupant be interested in evaluating further content associated with the status information, further information related to the status information may be displayed on selection thereof, for instance in a scroll down list.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">According to one embodiment, the status data may comprise a status indication, performance indication and/or an error indication associated with: the nomadic device itself, such as e.g. an indication of model (is the model supported by the in-vehicle system?), operating system version, device ID, SIM ID, SIM status, system uptime (if the nomadic device has been used for a long time), temperature, CPU load, capacity demanding applications, and/or battery status. Additionally or alternatively, the status data may comprise a status indication, performance indication and/or an error indication associated with: a radio communication connection between a radio communications network and the nomadic device, such as e.g. an indication of type of radio communications network and/or Quality of Service, for instance packet loss, jitter, streaming, signal strength, IP status, data connection and/or data activity (measuring bandwidth and activity). Additionally or alternatively, the status data may comprise a<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> status indication, performance indication and/or an error indication associated with: an application, "app", running on the nomadic device, such as e.g. in indication of Quality of Service, for instance packet loss, jitter and/or streaming.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Thereby, one or several elements indicating status of the nomadic device, a radio communication connection of the nomadic device, and/or an application running on the nomadic device, are determined, which subsequently may be of help in judging whether an experienced e.g. problem may be related to the nomadic device rather than the in-vehicle system. The expression "radio communications network" may refer to for instance a cellular communications network, or any arbitrary communications network providing the nomadic device with online abilities. The radio communication network may accordingly be represented by e.g. commonly known communication standard networks LTE, EDGE, CDMA, 4G, 3G, GPRS, or GSM. Furthermore, the word "application" may refer to a previously discussed user application program hosted and run on the nomadic device.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">According to another embodiment, the previously mentioned provision of the status information may comprise providing the status information via a dedicated application, "app", running on the nomadic device, and/or providing the status information via a standardized platform enabling direct access from the in-vehicle system to functionality, control and usage of the nomadic device. Thereby, feasible solutions are suggested by means of which the status information may be provided from the nomadic device to the in-vehicle system, in a convenient manner. The expression "dedicated application" is intended to refer to an application dedicated for said provision of the status information, and may for instance be represented by an adapted Volvo OnCall app or a specific application communicating with the in-vehicle system via e.g. Google Automotive Link (GAL). The expression "standardized platform", on the other hand, is intended to refer to a standard platform such as for instance Google Projection Mode (GPM), CarPlay or MirrorLink, or a successor thereof, supported by the nomadic device and the infotainment system.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">According to still another embodiment, the nomadic device may further refine, by means of a nomadic refining unit comprised in the nomadic device, a raw content of the status information to a refined content, prior to the previously mentioned provision of the status information. Thereby, the status information may be adjusted from raw data to refined data, whereby processing, e.g. interpretation, of the status information to a great extent<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> may be performed in the nomadic device in addition to, or rather than in, the in-vehicle system. Vice versa, should a raw content of the status information be refined to a refined content subsequent to the provision of the status information to the in-vehicle system, processing, e.g. interpretation, of the status information may to a great extent be performed in the in-vehicle system in addition to, or rather than in, the nomadic device. The word "refine" is intended to be interpreted in a broad manner, and may thus likewise include adapt, adjust, minimize and process. "Raw content" may refer to status information as such, e.g. the determined status data or a portion thereof. "Refined content", on the other hand, may hence refer to status information which, to some extent, has been refined.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">According to yet another embodiment, the previously mentioned determining of the status data may be initiated by a problem associated with the nomadic device being detected. Additionally or alternatively, the determining may be initiated by conditions of a subscription of the in-vehicle system being fulfilled, which subscription defines the conditions for the determining. Additionally or alternatively, the determining may be initiated by receiving, by means of a nomadic receiving unit comprised in the nomadic device, a status request from the in-vehicle system, which status request comprises a request for determining a current status associated with the nomadic device. Thereby, a detected problem, fulfilled conditions of a subscription, and/or a request from the in-vehicle system, may initiate determining of the status data.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The word "problem" may refer to e.g. a phone call being dropped, or data traffic being considered slow or being interrupted. The referred to "subscription of the in-vehicle system" is intended to refer to conditions which when fulfilled, may initiate determining of the status data. Such a subscription may be provided e.g. once, or regularly, to the nomadic device, as suitable for the implementation at hand. Furthermore, the referred to "status request" submitted to the nomadic device from the in-vehicle system, may be comprised in a message or signal of a generic or customized format supported in the communication between the nomadic device and the in-vehicle system. The status request may for instance be submitted by the in-vehicle system, should it be the in-vehicle system that detects the previously discussed "problem".</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">According to a second aspect of embodiments herein, the object is achieved by a method performed by an in-vehicle system of a vehicle, which in-vehicle system is paired with a<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> nomadic device, for assisting a vehicle occupant utilizing functionality of the nomadic device via the in-vehicle system, in avoiding incorrectly assuming the in-vehicle system to be at fault rather than the nomadic device.
