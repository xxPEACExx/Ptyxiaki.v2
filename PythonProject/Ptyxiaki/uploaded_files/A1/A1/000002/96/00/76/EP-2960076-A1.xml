exhibits a cavity resonance phenomenon caused by the length of a circular tube inside the tire. Further, a pneumatic tire, regardless of the type, generates noise having cavity resonance frequency in the range of 200 Hz to 270 Hz according to a circumference length thereof, and said noise is a main cause for unpleasant vehicle-interior noise.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As described above, since air resonance in the interior of the tire is a generation factor of the vehicle-interior noise, a method for absorbing noise in the interior of a tire is effective as an improvement method. Examples of conventionally proposed methods include, as disclosed in PTL 1, a technique of adhering short fibers to a tire inner peripheral surface.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In recent years, from the viewpoint of improving fuel efficiency of automobiles, there is a demand for a weight reduction of tires. To achieve weight reduction of tires, one of the following should be reduced: gauge of side portions (thickness); height of bead filler; number of carcass plies; height of carcass ply turn-up; and the like.</p><heading id="h0003">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">PTL 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004082387A"><text>JP2004082387A</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h0006">(Technical Problem)</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, reducing the gauge of side portions (thickness), the height of bead filler, the number of plies, the height of carcass ply turn-up, and the like, to achieve tire weight reduction, causes a decrease in the rigidity of the tire, and results in a decrease of steering stability and a decrease in strength against side cuts such as pinch cuts.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It could therefore be helpful to provide a pneumatic tire that enables suppressing at least one of the decrease in steering stability and the decrease in side cut resistance, and reducing cavity resonance sound, without greatly increasing tire weight.</p><heading id="h0007">(Solution to Problem)</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The pneumatic tire described herein has an aspect ratio AS of 55 % or less, wherein short fibers are fixed to a region of a tire inner peripheral surface including, at least in a part thereof, a position of the tire inner peripheral surface corresponding to a sidewall portion maximum width position, and tire thickness in the sidewall portion maximum width position is BW × (1 - AS) or less in a relation between bead core width BW and the aspect ratio AS.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">As used herein, "width" and "width direction" each refer to distance or length in tire width direction, and width direction of a tire. For the pneumatic tire described herein, the "aspect ratio", dimensions of each portion, and the like are measured when the tire is assembled with an applicable rim, with prescribed internal pressure applied and no load applied. The above "applicable rim" refers to a standard rim ("Design Rim" in the YEAR BOOK of TRA below, and "Measuring Rim" in the STANDARDS MANUAL of ETRTO below) specified by the standards below in accordance with tire size, "prescribed internal pressure" refers to air pressure specified by the standards below in accordance with the maximum load capability, and the "maximum load capability" refers to the maximum mass that the tire is allowed to bear according to the standards below. The standards are determined by valid industrial standards for the region in which the tire is produced or used, such as the "Year Book" of "THE TIRE AND RIM ASSOCIATION, INC. (TRA)" in the United States of America, "The European Tire and Rim Technical Organization (ETRO)" in Europe, and the "JATMA YEAR BOOK" of "the Japan Automobile Tire Manufacturers Association (JATMA)" in Japan.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Generally, if the thickness of the sidewall portion maximum width position is BW × (1 - AS) or less, the rigidity of the side portion is low, and therefore performance is insufficient in terms of steering stability and side cut resistance. In the disclosure, short fibers are fixed to this portion, and rigidity is enhanced by the adhesive layer formed by the adhesive used for<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> fixing, and as a result, it is possible to prevent a decrease in steering stability and side cut resistance. Further, these short fibers are disposed on the inner surface of the air chamber formed when assembling the tire to the rim and they exhibit a noise-absorbing effect to suppress the generation of cavity resonance sound. The above effect can surely be obtained with a pneumatic tire with an aspect ratio of 55 % or less.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In one embodiment of the pneumatic tire described herein, the short fibers are fixed to at least a part of a region of a tire inner peripheral surface from the position corresponding to the sidewall portion maximum width position to the outer side end in tire radial direction of the bead core, and bead filler height is 25 mm or less.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As used herein, "height" refers to the distance or length in tire radial direction.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">By setting the bead filler height to 25 mm or less, it is possible to contribute to tire weight reduction.

The pneumatic tire shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> has a pair of bead portions 1; a pair of sidewall portions 2; a tread portion 3 continued to the respective sidewall portions 2; a carcass 4 consisting of one carcass ply extending in a toroidal shape across the pair of bead portions 1 for reinforcing the bead portions 1, the sidewall portions 2 and the tread portion 3; a belt 5 consisting of two belt layers disposed on the outer side in the tire radial direction of the carcass 4 in the tread portion 3; a single belt reinforcing layer 6 disposed on the outer side in the tire radial direction of the belt 5; a bead filler 8 disposed on the outer side in the tire radial direction of a bead core 7 embedded in each of the bead portions 1; and an inner liner 9 disposed on the tire inner peripheral surface side of the carcass 4.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGs. 1 and 2</figref> show a tire assembled with an applicable rim, with prescribed internal pressure applied and no load applied.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The carcass 4 of the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> consists of a single carcass ply and has a main body portion extending in a toroidal shape across the pair of bead cores 7 and a turn-up portion wound around each bead core 7 from the inner side toward the outer side in the tire widthwise direction then toward the outer side in the tire radial direction. The number of plies and the structure of the carcass 4, however, are not limited to those in the aforementioned example in the pneumatic tire described herein. The bead filler 8 is disposed between the main body portion and each turn-up portion of the carcass in the pneumatic tire of the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the tread portion 3 of the pneumatic tire of the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the belt 5 consisting of two belt layers is disposed on the outer side in the tire radial direction of a crown portion of the carcass 4. The belt layers are generally steel cord layers coated with rubber and extending to be inclined<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> with respect to the tire equatorial plane E. The two belt layers of the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> are laminated such that steel cords constituting one belt layer intersect steel cords constituting the other belt layer with respect to the tire equatorial plane E, to together constitute the belt 5. Although the belt 5 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> consists of two belt layers, the number of the belt layers constituting the belt 5 may be three or more in the pneumatic tire disclosed herein. Although the pneumatic tire shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> has the single belt reinforcing layer 6 without a steel cord, disposed on the outer side in the tire radial direction of the belt 5, the pneumatic tire described herein may lack the belt reinforcing layer 6 or may have two or more belt reinforcing layers 6.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the pneumatic tire described herein, short fibers 10 described later are fixed to a region including, at least in a part thereof, a position corresponding to a maximum width position 11 where the sidewall portion of the tire inner peripheral surface has a maximum width MW. By applying short fibers to at least a part of the tire inner peripheral surface as described above, cavity resonance can be reduced.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The tire thickness (hereinafter also referred to as "gauge") of the maximum width position 11 in the sidewall portion of the pneumatic tire described herein, in a relation between bead core width BW and tire aspect ratio AS, is BW × (1 - AS) or less. The aspect ratio AS of the pneumatic tire described herein is 0.55 (55 %) or less, and more preferably 0.35 to 0.55. With an aspect ratio AS of 55 % or less, the rigidity improving effect obtained by applying the short fiber-fixed part described later is surely obtained. By setting the gauge of the sidewall portion to a thickness that satisfies the above expression, the tire weight before fixing short fibers can be made sufficiently light. However, if left this way, a decrease in steering stability and side cut resistance resulting from a decrease in the rigidity of the tire may be caused, and therefore, it is necessary to apply a short fiber-fixed part in at least a part of the region of the tire inner peripheral surface including at in least a part thereof a position in the tire inner peripheral surface corresponding to the sidewall portion maximum width position 11.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The bead filler height BH of the pneumatic tire described herein is preferably 25 mm or less, and particularly preferably 15 mm to 25 mm. By setting the bead filler height to 25 mm or less, the tire weight before fixing<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> short fibers can surely be reduced compared to a commercially available tire. However, if left this way, there is a risk of the rigidity in the vicinity of beads of the tire decreasing, and causing a decrease particularly in steering stability. In such case, it is preferable to apply a short fiber-fixed part to at least a part of the region of the tire inner peripheral surface (region U in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) from the position of the tire inner peripheral surface corresponding to the sidewall portion maximum width position 11 to the outer side end in the tire radial direction of the bead core.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the pneumatic tire described herein, the minimum tire thickness in the region from the sidewall portion maximum width position 11 to the outer side end in the tire width direction of the belt 5 (region D in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) is preferably 10 mm or less, and particularly preferably 6 mm to 10 mm. By setting the minimum tire thickness in this region to 10 mm or less, the tire weight before fixing short fibers can surely be reduced compared to a commercially available tire. However, if left this way, a decrease may be caused particularly in the side cut resistance of the tire, and therefore, in such case, it is necessary to apply a short fiber-fixed part in at least a part of the tire inner peripheral surface of the region D.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, the number of carcass plies at the sidewall portion maximum width position 11 of the pneumatic tire described herein is preferably three or less. By reducing the number of plies, the tire weight can be reduced.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In the pneumatic tire of the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, short fibers 10 are fixed to the tire inner peripheral surface of the tread portion 3 in order to further enhance the cavity resonance sound reduction effect. However, if it is desired to suppress the increase in weight, the fixing of short fibers to this portion may be omitted.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Examples of the short fibers 10 used in the short fiber-fixed layers include short fibers of organic synthetic fibers, inorganic fibers, regenerated fibers, natural fibers and the like. Examples of organic synthetic fibers include fibers made of: polyolefin such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polybutylene; aliphatic polyamide such as nylon; aromatic polyamide such as Kevlar; polyester such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, polyethylene succinate, polymethyl methacrylate; syndiotactic<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 1,2-polybutadiene; acrylonitrile-butadine-styrene copolymer; polystyrene; and copolymers of these polymers. Examples of inorganic fibers include carbon fiber, glass fiber and the like. Examples of regenerated fibers include rayon, cupro and the like. Examples of natural fiber include cotton, silk, wool and the like.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the pneumatic tire described herein, the short fibers are disposed preferably at a density of 500 fibers/cm<sup>2</sup> or more in the region where the short fibers are fixed to the tire inner peripheral surface. By doing so, a reduction effect of cavity resonance sound can surely be obtained. From the viewpoint of obtaining an even better cavity resonance sound reduction effect, the short fibers are disposed more preferably at a density of 1000 fibers/cm<sup>2</sup> or more, and particularly preferably at a density of 1,000 fibers/cm<sup>2</sup> or more and 20,000 fibers/cm<sup>2</sup> or less.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In another preferable example of the pneumatic tire described herein, the average length of the short fibers is 0.5 mm to 10 mm. By setting the length of short fibers to 0.5 mm or more, the effect of reducing the cavity resonance sound can be sufficiently obtained. On the other hand, by setting the average length of short fibers to 10 mm or less, it is possible to avoid the problem of tangling between short fibers which leads to an insufficient expression of noise-absorbing effect. From the same viewpoint, the average length of the short fibers is particularly preferably 2 mm to 8 mm.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The area where short fibers are fixed is preferably 25 % or more, particularly preferably 50 % or more, and further preferably 70 % or more of the area of the tire inner peripheral surface. By setting the area ratio of the area where short fibers are fixed to 50 % or more, the cavity resonance sound can surely be reduced.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In another preferable example of the pneumatic tire described herein, the average diameter of the short fibers is 1 µm to 500 µm. This way, thread breakage in a production process of the short fibers is suppressed, and a decrease in productivity of the short fibers can be suppressed. Further, it is possible to suppress the increase in rolling resistance caused by the increase in tire weight, and suppress the decrease in the fuel consumption rate of a vehicle on which the tires are mounted.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In the pneumatic tire described herein, a ratio (L/D) of length (L) with<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> respect to diameter (D) of the short fibers is preferably in the range of 5 ≤ L/D ≤ 2000. With a ratio (L/D) of length with respect to diameter of less than 5, the effect of reducing cavity resonance sound becomes small. On the other hand, with a ratio (L/D) of length with respect to diameter exceeding 2000, tangling may be caused between the short fibers and lead to an insufficient expression of noise-absorbing effect.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In the pneumatic tire of the present invention, it is preferable that the region where the short fibers are fixed consists of a plurality of short fiber-fixed layers, and that the plurality of short fiber-fixed layers are fixed independent of each other. By noncontinuously disposing the region where short fibers are fixed, even if the short fiber-fixed layer comes off, the area of coming off is kept very small, and the effect of suppressing cavity resonance can be maintained.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Production of the pneumatic tire described herein, comprises an applying process of applying an adhesive to a region including, at least in a part thereof, a position corresponding to a maximum width position 11 where the sidewall portion has a maximum width MW, and an adhering step of adhering short fibers to the part where an adhesive is applied. The production is characterized in that short fiber-fixed layers are formed in the tire inner peripheral surface with short fibers and an adhesive. With this production method, a pneumatic tire capable of suppressing generation of cavity resonance sound can be effectively produced.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The adhesive to be used is not limited to a particular type and any adhesive can be used. A polyurethane resin adhesive, an acrylic resin adhesive, an epoxy resin adhesive and the like are suitably used. The thickness of the formed adhesive layer is also not particularly limited as long as it does not exceed the length of short fibers. A thickness of 50 µm to 500 µm is preferable.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In the method for producing the pneumatic tire described herein, the short fibers 10 are preferably adhered to the tire inner peripheral surface by electrostatic flocking after the applying process i.e. during the adhering process. The short fibers 10 can be adhered to the tire inner peripheral surface by various methods. However, by applying an electrostatic flocking process, the short fibers 10 can easily be fixed to the tire inner peripheral<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> surface in a state where the short fibers 10 stand upright thereon, and a pneumatic tire that enables obtaining a noise-absorbing effect can be effectively produced.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Electrostatic flocking is a processing technique of electrically charging short fibers and attaching the short fibers, by electrostatic force, perpendicularly to an object with an adhesive applied thereto in advance. Therefore, it enables uniformly attaching short fibers to an object surface having a complicated shape and is suitable for attaching the short fibers 10 to a tire inner peripheral surface having a three-dimensional curvature.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The pneumatic tire described herein is generally assembled with a rim, and as a tire-rim assembly, it is mounted on a desired vehicle for use. In order to further enhance the effect of reducing cavity resonance sound, the above short fibers can be fixed to a part of or the whole rim.</p><heading id="h0011">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p0042" num="0042">Although the disclosure will be described below in further detail with reference to examples, the disclosure is not intended to be limited in any way to the following examples.</p><heading id="h0012">&lt;Examples 1 to 3&gt;</heading><p id="p0043" num="0043">Tires such as shown in Table 1, with reduced tire weight were prepared by reducing the gauge of the sidewall portion maximum width position and the above region D, as well as bead filler height BH from commercially available tires of size 255/35R20.
