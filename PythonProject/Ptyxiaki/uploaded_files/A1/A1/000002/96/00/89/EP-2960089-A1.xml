In particular, the invention relates to a mounting structure of an inverter that converts a direct-current electric power of a battery into an alternating-current electric power and that supplies this alternating-current electric power to a motor in an electric vehicle. "The electric vehicle" in the present specification includes a fuel-cell vehicle and a hybrid vehicle equipped with an engine as well as a motor.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">There are two types of vehicle body structures, that is, a monocoque structure and a frame structure. The monocoque structure imparts a structural strength by a plate material. The frame structure imparts a structural strength by a frame as a combination of beams. A motor vehicle of the frame structure has two beams extending in a longitudinal direction, as main members that impart a structural strength. The beams are referred to as side members or side frames. The two side members are main members of the frame. The two side frames are coupled to each other by an auxiliary beam extending in a vehicle width direction.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Main components of a drive train are arranged between the two side members in a front compartment, because a space between the two side members is suited to protect devices from an impact. A motor vehicle with an engine arranged between two side members is disclosed in, for example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2005029057A"><text>Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2005-029057</text></patcit> (<patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2005029057A"><text>JP 2005-029057 A</text></patcit>). <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2004175301A"><text>Japanese Patent Application<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Publication No. 2004-175301</text></patcit> (<patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2004175301A"><text>JP 2004-175301 A</text></patcit>) discloses an electric vehicle with the arrangement of an inverter improved. In the electric vehicle, a battery and the inverter, which converts a direct-current electric power of the battery into an alternating-current electric power to supply this alternating-current electric power to a motor, are arranged between two side members. Incidentally, in addition, the following art is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2005262894A"><text>Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2005-262894</text></patcit> (<patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP2005262894A"><text>JP 2005-262894 A</text></patcit>) as an art of protecting an inverter from an impact of a collision. According to the art, the inverter is fixed to a frame member by a clasp referred to as a bracket. A power cable is fixed to the bracket. The power cable is a cable that connects the inverter and the motor to each other, and is a component that is to be protected from an impact due to the flow of a large current therethrough. Upon receiving an impact, the bracket is also deformed as the frame member is deformed. For this reason, the amount of relative displacement of the inverter and the bracket is small. Therefore, the possibility of rupture of the power cable can be reduced.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is preferable that important devices be arranged between the two side members. In this case, however, the degree of freedom in arranging the devices is low. The present specification provides an art of effectively using a space of a front compartment of an electric vehicle. In the electric vehicle disclosed by the present specification, an inverter is arranged outside side members in a vehicle width direction, in a front compartment. Therefore, other devices can be arranged in a space between the two side members. It should be noted herein that "the side members" are a type of frame members of the vehicle as described above, and extend in a longitudinal direction of the vehicle. Besides, "the outside of the side members in the vehicle width direction" means a side that is further away from a center of the vehicle in the vehicle width direction than the side members. Besides, "the arrangement of the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> inverter outside the side members" does not necessarily mean that the entire inverter is located outside the side members. At least half of the inverter may be arranged outside the side members. Then, another device equivalent to half the volume of the inverter can be arranged between the two side members.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The inverter may be preferably fixed in the following mode. An inner side of the inverter in the vehicle width direction is fixed to one of the frame members. An outer side of the inverter in the vehicle width direction is fixed to a cabin outer plate. "The cabin outer plate" is a shell-like metal plate that defines a cabin. Furthermore, it is appropriate that the inverter be arranged above or below the side members, and that a fixation strength of the inner side of the inverter be lower than a fixation strength of the outer side of the inverter. By making the fixation strengths different from each other, the fixation between the side member and the inverter is first released upon reception of an impact diagonally from in front, so the inverter is freed from the side member. On the other hand, the inverter is linked with the cabin outer plate. Therefore, upon receiving an impact, the inverter can move as the cabin outer plate is deformed. The impact received by the inverter is mitigated through the movement of the inverter.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">While the side members are made of high-rigidity iron, the cabin outer plate is made from a steel plate, so the material of the side members exhibits higher rigidity than the material of the cabin outer plate. Therefore, with a view to making the fixation strength between the inverter and the side member lower than the fixation strength between the inverter and the cabin outer plate, it is appropriate to adopt, for example, a bracket that is more likely to be disengaged (more likely to be ruptured) than in the case of direct fixation by a bolt.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As described above, the degree of freedom in laying out the devices in the front compartment can be enhanced by arranging the inverter outside the two side members (outside in the vehicle width direction). Besides, the inner side of the inverter is fixed to one of the side members, and the outer side of the inverter is fixed<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> to the cabin outer plate. Also, the fixation strength of the inner side is made lower than the fixation strength of the outer side. Thus, upon receiving an impact diagonally from in front of the vehicle, the inverter is freed from the side member, but remains coupled to the cabin outer plate. The inverter is allowed to move to a moderate degree, so the impact can be mitigated.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the aforementioned structure, the inner side of the inverter in the vehicle width direction is fixed to one of the frame members. The advantage of the structure can also be obtained from the following structure. That is, both the inner and outer sides of the inverter in the vehicle width direction are fixed to the cabin outer plate, and the cabin outer plate is fixed to one of the frame members inside the inverter in the vehicle width direction. Then, the fixation strength of the outer side of the inverter in the vehicle width direction is made higher than the fixation strength of the inner side of the inverter in the vehicle width direction or the fixation strength between the cabin outer plate and the frame member. In such a structure as well, upon receiving an impact diagonally from in front of the vehicle, the inverter is freed from the side member, but remains coupled to the cabin outer plate. The inverter is allowed to move to a moderate degree, so the impact can be mitigated.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The details of the art disclosed by the present specification and further improvements thereof will be described subsequently with reference to embodiments of the invention.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1] FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view of an electric vehicle according to the first embodiment of the invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2] FIG. 2</figref> is a lateral view of the electric vehicle.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3] FIG. 3</figref> is a front view of the electric vehicle.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4] FIG. 4</figref> is an enlarged perspective view of a location where a side member<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> and an inverter are fixed to each other.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5] FIG. 5</figref> is a plan view showing an exemplary movement of the inverter upon reception of an impact diagonally from in front.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6] FIG. 6</figref> is a lateral view of an electric vehicle according to the second embodiment of the invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 7] FIG. 7</figref> is a front view of the electric vehicle according to the second embodiment of the invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 8] FIG. 8</figref> is a front view of an electric vehicle according to the third embodiment of the invention.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">Some preferred features of the art described in the embodiments of the invention will be listed below as to an attaching structure of an inverter.

Incidentally, a relationship among frame members of the vehicle, a cabin outer plate, and the inverter will be described herein, so the diagrammatic representation and description of other components will be arbitrarily omitted.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">A front compartment 31 of an electric vehicle 2 is mounted with a traction motor 6 and an inverter 4. The inverter 4 converts a direct-current electric<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> power of a battery 35, which is arranged in a luggage space in a rear part of the vehicle, into an alternating-current electric power, and supplies this alternating-current electric power to the motor 6. A large alternating current is supplied from the inverter 4 to the motor 6, so the inverter 4 is arranged close to the motor 6 with a view to reducing the transmission loss in electric power. Therefore, both the motor 6 and the inverter 4 are mounted in the front compartment.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The electric vehicle 2 has a frame structure. Two side members 3 are main components of a frame (frame members). The two side members 3 mainly impart a structural strength to the electric vehicle 2. The two side members 3 extend parallel to a longitudinal direction of the vehicle, and are coupled to each other by a plurality of cross members 21 that extend in a vehicle width direction. The motor 6 is arranged between the two side members 3. The motor 6 is fixed to the cross members 21. The motor 6 is arranged between the two high-strength side members 3. In the event of a collision of the vehicle, the side members 3 protect the motor 6.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The inverter 4 is arranged outside the side members 3 in the vehicle width direction instead of being arranged between the two side members 3. It should be noted, however, that the inverter 4 is fixed to one of the side members 3 via a bracket 7 by bolts 13 and 14. The bracket 7 is a clasp for attaching the inverter 4 to the side member 3, and is made from a metal plate.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Besides, the inverter 4 is also fixed to a cabin outer plate 5. The cabin outer plate 5 is a structure that defines a cabin (a boarding space 32), and is mainly made from a metal plate. Incidentally, a reference numeral 33 in the drawings denotes a seat in which a passenger is seated. The seat 33 is arranged in the cabin space 32.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As well shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">3</figref>, the inverter 4 is fixed to the side member 3 via the bracket 7 inside in the vehicle width direction, and is fixed to the cabin outer plate 5 outside in the vehicle width direction. Incidentally, a straight line CL indicates a vehicle center in the vehicle width direction in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>. Accordingly,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the inside in the vehicle width direction means a side that is closer to a centerline CL than the side members 3, and the outside in the vehicle width direction means a side that is further away from the centerline CL than the side members 3. Besides, in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, the cabin outer plate 5 is depicted only in the vicinity of the inverter 4, and the other part of the cabin outer plate 5 is not shown.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The bracket 7 is structured such that the inverter 4 is disengaged when a load of a predetermined magnitude is applied thereto. It should be noted herein that "the load of the predetermined magnitude" is a value lower than a fixation strength between the cabin outer plate 5 and the inverter 4. Besides, the fixation strength of the bracket 7 is adjusted such that the inverter 4 is disengaged from the side member 3 when an assumed collision impact is applied thereto. Conversely, the fixation strength between the cabin outer plate 5 and the inverter 4 is adjusted such that the assumed collision impact can be tolerated.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> shows an exemplary structure of the bracket 7. It should be noted that the depiction is vertically inversed in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> (see a coordinate system in the drawing). The bracket 7 has a through-hole 7a and a slit 7b. The bracket 7 is fixed to the side member 3 through the through-hole 7a by the bolt 13. On the other hand, the bracket 7 is fixed to the inverter 4 through the slit 7b by the bolt 14. A negative direction in an X-axis of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> is equivalent to a backward direction with respect to the vehicle. The slit 7b opens backward with respect to the vehicle. Therefore, when the load of the predetermined magnitude is applied to the inverter 4 backward with respect to the vehicle (in a direction indicated by an arrow A in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>), the inverter 4 is disengaged from the bracket 7, namely, from the side member 3.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Advantages of the aforementioned structure of the bracket 7 will be described. <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> is a plan view of the same electric vehicle 2 as in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. An arrow denoted by a reference symbol F represents an impact that the electric vehicle 2 receives from right in front. Thick lines indicate deformation of the cabin outer plate 5 upon reception of an impact, and the movement of the inverter 4. Upon receiving<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> an impact from right in front, a front-right portion of the cabin outer plate 5 bends leftward and backward. The outer side of the inverter 4 is fixed to the cabin outer plate 5, and the inner side of the inverter 4 is fixed to the side member 3. However, when the collision load applied backward exceeds the predetermined magnitude, the inverter 4 is disengaged from the bracket 7 to be freed from the side member 3. Therefore, the inverter 4 moves leftward and backward as the cabin outer plate 5 is deformed. Incidentally, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the inverter 4 is located above the side members 3. Accordingly, the inverter 4 can move leftward and backward without interfering with the side members 3. Upon receiving an impact, the inverter 4 is released from being fixed to the side member 3, and moves backward. The received impact is mitigated through the movement of the inverter 4.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the aforementioned structure, the inverter 4 is arranged outside the two side members 3. Therefore, other important devices can be arranged in a space between the side members 3. The electric vehicle 2 according to the embodiment of the invention is advantageous in that the degree of freedom in laying out the devices in the front compartment is high.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">(Second Embodiment) Next, the electric vehicle according to the second embodiment of the invention will be described. <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref> is a lateral view showing an electric vehicle 102 according to the second embodiment of the invention. <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 7</figref> is a front view showing the electric vehicle 102. The diagrammatic representation of a motor is also omitted in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. The electric vehicle 102 according to this second embodiment of the invention is an example in which the aforementioned attaching structure of the inverter is applied to a large-sized vehicle such as a pickup truck. In the case of a large-sized vehicle, the space of the front compartment 31 is high, and the space above front wheels is wide. In such a case, it is appropriate that the inverter 4 be arranged behind the center of the front compartment 31 in the longitudinal direction. A reference symbol L in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref> denotes the length of the front compartment 31 in the longitudinal direction. The inverter 4 is<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> arranged in a posterior half range (a range indicated by L/2 in the drawing) of the front compartment 31. By arranging the inverter 4 behind in the front compartment, the impact received by the inverter 4 in the event of a collision of the vehicle can be reduced.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Besides, when there is a space above the front wheels, it is appropriate that the inverter 4 be fixed to an upper portion of a fender apron 105a. The fender apron 105a constitutes part of a cabin outer plate 105, and is a location to which a front fender 108 is attached.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">(Third Embodiment) Next, the electric vehicle according to the third embodiment of the invention will be described. <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 8</figref> is a front view showing an electric vehicle 202 according to the third embodiment of the invention. The third embodiment of the invention is a modification example of the fixing structure of the inverter in the electric vehicle 2 according to the first embodiment of the invention. An inner side of the inverter 4 in the vehicle width direction, and an outer side of the inverter 4 in the vehicle width direction are fixed to a cabin outer plate 205. More specifically, the inner side of the inverter 4 and the outer side of the inverter 4 are fixed to the cabin outer plate 205 via brackets 207 by the bolts 14. The brackets are clasps for fixing an object. In this case, the brackets 207 are clasps for fixing the inverter 4 to the cabin outer plate 205.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The cabin outer plate 205 is fixed to the frame member 3 by the bolt 13, inside the inverter 4 in the vehicle width direction (on a side close to the centerline CL). Then, the fixation strength between the cabin outer plate 205 and the frame member 3 is lower than the fixation strength of the outer side of the inverter 4 in the vehicle width direction. The fixation strength of the outer side of the inverter 4 in the vehicle width direction is adjusted such that an assumed collision impact can be tolerated. The fixation strength between the cabin outer plate 205 and the frame member 3 is adjusted such that the cabin outer plate 205 and the frame member 3 are disengaged from each other when the assumed collision impact is applied thereto.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The same effect as in the electric vehicles according to the first and second embodiments of the invention is obtained from the structure of the third embodiment of the invention as well. That is, when the inverter 4 receives an impact, the cabin outer plate 205 and the side member 3 are released from being fixed to each other, so the inverter 4 is freed from the side member. As a result, the inverter 4 moves backward in accordance with the impact. The received impact is mitigated through the movement of the inverter 4.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Incidentally, in the third embodiment of the invention, the fixation strength between the cabin outer plate 205 and the frame member 3 is lower than the fixation strength of the outer side of the inverter 4 in the vehicle width direction. The same advantage is also obtained by making the fixation strength of the inner side of the inverter 4 in the vehicle width direction lower than the fixation strength of the outer side of the inverter 4 in the vehicle width direction, instead of establishing such a relationship between the fixation strengths.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In order to realize different fixation strengths, the bracket 7 exemplified in the first embodiment of the invention may be used. Different fixation strengths can also be realized by changing the diameters of the bolts for fixing the inverter. Concretely, a small-diameter bolt may be used to fix the outer side of the inverter in the vehicle width direction, and a large-diameter bolt may be utilized to fix the inner side of the inverter in the vehicle width direction, or to fix the cabin outer plate 205 and the frame member 3 to each other.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The points to remember about the art described in the embodiments of the invention will be mentioned. The side members 3 extending in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle are equivalent to an example of the frame members.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The representative and nonrestrictive concrete examples of the invention have been described in detail with reference to the drawings.
