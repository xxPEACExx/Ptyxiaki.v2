The injection molding machine shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> has a frame Fr, a mold clamping unit 10, an injection unit 40, and an ejector unit 70.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">First, the mold clamping unit 10 will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> and the like. The mold clamping unit 10 performs mold closing, mold clamping, and mold opening of a mold unit 30. The mold clamping unit 10 has a stationary platen 12, a movable platen 13, a rear platen 15, a tie bar 16, a toggle mechanism 20, a mold clamping motor 21, and a motion conversion mechanism 25. In the description of the mold clamping unit 10, a description will be made regarding a direction of movement (a rightward direction in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) of the movable platen 13 when<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> performing mold closing as the front and a direction of movement (a leftward direction in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) of the movable platen 13 when performing mold opening as the rear.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The stationary platen 12 is fixed to the frame Fr. A stationary mold 32 is mounted on the surface facing the movable platen 13 in the stationary platen 12.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The movable platen 13 is made so as to be able to move along a guide (for example, a guide rail) 17 which is laid on the frame Fr, and is made so as to be able to advance and retreat with respect to the stationary platen 12. A movable mold 33 is mounted on the surface facing the stationary platen 12 in the movable platen 13.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The movable platen 13 advances and retreats with respect to the stationary platen 12, whereby the mold closing, the mold clamping, and the mold opening are performed. The mold unit 30 is configured with the stationary mold 32 and the movable mold 33.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The rear platen 15 is connected to the stationary platen 12 through a plurality of (for example, four) tie bars 16 and is placed on the frame Fr so as to be able to move in a mold opening and closing direction. In addition, the rear platen 15<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> may be made so as to be able to move along a guide which is laid on the frame Fr. The guide of the rear platen 15 may be shared by the guide 17 of the movable platen 13.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In addition, in this embodiment, a configuration is made such that the stationary platen 12 is fixed to the frame Fr and the rear platen 15 is movable in the mold opening and closing direction with respect to the frame Fr. However, a configuration may be made such that the rear platen 15 is fixed to the frame Fr and the stationary platen 12 and is movable in the mold opening and closing direction with respect to the frame Fr.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The tie bars 16 are made so as to be parallel to each other in the mold opening and closing direction and extend according to a mold clamping force. A mold clamping force detector is provided in at least one of the tie bars 16. The mold clamping force detector may be a strain gauge type and detects the strain of the tie bar, thereby detecting the mold clamping force.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In addition, the mold clamping force detector is not limited to the strain gauge type and may be a piezoelectric type, a capacitive type, a hydraulic type, an electromagnetic type, or the like, and a mounting position thereof is also not limited to the tie bar 16.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> The toggle mechanism 20 is disposed between the movable platen 13 and the rear platen 15. The toggle mechanism 20 is configured with a cross head 20a, a plurality of links 20b and 20c, and the like. The link20bonone side is oscillatablymounted on the movable platen 13, and the link 20c on the other side is oscillatably mounted on the rear platen 15. The links 20b and 20c are oscillatably connected to each other by a pin or the like. The plurality of links 20b and 20c are bent and stretched by advancing and retreating the cross head 20a, whereby the movable platen 13 advances and retreats with respect to the rear platen 15.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The mold clamping motor 21 is mounted on the rear platen 15 and advances and retreats the cross head 20a, thereby advancing and retreating the movable platen 13. The motion conversion mechanism 25 for converting the rotation motion of the mold clamping motor 21 into linear motion and transmitting the linear motion to the cross head 20a is provided between the mold clamping motor 21 and the cross head 20a.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The motion conversion mechanism 25 includes a ball screw shaft 25a and a ball screw nut 25b. The ball screw shaft 25a is a male screw member having a thread groove at the outer periphery thereof. On the other hand, the ball screw nut 25b is a female screw member having a thread groove at the inner periphery thereof.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The ball screw shaft 25a is fixed to an output shaft of the mold clamping motor 21, thereby rotating along with the output shaft. On the other hand, the ball screw nut 25b is fixed to the cross head 20a. If the mold clamping motor 21 is driven, thereby rotating the ball screw shaft 25a, the ball screw nut 25b and the cross head 20a advance and retreat.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In addition, in this embodiment, the ball screw shaft 25a rotates and the ball screw nut 25b moves linearly. However, the motion of the ball screw shaft 25a and the ball screw nut 25b may be varied. For example, a configuration may be made in which the ball screw nut 25b rotates and the ball screw shaft 25a moves linearly. A configuration may be made in which one of the ball screw shaft 25a and the ball screw nut 25b is fixed and the other rotates and moves linearly. In this case, a bearing which rotatably supports the other is used and a member (for example, the cross head 20a) which retains the bearing moves linearly. Instead of a ball screw, a roller screw may be used. The roller screw may be either a planetary roller screw or a circulation roller screw.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the center line of the motion conversion mechanism 25 and the center line of the mold clamping motor 21 are disposed on the same straight line. However, the center lines may not<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> be disposed on the same straight line. In this case, the rotation motion of the mold clamping motor 21 is transmitted to the motion conversion mechanism 25 through a belt, a pulley, or the like.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The mold clamping motor 21 is driven, thereby advancing the cross head 20a, whereby the movable platen 13 advances, and thus the mold closing is performed. After the completion of the mold closing, a mold clamping force which is obtained by multiplying a thrust force of the mold clamping motor 21 by a toggle magnification is generated, and the mold clamping is performed using the mold clamping force. At the time of the mold clamping, a cavity 34 is formed between the movable mold 33 and the stationary mold 32, and the cavity 34 is filled with a liquid molding material. The molding material in the cavity 34 is solidified, thereby becoming a molding product. Thereafter, the mold clamping motor 21 is driven, thereby retreating the cross head 20a, whereby the movable platen 13 retreats, and thus the mold opening is performed.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Next, the ejector unit 70 will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> and the like. The ejector unit 70 pushes the molding product out from the mold unit 30 after the molding opening. The ejector unit 70 has an ejector motor 71 and an ejector rod 77. In the description of the ejector unit 70, similarly to the description of the mold clamping unit 10, a description will<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> be made regarding a direction of movement (the rightward direction in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) of the movable platen 13 when performing the mold closing as the front and a direction of movement (the leftward direction in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) of the movable platen 13 when performing the mold opening as the rear.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The ejector rod 77 is inserted into a through-hole of the movable platen 13 and made so as to be able to advance and retreat with respect to the movable platen 13.
