The towing hook can be a part of a retractable towing hook arrangement adapted to enable the towing hook, after being mounted to the vehicle, to be displaced between a towing position and a retracted position. The disclosure also relates to a gear for a displacement device for a towing hook and a displacement device for a towing hook comprising such gear.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Towing hooks for towing e.g. trailers are commonly used today on vehicles. In most cases a towing hook is mounted on the vehicle during the assembly process of the vehicle, although after sales mounting, e.g. by an authorized garage, is possible. For esthetical and practical reasons it may be desirable to have a towing hook which can be displaced between a towing position and a retracted position. Generally such towing hooks can also be referred to as retractable towing hooks.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">There are several considerations when constructing a towing hook of the retractable kind. The available space in which a retractable towing hook arrangement can be mounted on a vehicle varies between different manufactures and models. The rotation path, movement path or movement pattern, of the towing hook can be very space consuming and impart restrictions on the configuration of the towing hook. The towing hook should further, when in the retracted position, not be visible or at least not be clearly visible so as not to affect the aesthetic appearance of the vehicle. It is also important that the towing hook can be retracted to a position in which it is subjected to no or low risk of being damaged by the ground on which the vehicle rests or travels over, or by loose objects from the ground such as dirt or rubble.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">An example of a retractable towing hook arrangement is disclosed in the European patent no. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1894752B1"><text>EP 1,894,752 B1</text></patcit>. The towing hook in the mentioned patent projects from a bearing housing which forms the socket portion of a ball and socket joint. The towing hook has a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> ball portion forming the corresponding ball of the ball and socket joint. The ball and socket joint enables the towing hook to be displaced between a towing position, sometimes referred to as an operative position, and a retracted position, sometimes referred to as an inoperative position. A cam track cooperates with a displacement device comprising a gear arranged on a motor-driven axle, effects displacement of the towing hook between the towing position and the retracted position. The cam track is arranged In a groove on the ball portion of the towing hook and defines a predetermined rotation path for the towing hook along which the towing hook can rotate between the towing position and the retracted position. A second rotating axle operates a lock to prevent the towing hook from rotating when in the towing position.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Little is mentioned how the cam track can be manufactured in an efficient manner. Little is also mentioned about the cam track itself. The tolerance between the gear that drives the ball portion of the towing hook and the cam track have usually been very important. Due to complex manufacturing procedures, and that towing hooks generally are subjected to high stress levels during use, towing hooks comprising ball portions with cam tracks have been difficult and costly to manufacture. They generally also require separate components to be assembled.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to remove, or at least reduce some of the drawbacks of the prior art, or at least to provide for a useful alternative. These objects are at least partly met by a towing hook comprising a ball portion comprising at least one cam track, wherein the cam track is at least partly formed by recesses having a radius curvature.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It has been found that the high demands on tolerance between a cam track of a ball portion on a towing hook, and a drive gear, i.e. a gear adapted to cooperate with the cam track, is less important than first realized. It has been found that the method and the simple geometry of the cam track of the ball portion make it significantly easier to manufacture good gear teeth on a ball portion of the towing hook, i.e. on a 3D surface.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">By making the cam track at least partly formed by recesses having a radius curvature. Gear teeth of the cam track can be made robust, which shortens machining time and<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> improves the quality, i.e. tolerance control. It also makes the cam track less susceptible to ordinary wear and tear. This enables the cam track to be manufactured in a cost efficient manner. This is even more important on 3D surfaces, such as the ball portion of the towing hook, as 3D surfaces generally are both difficult and expensive to handle and to machine in a manufacturing process. It has also been found that the function of a retractable towing hook is not significantly reduced and that it is less sensitive to the usual wear and tear if the cam track is at least partly formed by recesses having a radius curvature. The gear teeth of the cam track can optionally be formed with smoother transitions between the recesses of the gear teeth, optionally with blunt tips of the gear teeth.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The towing hook can comprise a first end adapted to be connected to a towable object and a second end comprising the ball portion. The ball portion is adapted to form a ball of ball and socket joint of a towing hook arrangement. The socket joint may be formed by a bearing housing for example. The retractable towing hook arrangement enables the towing hook to be displaced between a towing position and a retracted position when mounted on the vehicle.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The cam track comprises a plurality of gear teeth, wherein at least two of the gear teeth of the cam track are at least partly formed by the recesses having a radius curvature. The cam track can be provided with gear teeth at least partly formed by recesses having a radius curvature, and optionally with gear teeth having other forms. It is preferable that all of the gear teeth of the cam track are at least partly formed by recesses having a radius curvature. Substantially each, or each, of the gear teeth of the cam rack can be separated by a recess having a radius curvature.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The radius curvature can have a radius from 1-20 mm, preferably 1-10 mm. The radius can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 mm for example.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The ball portion can be provided with a groove, sometimes referred to as a cam groove, and the cam track can be arranged in the groove. It has been found advantageous if the cam track is formed by a portion of the groove. A groove generally has a first and a second side wall, and a bottom. The groove may be provided with a first and a second transverse side wall but that is not necessary if the groove extends through the ball portion. The cam track can be formed from one or both of the side walls of the groove.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">This is a very cost efficient and favourable manner to manufacture a cam track of the ball portion. It also enables a simple connection with a displacement device, such as a gear driven by an electric motor,</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">It should be noted that the cam track and the groove, can have different shapes and forms. The cam track and groove can have a J-shaped form for example. The shape and the form of the cam track and the groove is however adapted according to the path that the towing hook is intended to pivot during displacement between the towing position and the retracted position.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The cam track can be integrally formed with the ball portion, i.e. formed in one unitary piece of material with the ball portion, or it can be formed by a separate piece of material attached to the ball portion. It is advantageous however to have the cam track is formed in one unitary piece of material with the ball portion. This enables the manufacturing of the ball portion to be simplified and cost efficient. It minimizes errors imparted due to differences in tolerances which may arise when working with separate components which must match each other during an assembly procedure.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The recesses can have a cylindrical form. Optionally, the recesses may have the form of a truncated cone, preferably with the truncated tip pointing towards the point of rotation of the ball portion.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">When the towing hook rotates between the towing position and the retracted position, the towing hook and the ball portion rotates about a point of rotation. The point of rotation can be substantially at the center of the ball portion, or it can be centrally positioned at a center point of the ball portion.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As mentioned, the ball portion comprises a point of rotation. The recesses of the cam track can extend towards the center of the ball portion, preferably towards the point of rotation of the ball portion. In more general terms, the recesses of the cam track are oriented towards the point of rotation of the ball portion. The benefits with this are the same as the benefits mentioned above. When manufacturing the ball portion, it has been found that the cam track and the recesses are advantageously oriented towards the point of rotation as this simplifies the milling of the cam track. It is believed that this is further simplified if the milling tool and the ball portion are displaced simultaneously when milling<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the cam track. It is however also advantageous when the towing hook is displaced, as a gear on a displacement device drives the towing hook via the cam track on the ball portion. When the ball portion rotates during displacement of the towing hook, the cam track interact well with a drive gear as the cam track is configured to take into account the rotation of the ball portion.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Due to the orientation of the recesses of the cam track and the gear thee, the cam track of the ball portion forms a spherically shaped cam track which can be operated by a straight gear. The cam track is thus of a bevel gear type, which is operated by a straight gear. This is enabled by the robust gear teeth of the cam track.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Gear teeth can further be described as having a length, a width and a height.<br/>
It should be noted that the recesses of the cam track may be oriented towards the point of rotation of the ball portion while the length of the gear teeth are not, some offset may be present. It is however advantageous if both the recesses and the length of the gear teeth are oriented towards the point of rotation of the ball portion; preferably extend towards the point of rotation of the ball portion.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The gear teeth of the cam track can be said to comprise a base with a tip. At least a portion of the tip can be provided with an arc shaped form. The tip of the gear teeth can however have different forms. It is believed that it is advantageous if the tip has a flat section. The flat section can be combined with curved edges extending along the length of the gear teeth which preferably transcends to the arc shaped form. Such curved edges preferably have a radius curvature. The arc shaped form extends along the length of the gear teeth. The flat section can have a triangular form. Optionally it may have a trapezium, or trapezoid, form. The triangular form of the flat section has a base and an apex. This will provide for a strong tip, i.e. not to pointy, which can withstand a lot of wear and tear as may be the consequence of having a cam track with less tolerance with respect to a gear of a displacement device and at least some of the conventional technique. If the cam track is formed in one side wall of a groove, the length of the gear teeth are preferably oriented towards the point of rotation of the ball portion, preferably extending towards the point of rotation.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The ball portion comprises a substantially spherical peripheral surface. The outer form of the ball portion should be adapted so that the ball portion can form a ball of a ball and socket joint to enable the towing hook to be displaced between a towing position and a retracted position. The cam track of the ball portion may be positioned on different places on the ball portion. There can further be one or more cam tracks. The cam track can be arranged in a groove, optionally formed by a part of the side wall of the groove. A cam track can be arranged on the spherical peripheral surface of the ball portion. If the cam track is arranged on the peripheral surface of the ball portion, the gear teeth are oriented away from the point of rotation</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The present invention also relates to a gear for a displacement device, such as the displacement device disclosed herein, to displace a towing hook between a towing position and a retracted position. The gear comprises a plurality of gear teeth having a length extending along a rotation axis of the gear, and an engagement portion for engaging with a cam track of a ball portion of said towing hook. The plurality of gear teeth has a first and a second width along the length of the gear teeth and at the engagement portion of the gear teeth.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The gear teeth have a first portion having a constant width and a second portion having a decreasing width along the length L of the gear teeth at the engagement portion of the gear teeth. The width thus continuously decreases from the portion having a constant width along the length of the gear teeth, and preferably continuously decreases to a width which is about 50 % of the width at the first portion. The gear teeth improve the connection between the cam track of the ball portion of the towing hook and the gear of the displacement device.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to an aspect, the present invention relates to a kit of a towing hook comprising a ball portion as disclosed herein, and a displacement device comprising a gear as disclosed herein. The contact between the cam track of the ball portion of the towing hook and the gear of the displacement device starts as a line contact, i.e. a line contact surface, and rolls off as a point, i.e. a point contact surface. It is believed that this has benefits on wear, strength and smoother displacement.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">It has been found that much is gained by a cam track which is manufactured in one piece of material with the ball portion of a towing hook. It is an object of the present invention to<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> remove, or at least reduce some of the drawbacks of the prior art, or at least to provide for a useful alternative. This object is met by a method for manufacturing a cam track on a ball portion. The ball portion can be integrally formed with a towing hook or it can be connectable to a towing hook. The method comprises the steps of;
<ol><li>a) milling a groove having a first and a second side wall and a bottom in the ball portion;</li><li>b) milling a second groove in the first side wall of the groove;</li><li>c) milling a cam track in the first side wall of the groove. The cam track is at least partly defined by the second groove of the first side wall of the groove.</li></ol></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The method provides for a manufacturing which is cost efficient, effective and which can be performed directly on a ball portion of a towing hook. It can be machined with standard, straight tooling. The second groove milled in the first side wall of the groove thus partly forms the sides of the gear teeth which are milled in the subsequent step. The cam track can be milled so that the cam track is aligned with the peripheral surface of the ball portion. In this way the cam track is not protruding from the peripheral surface of the ball portion but rather extends towards the center of the ball portion. The position and shape of the gear teeth can be made more accurate than is done separately by casting. Even if machining the cam track adds more machining time, by having the cam track manufactured in one piece of material with the ball portion, it saves components and assembly time and is therefore more cost effective.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The positions of the gear teeth of the cam track are individual in terms of that each gear tooth has a unique position, or a unique angle, on the ball portion. Simultaneous machining and displacement of the ball portion can advantageously be performed between the recesses, i.e. at the tip of the gear teeth. The cam track can be formed, or partly formed, by milling recesses having a radius curvature.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The orientation of the recesses towards the center of the ball portion, preferably towards a point of rotation of the ball portion has been found to be advantageous as it improves the cam tracks interaction with a displacement device, such as a rotating gear which intermeshes with the cam track to displace a towing hook.

For the sake of clarity, the bumber 2 has been<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> made transparent to better show the retractable towing hook arrangement 10. The vehicle 1 can be an automobile such as an SUV, a lorry, a tractor, a recreational vehicle (RV) or the like. The retractable towing hook arrangement 10 comprises a towing hook 11 intended to be connected to a towable object enabling the vehicle 1 to tow the towable object. A towable object can be a trailer such as a trailer for recreational sports equipment e.g. a boat trailer, jet-ski trailer or the like, or a caravan. A second group of towable objects are those which are mountable onto the towing hook 11 but are not trailed such as bicycle carriers or luggage carriers.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The towing hook 11 is adapted to be displaced between a towing position, shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1a</figref>, and a retracted position, shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> b. In the towing position, the towing hook 11 is ready to be connected to a towable object and tow the towable object while in the retracted position, the towing hook 11 is substantially hidden behind the bumper 2 and is inoperable in terms of that it cannot be connected to a towable object. <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> also shows a bearing housing.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> shows the retractable towing hook arrangement 10 in greater detail. <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> shows the towing hook 11, a lock device 12 and a displacement device 13. The lock device 12 is adapted to lock the towing hook 11 in the towing position and in the retracted position. The displacement device is adapted to operate, or drive, the displacement of the towing hook 10 between the towing position and the retracted position. Both the lock device and the displacement device 12, 13 are operated via electrical motors 14, 14'. It should be noted that a retractable towing hook arrangement 10 described herein may be manually operated if desired, either if none electrical motors are present or if one or more of the electrical motors 14, 14' are temporarily or permanently disabled.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The towing hook 11 comprises 1 first and a second end 15, 16.

In <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>, the first end 15 of the towing hook 11 is a standardized towing ball. The second end 16 of the towing hook 11 comprises a ball portion 20, or a ball. The ball portion 20 forms the ball of a ball and socket joint. The ball and socket joint permits the towing hook 11 to be displaced between the towing position and the retracted position.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">For the purpose of orientation, the following axes of rotation will be used herein. X axis, corresponding to the height direction of the vehicle 1, the Y axis corresponding to the longitudinal extension of the vehicle, and the Z axis, corresponding to the transverse extension of the vehicle. The extensions of the vehicle 1 are to be understood as when the vehicle 1 is in a ready to use state. In this sense the height direction of the vehicle 1 and the X axis can also be referred to as a vertical axis. The X, Y and Z axes are perpendicular to each other and intersect at an origin P at a center point of the ball portion 20. As described herein, the origin is the point of rotation P about which the towing hook 11 rotates during displacement. When the towing hook 11 rotates, it thus rotates about at least one of the X, Y or Z axes. Due to the ball portion of the towing hook, the ball portion can form a ball of a ball and socket joint, and thus rotate about at least two of the X, Y, and Z axes, preferably about all three X, Y, and Z axes.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> shows second end 16 and the ball portion 20 of the towing hook 11 in greater detail. The ball portion 20 comprises a cam track 21 comprising a plurality of gear teeth 22. The cam track 21 is adapted to be in working cooperation with a gear 18 of the displacement device 13. As is noticed, the gear 18 is a straight gear. Hence the cam track can be operated, or driven, with a straight gear which is advantageous. The gear 18 is connectable to a shaft (not shown) which is operated via the electrical motor 14' so that when the gear 18 rotates, the ball portion 20, and the towing hook 11, is displaced along a path defined by the path of the cam track 21 of the ball portion 20. The general principle of this is disclosed in European patent publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP1894752B1"><text>EP1894752 B1</text></patcit>, and will not be described in greater detail herein.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The cam track 21 is integrally formed with the ball portion 20 of the towing hook 11, but could be formed by a separate piece of material connected to the ball portion 20 of the towing hook 11.

In <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>, the cam track 21 is arranged on the first side wall 31, i.e. the inner curved side wall. It should be noted that the cam track 2 could be formed on other<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> places on the ball portion if desired such as on the second side wall 32, i.e. on the outer curved side wall, on the bottom 33, or on any other suitable surface of the ball portion 20.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> shows the cam track 21 of the ball portion 20 in greater detail. The cam track 21 is formed integrally with the side wall of the groove 30, and more specifically in the first side wall 31 of the groove 30. As is noticeable, the first side wall 31 comprises three sections, a lower section 35, a middle section 36 and an upper section 37. The cam track 21 positioned in the upper section 37 of the first side wall 31 of the groove 30 and is aligned with the peripheral surface 20p of the ball portion. Each of the lower section 35, the middle section 36, and the upper section 37 serves its own purpose. The lower section 36 defines a lower gear receiving groove in which a portion of the gear of the displacement device (not shown) may be guided to provide stability to the gear of the displacement device as it rotates. The middle section 36 widen the groove 30 and provides extra space for that portion of the gear 18 having teeth. The upper section 37 of the groove 30 is provided with the cam track 21 and enables the ball portion 20 to be displaced via the gear of the displacement device. Hence a groove 30 of the ball portion 20 can comprises a plurality of functional sections, e.g. three sections. A side wall of the groove 30 of the ball portion 20 can be provided with sections having different width, measured as indicated with the arrows in <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 4</figref>. The lower section 35 of the groove 30 has the smallest width, the middle section 36 of the groove 30 has the largest width and the upper section 35 of the groove 30 has a width which somewhere between that of the smallest width and the largest width.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The gear teeth 22 of the cam track 21 will be described in greater detail with reference to <figref idrefs="f0005">figure 5.

The method is also applicable for a method for manufacturing a towing hook comprising a ball portion comprising at least one cam track, such as the cam track described above.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The method will be described in greater detail with reference to <figref idrefs="f0007">figures 7a-7b. Figure 7a</figref> shows a portion of the ball portion 20 of the towing hook 11. It is important to understand that the method is applicable to a ball portion connectable to a towing hook, and towing hook with a ball portion, such as the towing hook 11 described herein. The ball portion for a towing hook can thus be manufactured separate as an individual component with respect to the remaining parts of the towing hook and especially the stem and the end to which a towable object is connected. A portion of the groove 30, or cam groove, and the first and the second side walls 31, 32 are also visible.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The method steps will now be described. The groove 30, hereafter referred to as the cam groove 30, is initially formed. It may be formed by milling it, or if molding the ball portion, during such molding process. When the first relatively deep cam groove 30 has been formed, a second groove 36' is milled. The distance between the peripheral surface 20p of the ball portion 20 and the second groove 36' will define the length L (shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">figure 6</figref>) of the gear teeth 22 about to be formed. In a more general term, the length L of at least one gear tooth, or one or more of the gear teeth, are defined by the milling of the second groove 36' of the ball portion 20. The second groove 36' is equivalent with the middle section 36 described above, and is milled in a direction substantially perpendicular to the cam groove 30. The distance between the between the peripheral surface 20p of the ball portion and the second groove 36' is kept constant throughput the milling process of the second groove 36'. It is possible that on or more sections of the cam track 21 may be provided with gear teeth having longer or shorter length L if desirable. This can be enabled by varying the distance of the second groove 36' from the peripheral surface 20p of the ball portion.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Subsequently after milling the second groove 36 in the first side wall 31 of the ball portion 20, the cam track 21 is milled. The cam groove 30 is at this stage provided with the first and the second side wall 31, 32 and the bottom 33 (not shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">figures 7a-7b</figref>). The second groove 36 which was milled earlier simplifies the milling of the cam track 21 as it provides for space for the milling tool. The cam track 21 is milled so that the recesses 25, 25' and the length L of the gear teeth 22 are offset with respect to the point of rotation P of the ball portion, as is schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">figure 7b</figref> with straight lines. It has been found that forming the cam track 21 in this manner simplifies the cooperation with a gear of a displacement device when displacing the towing hook 11 between a towing position and a retracted position.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The cam track 21 is thus at least partly formed by the second groove 36'. Further, the length L of at least one, or one or more, preferably a majority of the gear teeth 22, is defined by milling the second groove 30 of the ball portion 20.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The cam track 21 is further milled so that the recesses 25, 25' are provided with a radius curvature. The radius of the curvature is 2 mm, but could be set to an appropriate radius of from 1-20 mm, preferably 1-10 mm. The radius curvature can be constant throughput<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> the length L of the gear teeth 22, or be changing in terms of that a truncated cone is provided instead of a cylindrical form of the recesses 25, 25'. This can be controlled by the selection of appropriate milling tools. The milling of the recesses 25, 25' is performed so that so that the recesses 25, 25' extends in a direction towards the center of said ball portion, and as mentioned so that they are directed, or pointing, towards the point of rotation P of the ball portion 20.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">One method step is to machine the tip T of the gear teeth 22, 22'. A tip T of a gear tooth 22 can be machined by displacing the ball joint simultaneously as the milling tool is displaced. Hence in a more general aspect, parts of the cam track 21 can be formed by milling during displacement of both the ball portion and the milling tool. The step of machining of the tip T of the gear teeth 22, 22' is subsequently performed after the recesses 25, 25' has been milled, or the recesses and the tips T are machined intermittently. If a radius on the tip T of the gear teeth 22, 22' is desirable; such radius is efficiently manufactured by milling during simultaneous displacement of the ball portion and the milling tool.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059"><figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8</figref> shows an alternative gear which can be used with the displacement device 13 (shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>). The gear 18 comprises a plurality of gear teeth 18'. As is noticeable, the width of the gear teeth 18' of the gear 18 is non -uniform. The gear teeth 18' are thicker in that end which is closest to the center of the ball portion. In practice this means that the cam track of the ball portion of the towing hook will engage a tilted surface with respect to the elongation, i.e. the length L of the gear teeth 18'. Hence it is also within the present invention to provide a gear for use with a displacement device to displace a towing hook between a towing position and a retracted position. The gear comprises a plurality of gear teeth 18' having a length L extending along a rotation axis Rg of the gear 18. The plurality of gear teeth 18' has a varying width along the length direction L of the gear teeth 18'. <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8</figref> shows the width indicated with references Wg1, Wg2 of the gear teeth 18'. That end of the gear teeth 18' which is proximal to the point of rotation P (shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">figure 7b</figref>) of the ball portion of the towing hook, is thicker than the portion of the gear teeth 18' distal to the point of rotation P (shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">figure 7b</figref>) of the ball portion of the towing hook. The gear teeth 18' have a first portion having a constant width and a second portion having a decreasing width. The width Wg2 of the second portion decreases to about 50 % of the width of the first portion.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The purpose of the gear teeth 18' having a varying width is that the cam track of the ball portion simultaneously can have a point contact on one gear tooth and a line contact on another gear tooth of the cam track. The contact between the cam track of the ball portion of the towing hook and the gear of the displacement device thus starts as a line contact, i.e. a line contact surface, and rolls off as a point, i.e. a point contact surface. It is believed that this has benefits on wear, strength and smoother displacement and this is despite the simple manufacturing method of the cam track and the rigid gear teeth of the cam track of the ball portion of the towing hook.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061"><figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 9</figref> shows another embodiment of a gear for a displacement device to displace a towing hook between a towing position and a retracted position.

As can be noticed, the length of the gear teeth 18' extends along the rotation axis Rg of the gear 18. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">figure 9</figref>, the width of the gear teeth 18' is continuously decreasing along the full length of the gear teeth 18'. Hence it does not have a first portion having a constant width. It is of course possible that the width of the gear teeth 18' is continuously decreasing only along a major portion of the length of the gear teeth 18', and not along the full length of the gear teeth 18'.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">The gear teeth 18' shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">figures 8</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">9</figref> thus have a first and a second width Wg1, Wg2. The first width Wg1 is larger than the second width Wg2. The width Wg1, Wg2 described above should be measured on the gear teeth 18' at the same height of the gear teeth 18' and perpendicular to the rotation axis Rg.
