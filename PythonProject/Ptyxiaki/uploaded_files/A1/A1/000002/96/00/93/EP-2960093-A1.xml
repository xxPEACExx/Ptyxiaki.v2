Regulations, such as SAE J1645, require grounding of a fuel tank so as to eliminate static charge buildup. In this connection, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4540191A"><text>US 4 540 191</text></patcit> shows a fuel tank which is grounded to a vehicle chassis by means including a metal filler neck portion forming a sole electrical conducting portion of the tank, a metal vent tube connected between the metal filler neck portion and a metal tank mounting bracket secured to the vehicle chassis and a ground cable or wire connected to the filler neck portion and dangling into the tank. However, most fuel tanks are made entirely of a non-metallic material such as plastic. Some fuel tanks are internally grounded by a metal insert which is connected to the body of a fuel sender via a metal wire/cable, but such fuel tanks are difficult to assemble and service.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Accordingly, it is desired to provide an simplified grounded fuel tank assembly to prevent a static charge buildup for a non-metallic fuel tank.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">This and other objects are achieved by the present invention, wherein a grounded fuel tank assembly is provided. The grounded fuel tank assembly comprises a fuel tank having a non-metallic container and a non-metallic filler neck. The filler neck has an opening surrounded by a lip. The opening is adapted to receive a shank portion of a fuel cap. An electrically conductive insert member has a sleeve which is received by the filler neck and a ring-shaped outer part which at least partially surrounds a portion of the filler neck. An electrically conductive ground strap exterior to the container engages the outer part.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For a complete understanding of the objects, techniques, and structure of the invention reference should be made to the following detailed description and accompanying drawings:<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> -->
<dl id="dl0001"><dt>Fig. 1</dt><dd>is a perspective view of an upper portion of a grounded fuel tank assembly embodying the invention,</dd><dt>Fig. 2</dt><dd>is a perspective view of an insert being part of the grounded fuel tank assembly shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, and</dd><dt>Fig. 3</dt><dd>is a sectional view taken along a center line of a ground strap of the grounded fuel tank assembly shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</dd></dl></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, a grounded fuel tank assembly 10 includes a fuel tank 12 which has a non-metallic tank or container 14 and a non-metallic hollow filler neck 16 which projects from the container 14. The filler neck 16 has an opening 18 which is surrounded by a lip 20. The opening 18 is adapted to receive a hollow stem or shank portion 22 of a fuel cap 24. An O-ring 19 is mounted around a base portion of the shank portion 22. The shank portion 22 includes external threads 23. A groove 26 is formed in an outer surface of the fuel tank 14 and the filler neck 16. The grounded fuel tank assembly 10 also includes an insert member 30, an O-ring 32 and a ground strap 34. The ground strap 34 is received by the groove 26. Alternatively, a wire (not shown) in a molded channel could also be used, or a conductor could be molded into the fuel tank 12 to complete the grounding system between the metal fuel fill insert a vehicle ground.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, the filler neck 16 includes internal threads 17. The insert member 30 is an electrically conductive, hollow, cylindrical member. The insert member 30 has a hollow cylindrical inner part or sleeve 36 which is received by the filler neck 16. The sleeve 36 includes external threads 38 which engage the internal threads 17 of the filler neck 16. The sleeve 36 also includes internal threads 40 which engage the external threads 23 of the shank portion 22 of the fuel cap 24.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The insert member 30 also has a ring-shaped outer part 42. The outer part 42 is joined to an end of the sleeve 36. The outer part 42 includes an annular frusto-conical inner ring 44 which is joined to an end of the sleeve 36 and which extends axially away and<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> radially outwardly from sleeve 36 to a curved outer rim 46. The outer part 42 also includes an outer ring 48 which extends axially away from the outer rim 46 and towards the sleeve 36. The outer part 42 thereby forms an annular recess 50 which opens away from the outer rim 46 and towards the lip 20 of the filler neck 16.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">As best seen in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the outer part 42 receives the lip 20 of the filler neck 16 and the O-ring 32. Thus, the O-ring 32 forms a seal between the lip 20 and the inner ring 44 of outer part 42. The O-ring 19 forms a seal between the fuel cap 24 and the inner ring 44 of insert member 30. The outer part 42 also receives an end of the ground strap 34 so that the ground strap 34 makes electrical contact with the outer ring 48. A plurality of spaced apart tabs 56 project away from an outer edge of the outer ring 48.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As best seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, an upper portion of the filler neck 16 is surrounded by a plurality of evenly spaced fingers 52 which are separated by a corresponding plurality of upwardly opening slots 54. Each tab 56 can be bent into a corresponding one of the slots 54 to prevent the insert member 30 from being rotated and unscrewed from the filler neck 16.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Thus, the fuel tank ground assembly 10 includes an insert member 30 which has external threads 38 for securing it to the molded plastic fuel tank 12, internal threads 40 for securing the fuel cap 24, and tabs 56 which engage the filler neck 16 to prevent unscrewing of the insert member 30.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As the insert member 30 is screwed into the filler neck 16, a constant force pushes the grounding strap 34 inwardly towards the filler neck 16. The molded groove 26 locates the ground strap 34 in a defined position and to resist strap rotation while installing the insert member 30. The groove 26 has room for a robust ground strap 34 that is less susceptible to damage and entanglement than a grounding wire. The result is a grounded fuel tank assembly 10 which is simple to put together.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90460079" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A grounded fuel tank assembly comprising a fuel tank (12) having a non-metallic container (14) and a non-metallic filler neck (16), the filler neck (16) having an opening (18) surrounded by a lip (20), the opening (18) being adapted to receive a shank portion (22) of a fuel cap (24);
