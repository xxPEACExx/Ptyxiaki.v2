After the abutment member is deformed along the contour of a work, air is removed from the inner bag. Thus, the abutment member is hardened while maintaining the shape thereof. Besides, the enhancement of durability is achieved by fabricating the outer bag from a woven cloth made of aramid fiber.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0004">Problem to Be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">When the gripping by the gripping device is repeated, a hole may open in the outer bag due to abrasion, incision or the like, so the inner bag may be exposed from the outer bag. Then, when a hole opens in the outer bag, the work comes into direct contact with the inner bag, thus breaking the inner bag. The breakage of the inner bag becomes known for the first time due to a decrease in the degree of vacuum of the inner bag, a fall of the work or the like. Therefore, when it turns out that the inner bag has broken, the stoppage of a production line on which the gripping device is installed is<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> caused.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Accordingly, it is desirable to carry out the maintenance and management by replacing the outer bag as soon as a hole opens in the outer bag, namely, before the inner bag breaks. However, the gripping device may be used to grip a work to which oil, chips and the like have adhered, such as a mechanical part. As a result, dirt may adhere to the outer bag. In such a state, it is difficult to confirm, through visual observation, whether or not the outer bag has broken.</p><heading id="h0005">Means for Solving the Problem</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">A gripping device according to the invention is a gripping device having a gripping portion that grips a work while clamping the work. The gripping device is equipped with an abutment member that is annexed on a region of the gripping portion that abuts on the work. The abutment member is equipped with an inner bag that is made of a material having elasticity, a particulate matter with which the inner bag is filled, and an outer bag that covers the inner bag. The particulate matter is hardened while being deformed into a shape matching a contour of the work by increasing a ratio of a volume of the particulate matter to an inner volume of the inner bag with the work gripped by the gripping portion. A reverse face of the outer bag and a surface of the inner bag have a light-emitting portion therebetween.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The light-emitting portion is provided on at least one of the reverse face of the outer bag and the surface of the inner bag.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the light-emitting portion emits light in response to ultraviolet light.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In another embodiment of the invention, the light-emitting portion is constituted by a light storage member.</p><heading id="h0006">Effect of the Invention</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the invention, when the outer bag ruptures, an image of a ruptured region of the outer bag can be made to emerge in a dark place by the light-emitting portion, and can be visually observed with ease. Thus, a rupture created in the outer bag can be detected, and the breakage of the inner bag can be obviated, independently of the dirt on the outer bag.</p><heading id="h0007">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1] FIG. 1</figref> is a view showing a gripping device.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2] FIG. 2</figref> includes views showing a gripping portion of the gripping device. <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2 (a)</figref> is a front view. <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2 (b)</figref> is an A-A cross-sectional view. <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2 (c)</figref> is a B-B cross-sectional view.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3] FIG. 3</figref> is a front view of an abutment member.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4] FIG. 4</figref> is a lateral cross-sectional view of the abutment member.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5] FIG. 5</figref> is a view showing an inner bag of the abutment member.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6] FIG. 6</figref> is a view showing an outer bag of the abutment member.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7] FIG. 7</figref> is a view showing how a rupture is created in the abutment member.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8] FIG. 8</figref> is a partial cross-sectional schematic view showing the details of the abutment member.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9] FIG. 9</figref> includes views showing embodiments of arrangement of a light-emitting member on the abutment member. <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9 (a)</figref> shows the first embodiment of the invention. <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9 (b)</figref> shows the second embodiment of the invention. <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9 (c)</figref> shows the third embodiment of the invention. <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9 (d)</figref> shows the fourth embodiment of the invention. <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9 (e)</figref> shows the fifth embodiment of the invention. <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9 (f)</figref> shows the sixth embodiment of the invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10] FIG. 10</figref> is a view showing a method of detecting a rupture in the abutment member in a case where a member that emits light by being irradiated with ultraviolet light is used as the light-emitting member.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11] FIG. 11</figref> is a view showing a method of detecting a rupture in the abutment<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> member in a case where a light storage member is used as the light-emitting member.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0008">MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">A gripping device 1 is a device for gripping and holding a work or the like. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the gripping device 1 is equipped with a gripping portion 2, a control unit 7, and a vacuum exhaust facility 8. The gripping portion 2 is a region for directly gripping the work, and is equipped with a drive portion 3, a plurality of claw portions 4 and 5, and a plurality of abutment members 6.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, the drive portion 3 is equipped with two-line slider portions 3a and 3b. The respective slider portions 3a and 3b can be displaced in a reciprocating manner with respect to the same axial direction, independently of each other. For example, an electric actuator equipped with a reciprocating mechanism that is constituted of a ball screw, a nut, a motor and the like can be adopted as the drive portion 3.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The claw portions 4 and 5 are a pair of regions that are provided to clamp the work. The claw portions 4 and 5 clamp and grip the work, which is arranged at a midpoint between the claw portions 4 and 5. Incidentally, the shape of the respective claw portions 4 and 5 is set in consideration of the shape and size of the work to be gripped, the stroke amount of the respective slider portions 3a and 3b, and the like.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2 (b)</figref>, the claw portion 4 is equipped with a support portion 4a, and two clamp portions 4b and 4b that protrude from the support portion 4a. The clamp portions 4b and 4b are arranged apart from each other by a predetermined clearance. Besides, the claw portion 4 has an annexation face 4g on which the abutment members 6 are annexed. The support portion 4a of the claw portion 4 is fixed to the slider portion 3a. Then, the control unit 7 operates the drive portion 3 to slide the slider portion 3a, thus moving the respective clamp portions 4b and 4b in a reciprocating manner along a sliding direction of the slider portion 3a (see <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>).</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Besides, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2 (c)</figref>, the claw portion 5 is equipped with a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> support portion 5a, and a clamp portion 5b that protrudes from the support portion 5a. Besides, the claw portion 5 has an annexation face 5g on which the abutment member 6 is annexed. The support portion 5a of the claw portion 5 is fixed to the slider portion 3b. Then, the control unit 7 operates the drive portion 3 to slide the slider portion 3b, thus moving the clamp portion 5b in a reciprocating manner along a sliding direction of the slider portion 3b (see <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>).</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Each of the abutment members 6 is a region of the gripping device 1 that directly abuts on the work, and realizes two opposite modes, namely, a mode in which the shape thereof can be flexibly deformed and a mode in which the shape thereof is firmly maintained, as a single member. Each of the abutment members 6 usually assumes the mode in which the shape thereof can be flexibly deformed.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, the abutment members 6 are annexed on the clamp portions 4b, 4b, and 5b of the claw portions 4 and 5 respectively, and are connected to the vacuum exhaust facility 8. The vacuum exhaust facility 8 constitutes means for hardening and softening the abutment members 6, and is equipped with a vacuum pump 8a, vacuum pipelines 8b and 8b, and an electromagnetic valve 8c. Then, the vacuum pipelines 8b and 8b are connected to bag-like portions of the abutment members 6 respectively. Incidentally, in the present embodiment of the invention, the case where the vacuum exhaust facility 8 is equipped with the vacuum pump 8a is exemplified. However, it is also possible to adopt a configuration in which the vacuum exhaust facility 8 is equipped with exhaust means other than the vacuum pump 8a (e.g., an ejector or the like). Besides, the means for realizing the hardening and softening of the abutment members is not absolutely required to be a vacuum exhaust facility. Any means capable of realizing the hardening and softening of the abutment members can be adopted.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">When the vacuum pump 8a is operated to reduce the pressure of the interiors of the bag-like portions of the abutment members 6, respective particles constituting a particulate matter with which the bag-like portions are filled are more tightly anchored to one another, so the abutment members 6 are hardened. Therefore, at<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> this time, the abutment members 6 assume the mode in which the shape thereof is firmly maintained.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">When these abutment members 6 are pressed against the work in their soft state through clamping pressures applied by the claw portions 4 and 5, it is possible to cause the abutment members 6 to enter a convexo-concave portion of the surface of the work. Thus, the abutment members 6 can be deformed along the contour of the work. Then, the abutment members 6 can be hardened into a shape corresponding to the contour of the work by operating the vacuum exhaust facility 8. Thus, the solid abutment members 6 corresponding to the contour of the work can be formed.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">With the gripping portion 2 according to the present embodiment of the invention, the work can be firmly gripped at three points by the abutment members 6 that are annexed on the clamp portions 4b, 4b, and 5b respectively. A stable gripping state that can endure a swinging motion or the like of the work can be realized with a simple configuration having a small number of parts.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The foregoing claw portions 4 and 5 need to be ensured of rigidity in order to accomplish a predetermined clamping force, and hence are generally constituted by a material having a predetermined hardness, such as steel or the like. Therefore, when the claw portions 4 and 5 are brought into direct abutment on the work, the work may be broken etc. by the claw portions 4 and 5. Besides, the work assumes various shapes. Therefore, with a view to realizing a stable gripping state, the shape of the regions of the claw portions 4 and 5 that abut on the work needs to correspond to the shape of the work. Therefore, with the gripping device 1, the abutment members 6 are annexed on those regions of the clamp portions 4b, 4b, and 5b as clamping portions of the gripping portion 2 which abut on the work, respectively.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Each of the abutment members 6 is a member that can realize the two opposite modes, namely, the mode in which the shape thereof can be flexibly deformed and the mode in which the shape thereof is firmly maintained, as a single member. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>, each of the abutment members 6 is equipped with an inner bag 11 and an outer bag 13 that covers the inner bag 11. This configuration makes it<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> possible to simply and reliably prevent the inner bag 11 from being abraded through repeated use or being cut by the chips and the like adherent to the work. As a result, the product cycle of the inner bag 11 can be prolonged.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, the inner bag 11 is equipped with a bag body 11a, a connection port 11b, and the like. The bag body 11a in the present embodiment of the invention is a member made of nitrile rubber (NBR), and is fabricated through the use of a first rubber member and a second rubber member. The first rubber member is obtained by heating and press-molding crude rubber and molding it into the shape of a box (a pentahedron). The second rubber member assumes a sheet-like shape. More specifically, according to this configuration, the bag body 11a having air-tightness and elasticity is obtained by sticking the sheet-like second rubber member to an opening region of the box-shaped first rubber member through vulcanization and welding, and forming them into the shape of a box (a hexahedron). Besides, a hole portion 11f is formed through one face of the bag body 11a at a substantially central portion thereof. The connection port 11b as a member for establishing communication between the interior and exterior of the bag body 11a is disposed in the hole portion 11f. The connection port 11b is annexed on the hole portion 11f while ensuring air-tightness of the hole portion 11f, by inserting sealing members 11d and 11d thereinto and screwing and fastening a nut 11c thereto. Besides, the vacuum pipeline 8b is connected to the connection port 11b, and a filter 11e is disposed at an end portion of the connection port 11b that is encapsulated by the bag body 11a.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The interior of the bag body 11a is filled with a particulate matter 12 as an aggregate of a plurality of particles. Due to the filling of the interior of the bag body 11a with the particulate matter 12, the inner bag 11 can realize the two opposite modes, namely, the mode in which the shape thereof can be flexibly deformed and the mode in which the shape thereof is firmly maintained, as a single member. By providing the connection port 11b with the filter 11e, there is realized a configuration for preventing the particulate matter 12 from being discharged from the connection port 11b.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">When air is removed from the interior of the bag body 11a and the ratio of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the volume of the particulate matter 12 to the inner volume of the bag body 11a increases, the gaps among the respective particles constituting the particulate matter 12 with which the interior of the bag body 11a is filled decrease, and the respective particles are anchored to one another. As a result, the particulate matter 12 decreases in fluidity, and is hardened into the shape of a lump. When air is reintroduced into the bag body 11a with the particulate matter 12 hardened in the shape of a lump, the ratio of the volume of the particulate matter 12 to the inner volume of the bag body 11a decreases, so the gaps among the respective particles constituting the particulate matter 12 increase and the respective particles are stopped from being anchored to one another. As a result, the particulate matter 12 increases in fluidity, and is softened.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Incidentally, in the present embodiment of the invention, the case where nitrile rubber (NBR) is adopted as a material of the inner bag 11 (the bag body 11a) is exemplified, but the material constituting the inner bag 11 should not be limited thereto. Various materials can be adopted in accordance with the conditions such as working environments and the like, as long as they have elasticity and air-tightness.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, the outer bag 13 is a member for covering and protecting the inner bag 11, and is equipped with a bag body 13a, anchorage portions 13b and 13b, and the like. The bag body 13a is a member made of aramid fiber, which is a material exhibiting abrasion resistance and incision resistance. The bag body 13a is a member that is obtained by superimposing two substantially rectangular sheet-like members made of aramid fiber on each other, sewing three respective side portions thereof, and forming them into the shape of a bag. The interior of the bag body 13a is in such a size that the inner bag 11 can be displaceably accommodated therein. Besides, the anchorage portions 13b and 13b serving as regions for suspending the outer bag 13, and the like are annexed in the vicinity of unsewn opening side portions of the bag body 13a. The present embodiment of the invention adopts a simple configuration in which metal eyelets are adopted as the anchorage portions 13b and 13b.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In the present embodiment of the invention, aramid fiber is adopted as a material of the outer bag 13 (the bag body 13a). Aramid fiber is a material exhibiting<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> excellent abrasion resistance and excellent incision resistance, and hence can protect the inner bag 11 from being abraded or cut. Besides, aramid fiber is flexible enough to conform to the shape of a work. Therefore, the inner bag 11 accommodated in the outer bag 13 can be accurately made to conform to the shape of the work that is in contact with the inner bag 11 via the outer bag 13. For this reason, aramid fiber is preferred as a material forming the outer bag 13 (the bag body 13a). In this case, aramid fiber can be used in any form such as a woven fabric, a knitted fabric, a non-woven fabric or the like. However, aramid fiber is preferably used in the form of a woven fabric in order to achieve both sufficient flexibility and sufficient durability.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Incidentally, in the present embodiment of the invention, the case where aramid fiber is adopted as a material of the outer bag 13 is exemplified, but the material constituting the outer bag 13 should not be limited thereto. Various materials can be adopted as long as they exhibit excellent abrasion resistance and excellent incision resistance and are flexible enough to conform to the shape of the work.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Each of the abutment members 6 is configured such that the inner bag 11 and the outer bag 13 are separate from each other, and the inner bag 11 and the outer bag 13 are displaceable relatively to each other, so the inner bag 11 is not prevented from being deformed by being dragged by the outer bag 13. Therefore, the inner bag 11 can be accurately deformed along the shape of the work via the outer bag 13, and the abutment member 6 can be accurately made to conform to the shape (the convexo-concave portion) of the work. That is, owing to the configuration in which the inner bag 11 and the outer bag 13 are separate from each other, the abutment member 6 is improved so as to realize a firmer gripping state than an abutment member having a double-structure bag body with an inner bag and an outer bag integrated with each other. Furthermore, the abutment member 6 is excellent in economic efficiency as well, because only the inner bag 11 can be replaced when the inner bag 11 is damaged, and only the outer bag 13 can be replaced when the outer bag 13 is damaged.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>, the abutment member 6 is suspended by the anchorage portions 13b and 13b of the outer bag 13, with respect to the bolts 4d and 4d of<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> the clamp portion 4b. Then, with the abutment member 6 (the outer bag 13) suspended from the anchorage portions 13b and 13b, nuts 14 and 14 are fastened onto the bolts 4d and 4d via washers 15 and 15, so there is realized a configuration for simply and reliably annexing the abutment member 6 on the clamp portion 4b. Owing to this configuration, the abutment member 6 is easily replaced. Thus, the introduction into an actual production line on which the abutment members 6 are estimated to be abraded and cut can be easily realized.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Incidentally, the case where the abutment member 6 is annexed on the clamp portion 4b of the claw portion 4 has been described herein as an example. However, at the clamp portion 5b of the claw portion 5 as well, a bolt is protrusively provided on a disposition face. The abutment member 6 is suspended from the bolt, and is fixed through the use of a nut, a washer and the like. Thus, the abutment member 6 (not shown) is annexed in a similar manner.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>, when the number of times of contact between the outer bag 13 of the abutment member 6 and the work increases, a rupture (a rupture portion 20) may be created in the outer bag 13 of the abutment member 6 due to aged deterioration or the like. However, the outer bag 13 is in direct contact with the work, and hence may become dirty due to the cutting fluid, chips and the like adherent to the work. Therefore, when inspecting whether or not a rupture is created in the abutment member 6, it is sometimes difficult to detect the rupture through visual observation. As a result, the rupture created in the outer bag 13 may be overlooked.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>, the abutment member 6 is configured such that the outside of the inner bag 11 that is filled with the particulate matter 12 is covered with the outer bag 13. As described already, the bag body 11a made of NBR, which constitutes the inner bag 11, is filled with the particulate matter 12. Besides, the outer bag 13 is equipped with a lining 13c on a reverse face of the bag body 13a made of aramid fiber (a face that is in contact with the inner bag 11). The lining 13c is made of membrane-like polyethylene terephthalate (PET).

The light storage member can be used in a mode in which a light storage pigment is directly used as a paint, a mode in which a light storage pigment is mixed with resin to be used as a sheet-like or thread-like molded article, or the like. In addition, as the material constituting the light-emitting portion 16 (the light-emitting member), a member that emits light by being irradiated with ultraviolet light (black light) (a fluorescent member) may be used.

In the case where the rupture portion 20 is created in the abutment member 6, when ultraviolet light reaches the light-emitting portion 16 through the rupture portion 20, the light-emitting portion 16 emits light.
