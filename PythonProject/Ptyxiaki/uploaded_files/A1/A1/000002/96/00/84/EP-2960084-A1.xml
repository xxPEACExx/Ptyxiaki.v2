Systems of this type have been used in automobiles and also in aircraft. The use of tire or wheel monitoring systems allow a control unit of an aircraft to monitor the pressure of each tire of the aircraft landing gear during taxing, take-off, flight, and landing. The communication between the control unit on a stationary portion of the vehicle and a sensor assembly mounted on the wheel has been achieved using a rotary transformer. Power can be transmitted inductively across a wireless gap of the rotary transformer to the sensor assembly. Tuned primary and secondary tank circuits can be used to facilitate the transfer of power from the control unit to the sensor assembly, and the transmission of data from the sensor assembly back to the control unit.</p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A communication system between a control unit and a sensor assembly provides wireless transmission of power and control unit data from the control unit to the sensor assembly, and wireless transmission of sensor data from the sensor assembly to the control unit. The control unit produces a power signal having a carrier frequency, and modulates the power signal to provide control unit data to the sensor assembly. The power signal, along with modulation representing the control unit data, is transmitted through a rotary transformer to the sensor assembly. Power is derived by the sensor assembly from the received power signal, and control unit data is demodulated from the power signal.

BCU circuitry 12 provides a power signal modulated to contain BCU-to-sensor data through rotary transformer 16 to sensor assembly 14. Sensor assembly 14 receives the power signal and BCU-to-sensor data and uses the received power signal to derive power to operate the components of sensor assembly 14. The modulated power signal is demodulated by the sensor to derive the BCU-to-sensor data. Sensor assembly 14 senses a parameter, such as tire pressure, converts the sensor reading to digital sensor data, and modulates digital sensor data to BCU circuitry 12 through rotary transformer 16 by load modulation. The digital sensor data is received by BCU circuitry 12 from rotary transformer 16 and is demodulated and provided for use by BCU circuitry 12 or for reporting to other systems of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">BCU circuitry 12 includes BCU processor 20, which is a digital processor such as a microprocessor, microcontroller, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or field programmable gate array (FPGA). BCU processor 20 provides waveform control signals and BCU-to-sensor data to power wave generation circuitry 22, which includes waveform generator/data modulation circuitry 24, amplifier 26, and DC blocking capacitor 28. Based upon the waveform control signals and the BCU-to-sensor data provided by BCU processor 20, waveform generator/data modulation circuitry 24 produces an AC power signal having a carrier frequency and amplitude determined by the waveform control signal. When BCU-to-sensor data is to be sent to sensor assembly 14, waveform generator/data modulation circuitry 24 Frequency Shift Key (FSK) modulates the AC power signal. The AC power signal (with or without) FSK modulation, is amplified by amplifier 26 and provided through DC blocking capacitor 28 to primary tank circuit 16P of rotary transformer 16.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Demodulation circuitry 30 is also connected to primary tank circuit 16P. It receives a signal representing digital sensor data from sensor assembly 14. Load demodulation circuitry 30<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> includes sense resistor 32, operational amplifier 34, envelope detector 36, and comparator 38. The output of comparator 38 is digital sensor data, which is provided to BCU processor 20.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Sensor assembly 14 includes sensor assembly processor 40, which may be a microprocessor, microcontroller, ASIC, FPGA, or other digital processor. Power for the components of sensor 14 is derived from the power and data signal produced by BCU circuitry 12 and transmitted through primary tank circuit 16P to secondary tank circuit 16S of rotary transformer 16. Power regulation circuit 42 is connected to secondary tank circuit 16S, and includes rectifier 44, capacitor 46, and voltage regulator 48.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Sensor circuitry 50 includes sensor 52, analog-to-digital converter 54, and processor 40. Sensor 52 senses a parameter associated with the wheel to which sensor assembly 14 is mounted. That parameter may be, for example, tire pressure or temperature. The analog sensor signal (or reading) is provided to analog-to-digital converter 54, before it is converted to a digital sensor reading. Sensor assembly digital processor 40 receives the digital sensor reading, and produces digital sensor data which is converted to a load modulation signal by load modulation circuit 56, which is connected to secondary tank circuit 16S. Load modulation circuit 56 includes transistor 58 and resistor 60 and 62. As transistor 58 is turned on and off by the digital sensor data from sensor assembly processor 40, the load on secondary tank circuit 16S changes. This causes a load modulation signal to be transmitted across the wireless gap of rotary transformer 16 to primary tank circuit 16P, and then to load demodulation circuitry 30 of BCU circuitry 12.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Sensor assembly 14 also includes demodulation circuitry 63. In this embodiment, demodulation circuitry 63 includes FSK demodulator 64, which is connected to secondary tank circuit 16S to receive the power and data signal seen in tank circuit 16S. FSK demodulator 64 demodulates the data signal from the combined power and data signal and provides the BCU-to-sensor data to sensor assembly processor 40.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Wireless transformer 16 includes primary tank circuit 16P and secondary tank circuit 16S. Primary tank circuit 16P includes primary inductive winding 70P and capacitor 72P. Secondary tank circuit 16S includes secondary inductive winding 70S and capacitor 72S. The inductance and capacitance of primary and secondary tank circuits 16P and 16S are selected so that tank circuits 16P and 16S are tuned to be optimized for a specific application. Although tank circuits 16P and 16S are shown with an inductive winding and capacitor in parallel, other circuit configurations can be used..<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The power signal is an AC signal at a carrier frequency Y. The carrier frequency is chosen to be an optimal frequency at which to transmit power and data across the wireless gap from primary tank circuit 16P to secondary tank circuit 16S. The acceptable range of frequencies that is sufficient to transmit power and sustain operation of sensor assembly 14, is defined by Y+X1 and Y-X2, where X1 and X2 are the acceptable frequency deviations from the carrier frequency and are determined based on the specific application. BCU circuitry 12 encodes data into the carrier wave (power signal) through frequency shift key modulation. The frequency variation limits for the FSK modulation are constrained by Y+X1 and Y-X2. The frequency changes produced by waveform generator/data modulation circuitry 24 are distinct enough for sensor assembly 14 (and in particular FSK demodulator 64) to be able to interpret the BCU-to-sensor data encoded within the power signal. On the other hand, the frequency changes are not so distinct (large) that sensor assembly 14 loses power from the loss of power transmission efficiency through rotary transformer 16.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The ability to transmit BCU-to-sensor data across transformer 16 makes it possible to communicate to the sensor from the BCU or from a special interface device, after sensor assembly 14 is sealed. It allows the ability to reprogram, characterize, upgrade, and further use sensor assembly 14. It also allows communication from BCU circuitry 12 to sensor assembly 14 to provide sensor assembly processor 40 with sensor information about the system in which it is operating. This allows sensor assembly 14 to gather important system data.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In addition, the ability to send BCU-to-sensor data from BCU circuitry 12 to sensor assembly 14 can be used in embodiments in which multiple sensors are incorporated in sensor assembly 14. The BCU-to-sensor data can be used to address a specific one of the multiple sensors, and would allow sensor assembly 14 to send back data selectively from the addressed sensors. This minimizes the amount of time that it would take to get information from the sensor assembly, because it would not be necessary to wait for all sensors to reply before data is gathered by BCU circuitry 12.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, BCU-to-sensor data is transmitted together with the power signal by FSK modulation. <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> shows another embodiment, in which amplitude shift key (ASK) modulation is used rather than FSK modulation. System 10A of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is generally similar to system 10 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, and similar components have been identified with the same reference numerals used in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.

Sensor assembly 14A is similar to sensor assembly 14 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, except that demodulation circuitry 63A performs ASK demodulation, rather than FSK demodulation. The components of ASK demodulation circuit 63A include sense resistor 80, operational amplifier 82, envelope detector 84, and comparator 86. The output of comparator 86 is BCU-to-sensor data that is supplied to sensor assembly processor 40.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The demodulation of an ASK encoded power signal from BCU circuitry 12A to sensor assembly 14A involves a process that is very similar to how demodulation circuitry 30 demodulates digital sensor data from sensor assembly 14A. In system 10A, BCU circuitry 12A manipulates the voltage amplitude that is transmitted into the rotary transformer.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">To perform amplitude shift key modulation, waveform generator/data modulation circuit 24A modulates the voltage signal between two voltage levels, both of which are higher than the minimum voltage needed in the signal to provide adequate power to regulation circuit 42 of sensor assembly 14A. With amplitude shift key modulation, the frequency of the combined power and BCU-to-sensor data signal continuously operates at the carrier frequency, which is optimal for that application through rotary transformer 16.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>Discussion of Possible Embodiments</b></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">The following are non-exclusive descriptions of possible embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">A system comprises a control unit, a sensor assembly, and a rotary transformer.
