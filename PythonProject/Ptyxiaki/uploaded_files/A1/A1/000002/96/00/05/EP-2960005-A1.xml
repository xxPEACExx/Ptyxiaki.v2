Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Laser welding apparatuses and laser welding methods for joining two members together by laser welding are widely used. Examples of products that are manufactured by joining two members together by the laser welding apparatuses and the laser welding methods include secondary batteries including a box-shaped battery case and a lid member. Such secondary batteries are usually manufactured by joining a lid member to an open portion of a battery case by laser welding. One example of the technology for joining a lid member to an open portion of a battery case by laser welding is described in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2012110905A"><text>2012-110905</text></patcit> (<patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2012110905A"><text>JP 2012-110905 A</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">With a laser welding method and a laser welding apparatus described in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2012110905A"><text>JP 2012-110905 A</text></patcit>, a case (battery case) and a sealing plate (lid member) are welded together by applying a laser beam to the battery case and the lid member. The laser beam is formed of a low power density laser beam and a high power density laser beam. With the conventional laser welding method and laser welding apparatus described in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2012110905A"><text>JP 2012-110905 A</text></patcit>, the low power density laser beam is applied to the battery case, the lid member and a clearance between the battery case and the lid member in whole, while the high power density laser beam is applied to a portion of each of the battery case and the lid member, which is located within the area to which the low power density laser beam is applied. The laser welding method and laser welding apparatus described in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2012110905A"><text>JP 2012-110905 A</text></patcit> make it possible to stably weld the battery case and the lid member together with high quality.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The low power density laser beam, which is used in the laser welding method and laser welding apparatus described in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP2012110905A"><text>JP 2012-110905 A</text></patcit>, is applied in order to avoid abrupt temperature changes due to the high power density laser beam. Thus, the intensity of the low power density laser beam is not high enough to melt and evaporate the material. For this reason, with the conventional laser welding method and laser welding apparatus, it takes a long time for molten material to flow into the clearance. Consequently, with the conventional laser welding method and laser welding apparatus, it takes a long time to fill the clearance with the molten material. Thus, an increase in the laser beam (high power density laser beam) scanning speed may result in entrance of the laser beam into the clearance. Note that, in the following description, a phenomenon, in which a laser beam enters a clearance between two members that constitute a workpiece subjected to welding and then the laser beam reaches the inside or back side of the workpiece, will be referred to as laser beam penetration.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the case where the laser welding method and laser welding apparatus described in <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="JP2012110905A"><text>JP 2012-110905 A</text></patcit> are employed, when the inside or back side of a workpiece subjected to welding is provided with a part that should be protected, it is necessary to set the welding speed to a speed at which laser beam penetration does not occur. This makes it difficult to enhance the speed of laser welding. In view of this, there has been a demand for development of a technology pertaining to a laser welding apparatus and a laser welding method, which makes it possible to enhance the speed of laser welding that is performed to join two members together while avoiding occurrence of laser beam penetration.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The invention provides a laser welding apparatus and a laser welding method that make it possible to enhance the speed of laser welding by inhibiting laser beams from entering a clearance between two members to be joined together by laser welding.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A first aspect of the invention relates to a laser welding apparatus for<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> joining a first member and a second member together by laser welding. The laser welding apparatus includes: a first laser beam applying device that applies a laser beam to a border area between the first member and the second member; and a second laser beam applying device that applies a laser beam to a laser beam application spot of each of the first member and the second member, the laser beam application spot being located ahead of a laser beam application spot to which the laser beam is applied by the first laser beam applying device, in a laser welding forward direction.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the first aspect, it is possible to fill a clearance between the first member and the second member with the material melted by the laser beam applied by the second laser beam applying device, thereby inhibiting the laser beam applied by the first laser beam applying device from passing through the clearance. Thus, even when the speed of laser welding is increased, occurrence of laser beam penetration is avoided.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The laser welding apparatus according to the first aspect may further include a third laser beam applying device that applies a laser beam to a laser beam application spot of each of the first member and the second member, the laser beam application spot being located ahead of the laser beam application spot to which the laser beam is applied by the first laser beam applying device, in the laser welding forward direction, and being located behind the laser beam application spot to which the laser beam is applied by the second laser beam applying device, in the laser welding forward direction.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">With this configuration, the material is melted sufficiently by the laser beam applied by the third laser beam applying device. Thus, it is possible to ensure a sufficient depth of fusion while enhancing the speed of laser welding.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The laser welding apparatus according to the first aspect may further include: a single laser beam source; and a diffractive-optical element. The first laser beam applying device and the second laser beam applying device may be integrated into a single laser beam applying device that serves as both the first laser beam applying device and the second laser beam applying device, due to provision of the single laser beam source and the diffractive-optical element.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">With this configuration, the speed of laser welding is enhanced with the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> simply-configured laser welding apparatus.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The laser welding apparatus according to the first aspect may further include: a single laser beam source; and a diffractive-optical element.

Also, when there is a portion on which laser welding is performed while the laser welding forward direction is turned 90 degrees, an application pattern of the laser beam in the first laser beam application step, the laser beam in the second laser beam application step, and the laser beam in the third laser beam application step may be configured to be symmetric with respect to a line extending in the laser welding forward direction and to be symmetric with respect to a line perpendicular to the line extending in the laser welding forward direction.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to the above aspect, the speed of laser welding is enhanced with the simple method.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the second aspect, the first member may be a battery case and the second member may be a lid member.

The secondary battery 1 is manufactured by laser welding performed by the laser welding apparatus and laser welding method according to the embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The battery case 2 is a generally rectangular parallelepiped container in which an electrode body (not illustrated) and an electrolyte solution (not illustrated) are housed. The battery case 2 is open at one side thereof, so that an open portion 2a is formed. The lid member 3 is in the form of a plate, and used to seal the open portion 2a of the battery case 2. The lid member 3 has an outer shape that substantially conforms to the shape of an inner peripheral portion of the open portion 2a. Further, the size of the lid member 3 is slightly smaller than the size of the open portion 2a, so that the lid member 3 is accommodated in the open portion 2a. The battery case 2 and the lid member 3 that constitute the secondary battery 1 in the embodiment are both made of aluminum.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The secondary battery 1 includes the positive electrode terminal 4 and the negative electrode terminal 5 that protrude outward from the lid member 3. The positive electrode terminal 4 is electrically connected to a positive electrode (not illustrated) of the electrode body via a metal piece 6, and the negative electrode terminal 5 is electrically<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> connected to a negative electrode (not illustrated) of the electrode body via a metal piece 7. The lid member 3 of the secondary battery 1 has a safety valve 8 and a liquid supply port 9.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, when the lid member 3 is disposed in the open portion 2a of the battery case 2, a clearance 10 is formed between the open portion 2a and the lid member 3. The clearance 10 is formed due to the dimensional difference between the battery case 2 and the lid member 3. In the secondary battery 1 in the embodiment, the clearance 10 is a small clearance of 0.5 mm or less. The secondary battery 1 is manufactured by joining two members, that is, the battery case 2 and the lid member 3, together by laser welding, thereby sealing the open portion 2a with the lid member 3. In the secondary battery 1 obtained after completion of laser welding, the clearance 10 is sealed with a bead 11 that has flowed into the clearance 10 and its surrounding area.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Laser welding is performed along the direction in which the clearance 10 extends, and the secondary battery 1 has corner portions 1a. Thus, when each corner portion 1a is subjected to laser welding, the direction in which laser welding proceeds (hereinafter, referred to as "laser welding forward direction") is turned 90 degrees between opposite ends of the corner portion 1a (i.e., an angle of 90 degrees is formed between the laser welding forward direction at one end of the corner portion 1a and the laser welding forward direction at the other end of the corner portion 1a). In the embodiment, the clearance 10 has a rounded shape at each corner portion 1a. However, the shape of each corner portion 1a of the secondary battery 1 need not be a rounded shape. Although one corner portion 1a of the secondary battery 1 is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the secondary battery 1 has a total of four corner portions 1a defined at four respective corners of the secondary battery 1 in a plan view, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B</figref>.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B</figref> illustrate the arrangement of the battery case 2 and the lid member 3 before the corner portion 1a is subjected to laser welding. There is the clearance 10 between the battery case 2 and the lid member 3 before laser welding. Thus, when a laser beam is applied to the clearance 10, laser beam penetration (a phenomenon in which the laser beam reaches the inside of the battery case 2) may occur and thus the laser beam may give a damage to the electrode body (not illustrated) housed in the battery case<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> 2.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In view of this, the laser welding apparatus and laser welding method according to the embodiment of the invention are formulated as a technology for manufacturing the secondary battery 1 by joining two members, that is, the battery case 2 and the lid member 3, together by laser welding, while avoiding occurrence of laser beam penetration. In the embodiment, two members to be joined together by the laser welding apparatus and the laser welding method are the battery case 2 and the lid member 3 that constitute the secondary battery 1. However, the workpieces to which the laser welding apparatus and laser welding method according to the invention are applied are not limited to secondary batteries. The laser welding apparatus and laser welding method according to the invention may be widely applied to various kinds of workpieces that are manufactured by joining two members together by laser welding.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Next, laser beam application patterns that are formed by the laser welding apparatus and laser welding method according to the embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4A, FIG. 4B</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5A, FIG. 5B</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6A, FIG. 6B</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7A and FIG. 7B</figref>. In the laser welding apparatus and laser welding method according to the embodiment of the invention, laser beam applying devices apply laser beams in a laser beam application pattern formed of a combination of at least main laser beams S1 and sub-laser beams S2 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4A</figref>, thereby performing laser welding.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The main laser beams S1 are main laser beams that are applied in order to sufficiently melt the material with the heat applied by the main laser beams S1, thereby ensuring a required depth of fusion. The sub-laser beams S2 include laser beams that are applied to spots located ahead of the spots to which the main laser beams S 1 are applied (hereinafter, referred to as "application spots of the main laser beams S1"), in a laser welding forward direction X.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5A</figref>, the main laser beams S1 are applied to be aimed at the clearance 10, which is a border area between the battery case 2 and the lid member 3. Thus, the material around the clearance 10 is sufficiently melted with the heat applied by the main laser beams S1, so that a required depth of fusion of the material around the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> clearance 10 is ensured.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The sub-laser beams S2 are applied to the spots ahead of the application spots of the main laser beams S1 in the laser welding forward direction X. The sub-laser beams S2 are applied in order to supply the molten material into a portion of the clearance 10, which is located ahead of the application spots of the main laser beams S1 in the laser welding forward direction X. The material around the clearance 10 is melted by the sub-laser beams S2.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates a laser beam application pattern formed by a conventional laser welding apparatus and a conventional laser welding method. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5B</figref>, the laser beam application pattern formed by the conventional laser welding apparatus and laser welding method is formed only of a main laser beam S1. With this application pattern, laser welding is performed as follows. The main laser beam S1 is applied to a spot that overlaps with the clearance 10. Only after the material melted by the main laser beam S1 flows into the clearance 10, the application spot of the main laser beam S1 is shifted ahead in the laser welding forward direction X. In the conventional application pattern, the main laser beam S1 is located at the leading end of the bead 11 formed by laser welding. Thus, an increase in the speed of laser welding (i.e., the speed of shifting the application spot of the main laser beam S1) may result in entrance of the laser beam S 1 into the clearance 10.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">On the other hand, with the laser welding apparatus and laser welding method according to the embodiment of the invention, laser beams are applied in the laser beam application pattern as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5A</figref>. This makes it possible to melt the battery case 2 and the lid member 3 by the sub-laser beams S2, at spots ahead of the application spots of the main laser beams S1 in the laser welding forward direction X, and makes it possible to supply the molten material into the clearance 10, thereby filling the clearance 10 with the molten material. As described above, in the laser welding apparatus and laser welding method according to the embodiment of the invention, the laser beam application pattern formed of a combination of the main laser beams S1 and the sub-laser beams S2 is employed. Thus, it is possible to inhibit the laser beams from<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> entering the clearance 10 (laser beam penetration), thereby enhancing the speed of laser welding.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In the laser welding apparatus and laser welding method according to the embodiment of the invention, preferably, the sub-laser beams S2 are further applied to the material located behind the application spots of the main laser beams S1 in the laser welding forward direction X, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">With the conventional laser welding apparatus and laser welding method, when the main laser beams S1 are applied to be aimed at the clearance 10, laser beam penetration may occur. Thus, multiple main laser beams S1 are applied to spots apart from the clearance 10 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6B</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7B</figref> in some cases. In this case, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6B</figref>, multiple evaporation portions 12 are formed at positions apart from each other. Thus, it is not possible to ensure a sufficient depth of a material fused portion M around the clearance 10.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">On the other hand, in the laser welding apparatus and laser welding method according to the embodiment of the invention, the main laser beams S1 are applied onto the clearance 10 and the sub-laser beams S2 are applied to the spots behind the application spots of the main laser beams S1 in the laser welding forward direction X. In this way, a continuous evaporation portion 12 is formed over a wide area as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6A</figref>. Further, by applying the sub-laser beams S2 to the spots behind the application spots of the main laser beams S1 in the laser welding forward direction X, it is possible to ensure a sufficient depth of the material fused portion M around the clearance 10, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7A</figref>. With the laser welding apparatus and laser welding method according to the embodiment of the invention, welding quality is improved by applying the sub-laser beams S2 to the spots behind the application spots of the main laser beams S1 in the laser welding forward direction X.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In the laser welding apparatus and laser welding method according to the embodiment of the invention, preferably, additional laser beams S3 are applied in addition to the main laser beam S1 and the sub-laser beams S2 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4B</figref>.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The additional laser beams S3 are laser beams that are applied so that the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> evaporation portions 12 formed by the main laser beam S1 and the sub-laser beams S2 are more reliably made continuous with each other. The additional laser beams S3 are applied to be aimed at spots between the application spot of the main laser beam S 1 and the application spots of the sub-laser beams S2. Preferably, the intensity of each additional laser beam S3 is substantially equal to that of each sub-laser beam S2.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Laser welding has the following characteristic. A portion that has been melted by laser beam application is higher in energy absorption rate than a portion that has not been melted. Thus, applying a laser beam to the molten portion promotes laser welding more efficiently. In view of this, when the application spots of the laser beams S1, S2, S3 are made continuous with each other by applying the additional laser beams S3 to the spots between application spots of the sub-laser beams S2 and the application spot of the main laser beam S1, the entirety of the application spots of the laser beams is maintained at a high temperature, so that the energy absorption rate is increased. As a result, the material is melted efficiently in a shorter time. With the laser welding apparatus and laser welding method according to the embodiment of the invention, application of the additional laser beams S3 shortens the time required to melt the material, so that the speed of laser welding is further enhanced. In addition, a sufficient depth of fusion is ensured, so that the welding quality is further improved. In this specification, the state in which "the application spots of the laser beams S1, S2, S3 are made continuous with each other" means a state in which the application spots of the laser beams S1, S2, S3 are so close to each other that the evaporation portions 12 formed in the material as a result of laser beam application become continuous with each other. In other words, the application spots of the laser beams S1, S2, S3 need not be in contact with each other.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Next, a laser welding apparatus according to a first embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>.

The galvano scanner 22 is a device that realizes high-speed laser beam scanning by driving a motor to change the reflection angle of each of the reflecting mirrors 22a, 22b at high speed. A collimator lens 26 is disposed on the input side of the galvano scanner 22. The collimator lens 26 is a lens that turns the received light beams (laser beams) into parallel light beams and sends the parallel light beams to the reflecting mirrors (galvano mirrors) 22a, 22b.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">An Fθ lens 24 and a protective lens 25 are disposed on the output side of the galvano scanner 22.

The laser beams are applied to the support portion 13 located below the clearance 10 to melt the battery case 2 and the lid member 3 around the clearance 10.
