Moreover, the bevel of the upper parent metal 1a is inclined upward, and the lower parent metal 1b is welded in a beveled state at right angles from the plane.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As described above, in case of applying flux cored arc welding using an automatic machine in relation with the horizontal butt joint, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the upper parent metal 1a and the lower parent metal 1b are arranged to have different gaps 3 according to a rate of production, and a root part 2 is formed when the gaps 3 are filled and root pass is first carried out on the back of a side where welding is carried out. In case that deposited welding is carried out inside the bevel on which the root part 2 is formed, molten metal precedes a welding arc due to low viscosity of the molten metal and gravity acting to the molten metal so that the arc is formed on the molten metal. Because the arc formed on the molten metal is difficult to make the parent metal sufficiently penetrate, it frequently causes defects, such as incomplete fusion and slag inclusion in the welded metal.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Moreover, in case of a low arc force, the upper parent metal forms an unwelded macro cross-section 53 (See <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The arc force means a power to push a molten pool, and generally, increases proportionally to the square of current and the double of voltage. In case that the arc force is weak, that is, in case that low current and low voltage are used, because arc radius 51 becomes smaller, molten metal 52 is formed small. Furthermore, a thin metal penetration is formed on the bottom surface of the parent metal because the force to push the small molten metal 52 also becomes smaller, and only the lower parent metal 1b is welded on the cross section of the welded joint because the molten metal is not pushed up to the bevel of the upper parent metal 1a, so that the upper parent metal 1a is welded while forming an unwelded macro cross section 53.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Additionally, because a welding tip 31 of a general welding torch 30 is about 8mm, in case that it carries out weaving at a small ad narrow space, the welding tip gets in contact with the bevel and it frequently causes short. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> is a view showing a conventional welding tip 30.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In order to precisely weld the inside of the bevel, five to seven passes are needed. In addition, after welding the inside of the bevel, in case that welding of the surface part is carried out, because welding bead deflection frequently occurs due to influences of the low viscosity of the molten metal and gravity acting to the molten metal, the top bead has four or five passes to precisely weld if possible.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view of welded parts #1 to #6 that parent metals with a thickness of 23mm are welded using a number of passes by the conventional welding apparatus.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In case of the conventional welding method, a parent metal with a thickness of 15mm requires eight passes, and a parent metal with a thickness of 23mm requires 10 to 15 passes as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>.

In this instance, the supplied welding current and voltage are calculated by the welding current and voltage calculating step of <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 10</figref> according to the thickness of the upper parent metal 1a and the lower parent metal 1b. In the welding current and voltage calculating step (S10), when the welding current and the welding voltage are calculated, the moving speed of each nodal point is also calculated.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">Because the performance of the particular weaving pattern 7 minimizes the diameter of the welding tip 32 of the welding torch 8 and forms the insulating coating layer 33 on the outer circumferential surface, it makes the welding tip weave freely and prevents stop of arc generation by insulation even though the upper parent metal 1a or the lower parent metal 1b and the welding tip 32 get in contact with each other. That is, the particular weaving pattern 7 is difficult to carry out weaving of the welding tip 32 in case that the welding torch 8 of the present invention is not applied, and cannot be easily operated because of stop of arc generation in case that the welding tip 32 which is not insulated comes into contact with the upper parent metal 1a and the lower parent metal 1b.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Next, while the above welding step is carried out, the copper shoe device 4 injects the gas 5 to the molten metal 56 by control of the control unit 60. The copper shoe device 4 injects the gas of the predetermined pressure in the opposite direction to the welding direction in consideration of the amount of the molten metal produced by the control unit 60 using information of welding current and welding voltage and traveling control information of the orthogonal weaving axis<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> part 41 and the traveling axis part 40. The gas injected during the gas injection process prevents that the molten metal formed by the large arc force flows toward the welding torch 8 by the gas pressure stronger than the precedence force of the molten metal.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">The large molten metal 56 formed during the welding process is pushed up to the bevel of the upper parent metal 1a by the gas pressure and the arc force so as to form a macro cross section 58 on which the upper parent metal is welded.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">After the molten metal 56 is formed by the arc force, the movement direction, speed and stopping time of the orthogonal weaving axis part 41 and the traveling axis part 40 are controlled according to the stopping time and the moving speed between the nodal points which are calculated by the stopping time calculating step (S20) of <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 10</figref>. When arc is generated according to the welding current and the welding voltage at each welding position, welding by the particular weaving pattern 7 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 11</figref> is carried out between the upper parent metal 1a and the lower parent metal 1b.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">As described above, in case that horizontal butt joint welding is carried out to the two parent metals through the horizontal butt joint deposited welding method which carries out the welding condition control of the particular weaving pattern 7, the welding current, the welding voltage, the stopping time, the wire supply speed and the traveling speed are calculated by welding of the first pass to weld 50% to 100% of the welded part. Therefore, when the initial deposited welding which is the first pass welding inside the bevel is carried out without performing root pass welding, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0013">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, the present invention can perform<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> deposited welding of 50% to 100% having the rear bead B and the surface bead F with good quality by a single welding. Therefore, the present invention can perform horizontal butt joint welding through one or two passes because it just carries out welding of the remaining part, namely, 50% to 0% of the welded part, thereby remarkably reducing the number of passes for horizontal butt joint welding.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90460292" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A horizontal butt joint welding apparatus comprising:
