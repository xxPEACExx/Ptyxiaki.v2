method and an apparatus for producing a preform by laminating multiple reinforcing fiber substrates.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND ART</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">As for a fiber-reinforced plastics (FRP) molding method having excellent productivity, a so-called RTM molding method is known, which includes placing a substrate laminate composed of a dry reinforcing fiber fabric in a mold, injecting a matrix resin into the mold to impregnate the reinforcing fiber substrate laminate with the matrix resin, curing the resin, and then demolding the resultant molding. For the production of a relatively large molding or a thick molding, as a highly efficient molding method, such a molding method is often employed that includes firstly draping a reinforcing fiber substrate laminate (e.g., multiple reinforcing fiber substrates) into a predetermined shape to produce a reinforcing fiber substrate laminate preform, which is a molding precursor of an FRP, then placing the preform in a mold, then injecting a matrix resin into the mold, and then curing the resin with which the substrate is impregnated.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the production of a preform to be used in the RTM molding, for example, a sequence of steps as mentioned below have been carried out conventionally: (1) a step<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> of placing a substrate laminate produced by laminating multiple substrates on each other in a shaping mold, and then closing the shaping mold to impart a predetermined shape to the substrates by the shaping mold; (2) a step of heating (or preheating) the shaping mold to heat the substrate laminate indirectly, thereby softening or melting a fixing material interposed between the substrates; (3) a step of cooling a preform while keeping the shape of the preform by the shaping mold to solidify the fixing material, thereby fixing the substrate layers to each other; and (4) a step of removing the shaped preform from the shaping mold.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the sequence of steps, a method for heating using a thermal medium, an electric heater or the like is employed as the method for heating the shaping mold in step (2), and a method for cooling using (ambient temperature or cooled) air, cooling water or the like is employed as the method for cooling in step (3) (see, for example,</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent Document 1).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the above-mentioned method in which the heating of the whole of a shaping mold (generally a metallic mold) using a thermal medium and the cooling of the whole of the shaping mold are repeated, however, there is such a problem that the time required for one cycle including the heating and cooling is long and the amount of energy consumption required for the heating is large, and therefore it is difficult to produce a preform having a predetermined shape in a large quantity within a short period of time.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Then, a method is attempted, in which an electric current is applied to a substrate laminate or a reinforcing fiber molding in an in-plane direction or a thickness<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> direction and Joule heat generated by electric resistance of reinforcing fibers is utilized to generate heat (see, for example, Patent Documents 2 and 3).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">This heating method is called a conduction heating method. When the method is used for the production of a preform, only the substrates can be heated without heating the whole of the mold, unlike conventional techniques. That is, heat can be generated in laminated substrates by placing the laminated substrates in a shaping mold composed of an upper mold and a lower mold, closing the shaping mold, pressing the shaping mold, applying an electric current to the substrates in the direction of lamination utilizing the upper and lower molds as electrodes, and utilizing electric resistance of a material constituting each of the substrates to generate the heat. The heat generated in the substrates propagates to a fixing material that is interposed between the substrates and can soften or melt the fixing material. When the application of the electric current is completed, the fixing material is cooled by air to the atmospheric temperature and solidified, and therefore the substrate layers are fixed to each other. In this manner, the time required for carrying out steps (2) and (3) in the above-mentioned preform production can be shortened greatly. In addition, since the temperature of the substrates can be increased by applying an electric current for a short period of time and the whole of the mold cannot be heated, the amount of energy consumption required for the heating can also be reduced greatly.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">However, in the conventional conduction heating methods, a portion to be fixed in a substrate laminate cannot be fixed properly, and a fixed portion cannot be predicted or controlled. Furthermore, there is also a problem that a part of the shaping mold is melted or damaged locally. Therefore, in the conventional conduction heating<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> methods, it is difficult to produce a preform having a predetermined shape with high accuracy and good productivity.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</b></heading><heading id="h0004"><b>PATENT DOCUMENTS</b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2011168009A"><text>Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2011-168009</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP59002815A"><text>Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 59-2815</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 3: <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2009073132A"><text>Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2009-73132</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><heading id="h0006"><b>PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention addresses such a problem that, in view of the current state of the prior art techniques, in the production of a preform having a predetermined shape, which is a molding precursor of an FRP, employing a conduction heating method, a portion to be fixed in a substrate laminate is fixed properly, the occurrence of the damage of a shaping mold after draping is prevented, the cycle time is shortened to reduce the amount of energy consumption, and the productivity of the preform is increased.</p><heading id="h0007"><b>MEANS OF SOLVING THE PROBLEMS</b></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present inventors have studied in detail on the problems of the conventional conduction heating methods. As a result, it is found that the local melting and damaging of a shaping mold occurs in a part of the shaping mold in which the thickness of the laminate is reduced during pressing. Generally, an electric current flows in a larger amount in an area having lower electric resistance. If there is a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> thickness-reduced portion in a laminate, the flow of an electric current concentrates only in this portion in which electric resistance is low and heat is generated in the laminate locally, and therefore an upper mold or a lower mold in the shaping mold is partially melted and damaged at a portion thereof that is located adjacent to the locally heat-generated portion. Furthermore, the above-mentioned concentrated flow of an electric current can also be caused by a small change in the thickness of the cavity of a mold, which is caused in association with the surface roughness of the mold, or a small change in the unevenness of the surface of a fabric that constitutes the reinforcing fiber substrate. If the concentrated and local flow of an electric current occurs in an unintended portion that is different from a portion to be fixed in the substrate laminate, a sufficient amount of an electric current cannot flow at the portion to be fixed and therefore heat cannot be generated in the laminate. As a result, the portion to be fixed cannot be fixed properly.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present inventors have further made intensive studies on the basis of the above-mentioned finding. As a result, the present invention can be achieved.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">For solving the above-mentioned problems, the constitution of the method for producing a reinforcing fiber preform according to the present invention is as follows: a method for producing a reinforcing fiber preform, comprising: holding at least one substrate laminate by a shaping mold composed of at least two molds that face each other, wherein the at least one substrate laminate is selected from a substrate laminate which is produced by laminating multiple reinforcing fiber substrates each having a fixing material applied to at least one surface thereof and a substrate laminate which is produced by laminating multiple reinforcing fiber substrates with the fixing material<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> interposed therebetween; and subsequently applying an electric current to the substrate laminate in the direction of lamination to heat the reinforcing fiber substrates and therefore apply heat to the fixing material, thereby fixing the substrate layers in the substrate laminate to each other; wherein a means for making the electric resistance in a fixing area in the substrate laminate relatively lower compared with that in a non-fixing area in the substrate laminate is provided.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">For solving the above-mentioned problems, the constitution of the apparatus for producing a reinforcing fiber preform according to the present invention is as follows: an apparatus for producing a reinforcing fiber preform, which is so configured that a power supply is connected to at least two molds, which constitute a shaping mold and face each other, so that a voltage can be applied to a reinforcing fiber substrate laminate placed between the molds of the shaping mold, wherein the apparatus is equipped with a mechanism for making the electric resistance in a fixing area in the substrate laminate relatively lower compared with that in a non-fixing area in the substrate laminate.</p><heading id="h0008"><b>ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECT OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the method and the apparatus for producing a preform of the present invention, it becomes possible to draping a preform, which is a molding precursor of an FRP, into a predetermined shape with a short draping cycle time, with a small amount of energy consumption and with high efficiency, and it also becomes possible to produce a desired preform with high productivity.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to the method and the apparatus, a portion at which an electric<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> current can flow, which cannot be predicted in the conventional preform production methods employing a conduction heating method, can be utilized as a specified portion.

Each of the upper mold 13 and the lower mold 14 is made from a conductive material such as aluminum, copper and iron, and can act as an electrode. In each of the upper mold 13 and the lower mold 14, it may be possible that only a part which is in contact with a fixing area in a substrate laminate is made from a conductive material and a part which is in contact with a non-fixing area in the substrate laminate is made from an insulating material. The term "a fixing area" as used herein refers to an area in a substrate laminate in which substrates are needed to be fixed for the purpose of producing a desired preform. The term "a non-fixing area" as used herein refers to an area in a substrate laminate which is other than the fixing area. The voltage of a power supply 18 can be controlled by a transformer 17 and is applied between the upper mold 13 and the lower mold 14.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A voltage is applied to the upper mold 13 and the lower mold 14 while placing a substrate laminate 12 in a predetermined place in a shaping mold 11 and press-draping the substrate laminate 12 in that place, whereby an electric current flows in the substrate laminate 12 in the direction of lamination (i.e., the direction of thickness). In the present invention, it is important to provide a means for setting the electric resistance in the fixing area 15 relatively lower compared with that in the non-fixing area 16 in the substrate laminate 12. The electric resistance in the fixing area 15 and the electric resistance in the non-fixing area 16 can be obtained by, for example, carrying out a preliminary test in advance, cutting out a 20-square-mm test piece from each area in a preform obtained after the application of an electric current, attaching a measurement<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> terminal of an insulation resistance meter to each of the front and back surfaces of the cut-out test piece while preventing the thickness of the cut-out test piece from being changed, and then measuring the electric resistance of the cut-out test piece in the direction of lamination. The setting of the electric resistance will be mentioned below. According to the specific embodiments mentioned below, even though the electric resistance in each area before the application of an electric current is not specified particularly, the electric resistance in a fixing area can be made relatively lower compared with that in a non-fixing area.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1 (b)</figref> shows a schematic illustration of the apparatus for producing a reinforcing fiber preform according to the present invention, in which an electric current is being applied.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As mentioned above, in the substrate laminate, an electric current can flow in the fixing area 15 preferentially upon the application of the electric current as illustrated by an electric current flow pathway 19 by making the electric resistance in the fixing area 15 lower compared with that in the non-fixing area 16. In this manner, Joule heat is generated in a reinforcing fiber substrate in the substrate laminate 12 which exists in the fixing area 15, and the heat is transferred to a fixing material (not shown) which is previously interposed between the substrates. As a result, the substrates can be fixed to each other in a manner as mentioned below. That is, it becomes possible to fix an intended area without fail by making the electric resistance in the fixing area 15 lower compared with that in the non-fixing area 16. Although the electric resistance in the fixing area 15 is set to a lower value compared with that in the non-fixing area 16, it is preferred to make the electric resistance uniform in the fixing area 15. When the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> electric resistance in the fixing area 15 is made uniform, the same amount of an electric current can flow and the same amount of Joule heat can be generated under the same conditions in the fixing area 15, and therefore it becomes possible to produce a preform in which the inside of the fixing area 15 is fixed by a uniform fixing force.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the present invention, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)</figref>, the upper mold and/or the lower mold to be used may be divided into multiple pieces depending on the intended shape or size of a product to be draped. When a voltage is applied to the upper mold 23 and the lower mold 24 while placing the substrate laminate 22 in a predetermined place in the shaping mold 21 and press-draping the substrate laminate 22 in the place, an electric current can flow in the substrate laminate 22 in the direction of lamination (i.e., the direction of thickness) through an electric current flow pathway 29 which is defined by a regulation mechanism 20. When a mold divided into multiple pieces is used, the electric current to be flown in the electric current flow pathway 29 and/or the voltage to be applied to the mold can be controlled by the regulation mechanism 20. For example, different electric currents and/or voltages may be respectively and simultaneously applied to the divided multiple pieces of the mold, or an electric current and/or a voltage may be applied to only a specific piece among the multiple pieces of the mold. Of course, it may also be possible to apply the same amount of an electric current and/or the same amount of a voltage to all of the divided pieces of the mold. Furthermore, when a mold which is divided into multiple pieces is used, an electric current may be applied to only a specific piece of the mold by press-draping only the specific piece among all of the divided pieces of the mold.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the present invention, the reinforcing fibers to be exist in the fixing area are<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> required to have electric conductivity. As the reinforcing fibers having electric conductivity, carbon fibers, metal fibers and the like can be mentioned. For producing a molding having a light weight and excellent mechanical properties by impregnating a preform with a resin and then curing the resin, it is preferred to mainly use carbon fibers. The reinforcing fibers existing in the non-fixing area is not necessarily required to have electric conductivity. However, when reinforcing fibers having electric conductivity are used, reinforcing fibers having the highest volume resistivity among reinforcing fibers existing in the fixing area or reinforcing fibers having a higher volume resistivity than the above-mentioned highest volume resistivity are used. Particularly when the reinforcing fibers are, for example, to be inserted partially in the non-fixing area, the reinforcing fibers are not required to have electrical conductivity, and reinforcing fibers having substantially no electric conductivity, such as glass fibers, aramid fibers, boron fibers, alumina fibers, silicon carbide high-strength synthetic fibers, can be used. The form of the reinforcing fiber substrate is not particularly limited, and a one-direction sheet, a woven fabric, a non-woven fabric and the like can be used.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">For the purpose of producing the substrate laminate, multiple reinforcing fiber substrates each having a fixing material attached to at least one surface thereof are laminated. The substrate laminate may be produced by laminating multiple reinforcing fiber substrates with a fixing material interposed therebetween. At least one of the substrate laminates produced by the above-mentioned two ways is held by a shaping mold composed of at least two molds that face each other in the above-mentioned manner, and subsequently an electric current is applied to the substrate laminate in the direction of lamination to heat the reinforcing fiber substrates so that heat can be applied to the fixing material, thereby fixing the substrate layers in<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> the substrate laminate to each other.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In the present invention, the fixing material can have at least one form selected from a powder, a strip, fibers and a sheet. In other words, it is possible to use multiple forms of fixing materials in the laminate depending on the desired shape, mechanical properties and the like of the product. In the substrate laminate, the substrates can be fixed to each other by a thermal fixing method using the fixing material interposed between the substrate layers. The arrangement of the fixing material in the laminate is not particularly limited. The fixing material may be adhered onto each of the substrates in advance or may be inserted between the reinforcing fiber substrates upon the lamination.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The term "a thermal fixing method" as used herein refers to a method including applying heat to the fixing material to physically and/or chemically alter the state of the fixing material, thereby solidifying the fixing material and therefore fixing the substrate layers to each other. For example, when a fixing material containing a thermoplastic resin as the main component is used, the substrates can be fixed to each other by applying heat to the fixing material to melt the fixing material and subsequently cooling the melted fixing material to solidify the fixing material existing between the substrate layers. When a fixing material containing a heat-curable resin as the main component is used, the substrate layers can be fixed to each other by applying heat in an amount required for causing a reaction to the fixing material to solidify (cure) the fixing material existing between the substrate layers. The amount of the fixing material to be applied is preferably 0.1 to 10 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of the reinforcing fiber substrates. If the amount of the fixing material applied is smaller than<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> 0.1 parts by weight, it often happens that the resultant preform cannot keep the shape thereof and therefore the preform cannot be used in molding. On the other hand, if the amount of the fixing material applied is larger than 10 parts by weight, the fixing material might prevent the impregnation with a resin upon molding.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In the present invention, as one means for making the electric resistance in the fixing area 25 relatively lower compared with that in the non-fixing area 26, a means for making the fiber occupation ratio in the fixing area 25 relatively higher compared with that in the non-fixing area 26 upon the holding of the substrate laminate by the shaping mold can be employed. When the fiber occupation ratio in the fixing area 25 is made higher, the fibers existing in the vicinity of the area can be closely adhered and therefore the number of passages through which an electric current can flow can be increased in the area. As a result, the electric resistance in the fixing area 25 can be reduced. The term "a fiber occupation ratio (Vf)" as used herein refers to a value determined in accordance with the following formula (unit: %). <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Vf</mi><mfenced><mo>%</mo></mfenced><mo>=</mo><mfenced separators=""><mi mathvariant="normal">W</mi><mo>×</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">n</mi></mfenced><mo>/</mo><mfenced separators=""><mi mathvariant="normal">ρ</mi><mo>×</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">T</mi><mo>×</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">10</mn></mfenced></mrow></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="54" he="5" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> wherein

It is more preferred that the fiber occupation ratio in the fixing area ranges from 25 to 50%. If the difference in the fiber occupation ratio is less than 1%, a sufficient amount of difference in electric resistance between the fixing area and the non-fixing area cannot occur, and therefore the effect of the present invention cannot be exerted satisfactorily. However, even if the difference in the fiber occupation ratio is 1% or more, when the fiber occupation ratio in the fixing area is more than 70%, a substrate layer-substrate layer-contacting area in which the electric resistance is extremely low is formed as the result of the fluctuations in the areal weights of the reinforcing fiber substrates or the like in the area and the electric current is concentrated in the area. Therefore, it becomes difficult to predict and control a portion in which the electric current can flow, and a part of the upper mold or the lower mold which is located in the vicinity of the above-mentioned area is melted or damaged. On the other hand, when the difference in the fiber occupation ratio is 1 % or more and the fiber occupation ratio in the fixing area ranges from 25 to 70%, particularly from 25 to 50%, the fluctuations in the electric resistance in a substrate layer-substrate layer-contacting area become small and an electric current can flow in a wide area regardless of the fluctuations in areal weights of the reinforcing fiber substrates or the like, and therefore it becomes possible to predict and control a portion in which the electric current can flow. If the fiber occupation ratio in the fixing area is less than 25%, the fiber density is reduced in the whole area of the preform and therefore rigidity of the preform is lowered and it becomes difficult to keep the shape of the preform.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In the present invention, as the means for making the fiber occupation ratio in the fixing area relatively higher compared with fiber content in the non-fixing area, a<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> means for making the thickness of the laminate in the fixing area relatively smaller compared with the thickness of the substrate laminate in the non-fixing area can be employed.
