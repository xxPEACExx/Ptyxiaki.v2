Switches in the prior art generally comprise a button and a three-position contact module, wherein the button is used to control the three-position contact module in order to change the state of the contacts, e.g. a similar structure is disclosed in US patent announcement no. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4282414A"><text>US 4282414</text></patcit>. However, the structure of the three-position contact module is rather complex, with poor stability and high costs.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Furthermore, since an ordinary two-position contact module only has two states (on and off), an existing button cannot achieve three-position on/off switching if an ordinary two-position contact module is used.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Content of the invention</u></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">The present invention is intended to provide a button which can be used to control a two-position contact module to achieve three-position on/off switching.

the button is pressed so that the first pushing rod slides towards the generic two-position contact module, and so that the elastic member is compressed; the bridge moves with the first pushing rod until the bridge triggers the connection of the normally-open contact; the second pushing rod is supported<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> by the normally-closed contact and so does not move; when the button is released, the button returns to the equilibrium position, under the action of the restoring elastic force of the elastic member;<br/>
pulling the button up from the equilibrium position causes the first pushing rod to move in a direction away from the generic two-position contact module, and the elastic member to be compressed; the bridge drives the second pushing rod to move together with the bridge in the direction away from the generic two-position contact module, until the second pushing rod triggers through the connection of the normally-closed contact.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The button in an embodiment of the present invention and the switch which uses the button can use the first pushing rod to drive the bridge to move so as to control the on/off switching of the normally-open contact of the generic two-position contact module, and use the second pushing rod mounted on the bridge to control the on/off switching of the normally-closed contact of the generic two-position contact module, thereby achieving three-position on/off switching. Compared to a three-position contact module, the generic two-position contact module has a simple structure, and cost body, while mounting and replacement are convenient. Thus, when the switch of the button in an embodiment of the present invention is used, a generic two-position contact module with a lower cost can be used to achieve three-position on/off switching, with lower costs and convenient mounting and replacement.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The explanation above is merely an overview of the technical solution of the present invention.

A first end of the first pushing rod 150 is located in the first tube portion 112, and connected to the operating portion 120; thus, the operating portion 120 can drive the first pushing rod 150 to slide in the housing 110 relative to the mount 130 in the axial direction D1. A second end of the first pushing rod 150 is located in the second tube portion 113. In one embodiment, a projection 152 in contact with an upper part of the elastic member 170 (when the button 100 is in the position shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) can be provided on the first pushing rod 150, for applying an acting force to the elastic member 170.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The bridge 160 is disposed on the second end of the first pushing rod 150 and is located in the second tube portion 113. The bridge 160 can move together with the first pushing rod 150. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, the bridge 160 comprises a body 162, two extending portions 163 and a sidewall 165. The body 162 is substantially annular, may be used for mounting the first pushing rod 150, and may be used for triggering the connection of a normally-open contact in a two-position contact module. The two extending portions 163 are disposed on the body 162 in a substantially perpendicular manner, and can serve a guiding function. A guiding structure 164 such as a groove (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>) or a protrusion may be formed on an outer surface of the extending portion 163; in<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> this case, a protrusion or groove may be correspondingly disposed on an inner surface of the second tube portion 113, in order to guide the sliding of the bridge 160 in the second tube portion 113. The sidewall 165 is disposed on the body 110 in a substantially perpendicular manner and is located between the two extending portions 163. In one embodiment, the sidewall 165 is arranged along a periphery of the body 110 and is arcuate. A gap 166 is formed in the sidewall 165 and body 110; two recessed portions 167 are formed on an inner surface of the sidewall 165 and located on two sides of the gap 166, so that parts of the sidewall 165 which are close to the gap 166 become a thin-walled structure to mount the second pushing rod 190.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The elastic member 170 and spacer 180 are disposed on the first pushing rod 150 and located between the mount 130 and the step 1132 of the second tube portion 113. In one embodiment, the elastic member 170 is a spring which surrounds the first pushing rod 150; one end of the elastic member 170 is in contact with the projection 152 on the first pushing rod 150, while the other end is in contact with the spacer 180. The spacer 180 surrounds the first pushing rod 150 and is sandwiched between the elastic member 170 and the step 1132 of the second tube portion 113.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref> show, the second pushing rod 190 comprises a base body 192 and two extension arms 193. The base body 192 is substantially rod-shaped, and can be disposed in the gap 166 of the bridge 160. The two extension arms 193 are disposed on two sides of the base body 192, and are disposed to correspond to the two recessed portions 167 on the bridge 160. When the base body 192 is located in the gap 166 of the bridge 160, the two extension arms 193 are located inside the bridge 160 and are respectively in contact with the two recessed portions 167, so that the second pushing rod 190 is slidably disposed on the bridge 160. In one embodiment, the two extension arms 193 are arcuate.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Described above is a particular structure of the button 100 in an embodiment of the present invention. A method of using the button 100 is explained briefly below, taking as an example the use of the button 100 to control a generic two-position contact module (i.e. the button 100 and the generic two-position contact module form a switch) to achieve three-position on/off switching.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The generic two-position contact module comprises a normally-open contact and a normally-closed contact.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">When the button 100 is in the position shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the button 100 is in an equilibrium position; at this time, a lower part of the second pushing rod 190 is in contact with the body 162 of the bridge 160, while an upper part of the second pushing rod 190 is acted upon by the elastic member 170 and the spacer 180 and is thereby held in the position shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. When the button 100 in the equilibrium position is used for the generic two-position contact module, a bottom end or free end of the second pushing rod 190 can be made to trigger the disconnection of the normally-closed contact of the two-position contact module, i.e. both the normally-open contact and the normally-closed contact of the generic two-position contact module are in a disconnected state.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The button 100 is pressed so that the first pushing rod 150 slides in the mount 130 towards the generic two-position contact module in the direction from the first tube portion 112 to the second tube portion 113; at the same time, the bridge 160 also slides in the second tube portion 113 until the bridge 160 triggers the connection of the normally-open contact of the generic two-position contact module. During this process, the projection 152 on the first pushing rod 150 compresses the elastic member 170; since the bottom end or free end of the second pushing rod 190 is supported by the normally-closed<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> contact of the generic two-position contact module (the normally-closed contact may have a spring structure, wherein the elastic force of the spring can support the second pushing rod 190) and so cannot move, the normally-closed contact of the generic two-position contact module remains in a disconnected state, whereas the normally-open contact of the generic two-position contact module is in a connected state. When the button 100 is released, the first pushing rod 150 and bridge 160 return to the position shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, under the action of the restoring elastic force of the elastic member 170.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">When the button 100 is pulled up from the equilibrium position shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the first pushing rod 150 moves in the mount 130 in the direction from the second tube portion 113 to the first tube portion 112; during this process, the elastic member 170 is compressed, and the bridge 160 can drive the second pushing rod 190 to move together with the bridge away from the generic two-position contact module in the direction from the second tube portion 113 to the first tube portion 112, until connection of the normally-closed contact of the generic two-position contact module is triggered. At this time, the normally-closed contact of the generic two-position contact module is in a connected state, whereas the normally-open contact of the generic two-position contact module is in a disconnected state.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As described above, the button 100 in an embodiment of the present invention can use the first pushing rod 150 to drive the bridge 160 to move so as to control the on/off switching of the normally-open contact of the generic two-position contact module, and use the second pushing rod 190 mounted on the bridge 160 to control the on/off switching of the normally-closed contact of the generic two-position contact module, thereby achieving three-position on/off switching. Compared to a three-position contact module, the generic two-position contact module has a simple structure, and cost body, while<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> mounting and replacement are convenient. Thus, when the switch of the button 100 in an embodiment of the present invention is used, a generic two-position contact module with a lower cost can be used to achieve three-position on/off switching, with lower costs and convenient mounting and replacement.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In summary, the present invention discloses a button, comprising a housing, an operating portion, a mount, a first pushing rod, a bridge, an elastic member and a second pushing rod; the mount is mounted in the housing; the first pushing rod is movably disposed in the mount; a projection is formed on the first pushing rod; the bridge and the operating portion are disposed on two ends of the first pushing rod; the second pushing rod is movably disposed on the bridge and is acted upon by the elastic member; a step is formed in the housing; the step is located between the mount and the bridge; the elastic member is disposed on the first pushing rod and is located between the projection and the step; the first pushing rod can slide relative to the mount under the action of the operating portion or the elastic member, and drive the bridge and/or the second pushing rod to move.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The above embodiments are merely preferred embodiments of the present invention, which are not intended to limit it.
