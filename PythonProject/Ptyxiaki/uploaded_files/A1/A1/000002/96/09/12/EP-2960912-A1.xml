During compensation or filtering of a power grid, the power capacitor is connected or disconnected through a capacitor switch, or the capacitor switch and the power capacitor are always used in combination. However, the conventional power capacitor and capacitor switch are produced in two different industries, and the power sector needs to separately purchase the two products and assemble them on equipment prior to use. Because power capacitors of different sizes require different switches, matching of different power capacitors with suitable capacitor switches must be considered in use. High-order harmonics in the power grid generate resonance under specific conditions to cause damage of the capacitor, and in order to avoid the resonance caused by the high-order harmonics, a reactor is generally connected in series in the capacitor circuit to prevent damage of the capacitor. In practice, the series-connected reactor can only solve part of the problem of high-order harmonic resonance, and cannot solve the resonance problem fundamentally, and even with the reactor, burnout of the power capacitor also occurs due to high-order resonance. The conventional capacitor switch is a contactor-type capacitor switch, and such a switch has large power consumption generally around 15W. The conventional combination of the power capacitor and the switch is a combination of a three-phase power capacitor and a three-phase switch. When the capacitor is disconnected through the switch, the residual voltage of one phase of capacitor always reaches 1.36 times the peak supply voltage, and the capacitor must be discharged before being connected again, so that such combination of the switch and the capacitor cannot achieve rapid capacitor switching. In addition, a discharge resistor must be installed inside the conventional power capacitor as required by safety<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> specifications, but the discharge resistor produces large power consumption. The power consumption of the power grid caused by the discharge resistor exceeds 100 million kilowatts per year (merely according to the calculation of State Grid).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The conventional power capacitor generally adopts a mechanical thermal expansion snap-type explosion-proof mechanism in order to prevent explosion due to overheating of the capacitor. Such explosion-proof mechanism starts cutting off the capacitor when the capacitor is overheated. However, the explosion-proof mechanism is unrecoverable, and the capacitor can no longer be used once the explosion-proof mechanism operates. That is, the power capacitor that should not fail fails under some unexpected overheating conditions. Besides, such mechanical explosion-proof mechanism has high requirements on sealing of the capacitor, and the thermal expansion explosion-proof mechanism does not operate upon leakage. Further, such explosion-proof mechanism has low response speed, and cannot respond quickly to protect the capacitor when resonance occurs in the capacitor circuit.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">There is also an intelligent capacitor as disclosed in Chinese Patent No. ZL200620071465.7 now on the market. In this intelligent capacitor, a three-phase capacitor and a capacitor switch are simply combined, instead of designing the power capacitor and the capacitor switch as a whole product, with the mere effect that a user does not need to worry about selecting matching switches for different capacitors and the capacitor switch and the capacitor do not need to be connected during installation. However, such intelligent capacitor still cannot effectively solve the problems of protection against capacitor heating, harmonic protection, power consumption of the capacitor switch, and rapid capacitor switching.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An external temperature protection and overcurrent and overvoltage protection device used in practice can also protect the capacitor from damage when the power capacitor is overheated or subjected to an overcurrent or overvoltage. However, the external protection device is rarely used because of the cost and mainly because the external protection device cannot detect the actual operating status in a capacitor core. The external protection device makes little sense as it cannot achieve accurate and rapid protection.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Now the capacity of general three-phase power capacitors is over 30 kvar. Due to the cost of a small-capacity power capacitor and the cost of a capacitor switch, conventional reactive<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> compensation devices using power capacitors and having power lower than 30 kvar generally cannot achieve graded compensation, while reactive compensation devices with high power cannot achieve fine compensation.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In view of the above, the power capacitor operates in a poor power grid environment due to the presence of a large amount of harmonics. Because there is no effective, reliable and low-cost way of protecting the power capacitor, the protection of the low-voltage power capacitor remains to be a tough problem.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the Invention</b></heading><heading id="h0004">Technical problems</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The objective of the present invention is to provide a low-voltage intelligent switch capacitor having a capacitor switch and multiple protection devices, in which the capacitor switch, a power capacitor and overheating, overcurrent and overvoltage protection devices are integrated and designed as a whole to achieve an optimal combination of various parts so as to overcome the aforementioned deficiencies in the prior art.

A bottom of the control interface 7 is connected to the intelligent switch circuit board 3. A wire fastening device is disposed inside the leading-out terminal of the three-phase power line. The wire fastening device is a wire fastening nut or a wire fastening pressing plate. Low-voltage compensation power capacitors generally need a sealed structure due to moisture-proof and insulation requirements, so there is high requirement on the reliability of the capacitor switch installed inside the sealed housing.

Because a temperature processing circuit is inside the housing of the capacitor and even every capacitor core may be provided with a temperature sensor, and the capacitor is damaged generally as a certain weak capacitor core is overheated and damaged first, the operating status of the capacitor can be acquired more accurately and rapidly by disposing the temperature sensor on the capacitor core, so as to achieve accurate and rapid protection.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A large current passes through the capacitor during operation of the compensation capacitor, and if the lead terminal of the capacitor is not tightened in installation or the terminal of the capacitor is oxidized during use, the terminal of the compensation capacitor produces intense heat during operation, which is the cause of an early failure of the compensation capacitor. In the intelligent switch capacitor of the present invention, the temperature sensor may be installed near the leading-out terminal 6 of the three-phase power line, and if an excessively high temperature of the lead terminal 6 is detected, the switch may be cut off so that the intelligent switch capacitor stops operation, thereby preventing damage of the capacitor caused by overheating of the lead terminal.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The circuit shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic block diagram of a three-phase common compensation intelligent switch capacitor according to an embodiment of the present invention. The capacitor switch 5 is three independent relays 5-1, 5-2, and 5-3 that respectively control switches K1, K2, and K3. The switches K1, K2, and K3 are in intra-angle connection with three groups of capacitor cores, that is, each switch is connected to one capacitor core. The intelligent switch circuit board 3 controls the action time of each capacitor switch contact, so as to achieve surge-free capacitor switching of the alternating current capacitor. Besides, such structure in which the switch and the capacitor are connected may also control capacitor switching of a single one or two of the switches K1, K2, and K3, that is, achieving separate phase compensation.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The intelligent switch capacitor of the present invention may also be made into a structure used for star circuit compensation. In this case, the intelligent switch capacitor adopts four terminals A/B/C/N for leading out, and the schematic circuit block diagram is shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>. Similarly, relays 5-1, 5-2, and 5-3 respectively control switches K1, K2, and K3, the switches K1, K2, and K3 form star connection with three groups of capacitor cores, and the intelligent switch circuit board 3 controls the action time of each capacitor switch contact, so as to achieve surge-free capacitor switching of the alternating current capacitor. Similarly, if capacitor switching of a single one or two of the switches K1, K2, and K3 is controlled, separate phase compensation is achieved for the star circuit.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">It can be seen from the embodiments shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3 and FIG. 4</figref> that, the intelligent switch capacitor, either of a triangle structure or of a star structure, of the present invention can easily achieve capacitance output with common compensation and separate compensation, which is difficult for a conventional structure in which a capacitor switch and a capacitor are separated.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic circuit block diagram of an intelligent switch capacitor with multi-level capacity output according to an embodiment of the present invention. The capacity ratio of C11, C12, and C13 is 1:2:4 in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>. Different capacities of 1 to 7 levels may be output by controlling the action combinations of the switches K11, K21, and K31, and C21, C22, and C23 and C31, C32, and C33 are also in the same capacity ratio. The embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> can achieve output of different capacities of 1 to 7 levels and can also achieve output of different capacities of three phases by controlling the capacitor switching combinations of the switches K11-K33, so as to fulfill the function of three-phase unbalanced separate phase compensation required by the power grid. If the conventional approach in which the capacitor switch and the capacitor are separated is used, 9 capacitor switches and 9 capacitors are required, so the intelligent switch capacitor with multi-level capacity output according to the embodiment of the present invention has obvious advantages. More capacity outputs can be achieved if one more level of switch groups and capacitor groups is used, which is easy for general designers and will not be described herein again.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The solution of the intelligent switch capacitor with multi-level capacity output in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> can be easily achieved by means of a rectangular housing structure, because a conventional<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> rectangular power capacitor is formed by many small-capacity capacitor cores connected in parallel. If a cylindrical shaped structure is used, a coaxial annular capacitor core structure may be used to achieve multiple capacity outputs. The present invention proposes use of 7 capacitor cores with the same diameter arranged in a hexagon as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6-2</figref>, in which any two cores are connected in parallel and any four cores are connected in parallel so as to achieve 1:2:4 capacity outputs. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6-1</figref>, a control switch board of each capacitor group may also be placed above the corresponding capacitor group, so that the distance of a wire between a control switch and a controlled capacitor group can be shortened to optimize the structure of the intelligent switch capacitor with multi-level capacity output. The intelligent switch capacitor of the present invention may be made into a structure in which a single capacitor switch controls a single capacitor, that is, into a single-phase intelligent switch capacitor.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In the intelligent switch capacitor of the present invention, in order to reduce power consumption of the control circuit, the main measure taken is to use a capacitive buck rectifier power supply 12 to supply power to the intelligent switch circuit board 3 and use a magnetic latching relay to serve as the capacitor switch 5. In this way, the overall power consumption of the circuit is greatly reduced, and the overall power consumption of the control circuit can be controlled below hundreds of milliwatts, which saves energy and more particularly reduces heat produced by the control circuit in the housing of the capacitor.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8</figref>, in the intelligent switch capacitor of the present invention, the housing 1 is cube-shaped or cylinder-shaped, and the intelligent switch circuit board 3 can be disposed above the capacitor core 2 irrespective of the shape of the intelligent switch capacitor.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the embodiments of the intelligent switch capacitor of the present invention, the control interface 7 of the capacitor switch and a reactive compensation controller may be connected in a wired manner or in an infrared or wireless manner.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">During use, in function: the temperature sensor 8 on the capacitor core 2 and the temperature measurement module 9 on the intelligent switch circuit board 3 can have an overheating protection function. When the detected temperature is higher than a predetermined value, the intelligent switch circuit board 3 controls the capacitor switch 5 to be disconnected,<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> and the capacitor stops operation and enters a protected state. Such temperature protection is fast, and protection temperature can be set precisely and can be adjusted according to seasonal changes through the control interface 7 of the capacitor switch. Above all such protection is recoverable, that is, the capacitor can operate normally when it does not produce heat; meanwhile, because the capacitor core 2, the intelligent switch circuit board 3, and the capacitor switch 5 are made into a whole, installation is convenient and the reliability of the capacitor is improved. The current measurement module 10 and the current harmonic component measurement module 11 on the intelligent switch circuit board 3 can have a harmonic protection function. When power grid resonance is caused by an excessively high voltage of the power grid, high-order harmonics in the power grid or connection of the capacitor, once the detected current or current harmonic component exceeds a predetermined value, the capacitor switch 5 is cut off so as to ensure that the capacitor core 2 is not subjected to an overcurrent and thus is not burnt out. Moreover, the predetermined value of the overcurrent and the threshold of the harmonic component can be adjusted through the switch control interface 7, and the delay time of the protection action of the capacitor switch can be adjusted. In cost: because the intelligent switch capacitor has the harmonic protection function, a reactor for protection can be omitted, thereby greatly reducing the cost of a compensation device, and because such protection is performed against all harmonics higher than second harmonics, the fatal weakness of unreliable harmonic protection of the reactor is completely eliminated; further, because the thermal protection device, the harmonic protection device, and the switch are integrated, the cost of the switch is greatly reduced.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In energy saving: the intelligent switch capacitor of the present invention enables removal of a discharge resistor connected in parallel to a capacitor terminal while ensuring safety, so that the problem of power consumption of the discharge resistor of the power capacitor is solved. Besides, the intelligent switch circuit board 3 of the intelligent switch capacitor of the present invention adopts a low-power design, and the overall power consumption can be made below hundreds of milliwatts and is far lower than 15W of a conventional contactor-type capacitor switch. The capacitor switching speed of the intelligent switch capacitor of the present invention can be as high as that of a thyristor while the power consumption of the switch is far lower than that of a capacitor switch of the thyristor.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The present invention is not limited to the aforementioned most preferable implementation manners.
