Still more particularly, the present disclosure relates to a method and apparatus for optimizing the transmission and reception of radiation by elements in a phased array antenna based on a predicted future health state for elements in the phased array antenna.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Phased array antennas are used in many applications. For example, phased array antennas may be used for communications, detecting objects, tracking the movement of objects, and other suitable applications.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A phased array antenna has antenna elements electrically connected to at least one of a transmitter and a receiver. These antenna elements may be referred to as elements. An antenna element is an electrical device that converts electrical signals into electromagnetic radiation, and electromagnetic radiation into electrical signals. For example, a phased array antenna may be configured to convert electrical signals received from a transmitter into electromagnetic radiation for transmission. Further, an antenna may be configured to convert electromagnetic radiation received at the phased array antenna by the elements into electrical signals to be sent to a receiver.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In some cases, the amplitudes, phases, or both amplitudes and phases of the respective electrical signals being received at or sent from the different antenna elements in the antenna may be varied to change a radiation pattern of the antenna. The antenna elements<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> may be referred to just as "elements." The radiation pattern of an antenna describes the directional dependence of the strength of the electromagnetic radiation transmitted by the antenna or the sensitivity of the antenna to electromagnetic radiation received by the antenna.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The different elements in a phased array antenna may degrade and may fail over time. As a result, the configuration for transmitting signals using the phased array antenna may vary from the desired pattern for a particular application. Consequently, the phased array antenna may not perform as desired during a mission.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Many of the platforms that carry a phased array antenna may not have the ability to detect the failure or degradation of elements in the phased array antenna. Additionally, many of these platforms also may not have the processing power to identify a new configuration during a mission if one or more elements failed during the course of the mission.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As a result, the mission may not provide a desired result. In some cases, the mission may be aborted, the phased array antenna may be reconfigured, and the mission restarted. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a method and apparatus that take into account at least some of the issues discussed above, as well as other possible issues.</p><heading id="h0001"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">An embodiment of the present disclosure provides an apparatus comprising a phased array antenna optimizer.

For example, the degradation of elements in a phased array antenna may be taken into account for when those degradations occur during the mission. The degradation of an element may include the failure of the element to transmit or receive radiation signals.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that the current health state, as well as the predicted future health state of the elements at a future point in time, may be used to configure the elements in the phased array antenna. The illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that this type of configuration may lead to improved results from a mission as compared to currently used techniques.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Thus, the illustrative embodiments provide a method and apparatus for optimizing a phased array antenna. A predicted future health state for elements in the phased array of an antenna is identified. The elements are configured to use a radiation pattern based on the predicted future health state for the elements taking into account a potential degradation of a group of<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the elements that may potentially occur in the predicted future health state.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As used herein, a "group of" when used with reference to items means one or more items. For example, a group of elements is one or more elements.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">By taking into consideration what elements may degrade, the optimization of the configuration for the elements may be performed entirely off-line. In other words, the illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that this type of approach may be performed before a mission occurs. As a result, additional use of competition resources, sensors, or both are not required.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the illustrative examples, optimization of a component means that components may be set, configured, manipulated, or otherwise changed to perform as close as possible to a desired level of performance. This desired performance may be the best performance that may be obtained for the components or some lower-level that is selected for the desired level of performance of the components. The component may be, for example, a phased array antenna, a software application, a process, a controller, an element, a system, or some other type of component for which optimization may be desired.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the illustrative example, a platform carrying a phased array antenna does not need to be able to detect a degradation of the elements in the phase array antenna during the performance of the mission. In this manner, the weight, cost, complexity or some combination thereof for the phased array antenna, the platform, or both may be reduced.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The illustrative embodiments provide a method and apparatus for optimizing a phase array antenna. In one illustrative example, a predicted future health state for elements in the phased array antenna is identified.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> The elements are configured to use a radiation pattern based on the predicted future health state for the elements taking into account a potential degradation of a group of the elements. The configuration may optimize the phased array antenna for a mission that is to be performed at some point in time. The predicted future health state may be used to optimize the elements and may take into account the length of the mission.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">With reference now to the figures and in particular with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Figure 1</b></figref>, an illustration of a block diagram of a phased array antenna environment is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. In this illustrative example, phased array antenna environment <b>100</b> includes phased array antenna <b>102</b>. Phased array antenna <b>102</b> may be located on platform <b>104</b> and may operate to perform mission <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the illustrative example, platform <b>104</b> may take various forms. The platform may be, for example, a mobile platform, a stationary platform, a land-based structure, an aquatic-based structure, and a space-based structure. More specifically, the platform, may be an aircraft, surface ship, a tank, a personnel carrier, a train, a spacecraft, a space station, a satellite, a submarine, an automobile, a power plant, a bridge, a dam, a building, a missile, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a helicopter, and other suitable platforms.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the illustrative example, mission <b>106</b> may have various directions. Mission <b>106</b> may be, for example, communications, detection, surveillance, or other types of missions.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In these illustrative examples, phased array antenna optimizer <b>108</b> generates configuration <b>110</b> for phased array antenna <b>102</b>. Configuration <b>110</b> is used by phased array antenna <b>102</b> during operation, such as<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> performance of mission <b>106</b>. For example, phased array antenna optimizer <b>108</b> may generate data structure <b>112</b> containing configuration <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In particular, configuration <b>110</b> may be for the manner in which elements <b>114</b> in phased array antenna <b>102</b> uses radiation pattern <b>116</b>. Radiation pattern <b>116</b> is a function of the location, magnitude, and phase of each of elements <b>114</b>. As depicted, controller <b>118</b> receives data structure <b>112</b> containing configuration <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In this illustrative example, controller <b>118</b> controls the manner in which elements <b>114</b> generate radiation pattern <b>116</b> using configuration <b>110</b>. For example, controller <b>118</b> controls the amplitude, phase, and other characteristics of electrical signals <b>120</b> sent to elements <b>114</b> to use radiation pattern <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Elements <b>114</b> use radiation pattern <b>116</b> to perform at least one generating radiation pattern <b>116</b> or receiving radiation pattern <b>116</b>. As used herein, the phrase "at least one of," when used with a list of items, means different combinations of one or more of the listed items may be used and only one of each item in the list may be needed. In other words, at least one of means any combination of items and number of items may be used from the list but not all of the items in the list are required. The item may be a particular object, thing, or a category.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">For example, without limitation, "at least one of item A, item B, or item C" may include item A, item A and item B, or item B. This example also may include item A, item B, and item C or item B and item C. Of course, any combinations of these items may be present. In this illustrative example, at least one of one generating radiation pattern <b>116</b>, receiving radiation pattern <b>116</b>, or one generating radiation pattern <b>116</b> and<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> receiving radiation pattern <b>116</b>. In other words, elements <b>114</b> may be configured to perform any combination of generating or receiving radiation pattern <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In the illustrative example, in generating configuration <b>110</b>, phased array antenna optimizer <b>108</b> takes into account that elements <b>114</b> in phased array antenna <b>102</b> may not operate as desired over time. In other words, a group of elements <b>114</b> may have potential degradation <b>122</b>. For example, potential degradation <b>122</b> of one or more of the group of elements <b>114</b> may be a failure, reduction in performance or some combination thereof.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Thus, in this illustrative example, phased array antenna optimizer <b>108</b> identifies predicted future health state <b>124</b> for elements <b>114</b> in phased array antenna 102. Predicted future health state <b>124</b> is a health state for elements <b>114</b> that may occur at a future point in time. Predicted future health state <b>124</b> is in contrast to current health state <b>126</b> for elements 114 at the current point in time.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Phased array antenna optimizer <b>108</b> also identifies configuration <b>110</b> for elements <b>114</b> to use radiation pattern <b>116</b> based on predicted future health state <b>124</b> for elements <b>114</b> taking into account potential degradation <b>122</b> of a group of elements <b>114</b> in predicted future health state <b>124</b>.

Also, other blocks may be added in addition to the illustrated blocks in a flowchart or block diagram.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">For example, operation 302 may be omitted and operation <b>304</b> may identify the configuration based on the predicted future health state without the current health state.

However, this radiation pattern generated using the predicted future health state is selected to provide a desired level of performance for the elements in case the elements predicted to degrade actually degrade during operation of the phased array antenna.
