The junction box is provided with connecting terminals for electrically conductive sheets and connecting sheets connected between the connecting terminals and the electronic device.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As known by the inventor, a photovoltaic junction box generally comprises: a housing provided with a through hole for introducing an external cable thereon; a connecting terminal electrically connected with the introduced external cable through, for example, welding; and an electrically conductive sheet (a bus bar) connected between the connecting terminal and an electronic device (not shown), such as solar photovoltaic assembly. The conductive sheet is made of a thin metal material such as a copper foil and electrically connected with the connecting terminal through welding. Since the conductive sheet is very thin, a pseudo soldering may be generated during welding of the conductive sheet with the connecting terminal, which may result in a poor contact therebetween so that the conductive sheet is electrically connected with the connecting terminal intermittently. Further, a contact resistance between the conductive sheet and the connecting terminal is very high and thus an arc even may be generated, which results in a big potential risk. In addition, the welding process is very complicated and time-consuming, and components weld together are not easily separated from each other, which is not conducive for maintenance of a power generation panel of the solar photovoltaic assembly.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the photovoltaic junction box, another method for achieve an electrical connection of<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the conductive sheet with the connecting terminal is to use a holding member such as a spring clip to clamp them. However, using the holding member to clamp the electrically conductive sheet and the connecting terminal may result in a complicated structure and a high cost of the photovoltaic junction box. At the same time, since clamping the conductive sheet is performed by means of an elastic deformation of a metal, a clamping force provided by the spring clip is limited.</p><heading id="h0005"><b><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention has been made to overcome or alleviate at least one aspect of the above mentioned disadvantages.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention provides a photovoltaic junction box for a solar energy photovoltaic system which may achieve a firm mechanical connection between sheet-shaped connecting terminals and conductive sheets by a simply operation, improving transmission stability of weak signals and transmission quality of the signals.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a photovoltaic junction box comprising a housing and a plurality of connecting terminals mounted in the housing.

The present disclosure may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiment set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that the present disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the concept of the disclosure to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In addition, in the following detailed description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the disclosed embodiments. It will be apparent, however, that one or more embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are schematically shown in order to simplify the drawing.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">Figures 1 to 6</figref>, a photovoltaic junction box 100 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is used to connect electrically conductive sheets 10 in a electronic system, such as a solar photovoltaic module, communication assembly, for generating or transmitting weak electrical signals, and specifically to eclectically connect the electrically conductive sheets 10 to connecting terminals 2 of a electronic device provided in the photovoltaic junction box 100 which further processes or transmits the weak electrical signals transmitted from the conductive sheets.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A photovoltaic junction box 100 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention comprises: a housing 1 made of an insulating material for example; and a plurality of connecting terminals 2 mounted in the housing 1. Each connecting terminal 2 includes a main body portion 21 for electrically connecting with a cable 20 introduced into the housing 1; and a crimping mechanism 22 disposed at one end of the main body portion 21 to electrically connect with an electrically conductive sheet 10 introduced into the housing 1 in a manner of pressing.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 4 to 6</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment of the connecting terminal 2, the crimpling mechanism 22 includes a base 221 extending from the main body portion 21 in a first direction (a longitudinal direction of the connecting terminal 2) and at least one bending portion 222 each of which is integrally connected with the base 221 and constructed to bend towards the base 221 to press the conductive sheet 10 onto the base 221. Further, two bending portions 222 extend from both sides of the base 221 parallel to the first direction, respectively. In addition, the base 221 extends upwardly perpendicular to a plane, in which the main body portion 21 is located, in a direction away from a bottom of the housing 1. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref>, before the conductive sheet 10 is not pressed by the crimping mechanism 22, each of the bending portions 222 connected to both sides of the base 221 bends at an angle such as 80 to 120 degree relative to the base 221, so that the crimping mechanism 2 has a relatively small width and thus a bending operation become easier. Furthermore, it is possible for the electrically conductive sheet 10 passing through a through hole, for example, formed in the bottom of the housing 1 to be introduced therein to be easily inserted into the crimping mechanism 22 which is not crimped.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the photovoltaic junction box 100 according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, both the base 221 and the bending portions 222 are provided with a plurality of grooves 223 extending in a direction perpendicular to the first direction thereon. Each of the grooves 223 protrudes outwardly from an inner side of the crimping mechanism 22 for clamping the electrically conductive sheet 10. For example, the plurality of grooves 223 parallel to each other may be formed by means of punching. In this way, each of the grooves 223 protrudes at outer sides of the base 221 and the bending portions 222, which accordingly form a reinforcing rib, so that the two bending portions 222 may wrap the conductive sheet 10 together with the base 221 in a case where the conductive sheet 10 is pressed by the crimping mechanism 22, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref>. At this time, a part of the groove 223 protrudes outwardly function to maintain a bending state of the bending portions 222. In this way, the bending portions 222 having the grooves 223 may provide a greater pressing force, the crimping mechanism 22 will generate an irreversible metal deformation during crimping and apply a greater permanent pressing force to the conductive sheet (a bus bar) 10, and the pressing force will not gradually become smaller over time. Further, it is possible to avoid quality problems such as pseudo soldering during soldering by using the crimping mechanism 22 to electrically connect the connecting terminal 2 with the conductive sheet 10 by a mechanical operation without a soldering operation.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">Figures 1 to 4</figref>, in the photovoltaic junction box 100 according to the present application, the bottom 11 of the housing 1 is provided with a plurality of pairs of positioning devices 3 in a form of pillar upwardly projecting thereon with one connecting terminal 2 being disposed between each pair of the positioning devices. Each pair of positioning devices 3 are provided with blocking portions 31 projected oppositely to prevent the connecting terminal 2 from being disengaged from between the pair of positioning devices 3. Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 5 and 6</figref>, the recesses 23 for partially accommodating the positioning devices 3 are formed on both sides of the connecting terminal 2. The connecting terminal 2 may be pressed from an upper part of each positioning device 3 downwardly so that the upper part of the positioning device 3 is offset outwardly. The upper part of the positioning device 3 will return back to its original state after the recesses 23 of the connecting terminal 2 move across the blocking portion 31. In this way, the blocking portions 31 is constructed to prevent the connecting terminal 2 from moving upwardly to disengage from the positioning devices 3, and the recesses 23 is cooperated with the positioning devices 3 to prevent the connecting terminal 2 from moving in a fore-and-aft direction, so that the connecting terminal 2 is firmly held within the housing 1.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 5 and 6</figref>, the main body portion 21 is provided with a plurality of protrusions 24 protruding upwardly and formed by punching for example. Those protrusions 24 are electrically connected with pins 304 of an electronic device 30 and a conductor portion 201 of the cable 20 by a welding operation for example, respectively.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In the present invention, the respective portions of the connecting terminals 2 may be formed by a single piece of conductive metal sheet, such as a copper sheet, through shearing, punching, bending and other processes. The connecting terminal may be crimped into a predetermined shape using crimping tool and the conductive sheet is wrapped into the crimping mechanism. The bending portion and the base of the connecting terminal may generate irreversible metallic deformation during the crimping and produce a greater permanent pressing force. For example, it is also possible to automatically manufacture the connecting terminals of the present invention using specialized equipments. Moreover, the photovoltaic junction box of the present invention has a simple structure and low cost.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">It would be appreciated by those skilled in the art the embodiment as described and shown above are exemplary and various changes or modifications may be made thereto.
