A sample holder utilizing an electrostatic adsorption force is employed as this adsorption means.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In such a sample holder, a sample holding surface (an adsorption surface) is provided in an upper face of the plate-shaped substrate composed of ceramics. In the sample holder, for example, an adsorption electrode is provided in an inside of the substrate and then a DC<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> voltage is applied to the adsorption electrode so that an electrostatic adsorption force such as a Coulomb force caused by dielectric polarization and a Johnsen-Rahbek force caused by a minute leakage current is generated relative to the workpiece to be processed and thereby the workpiece to be processed can be adsorbed and fixed onto the sample holding surface.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The sample holder is used in a state where a supporting member is joined to a lower face thereof. For example, the supporting member includes a water passage provided in an inside of the supporting member and is constructed from a metallic material such as aluminum. Indium or an indium alloy is used for the joining. When such joining is to be performed, an underlayer of silver, copper, or the like having satisfactory wettability with indium is formed in advance in both of joining surfaces of the sample holder and the supporting member. Further, in some cases, an alloy of indium and tin, silver, or the like for reducing the melting point of indium is interposed between both of the joining surfaces of the sample holder and the supporting member.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Nevertheless, in a case where an underlayer having satisfactory wettability with indium is merely formed in both of the joining surfaces of the sample holder and the supporting member, the joining strength between the sample<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> holder and the supporting member is difficult to be improved. Specifically, in a sample holder described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004050267A"><text>JP-A 2004-50267</text></patcit> (referred to as Patent Literature 1, hereinafter), joining is performed by using an intermediate layer whose melting point is lower than the melting point of indium. Thus, there has been a possibility that when the sample holder goes into a high temperature, softening occurs in the intermediate layer so that the joining strength goes lower. Thus, there has been a possibility that the flatness and the parallelism of the sample holding surface vary in association with temperature cycles. As a result, the flatness and the parallelism of the sample holding surface have been difficult to be maintained.</p><heading id="h0003">Summary of Invention</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The sample holder according to an embodiment of the invention includes a substrate composed of ceramics, having a sample holding surface provided in an upper face thereof; a supporting member composed of metal, an upper face of the supporting member covering a lower face of the substrate; and a joining layer composed of indium or an indium alloy, the substrate and the supporting member being joined to each other via the joining layer, the joining layer having a layer region in at least one of a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> joining surface to the substrate and a joining surface to the supporting member, a content percentage of indium oxides of the layer region being higher than that of an intermediate region in a thickness direction of the joining layer.</p><heading id="h0004">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is sectional views showing a sample holder of an embodiment of the invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a partly sectional view showing a layer region of modified example 1 to a sample holder of the invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is sectional views showing modified example 2 to a sample holder of the invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view showing modified example 3 to a sample holder of the invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is sectional views showing modified example 4 to a sample holder of the invention; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a sectional view showing modified example 5 to a sample holder of the invention.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Description of Embodiments</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">A sample holder according to an embodiment of the invention is described below in detail with reference to the drawings.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is sectional views showing an embodiment of a sample holder of the invention. The sample holder 1 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1(a) and 1(b)</figref> comprises a substrate 2 which is composed of ceramics and has a sample holding surface provided in the upper face thereof; a supporting member 3 composed of metal, an upper face of the supporting member 3 covering a lower face of the substrate 2; a joining layer 4 composed of indium (In) or an indium alloy, the substrate 2 and the supporting member 3 being joined to each other via the joining layer 4. Then, the joining layer 4 has a layer region 5 in at least one of a joining surface to the substrate 2 and a joining surface to the supporting member 3, wherein a content percentage of indium oxides of the layer region 5 is higher than that of an intermediate region 6 in a thickness direction of the joining layer 4. Specifically, in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1(a)</figref>, the layer region 5 is located in the joining surface between the joining layer 4 and the supporting member 3. Further, in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1(b)</figref>, the layer region 5 is located in the joining surface between the joining layer 4 and the substrate 2. The intermediate region 6 mentioned here indicates a region described below. Specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1(a)</figref>, in a case where the layer region 5 is located in the joining surface between the joining layer 4 and the supporting member 3, a portion located above the layer<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> region 5 in the joining layer 4 is the intermediate region 6. Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1(b)</figref>, in a case where the layer region 5 is located in the joining surface between the joining layer 4 and the substrate 2, a portion located below the layer region 5 in the joining layer 4 is the intermediate region 6. Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1(c)</figref>, in a case where the layer region 5 is located respectively in the joining surface between the joining layer 4 and the supporting member 3 and the joining surface between the joining layer 4 and the substrate 2, a portion located in the middle of the two layer regions 5 is the intermediate region 6.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Here, the here-mentioned layer region 5 of which the content percentage of indium oxides is higher is, for example, a situation that indium oxides are present in indium or an indium alloy. Further, another example of the layer region 5 of which the content percentage of indium oxides is higher is a situation that the entire layer region 5 is composed of indium oxides.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">For example, the intermediate region 6 and the layer region 5 can be distinguished from each other by the following method. Specifically, the sample holder 1 is cut into a cross section perpendicular to the sample holding surface. Then, ion etching is performed on the portion containing the joining layer 4 in the sample<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> holder 1 by approximately 0 to 1 µm by using an argon (Ar) ion gun so that the cut surface is cleaned. Further, in the region of the joining layer 4 in the cut surface, elemental surface analysis or elemental line analysis in the joining layer depth direction is performed concerning oxygen by using an Auger electron spectrometer. In the result of elemental surface analysis or the result of elemental line analysis obtained as mentioned here, the maximum and the minimum of the amount of oxygen are checked and then the value of the half of the sum of the maximum and the minimum is calculated.

After that, the joining surface of the substrate 2 was laid thereon, then a weight was placed such that the<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> joining load becomes 0.2 MPa, and then natural cooling was performed so that the portion other than the layer region 5 in the joining layer 4 was formed.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">As a comparison object, a sample holder (sample No. 26) by a publicly known technique was also fabricated.

Then, indium molten metal was added immediately and then the both were bonded together so that they were joined together.

Then, in a state where cooling water was circulated through the supporting member 3 at a predetermined flow rate, the heat-generating resistor 9 was energized with observing the holding surface of the substrate 2 by using an infrared camera (a thermo viewer) and thereby the maximum temperature within the holding surface was fixed at 120°C. At that time, the difference<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> between the maximum temperature and the minimum temperature in the obtained temperature profile was measured as an intra-surface temperature variation ΔT.

In the plasma reaction vacuum chamber, an RF (radio frequency) electric power is used in order to generate a high-frequency plasma and then impart energy to the generated plasma so as to control it. An RF supply electric power and an RF bias electric power were connected to an RF power supply. Then, the RF supply electric power was connected to an induction coil of the chamber and the RF bias electric power was connected to the supporting member 3 (not shown). As such, the RF bias electric power was capacitively coupled to the plasma through a silicon wafer serving as a to-be-held object and through the supporting member 3 in cooperation with a ground electrode installed in a plasma generating region in the chamber provided with a feedback circuit for the bias current. The frequency of the RF bias was set to be 13.56 MHz.<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --></p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Further, in a state where cooling water was circulated through the supporting member 3 at a predetermined flow rate, the heat-generating resistor was energized and heated such that the holding surface became 120°C.

Measurement of the adsorption force was performed by using a load cell. That is, the high frequency and the RF bias were cut after 70 seconds has elapsed. Then, an adsorption force fluctuation having appeared in the adsorption force at that time was observed and then the change ratio of the adsorption force before and after the RF bias cut was calculated. A change ratio of 2% or smaller was defined as no adsorption force fluctuation.
