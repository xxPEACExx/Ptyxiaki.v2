One example thereof includes the utilization of regenerative energy in which kinetic energy is converted into electric energy and the energy is accumulated in a battery to be utilized. And then, with regard to the battery used in an idling stop vehicle (an IS vehicle), since power for the electric load at the time of the IS must be supplied from the battery and the number of times of restarting an engine is large, the discharge amount thereof is increased as compared with that in the case of being used in a conventional engine vehicle. As such, accepting a larger amount of regenerative energy in a short period of time is one of important characteristics of the battery. In general, the lower charged state, namely, the more partially charged state (PSOC (Partial State of Charge)) the battery is in, the higher the regenerative charge accepting performance becomes. As such, a battery requiring the performance for accepting regenerative energy is frequently used in a PSOC-controlled state.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Since the discharge amount of the battery for an IS vehicle is larger than that of the battery for a conventional engine vehicle as mentioned above, and moreover, the battery for an IS vehicle is used in a PSOC-controlled state, the battery for an IS vehicle must be more excellent in durability than the conventional battery. As a means of enhancing the durability, it is common to increase the amount of an active material in the positive or negative electrode. However, since the ratio of the amount of the electrolyte solution to the amount of the active material is reduced when the amount of the active material is increased, the concentration of the electrolyte solution is easily lowered at the time of discharging. When the concentration of the electrolyte solution is lowered, the solubilities of lead and lead sulfate are increased, and lead is allowed to ionize and to be easily eluted from the electrode plate. The eluted lead ions grow into needle-like crystals at the time of the subsequent charging, and a permeation short circuit in which the crystals penetrate through a separator and result in a short circuit is easily caused.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Incidentally, in the lead-acid battery, when the charge-discharge is repeated, water is produced at the time of discharging and thick sulfuric acid is produced at the time of charging. And then, since the thick sulfuric acid has a higher concentration than water, is allowed to move downward and is easily settled, a phenomenon called stratification in which the upper and lower portions of the electrolyte solution are different from each other in (sulfuric acid) concentration occurs. In a conventional engine vehicle, since the battery is overcharged at the time of driving, on this occasion, the stratification is alleviated by the stirring action in the electrolyte solution caused by oxygen and hydrogen gases generated<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> from the positive and negative electrode plates. However, under a PSOC-controlled state, since the battery is charged at the time of deceleration, the charging time is extremely short, and the poor charged state continues, the stirring action in the electrolyte solution caused by oxygen and hydrogen gases is not developed and the stratification easily occurs (Patent Document 1). When the stratification occurs, since the electrolyte solution concentration in the upper portion of the cell is lowered, a permeation short circuit at the upper portion of the cell is easily caused.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As stated above, in the flooded lead-acid battery for an IS vehicle, for architectonic reasons (the amount of the active material is relatively larger than the amount of the electrolyte solution) and operational reasons (easily stratified), a permeation short circuit is easily caused as compared with the battery for a conventional engine vehicle.</p><heading id="h0003">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT DOCUMENTS</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2010170939A"><text>JP-A-2010-170939</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2002260714A"><text>JP-A-2002-260714</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 3: <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP8064226A"><text>JP-A-08-64226</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">In recent years, in order to meet the needs for attaining highly enhanced capacity and attaining highly enhanced output, a measure of allowing the number of electrode plates to be increased may sometimes be taken. By allowing the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> number of electrode plates to be increased in this way, since the proportion occupied by the electrode plates in the space inside the container increases, as a result thereof, the liquid quantity of the electrolyte solution becomes small and the utilization factor of the electrolyte solution becomes high.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present inventor conducted studies, whereupon it was confirmed that the permeation short circuit in a flooded lead-acid battery used in a PSOC-controlled state is remarkably caused in the case where the liquid quantity of the electrolyte solution is small and the utilization factor of the electrolyte solution is high.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It has hitherto been known that lead ions can be prevented from being eluted from the electrode plate and a permeation short circuit is effectively suppressed by allowing salts of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal to be added to the electrolyte solution (Patent Document 2). However, it has also been known that the charge acceptability is significantly lowered by allowing salts of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal to be added to the electrolyte solution (Patent Document 3). In this connection, the reason why the charge acceptability is lowered while lead ions can be prevented from being eluted from the electrode plate by allowing salts of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal to be added to the electrolyte solution is because an alkali metal ion or an alkaline earth metal ion has an effect of strengthening the interaction between a sulfate ion and a lead ion and the charge reaction hardly proceeds.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention has been made in view of this situation and has been made in order to provide a flooded lead-acid battery which hardly causes a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> permeation short circuit and is also excellent in regenerative charge acceptability.</p><heading id="h0007">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">As described above, although the permeation short circuit can be prevented by allowing an alkali metal ion or an alkaline earth metal ion to be contained in the electrolyte solution, the charge acceptability is lowered. And then, since a flooded lead-acid battery used in a PSOC-controlled state deeply discharges, the battery immediately causes a poor charged state and the battery life is adversely affected when the regenerative charge acceptability is lowered. In contrast, the present inventor has found that the lowering in regenerative charge acceptability can be prevented by making the pore volume of the negative electrode material small, and thus, the present invention has been completed.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">That is, the flooded lead-acid battery according to the present invention includes a negative electrode plate holding a negative electrode material, a positive electrode plate holding a positive electrode material, and a flowable electrolyte solution in which these plates are immersed, and is a flooded lead-acid battery allowing the electrolyte solution to have a utilization factor greater than or equal to 75%, the concentration of an alkali metal ion or an alkaline earth metal ion in the electrolyte solution is 0.07 to 0.3 mol/L, and the pore volume of the negative electrode material is 0.08 to 0.16 mL/g. In this connection, "a utilization factor of the electrolyte solution" means a value (%) determined by calculating a theoretical capacity of the solution (a sulfate radical amount (g)/3.657) from the sulfate radical amount measured from the liquid quantity in a unit cell and the concentration thereof, and dividing the effective 20-hour rate capacity by the obtained theoretical capacity of the solution.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the present invention, it is preferred that the positive electrode plate be wrapped with a separator.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Moreover, the using method of a flooded lead-acid battery according to the present invention includes the step of using the above-described flooded lead-acid battery in a partially charged state. In this connection, although the partially charged state (PSOC) basically refers to a charged state of less than 100%, even in a lead-acid battery used in a partially charged state, there is also a case where a charge-discharge balance temporarily becomes greater than or equal to 100% by performing recovery charging. Moreover, in the present invention, it is preferred that the flooded lead-acid battery be used in a starting application for a vehicle.</p><heading id="h0008">ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">Since the present invention has the above-described configuration, it is possible to provide a flooded lead-acid battery which hardly causes a permeation short circuit and is also excellent in regenerative charge acceptability.</p><heading id="h0009">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1: Fig. 1</figref> is a graph showing the results of the permeation short circuit resistance test.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2: Fig. 2</figref> is a graph showing the results of the regenerative charge acceptance test.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3: Fig. 3</figref> is a graph showing the results of the high rate discharge test<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> at low temperature.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">Hereinafter, the embodiment according to the present invention will be described in detail.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">For example, the flooded (vented type) lead-acid battery according to the present invention is one that is provided with an element constituted of a negative electrode plate containing an active material composed mainly of lead, a positive electrode plate containing an active material composed mainly of lead dioxide, and a porous separator interposed between these electrode plates, and is one that is prepared by allowing the element to be immersed in a flowable electrolyte solution composed mainly of dilute sulfuric acid.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The negative electrode plate is one that is provided with a grid composed of a Pb-Sb based alloy, a Pb-Ca based alloy or the like, and is formed by allowing the grid to be filled with a pasty negative active material (negative electrode material). On the other hand, although the positive electrode plate is formed in the same manner as that in the negative electrode plate in the case of pasted type one, in the case of tubular type one, the positive electrode plate is formed by allowing the space between a tube composed of glass fibers and the like and a spine made of a lead alloy to be filled with a positive active material (positive electrode material). These respective constituent members can be appropriately selected from known ones according to the purpose and the application to be used. Moreover, the above-described negative (positive) active material is a material including an<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> additive reagent, and corresponds to a material excluding the grid from the negative (positive) electrode plate.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The flooded lead-acid battery according to the present invention is one that is used in a starting application for a vehicle and in a PSOC. With regard to the flooded lead-acid battery according to the present invention used in a PSOC in this way, for example, the charged state (SOC (State of Charge)) is controlled so as to be maintained within a range of 70 to 90%. However, since the charged state is affected by a driver's way of running and a battery condition, there may be a case where the charged state (SOC) lies outside a range of 70 to 90%.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the flooded lead-acid battery according to the present invention, it is preferred that the electrolyte solution have a utilization factor of 75 to 85%. When the utilization factor of the electrolyte solution is less than 75%, the capacity and the power become insufficient since the amount of the active material is relatively smaller than the electrolyte solution, and the application to an idling stop vehicle becomes difficult. On the other hand, when the utilization factor of the electrolyte solution is greater than 85%, the utilization factor of the active material is extremely decreased and sufficient low rate and high rate discharge capacities are not attained. In this connection, "a utilization factor of the electrolyte solution" means a value (%) determined by calculating a theoretical capacity of the solution (a sulfate radical amount (g)/3.657) from the sulfate radical amount measured from the liquid quantity in a unit cell and the concentration thereof, and dividing the effective 20-hour rate capacity by the obtained theoretical capacity of the solution, and in general, the utilization factor of the electrolyte solution of a valve regulated lead-acid battery is 90% or so. Moreover, "the effective<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> 20-hour rate capacity" means a value measured by substituting the 5-hour rate current I<sub>5</sub> in the 5-hour rate capacity test specified in JIS with the 20-hour rate current I<sub>20</sub>, and performing a capacity test. And then, the above-mentioned utilization factor of the electrolyte solution and the effective 20-hour rate capacity are values determined from a battery in a fully charged state prepared according to the constant current charging method 1 or 2 specified in JIS D5301 (2006).</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The electrolyte solution used in the present invention is one that contains an alkali metal ion or an alkaline earth metal ion in a concentration of 0.07 to 0.3 mol/L. Although a permeation short circuit can be prevented by allowing an alkali metal ion or an alkaline earth metal ion to be contained in the electrolyte solution, when the concentration is less than 0.07 mol/L, the permeation short circuit prevention effect is not sufficiently attained since the concentration is too low. On the other hand, when the concentration is greater than 0.3 mol/L, the lowering in regenerative charge acceptability becomes significant, and the regenerative charge acceptability cannot be recovered even when the negative active material density is heightened as described later. The concentration is preferably 0.1 to 0.3 mol/L.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The alkali metal and the alkaline earth metal are not particularly limited, and although examples thereof include Na, K, Li, Rb, Cs, Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and the like, of these, Na is preferred from the viewpoint of performance, costs and the like.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">For example, a sulfate or a borate can be added to an electrolyte solution to allow the alkali metal ion or the alkaline earth metal ion to be contained in the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> electrolyte solution. In particular, when a sulfate is added to an electrolyte solution to allow the alkali metal ion or the alkaline earth metal ion to be contained in the electrolyte solution, even in the case where sulfate ions derived from dilute sulfuric acid in the electrolyte solution are about to be depleted by deep discharge, it is possible to suppress the resistance of the electrolyte solution low and to suppress the lowering in charge recovering performance since sulfate ions derived from a sulfate of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal impart the electrolyte solution with conductivity. Moreover, since it is possible to suppress the dissolution of lead sulfate into the electrolyte solution by allowing the sulfate ion concentration to be increased, this is also effective from the viewpoint of preventing the permeation short circuit. In this connection, since sodium is usually contained in lignin which is an additive reagent for the negative active material paste, sodium ions derived from the lignin are also contained as the sodium ions in the electrolyte solution.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The negative active material used in the present invention is one that has a pore volume after formation of 0.08 to 0.16 mL/g measured by the mercury press-in method. Although it is possible to enhance the regenerative charge acceptability since the resistance between negative active material particles becomes small and the acceptance of an electron is facilitated when the density of the negative active material is heightened (the pore volume is allowed to become small), when the pore volume is less than 0.08 mL/g, the high rate discharge ability at low temperature is significantly lowered, the negative active material paste becomes too hard to be filled in the grid. On the other hand, when the pore volume is greater than 0.16 mL/g, the resistance between negative active material particles does not become sufficiently small since there are too many interstices<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> between negative active material particles. The pore volume is preferably 0.08 to 0.12 mL/g.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the present invention, it is preferred that the positive electrode plate be wrapped with a separator by an envelope method. In a lead-acid battery, respective numbers of positive electrode plates and negative electrode plates are appropriately set according to the requirements for necessary performance. A flooded lead-acid battery mounted on an engine vehicle is often provided with negative electrode plates, the number of which is greater than that of positive electrode plates by one plate, and when the positive electrode plate is wrapped with a separator, the separator is sometimes broken since the end part of a positive electrode grid is stretched at the time of overcharge. Consequently, the negative electrode plate is usually wrapped with a separator. However, in the case of being used in a PSOC-controlled state, since the battery is not overcharged and such a problem does not occur, in the case where greater number of the negative electrode plates than the positive electrode plate are provided, wrapping the positive electrode plate, the number of which is less than that of the negative electrode plate, with a separator is advantageous from an aspect of cost.</p><heading id="h0011">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p0027" num="0027">The present invention will be described below in more detail with reference to examples, but the present invention is not limited only to these examples.</p><heading id="h0012">(1) Battery to be tested</heading><p id="p0028" num="0028">Using an M-42 type (Battery Association of Japan standard SBA S 0101:2006) battery, the sodium ion concentration (hereinafter, referred to as Na<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> concentration) in the electrolyte solution and the pore volume of the negative active material (after formation) (hereinafter, referred to as NAM pore volume) were changed, and the amounts of the active material and the electrolyte solution were adjusted so that the utilization factor of the electrolyte solution becomes 75%, 80% or 85% to prepare a battery to be tested.
