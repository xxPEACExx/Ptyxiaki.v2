The present invention discloses a battery-embedded board 1 (referred to as the board 1 thereinafter), the board 1 mainly comprises a base 2, a battery 3, and a bottom cover 4.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref>, the base 2 includes a top face 21 and a bottom face 22, and an accommodation space 23 is defined upon the bottom face 22. The base 2 in this embodiment is a square base. Four edge-locating elements 24 are set respectively at<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> four edges of the bottom face 22 of the base 2, and four corner-locating elements 25 are set respectively at four corners of the bottom face 22 of the base 2. In this embodiment, the accommodation space 23 of the bottom face 22 is defined by the four edge-locating elements 24 and the four corner-locating elements 25. The base 2, however, can be a square base, a rectangular base, or a fan-shaped base which includes only one corner (the fan-shaped base only comprises one corner-locating element 25 and two edge-locating elements 24), but not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">As described above, the base 2 is a squre base and comprises four edge-locaing elements 24 and four corner-locating elements 25 on the bottom face 22. Each of the four edge-locating elements 24 adjoins two of the four corner-locating elements 25 by two sides, and two through slots 26 are defined between each of the four edge-locating elements 24 and the adjacent two corner-locating elements 25, and the plurality of through slots 26 are communicated with the accommodation space 23. In other words, each of the four corner-locating elements 25 adjoins two of the four edge-locating elements 24 by two sides, as a result, each of the four corner-locating elements 25 adjoins two of the plurality of through slots 26 by a left side and a right side.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the present embodiment, the battery 3 is a thin battery, and in particularly, is a lithium polymer battery, which is thin and has low risk of exposion, but not limit thereto. A shape of the battery 3 is corresponding to a shape of the accommodation space 23 of the base 2. The battery 3 has at least one set of conductive contacts including a positive electrode 31 and a negative electrode 32. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref>, the shape of the battery 3 is squre and the battery 3 has four corners, the set of the conductive contacts is near one of the four corners.

In this embodiment, the board 1 further comprises at least one positive cable 51 and at least one negative cable 52. One end of the positive cable 51 is electrically connected to the positive electrode 31 of the battery 3, and one end of the negative cable 52 is electrically connected to the negative electrode 32 of the battery 3. Other end of the positive cable 51 is extended out of the accommodation space 23 through one of the plurality of through slots 26, and other end of the negative cable 52 is extended out of the accommodation space 23 through another one of the plurality of through slots 26.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">By way of the positive cable 51 and the negative cable 52, the battery 3 can connect with other batteries in other boards 1 to have series connections or parallel connections therewith. Also, the battery 3 can be connected with a power source (not shown in the figures) through the positive cable 51 and the negative cable 52, so as to receive power from the power source for further storage. Moreover, the battery 3 can also be connected with a load (not shown in the figures) through the positive cable 51 and the negative cable 52, so as to provide stored power to the load.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.1C</figref>, a shape of the bottom cover 4 is corresponding to the shape of the accommodation space 23, and the bottom cover 4 can exactly cover the accommodation space 23 for encapsulating the battery 3 between the base 2 and the bottom cover 4. The bottom cover 4 in this embodiment includes at leat one protruding part 41 extended from one edge, the base 2 in this embodiment includes at least one corresponding concave hole 241 on one of the plurality of edge-locating elements 24, and the protruding part 41 exactly fix in the concave hole 241 when the bottom cover 4 is covered with the bottom face 22 of the base 2. The protruding part 41 and the concave hole 241 enhance the fixed effect of the bottom cover 4, and<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> provide an easier way for user to take the bottom cover 4 off from the bottom face 22 of the base 2.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In this embodiment, a material of the base 2 is depending on user demand, for example, it can be woods, bricks, plastics, etc. The battery 3 is embedded and hid inside the base 2, and have series connections or parallel connections with other batteries through the positive cable 51 and the negative cable 52, or connects with the power source or the load. In other words, if floors, walls or ceilings of a building is constructed by the board 1 in the present invention, user will not see and not notice the existence of the batteries 3, and the batteries 3 will not occupy indoor spaces of the building. As a result, the present invention can stimulate user desire to build an electricity storing system in their house.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">However, the board 1 in the present invention is used to construct the floors, the walls or the ceilings of the building, so waterproof effect of the board 1 should be considered for preventing damage of the battery 3.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2</figref> is a perspective view of a waterproof element of a first embodiment according to the present invention.
