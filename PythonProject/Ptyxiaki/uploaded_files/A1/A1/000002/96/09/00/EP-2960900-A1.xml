While these various embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the inventions, it should be understood that other embodiments may be realized and that logical, chemical and mechanical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the inventions. Thus, the detailed description herein is presented for purposes of illustration only and not of limitation. For example, the steps recited in any of the method or process descriptions may be executed in any order and are not necessarily limited to the order presented. Furthermore, any reference to singular includes plural embodiments, and any reference to more than one component or step may include a singular embodiment or step. Also, any reference to attached, fixed, connected or the like may include permanent, removable, temporary, partial, full and/or any other possible attachment option. Additionally, any reference to without contact (or similar phrases) may also include reduced contact or minimal contact.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, an acoustic window 100 is illustrated according to various embodiments. Acoustic window 100 may comprise a core 110 and tuning layers 120. Core 110 may provide structural properties to acoustic window 100. In various embodiments, core 110 may comprise a fiber reinforced material, such as a carbon reinforced epoxy or fiberglass. In various embodiments, core 110 may comprise a plurality of composite plies.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Tuning layers 120 may comprise a non-structural material. As used herein, "non-structural" refers to a material that has less structural integrity than a material of core 110. The structural integrity refers to the ability of the material to withstand a designed service load, and may be based on the mechanical properties of the material, such as at least one of toughness, strength, weight, hardness, or elasticity. For example, tuning layers 120 may comprise an un-reinforced epoxy. The tuning layers 120 may be bonded to core 110 by any method known in the art.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Acoustic window 100 may be used as a cover or barrier to protect ultrasonic or sonar equipment from the environment, such as seawater. For example, acoustic window 100 may protect a transducer 130. Transducer 130 may emit sound waves which travel though acoustic window 100, reflect off an object 140, and return to<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> transducer 130 through acoustic window 100. Higher frequencies may allow transducer 130 to provide a greater resolution of object 140. Acoustic window 100 may be shaped into curved or dome shapes or may be used as a planar window.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, a graph of insertion loss at normal incidence versus frequency is illustrated according to various embodiments. The graph represents a computer simulation of sound waves travelling though acoustic windows. The dashed line represents an acoustic window having a structural core without tuning layers (Sample A), and the solid line represents an acoustic window having a structural core with epoxy tuning layers (Sample B). In both cases, the structural core comprised seven composite plies assembled in a composite laminate. Each composite ply comprised high-strength carbon fibers in an epoxy. However, many types of fibers, such as glass, aramid, polyethylene, boron, and silicon carbide may be used in many types of matrix materials, such as polyimides, aluminum, titanium, and alumina. Similarly, many types of structural materials may be used for the structural core.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">As the frequency increased, the amount of insertion loss for Sample A varied periodically. As illustrated, local minima were observed at approximately 540 kHz, 1080 kHz, and 1620 kHz. The sinusoid nature of the insertion loss is at least partially a function of the acoustic wavelength and a thickness of the structural core. Insertion loss was lowest when a thickness of the core was a multiple of one-half wavelength of the sound waves in the material of the structural core. This may be at least partially due to constructive interference occurring within the structural core.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the illustrated simulation, the core had a thickness of 2.4 millimeters (0.09 inches), and the speed of sound in the core was 2,600 meters/second (5800 miles per hour). The wavelength of sound waves in the core can be calculated by dividing the speed of sound by the frequency of the sound waves. Thus, at the local minimum of 1080 kHz, the wavelength is 2.4 mm (0.09 inches), and one-half of the wavelength is 1.2 mm (0.05 inches). Thus, the thickness of the core was a multiple of one-half of the wavelength of sound at 1080 kHz, specifically the multiple two, resulting in the local minimum at the desired frequency. Selecting materials with a particular bulk modulus, density, or thickness may allow for the structural core to have a local minimum at a desired frequency.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">However, as is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the bandwidth about the minima is very narrow. For example, at the 1080 kHz minimum, only frequencies from about 1000 kHz to 1150 kHz are below 1.5 dB of insertion loss for the structural core without tuning layers. Thus, a structural core without tuning layers would block a significant amount of sound outside of a narrow range of frequencies at the local minimum. Many sonars utilize a range of frequencies, and even small manufacturing tolerances in the thickness of the structural core can have a significant impact of the location of the minima. Thus, acoustic windows having a greater bandwidth of low insertion loss are desirable in many applications.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Sample B, represented by the solid line, shows the insertion loss versus frequency for the composite core of sample A, with a tuning layer on each side of the core. The tuning layers were comprised of epoxy and had a thickness of 0.51 mm (0.020 inches). However, a variety of materials may be used for the tuning layers, such as engineering plastics or elastomers.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In various embodiments, a thickness of each tuning layer may be an odd multiple of one-quarter wavelength of sound waves in the tuning layers for a desired frequency. For example, the wavelength of sound waves in the epoxy at 1080 kHz is about 2.0 mm (0.080 inches), and the thickness of the epoxy was equal to one quarter wavelength. However, the thickness may also be selected to be 3/4 wavelength, 5/4 wavelength, etc. The effect of the tuning layers is observed in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> as the decrease in insertion loss in the region of the local minimum at 1080 kHz. However, the range of frequencies affected by the tuning layers may be changed by selecting different thicknesses of the tuning layers. For example, the thickness of the tuning layers may be selected such that the thickness is equal to 1/4 wavelength in the epoxy at 540 kHz in order to decrease insertion loss in the region of the first local minimum for the structural core.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The amount of insertion loss may be proportional to the difference in acoustic impedance between materials. For sound waves being transferred from a material with high acoustic impedance to a material with low acoustic impedance (or from low acoustic impedance to high acoustic impedance) a large amount of the energy of the sound waves may be reflected, resulting in high insertion loss. In various embodiments, the acoustic impedance of the tuning layers may be greater than the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> acoustic impedance of water, and less than the acoustic impedance of the structural core.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, a flowchart of a process for designing and manufacturing an acoustic window is illustrated according to various embodiments. A desired frequency range may be determined (step 310). In various embodiments, the desired frequency range may be determined based on the specific application for a sonar device. For example, a particular sonar device may focus on frequencies between 800 kHz - 1300 kHz. Properties for a structural core may be selected such that a local insertion loss minima is located within the desired frequency range (step 320). In various embodiments, the properties of the structural core may be selected such that the local insertion loss minima is at a center of the desired frequency range. The properties of the structural core to be selected may include at least one of thickness, material, density, bulk modulus, Young's modulus, shear modulus, or acoustic impedance. In various embodiments, the thickness may be selected to be a multiple of one-half wavelength of a sound wave in the structural core for a frequency within the desired frequency range.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Properties for a tuning layer may be selected such that insertion loss is decreased within the desired frequency range (step 330). The properties of the tuning layer to be selected may include at least one of thickness, material, density, bulk modulus, Young's modulus, shear modulus, or acoustic impedance. In various embodiments, the thickness may be selected to be an odd multiple of one-quarter wavelength of a sound wave in the tuning layer for a frequency within the desired frequency range. A material may be selected with an acoustic impedance close to the acoustic impedance of water, such as within a factor of 2, or within a factor of 4. The tuning layer may be coupled to the structural core (step 340). In various embodiments, a tuning layer may be coupled to each side of the structural core. In various embodiments, more than one tuning layer may be coupled to each side of the structural core.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the detailed description herein, references to "one embodiment", "an embodiment", "various embodiments", etc., indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature, structure, or characteristic.
