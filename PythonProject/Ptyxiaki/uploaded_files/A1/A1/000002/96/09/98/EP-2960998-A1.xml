Technical Field</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure generally relates to an electronic device having a connector device.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">An electronic device refers to a portable device that allows a user to access various digital content. The electronic device may include a portable terminal that enables transmission/reception to a device that allows the user to access various contents, such as an MP3 player, a PMP, and/or a wearable device, such as a smart watch or a Head Mounted Device (HMD), such as an eyeglass-type monitor.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Due to their portability, the above-mentioned electronic devices have been widely distributed to users and are used in various use environments regardless of time and place. In particular, recently, according to various leisure activities, the electronic devices are frequently exposed to various external environments. For example, the electronic devices are frequently placed in users' pockets or the like. Frequently, users carry the electronic devices even when they are in areas or environments that may be damaging to electronic devices, such as wet or hot environments (e.g., a health spa, a sauna, a washroom, or a lavatory). Users frequently carry their electronic devices when engaging in various outdoor activities that may be damaging to electronic equipment. For example, In the summer, users frequently carry the electronic devices even while enjoying outdoor activities, such as swimming or playing in the water. Also for example, in the winter, users frequently carry the electronic devices even while enjoying outdoor activities such as snowboarding or skiing.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">An electronic device may be provided with modules for enjoying various contents and also provided with connection devices so that the electronic device is connected with an external device so as to pair data with the external device, deliver a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> sound to the external device, or to receive a power from the external device, for example.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Among the connection devices, a connector, such as a USB, may be provided so that the electronic device can be connected with a separate external device. In general, such a connector device may be manufactured through SUS pressing. Conventionally, when a housing of the connector device manufactured through the SUS pressing, a hole is often formed due to an inner latch structure of an SUS press. The hole provides an access point through which foreign matter may easily infiltrate via the connector device. In addition, since the connector device is configured to be connected with the outside through a connector hole formed in the electronic device, a gap is formed between the connector device and the electronic device so that foreign matter may easily infiltrate through the gap.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to prevent the infiltration of foreign matter through the connector device and to implement dustproofing according to shaking or dropping of the electronic device, the electronic device may include a reinforcing device, such as a cover or a shield, that covers the connector device, in addition to the connector device.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A separate insert mold may be attached to the connector device in order to isolate the connector device from a case of the electronic device in which the connector device is inserted. When the separate insert mold is mounted on the connector device, a structure for waterproofing or dustproofing of the connector device may be implemented only when an additional attachment process is performed between the connector device and the insert mold.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a connector device may inhibit or prevent infiltration of foreign matter to the inside of the connector device through, for example, the latch structure (<i>e.g</i>., hole) for installing the connector device. According to aspects of the present disclosure, an electronic device including a connector device may be provided to facilitate dustproofing, as well as, improved resistance to damage from drops or impacts according to dropping or an impact, and an electronic device may include the connector device.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In aspects of the present disclosure, a connector device may inhibit or prevent infiltration of foreign matter through a gap occurring between the connection device and a case of an electronic device when the connector device is mounted inside the case<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> of the electronic device by sealing the gap between the connection device and the case, and an electronic device may include the connector device.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to a further aspect of the present disclosure, a connector device may maintain rigidity despite frequent mounting of an external module without additionally assembling a structure, such as a cover or a shield can, to the connector device, and an electronic device including the connector device.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, a connector device may include: a connector body that accommodates a connector terminal; and a sealing member provided in the connector body to seal a gap between the connector body and an electronic device.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided with an electronic device provided with a connector device. The electronic device may include: a case of the electronic device; an opening provided in the case and formed as a single part; a body part, on which the connector terminal is mounted, the connector terminal being mounted inside the case, exposed outwardly through the opening, and connected with an external device; and a sealing member that seals a gap between the body part and the opening.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, in a connector device provided with a variable detection module and an electronic device including the connector device, a connector body that accommodates a connector terminal is formed through an MIM method. Thus, a gap, such as a hole, connected to the outside of a connector housing through an existing latch structure or the like, does not occur on the surface of the connector body, and thus, infiltration of foreign mater into the connector device can be prevented.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In addition, the body part of the connector device, which may be formed through the MIM method, may prevent or inhibit fracturing of the connector device when the connector is subjected to external impact or dropped, and can implement dustproofing even if a structure, such as a separate cover or a shield, is not additionally assembled around the body part. Further, the body part may maintain its rigidity even if an external module or device is frequently mounted.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">When the connector device is mounted inside the case of the electronic device, the sealing member may seal the gap generated between the connection device and the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> case so that infiltration of foreign matter through the gap between the connection device and the case can be inhibited or prevented.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The guide member may be provided around the periphery of the body part. Thus, when the body part is mounted on the circuit board, the body part may be suppressed from moving, and may be prevented from being released, which may also facilitate assembly of the electronic device.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The circuit board may be cut out at a position corresponding to the position of the coupling part of the body part. Thus, when the body part is mounted on the circuit board, the circuit board may allow a fastening thickness to be reduced when the mounted body part is coupled to the case, and as a result, the electronic device can be slimmed.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The body part may be directly connected to a main circuit board provided inside the case. Otherwise, the circuit board may be provided in the case such that the circuit board is divided into first and second circuit boards, and the first and second circuit boards are electrically connected with each other through a separate connector. In particular, when the second circuit board, on which the body part is mounted, is provided to be electrically connected with the first circuit board after the circuit boards are provided to be separated from each other, fracturing of the body part or fracturing between the body part and the circuit boards can be prevented when the body part is assembled to the inside of the case, thereby facilitating assembly of the electronic device.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">The above and other aspects, features, and advantages of the present disclosure will be more apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:

Accordingly, upon being seated in the seating<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> recess 111, the connector body 210 may be engaged with and fixed by the periphery of the seating recess 111 to be prevented from moving leftward and rightward. The connector body 210 may also fixed by the protrusion plate 145 to be prevented from moving in the vertical direction (in the Z-axis direction). Further, as described below, the connector body 210 may be suppressed from moving horizontally leftward and rightward and vertically upward and downward by the guide member 150.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">An assembly procedure of the electronic device 100 provided with the connector device 200 as described above will be described. A connector terminal is accommodated in the connector body 210 through metal injection molding and the sealing member 300 may be coupled to the connector body 210 to be in close contact with the sealing face 210a in which, for example, a reinforcement structure and a coupling structure are implemented in the connector body 210 as one piece. The connector body 210 may be directly mounted on the circuit board 130 and in the case 110 without assembling a separate shield can or the like. One face of the connector body 210 provided with the sealing member 300 may be mounted on the circuit board 130. At this time, the coupling parts 213 of the connector body 210 may be positioned in the cutout portions 131 of the circuit board 130. Since the cutout portions 131 are provided, the guide member 150 may be mounted along the coupling line between the circuit board 130 and the connector body 210. As a result, the connector body 210 mounted on the circuit board 130 may be sealed in the coupling line by the guide member 150, and the movements of the connector body 210 on the circuit board 130 may be prevented.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">The other face of the connector body 210 is inserted into the seating recess 111 of the case 110, and when the connector body 210 inserted into the seating recess 111 is pushed to the opening 120 side, the sealing member 300 may be coupled to be in close contact with the inner face of the opening 120. Thus, the gap between the connector body 210 and the opening 120 can be sealed to block the infiltration of foreign matter.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">When the other face of the connector body 120 is seated in the seating recess 111 as one end of the connector body 210 is inserted into the opening 120, the coupling parts 213 may face the fastening parts 140. In the case of the fastening parts 140 and the coupling parts 213 according to the first embodiment among various embodiments of the present disclosure, the boss 141 and the protrusion plate 145 face each other to be supported, and the fastening holes 142 and the coupling holes 213b are connected<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> with each other. When the fastening screws are fastened to the fastening holes 142 through the coupling holes 213b, the connector body 210 mounted on the circuit board 130 can be coupled to the case 110 to be fixed by the seating recess 111, the fastening part 140, and the coupling parts 213. In addition, in the case of the fastening part 140 and the coupling parts 213 according to the second embodiment among various embodiments of the present disclosure, when the connector body 210 is mounted in the seating recess 111, the connector body 210 can be fixed to be suppressed from moving in the horizontal direction (in the X and Y axis directions) by being inserted into the seating recess 111, and can be fixed to be suppressed from moving in the Z-axis direction as the seating plate 213c is inserted into the inner space of the protrusion plate 145.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">As described above, since the gap between the opening 120 and the connector body 210 is sealed by the sealing member 300, the infiltration of foreign matter into the space between the connector body 210 and the opening 120 can be prevented primarily.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">In addition, since the guide member 150 is further provided between the circuit board 130 and the connector body 210, the infiltration of foreign matter can be sealed again by the guide member 150 even if the foreign matter is infiltrated through the gap between the opening 120 and the connector body 210.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">Various embodiments of the present disclosure disclosed in this specification and the drawings are merely specific examples presented in order to easily describe technical details of the present disclosure and to help the understanding of the present disclosure, and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.
