formed in order to reflect heat is known. In the case where an antenna conductor for receiving radio waves is formed on such vehicle window glass on its vehicle interior side, radio waves arriving from outside the vehicle are blocked by the conductive film, so that the reception characteristics required of the antenna conductor may not be sufficiently obtained.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Window glass that uses a conductive film to have an antenna function in order to eliminate such an adverse effect is known. (For example, see Patent Documents 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.)</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Patent Documents 1, 2 and 4 are directed to slot antennas that use a slot between a flange of a vehicle body to which a glass plate is fixed and a conductive film. In the case of slot antennas that use a slot between a flange of a vehicle body and a conductive film, the size of the slot is determined vehicle type by vehicle type, and in particular, it is difficult to cause resonance at a predetermined frequency to receive radio waves in high-frequency bands. Furthermore, in order to receive radio<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> waves in high-frequency bands, the positional relationship between the flange and the conductive film should be accurately controlled. However, there are variations in individual glass plates, and the glass plate is fixed to the flange of the vehicle body with an adhesive agent. Therefore, errors are variably caused in the thickness of the adhesive agent, the position at which the glass plate is fixed to the flange, etc. Accordingly, there has been a problem in that it is difficult to form slots of the same size in mass production.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Furthermore, in the case where a slot is provided in the conductive film in addition to the slot between the flange of the vehicle body and the conductive film as in Patent Document 4, the slot reduces the effect of the conductive film if the slot is large, and there is another problem in that a large heat distribution is generated on the glass plate based on the presence or absence of the conductive film so as to reduce forming accuracy when heating and bending the glass plate.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to solve the above-described problems, the antenna disclosed in Patent Document 5 is configured so that a slot formed in a conductive film is positioned between a pair of electrodes when the pair of electrodes is projected onto the conductive film and that the pair of electrodes and the conductive film are capacitively coupled. According to such an antenna configuration, a change in an external environment (including window glass, a part of a vehicle body to which window glass is attached, such as a flange, and the size and shape of a conductive film) is less likely to change antenna characteristics.</p><heading id="h0003">[Prior Art Documents]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Patent Documents]</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007"><ul><li>[Patent Document 1] <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP6045817A"><text>Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> No. 6-45817</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 2] <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP9175166A"><text>Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 9-175166</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 3] <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2000059123A"><text>Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2000-59123</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 4] <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5012255A"><text>United States Patent No. 5012255</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 5] International Publication Pamphlet No. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO2011004877A"><text>WO 2011/004877</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the antenna configuration where a slot is formed in the conductive film, it is difficult to easily change the size of the slot, so that it is difficult to tune the antenna in the actual external environment.

each of the pair of sub slots has, at one end, an open end that is open at the outer edge of the conductive film, and one of the sub slots connects, at the other end, to the main slot so as to surround one of the pair of facing parts, and the other of the sub slots connects, at the other end, to the main slot so as to surround the other of the pair of facing parts.</claim-text></claim></claims><drawings mxw-id="PDW20422082" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --><figure id="f0001" num="1"><img id="if0001" file="imgf0001.tif" wi="164" he="233" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="51"> --><figure id="f0002" num="2"><img id="if0002" file="imgf0002.tif" wi="165" he="194" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="52"> --><figure id="f0003" num="3"><img id="if0003" file="imgf0003.tif" wi="165" he="220" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="53"> --><figure id="f0004" num="4"><img id="if0004" file="imgf0004.tif" wi="165" he="207" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --><figure id="f0005" num="5,6,7"><img id="if0005" file="imgf0005.tif" wi="147" he="233" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="55"> --><figure id="f0006" num="8,9,10"><img id="if0006" file="imgf0006.tif" wi="165" he="232" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="56"> --><figure id="f0007" num="11,12"><img id="if0007" file="imgf0007.tif" wi="165" he="220" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="57"> --><figure id="f0008" num="13,14"><img id="if0008" file="imgf0008.tif" wi="165" he="220" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="58"> --><figure id="f0009" num="15,16"><img id="if0009" file="imgf0009.tif" wi="165" he="220" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="59"> --><figure id="f0010" num="17,18"><img id="if0010" file="imgf0010.tif" wi="165" he="227" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="60"> --><figure id="f0011" num="19"><img id="if0011" file="imgf0011.tif" wi="165" he="122" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="61"> --><figure id="f0012" num="20"><img id="if0012" file="imgf0012.tif" wi="165" he="225" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="62"> --><figure id="f0013" num="21,22"><img id="if0013" file="imgf0013.tif" wi="165" he="225" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="63"> --><figure id="f0014" num="23"><img id="if0014" file="imgf0014.tif" wi="165" he="219" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="64"> --><figure id="f0015" num="24,25"><img id="if0015" file="imgf0015.tif" wi="147" he="233" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="65"> --><figure id="f0016" num="26"><img id="if0016" file="imgf0016.tif" wi="159" he="138" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="66"> --><figure id="f0017" num="27"><img id="if0017" file="imgf0017.tif" wi="165" he="155" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="67"> --><figure id="f0018" num="28"><img id="if0018" file="imgf0018.tif" wi="165" he="176" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="68"> --><figure id="f0019" num="29"><img id="if0019" file="imgf0019.tif" wi="165" he="122" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><search-report-data><doc-page id="srep0001" file="srep0001.tif" wi="163" he="233" type="tif"/><doc-page id="srep0002" file="srep0002.tif" wi="163" he="233" type="tif"/></search-report-data><copyright>User acknowledges that Fairview Research LLC and its third party providers retain all right, title and interest in and to this xml under applicable copyright laws.
