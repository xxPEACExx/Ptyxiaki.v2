More specifically, while the conventional negative electrode material mainly used a carbon material such as graphite powder whose theoretical electric capacity of graphite is 372 mAh/g, a combined use with other materials with theoretical electric capacities<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> higher than graphite (for example, silicon, tin, aluminum, and the like) has been attempted, in order to obtain the higher charge-discharge capacity.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For example, Patent Literature 1 discloses a composite material of graphite and Si obtained by mixing flake graphite and silicon powder and pulverizing and granulating the mixture in a high-speed air stream.

generally any of a rounded disk shape, a flattened ellipsoidal body shape, or a broad bean-type shape; the flat particles include at least one structure in which particles of a battery active material capable of combining with lithium ions are sandwiched between folds consisting of graphite; the battery active material capable of combining with lithium ions has an average particle diameter of 1 µm or less; some of the folds consisting of graphite are inclined from a vertical axis direction of a flat surface in a cross section vertical to the flat surface of the flat particles, the some of the folds being positioned other than at a vicinity of both ends in the longitudinal direction in the cross section; and the structure in which the particles of the battery active material capable of combining with lithium ions are sandwiched between the folds consisting of graphite has an orientation that is generally parallel with the flat surface.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Since the composite active material has the rounded flat shape from these features, it can be applied at high density while increasing fluidity of the particles as an electrode material without having a sharp edge (ridge and weave) generally found in crushed particles, and it is possible to suppress the decomposition of an electrolyte solution when being used as a battery.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Here, the rounded disk shape indicates that a substantially disk shape is exhibited when particles are placed on a flat surface and then observed from above using a scanning electron microscope or the like and that upper and lower circumference of the disk are formed in a rounded shape. The flattened ellipsoidal body indicates that a revolving ellipsoidal body is flattened. The broad bean-type shape indicates that the central portion of particles is recessed, circumferential corners are rounded and thus are thicker than the central portion, or the circumference is distorted when the particles are placed on a flat surface and then observed from above using a scanning electron microscope or the like.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">With respect to the size of the flat particles constituting the composite active material according to the first aspect of the present invention, the flat particles preferably have an average thickness of 2 to 30 µm, and preferably have an average diameter of 4 to 60 µm.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The flat particles constituting the composite active material according to the first aspect of the present invention include at least one structure in which particles of the battery active material capable of combining with lithium ions are sandwiched between the folds consisting of graphite. An average thickness of the folds consisting of graphite is preferably 0.1 µm or less, but is preferably 40 nm or less and is further preferably 22 nm or less in that the charge-discharge capacity and cycle characteristics of the lithium secondary battery using the composite active material for lithium secondary batteries are more excellent. The lower limit is not particularly limited, but the average thickness is generally 4 nm or more since the production procedure is complicated.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The average particle diameter of the battery active material according to the first aspect of the present invention is necessary<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> to be 1 µm or less, more preferably 0.5 µm or less, and further preferably 0.1 µm or less, in that falling off of the battery active material upon complexation of graphite with the battery active material and expansion failure of the battery active material with cycles and the like are suppressed. The lower limit is not particularly limited, but the smaller is preferable. In the usual pulverization method, it is possible to produce a fine powder to an average particle diameter of about 0.01 µm, and a powder having a particle diameter in this range can be effectively used.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In particular, as the battery active material, silicon particles are preferred, and silicon particles having an average particle diameter of 100 nm or less (particularly preferably, average particle diameter of 50 nm or less) are particularly preferred. As will be described below, as the silicon particles, silicon particles can be used which are obtained by subjecting silicon monoxide to a heating treatment to form a composite containing silicon particles and the silicon dioxide and removing the silicon dioxide from the composite. In addition, silicon particles obtained by reducing silicon dioxide particles using a reducing agent can be used.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Here, the average particle diameter of the battery active material is set to a volume-based particle size distribution value of 50%. The average particle diameter of the battery active material is obtained in such a manner that at least 100 or more battery active materials are observed in a cross section of the composite active material for lithium secondary batteries observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV or less, the particle diameter is calculated by image analysis, and the calculated value is obtained on the basis of the volume. When the particle diameter is not a true circle shape (for example, ellipsoidal shape), a long diameter is used as a particle diameter (diameter).</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As a method of observing the cross section of the composite<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> active material for lithium secondary batteries, there is a method for polishing the cross section by burying the composite active material in a resin.

Since the orientation of the structure in which the particles of the battery active material capable of combining with lithium ions are sandwiched between the folds consisting of graphite is aligned, there is no large pores, and the structures in which the particles of the battery active material capable of combining with lithium ions are sandwiched between the folds consisting of graphite can be stacked at close intervals, thereby increasing the density of the composite active material.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Here, the fact that the structures in which the particles of the battery active material capable of combining with lithium ions are sandwiched between the folds consisting of graphite are stacked in parallel generally with the flat surface means that the orientation of the center axis of the structure in which the particles of the battery active material capable of combining with lithium ions are sandwiched between the folds consisting of graphite are stacked is in the range of ± 30 degrees with respect to the flat surface.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The structure in which the particles of the battery active material capable of combining with lithium ions are sandwiched between the folds consisting of graphite has preferably a thickness<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> of 1 µm to 20 µm, and has more preferably a thickness of 2 to 10 µm.

By the mixing step, the graphite folds are closed by the compression with the unidirectional press and adhere to the battery active material as being sandwiched between the graphite folds. By the spheroidization step, the composition of the battery active material and the graphite having a structure, in which the battery active material adheres to the graphite folds so as to be sandwiched between graphite folds, is constituted by flat particles having generally any of a rounded disk shape, a flattened ellipsoidal body shape, or a broad bean-type shape. At this time, since the battery active material outside of the composite active material is peeled off and falls in the spheroidization step, the graphite layer of the outermost layer generally wraps a multi-layer laminate of a battery active material layer and a graphite layer therein. Accordingly, the composite active material for lithium secondary batteries according to the first aspect of the present invention has very good contact frequency and adhesion between the graphite and the battery active material, as compared to the conventional composite active material for lithium secondary batteries. As a result, it becomes possible<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> to impart high conductivity to the battery active material, and avoid the loss of the conductive path due to the pulverization of the battery active material with charge-discharge cycles, and it is consequently possible to improve cycle characteristics of the lithium secondary battery.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Conventionally, in a composite active material for lithium secondary batteries composed of graphite and a battery active material, expansion relief space has been intentionally provided in the composite active material to mitigate volume expansion and contraction of the battery active material. However, in the composite active material for lithium secondary batteries according to the first aspect of the present invention, the graphite and the battery active material are dispersed as highly as possible, compressed by the unidirectional press, and subjected to the spheroidization treatment based on the exactly opposite idea, thereby confining expansion of the battery active material in the solid AB planes of the graphite, maintaining conductivity and suppressing deformation of the composite active material. Particularly, since the composite active material for lithium secondary batteries according to the first aspect of the present invention is compressed by the unidirectional press at a high density, the density is high and it is possible to form a negative electrode of a high density with a process such as coating.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Furthermore, even when a battery active material is subjected to physical deformations such as finely pulverization with charge-discharge cycles, the battery active material is maintained in a state of being sandwiched between the graphite layers the distance between which can be flexibly adjusted, thus conductivity of the battery active material can be maintained.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Moreover, by using a molding material obtained by spheroidizing the composite active material for lithium secondary batteries<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> according to the first aspect of the present invention, delamination of the pulverized battery active material from the fold of graphite can be suppressed. Alternatively, for the composite active material for lithium secondary batteries obtained by being subjected to spheroidization treatment has a structure in which a graphite edge is substantially not exposed to the outer surface due to spheroidization. Furthermore, as necessary, it is possible to have an edgeless structure in which the battery active material or graphite edge is not exposed to the surface of the composite active material for lithium secondary batteries due to the coating of CVD carbon on its surface. Further, when other carbon materials such as the amorphous carbon, the hardly-graphitizable carbon, the easily-graphitizable carbon are contained in the structure in which the particles of the battery active material capable of combining with lithium ions are sandwiched between the folds consisting of graphite, along with the particles of the battery active material capable of combining with lithium ions sandwiched between the folds consisting of graphite, carbon precursor materials such as petroleum pitch, coal pitch, pitch, polyacrylonitrile, phenol resin, furan resin are mixed with the battery active material in the mixing step to form a mixture of the expanded graphite, and the mixture may be carbonized by a heating treatment after being subjected to a compression step and a spheroidization step.

More specifically, the inventors assume, for example, in the case of the silicon which is the battery active material capable of combining with lithium ions, that expansion and contraction of the volume occur when lithium ions are stored and released in/from the silicon, stress is applied to the silicon at this time to cause cracks, an electrolyte solution penetrates from the cracks, and thus an oxidation process of the silicon is repeated.</p><p id="p0159" num="0159">Therefore, the inventors have found that the above problem can be solved by using the carbon precursor and the additive.
