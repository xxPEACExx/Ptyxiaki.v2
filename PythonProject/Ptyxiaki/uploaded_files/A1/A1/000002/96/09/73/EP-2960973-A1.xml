Characteristics required of a separator thus include a high electrical conductivity, a high impermeability to gases, chemical stability, heat resistance and hydrophilicity. Of these characteristics, techniques known for increasing the hydrophilicity include the methods disclosed in Patent Documents 1 to 4.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Patent Documents 1 and 2 disclose methods of hydrophilizing the surface of a fuel cell separator by treatment with fluorine gas or SO<sub>3</sub> gas. The static contact angle of these separators is initially 20°, indicating good hydrophilicity. However, after 2,000 hours of immersion in hot water at 90°C, the static contact angle rises to 35°. Hence, a problem with these methods is that the hydrophilicity is not maintained.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Patent Document 3 discloses a method of hydrophilizing the surface of a fuel cell separator by roughening the surface, then subjecting it to atmospheric-pressure plasma treatment. The contact angle of this separator is 20°<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> immediately after production, indicating a good hydrophilicity. However, the contact angle following one month of atmospheric storage rises to 67° and so, here too, the hydrophilicity is not maintained.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Moreover, in the fuel cell separators obtained by the methods disclosed in Patent Documents 1 to 3, the hydrophilicity decreases on account of contamination of the separator surface owing to the bleed-out of binder component low-molecular-weight ingredients and of mold release agent at the separator surface.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Patent Document 4 discloses a method of hydrophilizing the surface of a fuel cell separator by infrared laser irradiation. Because the binder component at the separator surface has been removed, there is no separator contamination due to the bleed-out of low-molecular-weight ingredients within the binder component and of mold release agent. However, the initial contact angle is 30° or more, and so the hydrophilicity is inadequate.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Citation List</u></heading><heading id="h0004"><u>Patent Documents</u></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2011060667A"><text>JP-A 2011-060667</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2011076989A"><text>JP-A 2011-076989</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 3: <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2006331673A"><text>JP-A 2006-331673</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 4: <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO2012032922A"><text>WO 2012/032922</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><u>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</u></heading><heading id="h0006"><u>Technical Problem</u></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a fuel cell separator which has a high hydrophilicity and maintains that hydrophilicity for a long time.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0007"><u>Solution to Problem</u></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The inventor, having conducted extensive investigations in order to attain the above object, has discovered as a result that a fuel cell separator obtained by subjecting the surface of an article molded from a composition containing a graphite powder, an epoxy resin and a phenolic resin to roughening treatment, followed by infrared laser irradiation treatment and, additionally, hydrophilizing treatment, has a high hydrophilicity and maintains that hydrophilicity for a long time.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Accordingly, the invention provides:
<ol><li>1. A fuel cell separator obtained by subjecting a surface of an article molded from a composition that includes a graphite powder, an epoxy resin and a phenolic resin to roughening treatment, followed by infrared laser irradiation treatment and, additionally, hydrophilizing treatment,<br/>
wherein the fuel cell separator possesses characteristics (1) and (2) below:

Fuel cells provided with the fuel cell separator of the invention are thus able to maintain a stable power generation efficiency over a long period of time.</p><heading id="h0009"><u>DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</u></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The fuel cell separator of the invention is obtained by subjecting a surface of an article molded from a composition that includes a graphite powder, an epoxy resin and a phenolic resin (which composition is referred to below as the "fuel cell separator composition") to roughening treatment, followed by infrared laser irradiation treatment and, additionally, hydrophilizing treatment.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The graphite powder is exemplified by graphite powders of, e.g., natural graphite, synthetic graphite obtained by firing needle coke, and synthetic graphite obtained by firing lump coke. Such graphite powders may be of one type used alone, or may be of two or more types used in combination. These graphite powders may have mixed therein carbon material powders such as ground electrodes, coal pitch, petroleum pitch, coke, activated carbon, glassy carbon, acetylene black, ketjen black, carbon nanotubes or graphene.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The mean particle size d<sub>50</sub> of the graphite powder is not particularly limited. However, from the standpoint of maintaining voids between the graphite particles at a suitable level, making the surface area of contact between graphite particles larger and increasing the electrical conductivity (decreasing the contact resistance) by suppressing the formation of surface irregularities following<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> resin removal, the mean particle size is preferably from 10 to 130 µm, more preferably from 20 to 110 µm, even more preferably from 20 to 70 µm, and still more preferably from 30 to 60 µm. At a graphite particle mean particle size d<sub>50</sub> of 10 µm or more, when the molded article has been irradiated with an infrared laser, resin is removed from the surface layer of the molded article, enabling the electrical conductivity at the separator surface to be increased; at the same time, the surface area of contact between graphite particles at the separator interior is fully maintained, making it possible to improve the electrical conductivity in the thickness direction of the separator as well. At a mean particle size of 130 µm or less, voids between the graphite particles are kept at a suitable level and so even when the resin that has been filled into the voids between the graphite particles on the separator surface is removed by laser irradiation, large irregularities do not form on the separator surface. As a result, the contact resistance at the separator surface is low and the electrical conductivity of the separator itself does not worsen.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Moreover, at a mean particle size d<sub>50</sub> of from 10 to 130 µm, by subjecting the molded article to infrared laser irradiation and thereby removing the resin between the graphite particles in the surface layer thereof, the molded article can be rendered into a separator having an excellent hydrophilicity and also a low contact resistance.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">To increase even further the hydrophilicity-improving effect and the contact resistance-decreasing effect in the fuel cell separator of the invention, when the mean particle size d<sub>50</sub> of the graphite powder used is in the range of 10 to 130 µm, it is more preferable for the content of fine powder having a particle size of 5 µm or less in the graphite powder to be 5 wt % or less and for the content of coarse powder<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> having a particle size of 200 µm or more to be 3 wt % or less. If the mean particle size d<sub>50</sub> is in the range of 30 to 60 µm, it is even more preferable for the content of fine powder having a particle size of 5 µm or less in the graphite powder to be 3 wt % or less and for the content of coarse powder having a particle size of 200 µm or more to be 1 wt % or less.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The mean particle size d<sub>50</sub> in this invention refers to the median diameter in particle size analysis by the laser diffraction method.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The epoxy resin is not subject to any particular limitation, so long as it is a resin having epoxy groups. Illustrative examples include o-cresol novolak-type epoxy resins, phenol novolak-type epoxy resins, bisphenol A-type epoxy resins, bisphenol F-type epoxy resins, biphenyl-type epoxy resins, biphenyl-aralkyl type epoxy resins, trisphenol-type epoxy resins, brominated epoxy resins and dicyclopentadiene-type epoxy resins. Of these, o-cresol novolak-type epoxy resins and phenol novolak-type epoxy resins are preferred; o-cresol novolak-type epoxy resins are more preferred.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">To further increase the heat resistance of the resulting fuel cell separator, the epoxy resin has an epoxy equivalent weight of preferably from 158 to 800 g/eq, more preferably from 185 to 450 g/eq, and even more preferably from 190 to 200 g/eq.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In addition, to further increase the heat resistance of the resulting fuel cell separator and to provide also a good molding processability, the ICI viscosity of the epoxy resin at 150°C is preferably from 0.01 to 5.8 Pa·s, more preferably from 0.17 to 1.2 Pa·s, and still more preferably from 0.24 to 0.70 Pa·s. By using an epoxy resin having an ICI viscosity in this range, the molecular weight of the resin is appropriate, the resulting fuel cell separator has a good<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> heat resistance and the resin flow properties are good, thereby making it possible to lower the molding pressure and otherwise improve the molding processability.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Examples of phenolic resins include novolak-type phenolic resins, cresol-type phenolic resins, alkyl-modified phenolic resins, biphenyl aralkyl-type epoxy resins and trisphenol-type epoxy resins. These may be used singly or two or more may be used in combination.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the fuel cell separator of the invention, the phenolic resin acts as a curing agent for the epoxy resin. The hydroxyl equivalent weight of the phenolic resin is not particularly limited, although to further increase the heat resistance of the resulting separator, the hydroxyl equivalent weight is preferably from 95 to 240 g/eq, and more preferably from 103 to 115 g/eq.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In addition, to further increase the heat resistance of the resulting fuel cell separator and to provide a good molding processability, the ICI viscosity of the phenolic resin at 150°C is preferably from 0.02 to 0.7 Pa·s, more preferably from 0.20 to 0.60 Pa·s, and still more preferably from 0.30 to 0.50 Pa·s. By using a phenolic resin having an ICI viscosity in this range, the molecular weight of the resin is appropriate, the resulting fuel cell separator has a good heat resistance and the resin flow properties are good, thereby making it possible to lower the molding pressure and otherwise improve the molding processability.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The composition of the invention preferably further includes a curing accelerator and an internal mold release agent. The curing accelerator is not particularly limited, so long as it accelerates the reaction of epoxy groups with the curing agent. Illustrative examples include triphenylphosphine, tetraphenylphosphine, diazabicycloundecene, dimethylbenzylamine, 2-methylimidazole,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 2-methyl-4-imidazole, 2-phenylimidazole, 2-phenyl-4-methylimidazole, 2-undecylimidazole and 2-heptadecylimidazole. These may be used singly or two or more may be used in combination.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The internal mold release agent also is not particularly limited, and is exemplified by internal mold release agents that have hitherto been used in the production of separators. Illustrative examples include stearic acid wax, amide waxes, montanic acid wax, carnauba wax and polyethylene waxes. These may be used singly or two or more may be used in combination.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The combined content of epoxy resin and phenolic resin in the fuel cell separator composition is not particularly limited, but is preferably from 10 to 30 parts by weight, and more preferably from 15 to 25 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of graphite powder.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The content of internal mold release agent in the fuel cell separator composition, although not particularly limited, is preferably from 0.1 to 1.5 parts by weight, and especially from 0.3 to 1.0 part by weight, per 100 parts by weight of graphite powder. An internal mold release agent content of less than 0.1 part by weight may lead to poor mold release, whereas a content in excess of 1.5 parts by weight may hinder curing of the resins and lead to other problems as well.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In the fuel cell separator composition, the epoxy resin, the phenolic resin and the curing accelerator together make up the binder component. Here, it is preferable to include from 0.5 to 1.2 parts by weight of curing accelerator per 100 parts by weight of a mixture of the epoxy resin and the phenolic resin. When less than 0.5 part by weight of curing accelerator is included, the binder component curing reaction may become slower or fail to proceed to a sufficient degree. On the other hand, at more than 1.2 parts by weight, the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> binder component curing reaction may become overly sensitive, possibly shortening the pot life.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The phenolic resin is included in an amount which is preferably from 0.98 to 1.02 hydroxyl equivalents per equivalent of the epoxy resin. At an amount of phenolic resin which is less than 0.98 hydroxyl equivalent, unreacted epoxy resin remains, which may result in the unreacted ingredients leaching out during power generation. At an amount which is more than 1.02 hydroxyl equivalents, unreacted phenolic resin remains, which may likewise result in unreacted ingredients leaching out during power generation.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The fuel cell separator composition may be prepared by, for example, mixing together the binder component, the graphite powder and the internal mold release agent in any order and in specific proportions. The mixer used at this time may be, for example, a planetary mixer, a ribbon blender, a Loedige mixer, a Henschel mixer, a rocking mixer or a Nauta mixer.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The fuel cell separator of the invention is obtained by molding a fuel cell separator composition, then subjecting the surface of the resulting molded article to roughening treatment, infrared laser irradiation treatment and hydrophilizing treatment. Various hitherto known processes may be used to prepare the composition and to mold the molded article.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The process used to mold the molded article may be, for example, injection molding, transfer molding, compression molding, extrusion molding, or sheet molding. When using a mold during molding, it is desirable to use a mold for the production of fuel cell separators which is capable of forming, on one or both sides at the surface of the molded article, grooves to serve as flow channels for the supply and removal of gases.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Roughening treatment on the molded article may be carried out by blasting such as air blasting or wet blasting, or by polishing such as barrel polishing or brush polishing. Blasting is preferred, and wet blasting is more preferred. The degree of roughening is not particularly limited, although taking into account the infrared laser irradiation treatment in the next step, roughening to an arithmetic mean roughness Ra of from 0.2 to 1.2 µm, a roughness curve element mean length RSm of from 100 to 200 µm, and a mean interval S between local peaks of 20 to 80 µm is preferred.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In cases where Ra, RSm and S are smaller than the lower limits, because a large amount of the binder component or molding release agent remains in the surface layer of the molded article, when this surface is irradiated with an infrared laser, a large amount of soot is generated, which may contaminate the molded article and the laser system. On the other hand, in cases where Ra, RS, and S are larger than the upper limits, the irregularities in the surface layer are large, as a result of which, when this surface layer is irradiated with an infrared laser, the laser light scatters, which may make sufficient irradiation impossible.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Examples of the laser used in infrared laser irradiation treatment include, without particular limitation, YAG lasers, carbon dioxide lasers, dye lasers and semiconductor lasers. From the standpoint of focal depth, convergence and oscillator life, a fiber laser is preferred. The wavelength of the infrared laser, although not particularly limited, is preferably from 780 to 10,600 nm, more preferably from 808 to 1,095 nm, and even more preferably from 920 to 1,070 nm.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The pulse energy of the infrared laser is preferably from 5 to 30 mJ, more preferably from 5 to 20 mJ, even more preferably from 7 to 15 mJ, and still more preferably from 10<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> to 12 mJ. At a pulse energy of less than 5 mJ, the removal of resin ingredients from the surface layer of the separator is inadequate, which may lead to declines in the hydrophilicity and electrical conductivity. On the other hand, at a pulse energy greater than 30 mJ, the separator heats up during processing, giving rise to warping, as a result of which the contact resistance may increase.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The spot diameter of the infrared laser is preferably from 50 to 800 µm, more preferably from 100 to 700 µm, even more preferably from 200 to 600 µm, and still more preferably from 300 to 500 µm. If the laser spot diameter is less than 50 µm, the power density becomes excessive and the separator heats up during processing, giving rise to warping, as a result of which the contact resistance may increase.
