More particularly, and without limitation, the present disclosure described embodiments of methods, systems, and computer readable media for cascading user interface element animations. Traditional computing devices include user interface and input combinations that provide users with a combination of tactile and visual feedback. This combination provides users with reliable, certain, consistent, and familiar interaction with computing devices. For example, a user may slide a mouse, and the computing device will depict a pointer moving on a monitor. Other traditional examples include a user pressing a combination of keys on a keyboard, causing the computing device to shift focus to a different application (e.g., pressing "Alt" and "Tab").</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, some devices lack the tactile input mechanisms found in traditional computing devices. For example, smartphones and tablet computers have few, if any, physical buttons and primarily rely on a touch screen to facilitate user input<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> and interactions.

Further embodiments are disclosed in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006">FIGs. 1-4</figref>, which may be implemented together or individually.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Embodiments of the present disclosure are generally directed to systems, methods, and computer-readable media for generating cascaded user interface element animations based on a user input. According to certain embodiments, a user interface of a device is provided with at least one user interface element. For example, a smartphone having a touchscreen could display a row of icons. A user may provide input (e.g., tapping or pressing the touchscreen) at a particular location. In response to the user input, surrounding user elements are animated based on their spatial proximity to the user input, creating a "ripple" effect, for example. Other types of animation are also possible, such as those described below.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">A user interface may include any human-computer interface that allows a user interact with a computing device, such as a graphical user interface (GUI). An example user interface may allow a user to control a computing device and receive feedback from a computing device. For example, a user interface may receive input from a user and provide output to a user. An example user interface may allow a user to enter data. For example, a user interface may include selectable numbers or a keyboard for entering a phone number in a computer. An example user interface may respond to user input. For example, a user interface may highlight text, responsive to a user selection. A user interface may include one or more user interface elements of various types.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A user interface element may be any part, portion, or component of a user interface. Example user interface elements include, for example, an icon, button, window, control, label, menu, menu item, text, text field, binary field, image, and/or video. A user interface element may identify an area to receive input from a user,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> provide output to a user, or a combination of the two. For example, a user interface may include an element to provide input, such as entering a number or pressing an arrow to increase a value (e.g., volume of system audio, contrast of a display, a scroll bar for a window, etc.). An example output user interface element may include, for example, a field to display data from sensors, such as a graph showing power consumption over time or displaying the time of day. User interface elements may act as mechanisms to both receive user input and provide output for a user. For example, an icon may be selectable by a user to launch a program. When the example icon is selected it may be highlighted by the interface (e.g., outlined, colored, bolded, etc.), providing confirmation to the user of the input that was received.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">An example user interface element may be capable of being animated. In an embodiment, a user interface element may have a corresponding series of images that form an animation (e.g., a GIF). The animation may be played responsive to user input or system processes. For example, a wheel icon may represent a web browser application. When the device receives user input, it may animate the wheel (e.g., spin the wheel) to indicate that the device has received user input selecting the web browser application. In an embodiment, a user interface element may have an alternate display design. Animation may be provided by alternating the alternate display design with the primary display design for a period of time and/or with a certain frequency. For example, a weather application may have a cloud icon with an alternate display design of a sun icon. The display or rendering of the user interface element may be alternated between the sun icon design and cloud icon. In an embodiment, the alternate design may serve a function. For example, the alternate design may correspond to information to convey to<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> a user. To illustrate this further, assume that the primary design of a weather application icon is to display the current weather. The alternate design may correspond to the forecast for a next period of time (e.g., hour, half-day, day, etc.). The processor may use a sun icon as the primary design when conditions are sunny. However, the processor may determine that the alternate design should be a rain cloud because the forecast calls for rain in the next hour. The animation may alternate between the sun (primary design) and the rain cloud (alternate design).</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In an embodiment, when a user interface element does not have a corresponding animation, alternate design, or other specific means to distinguish itself, the user interface may provide a default animation. An example default animation may include the system alternating the display of the primary design with a display of generated alternate design, such as a negative image of the user interface element, a colored outline surrounding the user interface element, or a colored fill of the user interface element. For example, an icon may consist of a stylized "M" for an email application. The default animation may be to alternate the display of the alternate design with the display of the same stylized "M" in red.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In an embodiment, the animation may include replacing the primary design of the user interface element with an alternate design, without immediately re-displaying the primary design.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a flowchart of an example cascaded animation process 100, consistent with embodiments of the present disclosure. As described below, example process 100 may be implemented with one or more of the components, such as those illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 4</figref>. As will be appreciated from this disclosure, other<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> arrangements and implementations are possible. Additionally, the process steps or operations of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> may be performed using one or more processors, storage mediums, and user interfaces.

Accordingly, the depicted order of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is merely example and provided for purposes of illustration.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In step 102, a processor may receive input. In an embodiment, the input may correspond to a user input via an input device. For example, a user may select a location on a user interface by clicking a mouse or pressing a touchscreen. Other input devices may be used by a user, such as a trackball, keyboard, stylus, camera, microphone, or joystick, for example. For example, a user may press arrow keys on a keyboard to highlight a certain icon in a user interface. In an embodiment, an application may provide input, such as an application highlighting a particular user interface element. For example, a "how-to" tutorial application may provide input to the user interface to highlight a particular menu item. Any input that may be correlated to a location on a user interface may be used.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In step 104, the processor may determine the location and time of the input. The location may be coordinates identifying a location in a user interface. In an embodiment, the processor may determine the location of an input in the user interface. The input itself may be inherently tied to a location in a user interface, and the processor may identify the location of the input. For example, a user may provide input by pressing a touchscreen. The press input may take place at a certain location on the user interface portrayed on the touchscreen. The processor may determine and record the location of the press input as a pair of coordinates. In an embodiment, the processor<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> may correlate a particular location in a user interface with the input. The input may not have an inherent location. For example, the input may include the user pressing the "A" key on a keyboard. The user interface may interpret "A" as being a shortcut for a particular application or the user interface may highlight an icon corresponding to a program or file starting with the letter "A." The processor may determine the location to be a center or centroid of the icon.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">When an input is interpreted as selecting a user interface element, such as an icon, a center or centroid of the icon may be interpreted as the location of the input, rather than the location of the selection input itself, which may be located on the edge of the user interface element (e.g., off-center).</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The time of the input may be the time (e.g., hours, minutes, seconds, and/or fraction of seconds) that the processor receives the input. For example, the processor may record that the touchscreen received a finger press at 9:01:58.65 AM. The time may take into account processing delay to record the time the input was initiated. For example, the processor may consider the time taken to depress the button on a mouse and the time taken for the processor to receive the corresponding mouse button signal in order to create the perception of a higher degree of responsiveness. In an embodiment the time may correspond to the start of a timer, so that subsequent events may be timed relative to the receipt of the input.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In step 106, the processor may identify user interface elements capable of being animated. In an embodiment, the processor may iterate through the user interface elements that may be suitable for animation. For example, the processor may analyze each icon and menu item on a home screen to determine if there is an existing<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> animation for the user interface element or if an animation may be generated for the user interface element (e.g., generating a default alternate design as discussed above). The processor may generate a table of list of interface elements that may be animated as a result.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In an embodiment, each user interface element may, when it becomes visible in a user interface, may be recorded and along with its animation capabilities in a register or storage device. When the user interface element is no longer displayed, it may be removed from the register of user interface elements. These actions may be performed by the processor, the user interface, or the user interface element itself. Providing a register may facilitate the information used in step 106, such that the processor may identify using a table rather than iterating through each user interface element each time step 106 is performed. This may reduce processing workload and increase the perceived responsiveness of the user interface.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In step 108, the processor determines the location of the user interface elements to be animated. The location may be coordinates of the user interface element in the user interface. In an embodiment, the processor may determine the center or centroid of the user interface elements. For example, the processor may determine that the coordinates for the center of an icon are (200, 800), corresponding to the coordinates on the x-axis and the y-axis, respectively, in the user interface. The coordinates may be based on the resolution of the display used to provide the user interface. In another embodiment, the processor may determine the location to be the closest edge of the user interface element to the input location. The user interface<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> element may self-define its location. For example, the properties of an icon may include its coordinates in the user interface.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In step 110, the processor may determine a timing for the animation of each user interface element. The timing may be based on the distance from the location of the user interface element to the location of the input, making all user interface elements located at the same distance from the input location to be animated at the same time. This may create a ripple effect, as the animations extend radially from the location of the input.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In an embodiment, the timing may be a linear function of the distance from the input location. For example, the timing may be calculated using the formula: <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="italic">t</mi><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="italic">target</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">i</mi></msub></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="italic">cd</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">i</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="italic">t</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">input</mi></msub></mrow></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="41" he="7" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
where the target time for animating a user interface element (<i>t<sub>target<sub2>i</sub2></sub></i>) is calculated by summing the product of a constant (c) and the distance of the location of the user interface element from the location of the input (<i>d<sub>i</sub></i>) with the time of the input (<i>t<sub>input</sub></i>). The constant may be increased to provide a higher delay in initiating the user interface element animations. In an embodiment, the timing function used by the processor may be altered to have an exponential relationship function of the distance. For example, the timing may be calculated using the formula: <maths id="math0002" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="italic">t</mi><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="italic">target</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">i</mi></msub></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>c</mi><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="italic">d</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">i</mi></msub></mrow></msup><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="italic">t</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">input</mi></msub></mrow></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="40" he="7" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
The process may calculate the timing using piecewise functions, such that all user interface elements that extend beyond a certain radius are all animated at the same time. The target timing functions may not be continuous. The processor may calculate<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> the timing to be inverted, which may animate user interface elements that are farther away from the input location before closer user interface elements.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In step 112, the processor may generate instructions to animate the user interface elements based on the timing for each user interface element (e.g., the timing determined by the processor in step 110). The processor may generate a set of instructions, where each instruction identifies a user interface element, an animation for the user interface element, and a time to perform the animation. For example, an instruction may specify to animate a web browser icon (e.g., a wheel), by spinning the wheel at 12:01:54.50. The instructions may identify elements in groups, where elements that are intended to be animated at the same time (e.g., they are all located the same distance from the input location) are identified in a single instruction. Other instruction schemes may be used to identify user interface elements and their respective animation and timing.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In an embodiment, the processor may generate instructions to animate user interface elements based on the timing provided in step 110, as well as a relative direction of the user interface element location from the input location. The processor may determine that the input location is a certain angle from the location of the user interface element. For example, the processor may determine that input location is 112.5 degrees from a user interface element, where zero degrees is pointing to the top of the user interface and the degrees increase in the clockwise direction, similar to a compass. The relative direction may also be indicated more generally, such as a cardinal direction or a four quadrant organization. For example, the processor may determine that the input location is "East" of the location of the user interface element.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> Further divisions, such as eight quadrants or more, may be used to increase the precision of the relative direction (e.g., "East-Southeast"). The processor may then determine or select an animation based on the relative direction, such as an animation for when the input location is below (e.g., "South") the location of the user interface element and a separate animation for when the input location is above (e.g., "North") the location of the user interface element. For example, a square icon displayed on a touchscreen may have multiple animations, such as a swipe up, swipe down, swipe left, and swipe right. When the user taps the touchscreen below the location of the square icon, the processor may select a swipe up animation to simulate a ripple extending outward from the touchscreen tap location. However, a swipe down animation may be used to simulate a pull toward the tap location. In other examples, the animation may be perpendicular in orientation to the input location to create a spiral hurricane effect. Other effects may be achieved by coordinating the animation type and direction based on the distance and relative direction of the input location to the location of the user interface element. System defaults or user-controlled preferences may allow the animation timing and effects to be customized or altered.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">An interface may be provided to allow the user to create effects controlling the type of animations used for the user interface elements and timing of the animations based on distance to the input location, the relative direction of the input location, and the type of user interface element. For example, a user may specify that all text fields fade up at a fixed time after an input, while icons may perform an animation extending outward from the input location, timed in a linear delay, to create a ripple.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In an embodiment, system default settings or user preferences may flag specific user interface element, a type of user interface elements, or a group of user interface elements, indicating that the processor should not animate them (e.g., they are exceptions to the user interface element animations). For example, a user may find a particular icon animation displeasing. The user may enter a flag in system preferences for the particular user interface element.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In step 114, the processor may execute instructions (e.g., the instructions generated in step 112). The instructions may cause the user interface to animate one or more user interface elements in accordance with the timing and type of animation indicated in the instructions. For example, the user interface may animate a wheel icon by rotating it in accordance with instructions executed by the processor.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In some embodiments, the instruction to animate a particular user interface may be overridden by a flag exception stored in system settings or user preferences. For example, the processor may store user edits to system settings indicating that a text field should never be animated. The instruction to animate the text field may be blocked or otherwise not executed by the flag stored in system settings. The flag may be further overridden by an override instruction. For example, an instruction may include a command to ignore flags in system settings.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a diagram of an example user interface, consistent with the embodiments of the present disclosure. System 200 may include user interface 201. User interface 201 may be a graphical user interface (GUI), including one or more user interface elements (e.g., header 210, first icon 220, and second icon 230). For example, user interface 201 may be the touchscreen of a smartphone including a status bar<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> displaying the time, network signal strength, and battery life, as well as multiple icons to that may be selected to launch applications. The user interface may include other user interface elements, including those described above.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Each user interface element may have a center or centroid (e.g., header centroid 211, first icon centroid 221, and second icon centroid 231). The coordinates of the centroid of a user interface element may represent the location of the user interface element, such as the user interface element location used in the steps of process 100 described above. The centroid may be calculated by the processor or self-determined by the properties of the user interface element. For example, header 210 may include a list of properties that may include the coordinates of the centroid of the header. Other non-centroid coordinates may be used as the location of the user interface element for purposes of the processes and features described.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">User interface 201 may receive input at input location 203. For example, a user may press a touchscreen and the location may be recorded by the touchscreen and sent to the processor in accordance with step 102 and step 104 of process 100. Other forms of input may be used, such as a stylus, mouse, keyboard, and a trackball, for example.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In accordance with step 106 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the processor may identify header centroid 210, first icon 220, and second icon 230 as user interface elements in user interface 201. The process may determine header centroid 211, first icon centroid 221, and second icon centroid 231 as the locations of the corresponding user interface elements (step 108). The processor may calculate distance 213 from input location 203 to header centroid 211, as well as distance 223 and distance 233 (step 110). Processor<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> may use distance 213 in calculating the timing for the animation of header 210. Similarly, distance 223 and distance 233 may be used in calculating the timing of the animation for their corresponding icons. For example, the timing for header 210 may be longer than the timing of first icon 220 (e.g., header 210 may be animated after first icon 220) because distance 213 is longer than distance 223. Similarly, the instruction for animating second icon 230 may be timed before the instruction to animate first icon 220 because distance 233 is shorter than distance 223. However, the timing function may time longer distance to animate prior to shorter distances.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052"><figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005">FIGs. 3A-3C</figref> illustrate example diagrams of a cascaded animation in a user interface, consistent with embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005">FIGs. 3A-3C</figref> may represent an example sequence of user interface element animations of a linear time delay function.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref> depicts an example first diagram of a cascaded animation in user interface 201.

Because all points along second event distance 301 B are located farther from input location 203 than first event distance 301A, the processor may generate instructions to animate user interface elements along second event distance 301 B after the user interface elements along first event distance 301 A, for example.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 3C</figref> depicts an example third diagram of a cascaded animation in user interface 201.

For example, header 210 could be subdivided into thirds width-wise, with each subelement having a separate location (e.g., centroid) and animation. The processor may subdivide based on a predefined distance (e.g., pixels, centimeters, inches, etc.) of an edge from a centroid for the pre-subdivided user interface element.
