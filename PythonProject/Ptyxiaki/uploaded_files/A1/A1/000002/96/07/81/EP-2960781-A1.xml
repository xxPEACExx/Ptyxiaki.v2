These operations often require a significant amount of power. Power consumption of a processor may be further exacerbated by the fact that the operations are performed repetitively over a period of time to complete a given signal processing task. For example, in the case of graphics processing, applying a texture filter to an image or a series of images when rendering video may be particularly power intensive.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">A method of signal processing includes determining a first component common to a first input signal and a second input signal. The method also includes extracting the first component from at least one of the first input signal or the second input signal, a second component from the first input signal, and a second component from the second input signal. The second component of the first input signal is different from the second component of the second input signal. The method further includes performing an operation using the extracted, second components and combining the first component with a result of the operation.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A system includes a correlation detection circuit configured to determine a first component common to a first input signal and a second input signal. The system also includes a component handling circuit configured to extract the first component from at least one of the first input signal or the second input signal, a second component from the first input signal, and a second component from the second input signal. The second component of the first input signal is different from the second component of the second input signal. The system further includes an operations circuit configured to perform an operation using the extracted, second components<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> and an output selection circuit configured to combine the first component with a result of the operation.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Embodiments may reduce power consumption during signal processing by exploiting frequency invariance and spatial locality in received signals.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">By way of example, a common component of the input signals may be identified and distinguished from other portions of the signals that differ. Power consumption may thus be reduced by operating upon the portions of the input signals found to be different and joining the result of the processing with the common component. Various operations performed may be effectively implemented with input signals of reduced bit width, which may reduce the power that is consumed.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">This Summary section is provided merely to introduce certain concepts and not to identify any key or essential features of the claimed subject matter. Many other features and embodiments of the invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the following detailed description.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The accompanying drawings show one or more embodiments; however, the accompanying drawings should not be taken to limit the invention to only the embodiments shown.

The process(es), machine(s), manufacture(s) and any variations thereof described within this disclosure are provided for purposes of illustration. Any specific structural and functional details described are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the features described in virtually any appropriately detailed structure. Further, the terms and phrases used within this disclosure are not intended to be limiting, but rather to provide an understandable description of the features described.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">This disclosure relates to integrated circuits and, more particularly, to reducing power consumption while performing signal processing operations on signals having a common component. In accordance with the inventive arrangements described within this disclosure, a processor may include circuitry configured to identify a common component within received signals. The common component may be distinguished from uncommon components of the signals. A common component is a portion, e.g., one or more bits, of a multi-bit signal that is the same as, or matches, the corresponding portion, or bits, of one or more other multibit input signals. An uncommon component is a portion of a multibit signal that does not match, e.g., is not the same, as the same portion of one or more other multibit signals. The common component and the uncommon components may be extracted and processed.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In one aspect, the uncommon components may be provided to an operations circuit, while the common component is not operated upon by the operations circuit. For example, the common component may bypass the operations circuit. A result generated by the operations circuit may be combined with the common component. Power consumption may be reduced by effectively reducing the width of the input signals upon which the operations circuit operates. The width of the signals operated upon may be effectively reduced by the width of the common component.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In some cases, the operations circuit may operate only upon the uncommon components by operating upon a version of each input signal with the common component zeroed out in each respective signal. In other cases, circuit elements within the operations circuit that would otherwise operate upon bits of the common component may be disabled, while those circuit elements that operate upon bits of the uncommon components may be enabled or remain activated as the case may be. Thus, rather than operate on the entirety of the received signals, the operations circuit may operate only upon the uncommon components. The portion of the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> operations circuit that would otherwise operate upon the common component may be disabled. The inventive arrangements described herein may be implemented as a method or process performed by a data processing system and/or an electronic circuit such as an integrated circuit (IC) within a data processing system. The IC, for example, may be a processor. In another aspect, the inventive arrangements may be implemented as a system, e.g., an apparatus, such as an electronic circuit. The electronic circuit may be implemented as an IC that may implement, or include, a processor. Examples of processors may include, but are not limited to, central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), controllers, digital signal processors (DSPs), or the like. Further, the processor may be part of a larger system such as a programmable IC, a data processing system or other computing and/or communication device, an entertainment and/or gaming system or console, an automobile, etc.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">For purposes of simplicity and clarity of illustration, elements shown in the figures have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example, the dimensions of some of the elements may be exaggerated relative to other elements for clarity. Further, where considered appropriate, reference numbers are repeated among the figures to indicate corresponding, analogous, or like features.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is an exemplary architecture 100 for a data processing system. Architecture 100 may be used to implement any of a variety of different systems and/or devices that include a processor and memory capable of performing the operations described within this disclosure. In some cases, the particular system and/or device implemented using architecture 100 may include fewer components or more components than shown. Further, the particular operating system and/or application(s) included may vary. Exemplary systems that may use architecture 100 may include, but are not limited to, embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computing devices such as desktop, laptop, and/or tablet computing devices, servers, gaming consoles, entertainment systems, display devices, and the like.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As pictured, architecture 100 includes at least one processor 102. Examples of processor 102 may include, but are not limited to, a CPU, a DSP, a GPU, a controller, a field programmable gate array or other programmable integrated circuit, or the like. Processor 102 includes a system 105 implemented as circuitry and configured to perform signal processing. In one aspect, system 105 may be configured to operate upon signals with a common component. In another aspect, system 105 may be configured to operate upon signals and apply different processing techniques<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> according to whether the signals are determined to include a common component. While operating upon signals that include a common component, system 105 may perform operations using less power than other conventional processors and/or processing techniques. In consequence, processor 102 may utilize less power, as will architecture 100 and/or any system utilizing and/or incorporating system 105 therein.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Processor 102 may be coupled to memory elements 110 through a system bus 115 or other suitable circuitry. Architecture 100 may store program code within memory elements 110. Processor 102 executes the program code accessed from memory elements 110 via system bus 115. Memory elements 110 include one or more physical memory devices such as, for example, a local memory 120 and one or more bulk storage devices 125. Local memory 120 refers to random access memory (RAM) or other non-persistent memory device(s) generally used during actual execution of the program code. Bulk storage device 125 may be implemented as a hard disk drive (HDD), a solid state drive (SSD), or another persistent data storage device. Architecture 100 may also include one or more cache memories (not shown) that provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times program code must be retrieved from bulk storage device 125 during execution.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Input/output (I/O) devices such as a keyboard 130, a display device 135, and a pointing device 140 may optionally be coupled to architecture 100. In some cases, one or more of the I/O devices may be combined as in the case where a touchscreen is used as display device 135. In that case, display device 135 may also implement keyboard 130 and pointing device 140.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The I/O devices may be coupled to architecture 100 either directly or through intervening I/O controllers. One or more network adapters 145 may also be coupled to architecture 100 to enable architecture 100 to become coupled to other systems, computer systems, remote printers, and/or remote storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems, cable modems, Ethernet cards, wireless transceivers, and/or wireless radios are examples of different types of network adapter 145 that may be used with architecture 100. Depending upon the particular device implemented using architecture 100, the specific type of network adapter 145, or network adapters as the case may be, will vary.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As pictured in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, memory elements 110 may store an operating system 150 and optionally one or more applications 155. In one aspect, operating system 150 and application(s) 155, being implemented in the form of executable program code, are executed by architecture 100. As such,<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> operating system 150 and application(s) 155 may be considered an integrated part of architecture 100. Operating system 150, application(s) 155, and any data items used, generated, and/or operated upon by architecture 100 are functional data structures that impart functionality when employed as part of a system implemented using architecture 100.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In some cases, architecture 100 may include operational software where operating system 150 and applications 155 are implemented as a single, larger program. For example, in the case where architecture 100 is used to implement an embedded system, the functions performed by operating system 150 and application(s) 155 may be combined and implemented as an integrated program.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Architecture 100 is presented for purposes of illustration only. In other examples, architecture 100 may include a processor 102 such as a CPU and a separate GPU. In general, a GPU is optimized for manipulating computer graphics, performing image processing, and the like. In some cases, the processor, e.g., the CPU, may offload particular tasks ordinarily performed by the CPU to the GPU for processing. In still other examples, the GPU may be implemented on a separate circuit board than processor 102.

In the example pictured in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>, system 105 includes a correlation detection circuit 505, a mask circuit 510, a component handling circuit 515, an operations circuit 520, and an output selection circuit 525.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Correlation detection circuit 505 receives a first input signal 530 and a second input signal 535. Correlation detection circuit 505 is configured to determine whether signal 530 and signal 535 include a first component that is common to both signals 530 and 535. In one aspect, the first component may be the "x" most significant bits (MSBs) of signals 530 and 535, where "x" is an integer value greater than or equal to zero. In the example of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>, the first component may be of variable width in terms of the number of bits. Signals 530 and 535 may be compared to determine the particular number of matching MSBs. As pictured, correlation detection circuit 505 generates output signal 540. Signal 540 is provided to mask circuit 510. Signal 540 indicates whether signals 530 and 535 are coherent, e.g., have a common first component. If signals 530 and 535 are coherent, signal 540 indicates the number of matching bits or bit size of the common first component.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Correlation detection circuit 505 may be implemented using any of a variety of known circuits. In one aspect, for example, correlation detection circuit 505 may be implemented as a frequency analysis circuit that identifies common lower frequency components and<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> different higher frequency components of signals 530 and 535. In another aspect, correlation detection circuit 505 may be implemented using Boolean logic gates such as exclusive OR circuitry and/or OR circuitry.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Mask circuit 510 is configured to generate a mask specified by signal 545 that is output to component handling circuit 515, operations circuit 520, and output selection circuit 525. Component handling circuit 515 may be configured to extract the first component from at least one of signal 530 or signal 535. Component handling circuit 515 further may be configured to extract a second component from each of signals 530 and 535. In one aspect, component handling circuit 515 extracts the various components by applying the mask generated by mask circuit 510. While the first component from signals 530 and 535 may be common, the second component of signal 530 may be different from the second component of signal 535. As noted, in the example of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>, the width of the first component (and second components) may vary from one iteration of system 105 to another. For example, the common component may be 1 bit in a first iteration, 5 bits in a second iteration, 5 bits in a third iteration, and zero bits in a fourth iteration with the second component being formed of the remainder of bits of the signal in each iteration. In some cases, the entirety of signals 530 and 535 may be found to match, e.g., where the second component is zero bits.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Component handling circuit 515 outputs the first component and the second components specified by signal 550. Appreciably, in the case where signals 530 and 535 are not coherent, the first component will be zero bits in width, while the second component of signal 530 is the entirety of signal 530 and the second component of signal 535 is the entirety of signal 535.

Operations circuit 520 generates signal 560 as an output that is provided to output selection circuit 525. In one aspect, operations circuit 520 utilizes the mask specified by signal 545 to selectively enable and/or disable selected circuit elements implemented therein. For example, since the mask indicates the particular bits of the common first component, bits of the mask may be used to deactivate or disable circuit elements of operations circuit 520 dedicated to operating upon the first component when signals 530 and 535 are coherent. Similarly, operations circuit 520<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> may use the mask to enable or activate circuit elements of operations circuit 520 that operate upon the second or uncommon components.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Output selection circuit 525 may be configured to combine signal 555 with signal 560. For example, output selection circuit 525 may be configured to concatenate signal 555 with signal 560. In one aspect, output selection circuit 525 may use the mask specified by signal 545 to determine the portion of signal 555 to pass in combination with signal 560. For example, in the case where signals 530 and 535 are not coherent, the mask will indicate that output selection circuit 525 is to pass the entirety of signal 560 as signal 565. In the case where signals 530 and 535 are coherent, the mask indicates that output selection circuit 525 is to concatenate a particular number of bits of signal 560 with the first component specified by signal 555 and provide the result as signal 565.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary implementation of system 105 of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>.

Continuing with the prior example, signal 545 would specify a binary encoded mask of [00000011].</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Component handling circuit 515 may include a common component extraction circuit 606 and an uncommon component extraction circuit 608. As pictured, component handling circuit 515 further includes an inverter 610. Inverter 610 generates an inverted version of the mask, e.g., signal 545, which is provided to common component extraction circuit 606. Signal 545, without inversion, is provided to uncommon component extraction circuit 608.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Common first component extraction circuit 606 is configured to extract the common component, if any, from signal 530. Uncommon component extraction circuit 608 is configured to extract the uncommon, e.g., second, component from each of signals 530 and 535. In one aspect, the term "extracting" as used herein as applied to components may mean zeroing each bit of a signal that is not part of the component sought to be extracted, whether a first component, a second component, common or not. In another aspect, extraction may mean separating a first component from a second component of the signal.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Common component extraction circuit 606 may be implemented using AND circuitry configured to perform a logical AND operation between signal 530 and the inverted version of signal 545. For example, a logical AND of signal 530 [11110100] and the inverted version of signal 545 [11111100] results in a binary encoded value of [11110100]. The first common component in this example is [111101]. The remainder of signal 430 is zeroed out in that the least significant two bits are [00]. The result determined by common component extraction circuit 606 may be output as signal 555.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">Uncommon component extraction circuit 608 may be implemented using AND circuitry configured to perform a logical AND operation between signal 530 and signal 545 and a logical AND operation between signal 535 and signal 545. For example, a logical AND of signal 530 [11110100] and signal 545 [00000011] results in a binary encoded value of [00000000]. The common component in this example, being [111101], is zeroed out leaving the least significant two bits of signal 530, which happen to be [00], as the uncommon second component of signal 530. A logical AND of signal 535 [11110110] and signal 545 [00000011] results in a binary encoded value of [00000010]. The common component in this example, again being [111101] is zeroed out leaving the least significant two bits of signal 535, which are [10], as the uncommon second component of signal 535.

In one aspect, signal 545 may be used by operations circuit 545 to deactivate or disable circuit elements that are dedicated<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> to processing bits of the common component. For example, if the value of bits 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 are common to both signals 530 and 535, circuit elements dedicated to operating upon bits 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 of signals 530 and 535 within operations circuit 520 may be disabled. The bits of signal 545 corresponding to the common bits will be zero and may be used as clock enable signals to such components to disable the components.

As pictured concatenation circuit 612 receives signals 555 and 560 as inputs. Concatenation circuit 612 further may receive signal 545 as a selection signal. Signal 545 indicates how many bits of signal 555 are to be concatenated with signal 560. For example, signal 555 specifies the common component. Signal 545 indicates a bit width of the common component 555 in that each bit equal to zero in the mask corresponds to a bit of the common component. Referring to the prior example, the common component is six bits. Accordingly, six bits of signal 555 are concatenated with two bits of signal 560.

It should be appreciated that the alignment of outputs from AND gates 702 and AND gates 704 may be maintained with OR gates 708. For example, a first AND gate 702 may process the first bit (e.g., the MSB) of signal 530. A first AND gate 704 may process a first bit (e.g., the MSB) of signal 535. The second AND gate 702 and 704 processes the next, or second MSB, bit of signals 530 and 535, respectively, and so on.
