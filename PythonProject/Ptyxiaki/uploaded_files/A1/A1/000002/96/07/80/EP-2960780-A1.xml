As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the multifunctional peripheral 100 includes a dimension acquisition part 301, a paper selection part 302, a preview display part 303, and a packaging mode selection part 304.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The dimension acquisition part 301 acquires dimensions of a three-dimensional object on the basis of images of two faces constituting the three-dimensional object that have been acquired by the image reading part 120. By disposing the reading object faces of a three-dimensional object as a packaging object on the document table 103 in turn, the images of the two faces are read by the image reading part 120. Here, the two faces refer to a first face and another face (hereinafter, referred to as a second face) that crosses the first face. For example, when the first face is a bottom face, the second face is any one of the side faces.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The dimension acquisition part 301 measures the dimensions of, for example, "length" and "breadth" from the image of the first face. Hereinafter, an image of the first face is referred to as a bottom face image. The dimension acquisition part 301 measures the dimension of "height" from the image of the second face. Hereinafter, an image of the second face is referred to as a side face image. The three-dimensional object is preferably a rectangle parallelepiped. However, the three-dimensional object may be any three-dimensional object, for example, a truncated square pyramid, if it has an outer shape that allows packaging it practically as a rectangle parallelepiped. In this case, the dimension acquisition part 301 acquires the lengths of the two sides of a rectangle circumscribing<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the first face in the bottom face image. In addition, of the sides constituting a rectangle circumscribing the second face in the side face image, the dimension acquisition part 301 acquires the length of the side that does not constitute the circumscribing rectangle of the first face.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The paper selection part 302 selects a paper capable of packaging the three-dimensional object on the basis of the dimensions of the three-dimensional object that have been acquired by the dimension acquisition part 301. Such dimensions are "length", "breadth", and "height". The paper selection part 302 selects a minimum size of paper capable of packaging the three-dimensional object on the basis of the sizes of papers disposed on the manual feed tray 151 and the paper feeding cassettes 152, 153, and 154; a development view according to a later-described packaging mode; and the dimensions of the three-dimensional object. For example, the paper selection part 302 selects a minimum size of paper allowing printing of a development view according to the dimensions of the three-dimensional object and the packaging mode. On the paper that has been selected by the paper selection part 302, a prescribed image is printed in the image forming part 140. Then, the paper is outputted as a wrapping paper. In the present embodiment, on one face of the paper, folding lines (a development view) for packaging the three-dimensional object are printed. In addition, on the other face of the paper, a later-described decorative pattern is printed.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The preview display part 303 displays an appearance after packaging. This appearance after packaging is based on the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> dimensions of the three-dimensional object that have been acquired by the dimension acquisition part 301, and the information about the paper (the paper size) that has been selected by the paper selection part 302. In the present embodiment, the preview display part 303 displays the appearance after packaging on the touch panel display of the operation panel 171. The multifunctional peripheral 100 in the present embodiment is configured to allow a packaging mode to be selected as described later. Therefore, the packaging mode that has been selected by the user is reflected to the preview display.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The packaging mode selection part 304 requests the user to select a packaging mode for the three-dimensional object. In the present embodiment, the packaging mode selection part 304 requests the user to select a packaging mode through the touch panel display of the operation panel 171. For example, the packaging mode selection part 304 displays the appearances of the packaging modes on the touch panel display with selection buttons, and the like, and accepts selection by the user.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In addition, the multifunctional peripheral 100 of the present embodiment is provided with a pattern selection part 305 and a printing location adjusting part 306. The pattern selection part 305 requests the user to select a decorative pattern to be printed on the paper that has been selected by the paper selection part 302.
