In the drawings, the identical or equivalent component is designated by the identical symbol, and the overlapping description is omitted.</p><heading id="h0005">&lt;A. System configuration&gt;</heading><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a PLC system 1000 according to a first embodiment. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the PLC system 1000 that is the communication system includes a plurality of PLCs 1, 2, and 3, a programmable indicator 4, and a PC (Personal Computer) 5.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Typically, each of the PLCs 1 to 3 includes a CPU unit 10 that is a main body executing a program, a power-supply unit 12 that supplies power to the CPU unit 10 and the like, and an IO (Input and Output) unit 14 that transmits and receives a signal to and from a field. The IO unit 14 is connected to the CPU unit 10 through a system bus 11. Typically, the IO unit 14 acquires an input signal from a detection sensor 6 that is a field device, and drives a relay 7 that is the field device according to a program<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> execution result of the CPU unit 10.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The programmable indicator 4 acts as a GUI (Graphical User Interface) in an HMI (Human Machine Interface) environment. The programmable indicator 4 includes an operation unit such as a touch panel, a display such as a liquid crystal display, a communicator that communicates with the CPU unit 10, and a controller that controls each unit. In each of the PLCs 1 to 3, various settings can be changed in response to operation of the operation unit of the programmable indicator 4 and, predetermined information on the PLC can be displayed on the programmable indicator 4.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The programmable indicator 4 has a logging function. That is, the programmable indicator 4 has a function of acquiring various logs and storing the acquired logs in a memory. Typically, the programmable indicator 4 sequentially acquires the log by referring to a setting file (see <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>) in which an acquisition target, an acquisition method, and a management method of the log are described. The programmable indicator 4 writes the acquired log in a previously-designated file (hereinafter, referred to as a "log file").</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">By way of example, the programmable indicator 4 refers to the setting file every time a command for performing the logging function is received. Alternatively, the programmable indicator 4 refers to the setting file every time a predetermined event is generated in the programmable indicator 4. Alternatively, the programmable indicator 4 refers to the setting file every time a predetermined command is received from the PC 5. Thus, there is no particular limitation to a trigger of the processing of referring to the setting file.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Although described in detail later, the programmable indicator 4 can perform or stop the logging function. Hereinafter, the performance of the logging function is also referred to as "turning on the logging function". The stopping of the performance of the logging function is also referred to as "turning off the logging function".</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The PC 5 is connected to the programmable indicator 4. The PC 5 has a function of monitoring running states of the PLCs 1 to 3 of connection targets and values of various pieces of data. The PC 5 can control action of the programmable indicator 4 by transmitting various control commands to the programmable indicator 4.
