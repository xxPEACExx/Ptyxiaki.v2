id="p0002" num="0002">In the related art, there are known scanning microscopes that acquire an image of a specimen by two-dimensionally scanning a beam over the specimen (for example, see Patent Literature 1). According to Patent Literature 1, it is possible to change an image-acquisition region in the depth direction of the specimen by moving the focal point of the beam also in the optical-axis direction by using a wavefront converting device.</p><heading id="h0003">{Citation List}</heading><heading id="h0004">{Patent Literature}</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">{PTL 1} <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004109219A"><text>Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. 2004-109219</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">{Summary of Invention}</heading><heading id="h0006">{Technical Problem}</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><p id="p0004" num="0004">The lifetime of fluorescence generated by molecular reactions in a biological subject is assumed to be about three nanoseconds. Therefore, in order to observe reactions occurring at different depths in the biological subject at substantially same timescale as the fluorescence lifetime by using the device disclosed in Patent Literature 1, the beam needs to be modulated at a high speed of several hundreds of megahertz. However, because the wavefront converting device moves the position of the focal point of the beam by mechanically changing the shape of a reflecting surface thereof, there is a limit to enhancing the speed at which the focal point is moved, and thus, in principle, it is difficult to achieve the above-described high-speed modulation. Therefore, with the device disclosed in Patent Literature 1, there is a problem in that it is not possible to observe reactions occurring at different depths in the specimen at substantially the same point in time.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention has been conceived in light of the above-described circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide a beam splitter apparatus, a scanning observation apparatus, a laser-scanning microscope, and a laser-scanning endoscope with which it is possible to observe even reactions occurring at different depths in a specimen at the same point<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> in time.</p><heading id="h0007">{Solution to Problem}</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to achieve the above-described object, the present invention provides the following solutions.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A first aspect of the present invention is a beam splitter apparatus that is applied to an observation apparatus that irradiates a specimen with pulsed light beams to induce a molecular reaction in the specimen and that observes signal lights generated by this reaction, the beam splitter apparatus including a demultiplexing portion that splits an input pulsed light beam into a plurality of optical paths; relay optical systems that are provided in the plurality of optical paths and that relay the pulsed light beams guided through the individual optical paths; a multiplexing portion that multiplexes the plurality of the pulsed light beams that have been relayed through the individual optical paths by the relay optical systems; delaying portions that are provided in the plurality of optical paths and that give the pulsed light beams, which are guided through the individual optical paths, relative time delays that are large enough to separate the plurality of the signal lights from each other; and divergence-angle setting portions that are provided in the plurality of optical paths and that give the pulsed light beams that are guided through the individual optical paths<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> divergence angles that are different from each other.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">With the first aspect of the present invention, the pulsed light beam entering from outside is split by the demultiplexing portion, after which the split beams are individually given time delays and divergence angles while being relayed by the relay optical systems along the individual optical paths, and are multiplexed by the multiplexing portion. Therefore, the plurality of pulsed light beams, whose focal points are formed at different positions in the optical-axis direction, exit the multiplexing portion with sufficiently short time intervals that correspond to the time delays. Specifically, the individual pulsed light beams are substantially simultaneously radiated onto different depth positions in the specimen. By doing so, it is possible to observe reactions occurring at different depths in a specimen at the same point in time.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the first aspect described above, the relay optical systems may be provided with pairs of lenses, and each of the divergence-angle setting portions may be disposed between the pair of lenses.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">By doing so, beam divergence angles achieved at the pair of lenses and thereafter are changed by changing the beam focusing positions between the pair of lenses in the optical-axis<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> direction. By doing so, it is possible to change the beam divergence angles in a continuous manner.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the first aspect described above, the divergence-angle setting portions may be provided with mirror pairs that deflect the pulsed light beams split by the demultiplexing portion toward the multiplexing portion so as to trace out a rectangular shape, and the mirror pairs may be provided in such a way that the mirror pairs can be moved together in a direction parallel to entrance optical axes of the pulsed light beams coming from the demultiplexing portion.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">By doing so, it is possible to change the focal-point positions of the pulsed light beams in the optical-axis direction by moving the mirror pairs in the direction parallel to the entrance optical axes.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the first aspect described above, the mirror pairs may be provided in such a way that the mirror pairs can be moved together in a direction that intersects the entrance optical axes of the pulsed light beams coming from the demultiplexing portion.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">By doing so, it is possible to change the focal-point positions the plurality of the pulsed light beams in the direction that intersects the optical axes by moving the mirror pairs in the direction that intersects the entrance<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> optical axes.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the first aspect described above, the divergence-angle setting portions may be provided with focusing lenses that are provided in the plurality of optical paths and that convert the pulsed light beams that are guided through the individual optical paths to converging beams that are converged at positions differing from each other in the optical-axis direction; and a collimator lens that is provided behind the multiplexing portion and that receives all of the pulsed light beams that have been converted to the converging beams by the individual focusing lenses and that converts the received beams to substantially collimated beams having different divergence angles from each other. In this case, the focusing lenses may be provided so as to be movable in the optical-axis direction.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">By doing so, it is possible to shift the focal-point positions in the optical-axis direction without changing the respective time-delay levels of the plurality of pulsed light beams.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the first aspect described above, the individual focusing lenses may be provided so as to be movable in the optical-axis direction in synchronization with each other.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">By doing so, by moving the plurality of focusing lenses<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> at the same time, the focal-point positions of the plurality of pulsed light beams are moved together in the optical-axis direction. By doing so, it is possible to scan the plurality of pulsed light beams at irradiation positions located in the depth direction of the specimen.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The first aspect described above may be provided with light-intensity adjusting portions that are provided in the plurality of optical paths and that adjust intensities of the pulsed light beams that are guided along the individual optical paths.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">By doing so, it is possible to compensate for the variability of the intensities of the signal lights generated at the specimen caused by the fact that the specimen is irradiated with the plurality of pulsed light beams at positions that differ in the depth direction.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the first aspect described above, at least one of the demultiplexing portion and the multiplexing portion may be provided with a polarizing beam splitter, and the light-intensity adjusting portions may be provided with a polarization adjusting portion that is provided in front of the polarizing beam splitter and that adjusts the polarization of the pulsed light beams.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">By doing so, because the splitting ratio of the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> polarizing beam splitter depends on the polarization of the pulsed light beams, it is possible to adjust the intensities of the individual pulsed light beams by adjusting the polarization of the pulsed light beams that enter the polarizing beam splitter by using the polarization adjusting portion.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the first aspect described above, the light-intensity adjusting portions may be provided with parallel plates that are provided in the plurality of optical paths and with which transmittances of the pulsed light beams can be changed.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">By doing so, the intensities of the individual pulsed light beams can easily be adjusted.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the first aspect described above, multiple sets of the demultiplexing portion, the relay optical systems, the multiplexing portion, the delaying portions, and the divergence-angle setting portions may be provided in series.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">By doing so, it is possible to double the number of pulsed light beams finally generated from a single pulsed light beam.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">A second aspect of the present invention is a scanning observation apparatus including any one of the beam splitter apparatuses described above; a scanning portion that scans a<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> plurality of pulsed light beams emitted from the beam splitter apparatus in a direction that intersects the optical axes; an observation optical system that irradiates the specimen with the pulsed light beams scanned by the scanning portion; and a detection system that detects the signal lights coming from the specimen.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">With the second aspect of the present invention, the signal lights generated at the specimen are detected by the detection system when the plurality of pulsed light beams that have exited the beam splitter apparatus are radiated onto the specimen by means of the observation optical system while being scanned by the scanning portion. In this case, because the individual pulsed light beams are substantially simultaneously scanned in a synchronized manner on the observation planes at different depths in the specimen, it is possible to observe even reactions occurring at different depths in the specimen at the same point in time.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">With the second aspect described above, it is preferable that the observation optical system be provided with an objective lens that focuses the pulsed light beams on the specimen.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">By doing so, it is possible to efficiently generate single light beams by using the individual pulsed light beams.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The second aspect described above may be provided with a control portion that synchronizes a timing at which the detection system detects the signal lights with the pulsed light beams; a restoring portion that restores two-dimensional information or three-dimensional information by associating the signal lights detected by the detection system and the scanning positions of the pulsed light beams on the specimen; and a display portion that displays the
