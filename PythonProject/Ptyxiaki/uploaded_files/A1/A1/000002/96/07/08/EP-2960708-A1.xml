In this case, resolution of the projection image can be improved with increasing horizontal resonance frequency associated with horizontal scanning.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">On the other hand, there are various technical problems when the horizontal resonance frequency is increased. Thus, on the two-dimensional optical scanning apparatus, a scanning direction associated with the horizontal direction is reversed for each one line in many cases so as to obtain a relatively high-resolution projection image even if the horizontal resonance frequency is relatively low. A displacement of the "one line" means a d displacement in the vertical direction during a half period of time of the scanning associated with the horizontal direction.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> If, however, the scanning direction associated with the horizontal direction is reversed for each one line, for example, a scanning line interval in a central portion of the projection image and a scanning line interval in an end portion of the projection image are different (i.e. there is density unevenness of scanning lines), which is technically problematic.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">With regard to this technical problem, for example, there is proposed an apparatus configured to offset a phase of a vertical drive waveform associated with a vertical drive signal for driving the mirror in the vertical direction, against a phase of a horizontal drive waveform associated with a horizontal drive signal for driving the mirror in the horizontal direction, thereby suppressing the density unevenness of the scanning lines (refer to Patent Literature 1).</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Patent Literature 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20080144150A"><text>U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0144150</text></patcit> Specification</p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, a blanking period for controlling the phase varies depending on the horizontal resonance frequency, which is influenced by, for example, temperature or the like.

Here, the driving device drives the mirror such that a scanning direction associated with the main scanning direction is reversed for each one line.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The drive signal generating device, which is provided with, for example, a memory, a processor, and the like, generates a first drive signal for the driving device to drive the mirror in the main scanning direction, and a second drive signal for the driving device to drive the mirror in the sub scanning direction. The first drive signal and the second drive signal may be separately supplied to the driving device, or the second drive signal may be superimposed on the first drive signal and then supplied to the driving device. The drive signal is, for example, a sinusoidal signal. On the other hand, the second drive signal is, for example, a sawtooth (or ramp wave, sawtooth wave) signal.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Particularly in the embodiment, the second drive signal is generated by the drive signal generating device such that drive amplitude (or drive current or drive voltage) associated with the second drive signal in one of a plurality of frame periods is offset against drive amplitude (or drive current or drive voltage) associated with the second drive signal in another frame period out of the plurality of frame periods.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Here, the second drive signal may be generated by generating a basic signal for the driving device to drive the mirror in the sub scanning direction and an offset to be added to the basic signal and by adding the generated offset to the generated basic signal.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">An offset amount between the drive amplitude associated with the second drive signal in the one frame period and the drive amplitude associated with the second drive signal in the another frame period may be, for example, an integral multiple of an amount corresponding to one line associated with the optical scanning.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> Alternatively, the offset amount may be, for example, an amount in which an interval of a scanning locus in the sub scanning direction in a central portion of a scanning range associated with the optical scanning and an interval of the scanning locus in the sub scanning direction in an end portion of the scanning range are close to each other, in a predetermined period including the one frame period and the another frame period.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As described above, the addition of the offset to the drive amplitude causes, for example, a one-line difference between the scanning locus in the one frame period and the scanning locus in the another frame period. Therefore, the scanning line interval in the central portion of the scanning range and the scanning line interval in the end portion of the scanning range can be brought close to each other.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Particularly in the embodiment, as opposed to the technology described in the Patent Literature 1 described above, the phase of the signal waveform associated with the drive signal is not controlled in order to suppress the density unevenness of the scanning lines, and it is thus unnecessary to perform strict time control. As a result, according to the two-dimensional optical scanning apparatus in the embodiment, the density unevenness of the scanning lines can be suppressed, relatively easily.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">If the second drive signal is generated by adding the offset to the basic signal, it is preferable to add, to the basic signal, such an offset that the offset amount is gradually increased from an end of an effective period associated with a frame period immediately before the one frame period, to a start of the one frame period, and that the offset amount is maintained in an effective period associated with the one frame<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> period.

Since the period can be expressed as Th1=1/fh (wherein "fh" is horizontal scanning frequency), an interval y1 of the horizontal scanning lines adjacent to each other in the end portion of the scanning range is a • Th1 (or two lines herein).</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">On the other hand, an interval of horizontal scanning lines adjacent to each other in a central portion of the image (corresponding to the central portion of the scanning range) is equal to a vertical displacement of a period corresponding to a half period associated with the horizontal scanning. Specifically, it is assumed that the period corresponding to the half period associated with the horizontal scanning is Th2. Since the period can be expressed as Th2=1/(2 • fh)=1/(2 • Th1), an interval y2 of the horizontal scanning lines adjacent to each other in the central portion of the image is a • Th2=( a • Th1)/2. In other words, the interval y2 is a half the interval y1 (i.e. one line).</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Therefore, if no measures are taken, regarding the scanning locus, for example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>, a scanning line interval (iv) at a scanning line end (i.e. in the end portion of the scanning range) is twice a scanning line interval (iii) in the central portion of the image, and that causes density unevenness of the scanning lines. <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an optical scanning locus in two continuous frame periods.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In the example, however, the offset is set ON/OFF in each one frame period (refer to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2B</figref>).

As a result, also due to an afterimage effect, a projection image with less density unevenness of the scanning lines is provided to a user of the image generating apparatus 1.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2A to FIG. 2C</figref>, the offset is set OFF in an odd frame period, and the offset is set ON in an even frame period; however, for example, the offset may be set ON in the odd frame period, and the offset may be set OFF in the even frame period.
