With specific reference now to the drawings in detail, it is stressed that the particulars shown are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of embodiments of the invention. In this regard, the description taken with the drawings makes apparent to those skilled in the art how embodiments of the invention may be practiced.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the drawings:
<ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart schematically representing a method for secure touch screen input, according to some embodiments of the present invention; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic illustration of a system for secure touch screen input, according to some embodiments of the present invention.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0004"><u>DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to secure input and, more particularly, but not exclusively, to secure touch screen input.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Touch screens may be very sensitive to touch events. Therefore, erroneous touches by a user may regularly occur when using a touch screen. Also, issuing a command on a touch screen requires only one touch action, compared to regular computer commands requiring at least two actions of moving a pointer and clicking.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">For some applications, where commands received by the touch screen are critical, such erroneous touches may result in unwanted critical errors with serious consequences. For example, an error by traders that execute orders or trades may result in loss of money. Other examples of potentially critical errors are military orders during battle that are issued using a touch screen, medical equipment operated by a touch screen and/or any other use of which commands are critical and/or difficult to reverse.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to some embodiments of the present invention, a method exists for a secure touch screen input. A processor receives from a touch screen an indication of a touch event on a predetermined enablement area on the said touch screen. The processor also receives an indication of a touch event on an interface element on the touch screen associated with a command. The processor then verifies that the touch<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> events occur at overlapping times, and when they do occur at overlapping times, the processor performs the command.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">This double touch mechanism minimizes the possibility of commands performed by erroneous touches, as accidental touch of a user on both the enablement area and an interface element simultaneously is an unlikely event.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not necessarily limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components and/or methods set forth in the following description and/or illustrated in the drawings and/or the Examples. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The present invention may be a system, a method, and/or a computer program product. The computer program product may include a computer readable storage medium (or media) having computer readable program instructions thereon for causing a processor to carry out aspects of the present invention.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The computer readable storage medium can be a tangible device that can retain and store instructions for use by an instruction execution device. The computer readable storage medium may be, for example, but is not limited to, an electronic storage device, a magnetic storage device, an optical storage device, an electromagnetic storage device, a semiconductor storage device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing. A non-exhaustive list of more specific examples of the computer readable storage medium includes the following: a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), a static random access memory (SRAM), a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), a digital versatile disk (DVD), a memory stick, a floppy disk, a mechanically encoded device such as punch-cards or raised structures in a groove having instructions recorded thereon, and any suitable combination of the foregoing. A computer readable storage medium, as used herein, is not to be construed as being transitory signals per se, such as radio waves or other freely propagating electromagnetic waves, electromagnetic waves propagating through a waveguide or other transmission media (e.g., light pulses passing through a fiber-optic cable), or electrical signals transmitted through a wire.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Computer readable program instructions described herein can be downloaded to respective computing/processing devices from a computer readable storage medium or to an external computer or external storage device via a network, for example, the Internet, a local area network, a wide area network and/or a wireless network. The network may comprise copper transmission cables, optical transmission fibers, wireless transmission, routers, firewalls, switches, gateway computers and/or edge servers. A network adapter card or network interface in each computing/processing device receives computer readable program instructions from the network and forwards the computer readable program instructions for storage in a computer readable storage medium within the respective computing/processing device.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Computer readable program instructions for carrying out operations of the present invention may be assembler instructions, instruction-set-architecture (ISA) instructions, machine instructions, machine dependent instructions, microcode, firmware instructions, state-setting data, or either source code or object code written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as Smalltalk, C++ or the like, and conventional procedural programming languages, such as the "C" programming language or similar programming languages. The computer readable program instructions may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider). In some embodiments, electronic circuitry including, for example, programmable logic circuitry, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), or programmable logic arrays (PLA) may execute the computer readable program instructions by utilizing state information of the computer readable program instructions to personalize the electronic circuitry, in order to perform aspects of the present invention.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Aspects of the present invention are described herein with reference to flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems), and<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer readable program instructions.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">These computer readable program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks. These computer readable program instructions may also be stored in a computer readable storage medium that can direct a computer, a programmable data processing apparatus, and/or other devices to function in a particular manner, such that the computer readable storage medium having instructions stored therein comprises an article of manufacture including instructions which implement aspects of the function/act specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The computer readable program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other device to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer, other programmable apparatus or other device to produce a computer implemented process, such that the instructions which execute on the computer, other programmable apparatus, or other device implement the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The flowchart and block diagrams in the Figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods, and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present invention. In this regard, each block in the flowchart or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of instructions, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). In some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the block may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved. It will also be noted that<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> each block of the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts or carry out combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart schematically representing a method for secure touch screen input, according to some embodiments of the present invention.

Reference is also made to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> which is a schematic illustration of a system for secure touch screen input, according to some embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">System 200 includes a touch screen 201 that identifies touch events of a user 205. Touch screen 201 may be of any type, size and/or resolution. Touch screen 201 may be integrated in any physical device, for example, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, a mobile phone and/or any other device.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Interface elements 202 are presented on touch screen 201, each associated with a command. Interface elements 202 may be, for example, buttons, menus, switches, checkboxes, textboxes, widgets, compositions of such elements and/or any other type of layout element.

Optionally, the size, shape, division, marking and/or any other parameter of enablement area 203 is determined by user 205.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0041" num="0041">System 200 includes a processor 204 that receives indication of touch events from touch screen 201 and performs required commands. Processor 204 may be any hardware unit capable of processing digital commands, for example, a computer processor.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Processor 204 may be integrated in the same physical device as touch screen 201 or may be integrated in a remote device. Touch screen 201 then communicates with processor 204, for example, by a network such as the local area network (LAN), wireless local area network (WLAN), cellular network and/or any other kind of communication.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">First, as shown at 101, processor 204 receives from touch screen 201 an indication of a touch event on enablement area 203. The indication includes the time of the touch event. The touch event may be caused by a touch of user 205 on any part of enablement area 203. The touch may be, for example, tap, swipe and/or any other gesture.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Optionally, the size, shape, color and/or any other parameter of any of interface elements 202 and/or enablement area 203 is changed when enablement area 203 is touched to indicate that a touch in any of them will cause the associated command to be performed. For example, in trade functionality, when enablement area 203 is touched, the interface elements for buying and selling are changed to bright color.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Then, as shown at 102, processor 204 receives from touch screen 201 an indication of a touch event on one of interface elements 202. The touch may be any gesture, as described above.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Then, as shown at 103, processor 204 verifies that the interface element touch event occurs at an overlapping time with the enablement area touch event. Optionally, processor 204 also verifies that the enablement area touch event is continues and started before and/or simultaneous with the interface element touch event.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Then, as shown at 104, when the touch events occur at overlapping times, processor 204 performs the command associated with the touched interface element 202. Optionally, the command is performed only if the enablement area touch event is continues and started before and/or simultaneous with the interface element touch event.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Optionally, the size, shape, color and/or any other parameter of the touched interface element 202 is changed when the associated command is performed. For example, the interface element is blinking once for confirmation.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Optionally, only some of the actions associated with interface elements 202 require enablement area touch to be performed. Optionally, interface elements requiring enablement are presented differently on touch screen 201 from interface elements not requiring enablement. For example, interface elements requiring enablement are presented in a different color and/or having a lock icon.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Optionally, as shown at 104, when the touch events do not occur at overlapping times, processor 204 performs an alternative command associated with the touched interface element 202. For example, the alternative command is providing information to user 205 on touch screen 201, asking user 205 to confirm the original command and/or any other command.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Optionally, system 200 is used as a keyboard in for a computer. Some commands by the computer are performed only when user 205 touches enablement area 203 and one of interface elements 202 at overlapping times. Optionally, actions made on the computer affect the information and interface element 203 that are presented on touch screen 201. The computer may include a main screen that presents information corresponding to the information and interface elements 202 that are presented on touch screen 201. For example, selecting a different object on the main screen changes the interface elements presented on touch screen 201. System 200 is integrated in the computer, for example, so processor 204 is the processor of the computer.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In an exemplary scenario, a broker is using the system to perform trade actions. The system is connected to a main trading computer. The interface elements associated with buying and selling are presented as numbers indicating prices. While holding the touch screen, the broker accidentally touches one of the numbers associated with a sale, however, the sale is not performed. Then, the broker decides to make a buy, so he touches an enablement area presented on each side of the touch screen. The numbers indicating prices are highlighted, and the broker also touches the number associated with a desired buy. The buy is then performed by the processor located on the main trading computer.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The flowchart and block diagrams in the Figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present invention.
