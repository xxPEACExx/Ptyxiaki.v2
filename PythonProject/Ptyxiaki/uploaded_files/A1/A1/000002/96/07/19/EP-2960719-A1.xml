In some label printers that print an image to a roll shaped medium, the image is printed to the medium by an electrographic method as in devices described in Patent Documents 1 and 2. The label printers described in Patent Documents 1 and 2 have toner image formation units that form an image (toner image) developed with toner, and an intermediate transfer body to which the toner image is primarily transferred, the intermediate transfer body to be rotated while holding the toner image.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Further, in the label printers described in Patent Documents 1 and 2, a pair of rollers that nips the medium to secondarily transfer the toner image held on the intermediate transfer body, and a pair of rollers that nips the medium to fix the transferred toner image are arranged at positions in the middle of a conveyance route for the medium formed in the device. It should be noted that the fixing roller may be abutted with the medium in a state where the roller is heated for fixing the toner image to the medium.</p><heading id="h0003">[Citation List]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Patent Document]</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><p id="p0004" num="0004"><ul><li>[Patent Document 1] Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2014052433A"><text>2014-52433</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 2] Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP6278938A"><text>6-278938</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 3] Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2002338113A"><text>2002-338113</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">[Summary of the Invention]</heading><heading id="h0006">[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In a case where a condition relating to printing such as a type of a medium to be used is changed, an outer diameter of the fixing roller is sometimes accordingly changed. For example, in a case where a medium having larger thickness is used, a surface temperature of the fixing roller is increased in comparison to a case where a medium having smaller thickness is used. Naturally, the higher the surface temperature of the roller is, the more an increase amount when the outer diameter of the fixing roller is increased by thermal expansion heat is increased. As a result, in a case where the medium having larger thickness is used, circumferential speed of the fixing roller is increased in comparison to a case where the medium having smaller thickness is used.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Meanwhile, when a roll shaped medium is used as the medium, the roll shaped medium is extended between a feed roller and a take-up roller, and a toner image is secondarily transferred and fixed between the feed roller and the take-up roller. That is, parts of the roll shaped medium are nipped by a pair of transfer rollers after fed out and until taken up and further nipped by a pair of fixing rollers on the downstream side thereof. At this time, when circumferential speed of the fixing roller is changed in accordance with a change in a printing condition, slack is generated and extinguished between two parts of the roll shaped medium nipped by each pair of rollers.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">When the above slack is excessively generated, a paper jam (so-called, the jam) is caused. On the contrary, when the medium is pulled by the fixing roller in a state where the above slack is extinguished, that is, in a state where the roll shaped medium is strained, there is a fear that transfer of the toner image performed on the upstream side thereof is troubled. Therefore, there is a need for stabilizing a degree of slack generated in the part of the roll shaped medium where the toner image is transferred or later. As described above, excess or shortage of the slack generated on the downstream side of the part of the roll shaped medium where the toner image is transferred generates failure such as the jam and transfer failure, and badly influences quality of an image to be printed at the end.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Meanwhile, Patent Document 2 describes that upon cutting a roll paper by designated length, slack is provided on the downstream side of a cut position, and the slack is managed to a proper amount. However, the technique described in Patent Document 2 is not to control the slack generated on the downstream side of the part of the roll shaped medium where the toner image is transferred, and hence not a technique for improving the quality of the printed image.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Patent Document 3 describes that slack is provided to a roll paper in order to eliminate pausing failure of the roll paper generated when a remaining amount of the roll paper wound around a feed roller is changed, and the slack is controlled to a proper amount. However, the technique described in Patent Document 3 is a technique relating to an ink jet type label printer, and after all, an amount of the slack is not controlled for the purpose of improving the transfer failure of the toner image or the like.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention is achieved in consideration of the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> above problems, and an object thereof is to provide, as a label printer that prints an image to a roll shaped medium by an electrographic method, a label printer capable of properly supplying the roll shaped medium and improving the quality of the printed image.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As a specification that a label printer is required, the label printer is desired to deal with not only the roll shaped medium but also other media such as cut papers. Further, more preferably, the roll shaped medium is cut by predetermined length to create cut papers and an image can be printed to such cut papers. Another object of the present invention is to provide a label printer capable of dealing with any of a method of supplying a roll shaped medium as it is roll shaped, a method of supplying a single strip shaped medium, and a method of cutting the roll shaped medium and supplying as the single strip shaped medium as a method of supplying the medium.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Further, in a case where a medium where fragmentary adhesive media are attached to a continuous release paper as in a die cut label is used, and when the medium is remarkably bent in the middle of a conveyance route thereof, there is a fear that the adhesive media are detached. Another object of the present invention is to provide a label printer capable of, in a case where a medium including a release paper and adhesive media is used, suppressing the adhesive media from being detached while the medium is conveyed.</p><heading id="h0007">[Means for Solving the Problems]</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">The above problems are solved by a label printer of the present invention, the electrographic type label printer, including a printer unit that transfers a toner image to a medium and prints an image to the medium, a medium supply unit that supplies the medium to the printer unit, a first control unit that controls the medium supply unit, and a second control unit<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> that controls the printer unit, characterized in that (A) the printer unit has (a1) a transfer portion that transfers the toner image to the medium, and (a2) a fixing portion that fixes the toner image transferred to the medium, (B) the medium supply unit has (b1) a feed roller that feeds a roll shaped first medium serving as the medium, (b2) a take-up roller that takes up a part of the first medium where the image is printed, (b3) a cutter arranged between the feed roller and the take-up roller, the cutter that cuts the first medium, (b4) a supplying mechanism that supplies a single strip shaped second medium serving as the medium while retaining the second medium, (b5) a conveyance mechanism that conveys the medium in the printer unit, the conveyance mechanism being placed on the downstream side of the transfer portion in the conveying direction of the medium and on the upstream side of the fixing portion, and (b6) a detector that detects a slack degree of the medium between the transfer portion and the fixing portion in the conveying direction, and outputs a signal in accordance with the slack degree, (C) the conveyance mechanism has (c1) a conveyance mechanism main body that conveys the medium by moving a mount surface for the medium in a state where the mount surface faces the upper side, and (c2) an intake mechanism that performs an air intake action for tightly fitting the medium to the mount surface, (D) the first control unit is capable of selecting a conveyance mode of the medium by the conveyance mechanism from a first mode to convey the first medium extended between the feed roller and the take-up roller, a second mode to convey the second medium supplied from the supplying mechanism, and a third mode to convey the second medium created by cutting the first medium which is fed from the feed roller by the cutter, (E) passing speed at which the medium passes through a pass-through portion provided in the fixing portion is variable, and (F) when the first control unit selects the first mode, the second control unit controls the passing speed in accordance with an output signal from the detector in order to adjust the slack degree within a preliminarily set range.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">With the label printer of the present invention formed as above, when the image is printed to the roll shaped first medium, the slack degree of the medium between the transfer portion and the fixing portion is detected, and the passing speed of the medium in the fixing portion is adjusted in accordance with a detection result. Thereby, even when a printing condition such as a type of the medium is changed, the above slack degree can be adjusted to be a proper amount. As a result, failure generated due to excess or shortage of the slack (such as a jam and transfer failure) is avoided, so that quality of a printed image can be improved. Further, with the label printer of the present invention, the conveyance mode is selected from the mode to convey the roll shaped medium as it is roll shaped, the mode to convey the single strip shaped medium, and the mode to cut the roll shaped medium and convey as the single strip shaped medium. Thereby, variations of a method of supplying the medium are increased, and a highly versatile label printer can be provided.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Favorably, in the above label printer, the mount surface is inclined in such a manner that a downstream side end in the conveying direction is placed on the upper side of an upstream side end, an upstream side end portion in the conveying direction of the mount surface is placed on the lower side of a pass-through portion for the medium provided in the transfer portion, and a downstream side end portion in the conveying direction of the mount surface extends toward the pass-through portion provided in the fixing portion.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">With the above configuration, in the mount surface of the conveyance mechanism, the upstream side end portion in the conveying direction is placed on the lower side of the pass-through portion for the medium provided in the transfer portion. Thereby, the slack is generated between a part of the roll shaped medium where the toner image is transferred and a part mounted on the mount surface at an upstream side end in<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the conveying direction. Meanwhile, in the mount surface, the downstream side end portion in the conveying direction extends toward the pass-through portion for the medium provided in the fixing portion. Thereby, in a case where the single strip shaped medium is used, a downstream side end portion in the conveying direction of the medium smoothly enters the fixing portion after being separated from the mount surface. Thus, generation of the jam at such a position can be suppressed.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">More favorably, in the above label printer, the second control unit controls to maintain passing speed at which the medium passes through the pass-through portion provided in the transfer portion at fixed speed while the printer unit prints the image to the medium.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">With the above configuration, effects of the present invention become more meaningful. Specifically speaking, during image printing, the passing speed at which the medium passes through the pass-through portion provided in the transfer portion, in other words, speed at which the toner image is transferred to the medium (transfer speed) is maintained at fixed speed. In contrast, speed at which the medium passes through the pass-through portion provided in the fixing portion is changed for example depending on a change in an outer diameter of fixing rollers or the like. At this time, when the passing speed at which the medium passes through the pass-through portion provided in the fixing portion is excessively increased, the slack degree of the medium is reduced. If the slack is completely extinguished, the medium is pulled to the side of the fixing portion and strained. As a result, there is a possibility that the toner image is not properly transferred on the upstream side. Meanwhile, with the label printer of the present invention, a change in the slack degree is detected by the detector, and the passing speed at which the medium passes through the pass-through portion provided in the fixing portion is adjusted in accordance with the detection result. Thus, the above slack degree can be fixed and maintained. That is, on<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the upstream side of a part of the roll shaped medium where the slack is generated, feeding speed of the medium is fixed for transferring the toner image. Thus, by changing the feeding speed of the medium on the downstream side of the part where the slack is generated, the slack degree can be properly adjusted.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Much more favorably, in the above label printer, the printer unit has a plurality of toner image formation units that forms the toner images of color different from each other, and an endless intermediate transfer belt to which the toner images of different colors formed by the plurality of toner image formation units are successively transferred, the intermediate transfer belt to be rotated while holding a color toner image formed by superimposing the toner images of different colors on each other, the plurality of toner image formation units is arranged side by side in the up and down direction, and the color toner image is transferred to the medium when a part of the intermediate transfer belt where the color toner image is held passes through the pass-through portion provided in the transfer portion together with the medium.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">With the above configuration, the color toner image is collectively transferred at one point in the conveyance route for the medium.

Further, in a case where a medium including a continuous release paper and fragmentary adhesive media attached to the release paper is used, the smaller number of points where the toner image is transferred are, the less likely the adhesive media are detached.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Furthermore favorably, in the above label printer, the plurality of detectors is provided at positions different from<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> each other in the conveying direction, one of the detectors detects the slack degree of the medium on the side closer to the transfer portion among the transfer portion and the fixing portion, and the other detector detects the slack degree of the medium on the side closer to the fixing portion among the transfer portion and the fixing portion.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">With the above configuration, the slack degree of the medium is detected respectively on the side closer to the transfer portion and on the side closer to the fixing portion.

Particularly when the slack<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> degree of the medium between the transfer portion and the fixing portion becomes excessively small, the passing speed at which the medium passes through the pass-through portion provided in the fixing portion can be decreased and the slack degree can be adjusted to be a normal slack degree.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">All the more favorably, in the above label printer, when excessive slack is generated in the medium, the detector that detects the slack degree of the medium on the side closer to the transfer portion outputs an ON signal indicating that the lever is in a falling state, and the detector that detects the slack degree of the medium on the side closer to the fixing portion outputs an OFF signal indicating that the lever is in a standing state, and when receiving the ON signal from the detector that detects the slack degree of the medium on the side closer to the transfer portion and receiving the OFF signal from the detector that detects the slack degree of the medium on the side closer to the fixing portion, the second control unit increases the passing speed at which the medium passes through the pass-through portion provided in the fixing portion.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">With the above configuration, when the slack degree of the medium between the transfer portion and the fixing portion becomes excessively large, the passing speed at which the medium passes through the pass-through portion provided in the fixing portion can be increased and the slack degree can be adjusted to be a normal slack degree.

The toner forming the layer on the outer peripheral surface of the developing roller 44 is moved toward the outer peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 46 as an electric field is formed between the developing roller 44 and the photosensitive drum 46 by a fixed developing bias voltage applied to the developing roller 44.

By horizontally conveying the medium in the printer unit 2 in such a way, the medium is more smoothly supplied and conveyed in the present embodiment.

The part of the die cut label S1 where the image is printed (strictly speaking, the part where the color toner image is fixed) is collected by the rewinder 35 while the part remains in a roll shape. In such a way, in the first paper loading mode, in a state where the die cut label S1 is extended between the unwinder 31 and the rewinder 35, the color toner image is transferred (secondary transfer) and fixed to the die cut label S1.

Further, in accordance with the change in the<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> heating temperature, an outer diameter of the heat roller 26 is changed. As a result, even when the heat roller 26 is rotated always at the same rotation speed, the outer diameter is changed as described above, so that circumferential speed of the heat roller 26 is changed.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">Meanwhile, the intermediate transfer belt 21, the secondary transfer roller 23, and the opposing roller 24 are rotated always at the same circumferential speed in synchronization with each other during image printing processing.

When the circumferential speed of the intermediate transfer belt 21, the secondary transfer roller 23, and the opposing roller 24 is fixed but the circumferential speed of the heat roller 26 is changed as described above, slack is generated or extinguished in a part of the die cut label S1 between the secondary transfer position and the fixing position.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">Specifically speaking, when the outer diameter of the heat roller 26 is increased and the circumferential speed of the roller is increased, a slack degree is reduced in the part of the die cut label S1 between the secondary transfer position and the fixing position.

As described above, there is a need for stabilizing the degree of the slack generated in the part of the die cut label S1 where the color toner image is transferred or later to be a proper amount.

In other words, when the upper surface of the conveyance belt 51 virtually extends to the downstream side in the conveying direction, the fixing position, that is, the nipping portion between the fixing rollers 26, 27 is placed ahead.

As a result, length of the part of the die cut label S1 ranging from the secondary transfer position to the fixing position is gradually increased, and the slack is generated in the part. The printer unit controller 71 finally maintains the rotation speed of the heat roller 26 at speed when the slack degree is brought into a proper range.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">On the other hand, in a case shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>, that is, in a case where excessive slack is generated in the part of the die cut label S1 ranging from the secondary transfer position to the fixing position (strictly speaking, the position immediately before the fixing position) the printer unit controller 71 receives the ON signal from the upstream side slack detection sensor 61 and receives the OFF signal from the downstream side slack detection sensor 62. After that, the printer unit controller 71 increases the rotation speed of the heat roller 26 higher than the speed of normal time. As a result, the length of the part of the die cut label S1 ranging from the secondary transfer position to the fixing position is gradually reduced, and the excessive slack generated in the part (strictly speaking, the position immediately before the fixing position)<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> is eliminated. The printer unit controller 71 finally maintains the rotation speed of the heat roller 26 at speed when the slack degree is brought into a proper range.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">As described above, in the printer 1, while the printing processing is performed in the first paper loading mode, the printer unit controller 71 controls the rotation speed of the heat roller 26 in accordance with the output signals from the slack detection sensors 61, 62. Thereby, even when size of the outer diameter of the heat roller 26 is changed, the slack degree in the part of the die cut label S1 ranging from the secondary transfer position to the fixing position is adjusted to be a proper amount. As a result, the jam and the transfer failure generated due to excess or shortage of the slack are suppressed, so that the quality of the printed image is improved.</p><heading id="h0014">&lt;&lt;Other Embodiments&gt;&gt;</heading><p id="p0117" num="0117">In the above embodiment, one example is described mainly for the configuration of the label printer of the present invention. However, the above embodiment is not to limit the present invention but only to provide one example for facilitating understanding of the present invention. The present invention can be modified and improved without departing from the gist thereof, and the present invention includes equivalent items thereof as a matter of course.</p><p id="p0118" num="0118">In the above embodiment, the toner image formation units 20Y, 20M, 20C, 20K of four colors of YMCK are arranged side by side in the up and down direction. Further, in the above embodiment, when the part of the intermediate transfer belt 21 where the color toner image is held passes through the part between the secondary transfer roller 23 and the opposing roller 24 (nipping portion), the above color toner image is transferred to the medium. That is, in the above embodiment, the color toner image is collectively transferred at one point in the conveyance route for the medium in the printer unit 2. However, the present<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> invention is not limited to this but for example, the toner image formation units 20Y, 20M, 20C, 20K of four colors of YMCK may be arranged in a laterally placed state, that is, in a state where the toner image formation units are placed side by side along the conveyance route. In such a case, the toner images of different colors are individually transferred at plural points in the conveyance route for the medium.</p><p id="p0119" num="0119">Meanwhile, when the toner image formation units 20Y, 20M, 20C, 20K are arranged side by side in the up and down direction as in the above embodiment, a space for providing the slack in the die cut label S1 is easily ensured in the printer unit 2. That is, the slack is more easily provided in the above embodiment than a configuration that the toner image formation units 20Y, 20M, 20C, 20K of four colors of YMCK are laterally arranged side by side.</p><p id="p0120" num="0120">In a case where the color toner image is collectively transferred at one point in the conveyance route for the medium, the number of the point where the toner image is transferred, specifically, the number of the point where the medium is nipped between the pair of transfer rollers is reduced in comparison to the configuration that the toner images of different colors are individually transferred at plural points in the conveyance route for the medium. The more the number of the point where the toner image is transferred is reduced, the more the number of abutment with the medium is reduced. Thus, when the die cut label S1 is used as the medium, the adhesive media Sf are less likely to be detached from the release paper Sb. Therefore, from a viewpoint of avoiding detachment of the adhesive media Sf, the color toner image is more favorably collectively transferred at one point in the conveyance route for the medium.</p><p id="p0121" num="0121">In the above embodiment, the two slack detection sensors 61, 62 are used in order to detect the slack degree in the part of the die cut label S1 ranging from the secondary transfer<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> position to the fixing position in the first paper loading mode. One of the two slack detection sensors 61, 62 detects the slack degree on the side closer to the secondary transfer position, and the other sensor detects the slack degree on the side closer to the fixing position. However, the number of sensors for detecting the slack is not particularly limited. For example, in a case where a sensor capable of detecting a slack amount with high precision such as a distance sensor is used, only one sensor may be arranged. However, in a case where the interrupter type photo sensors which are relatively inexpensive are used as the sensors for detecting the slack as in the above embodiment, the plurality of sensors may be arranged at positions different from each other in the conveying direction, and at least one sensor may be arranged on the side close to the secondary transfer position, and at least one sensor may be arranged on the side close to the fixing position.</p><p id="p0122" num="0122">An arrangement position of the sensor for detecting the slack is also not particularly limited. For example, the downstream side slack detection sensor 62 may be arranged at a position on the slightly upstream side of the arrangement position shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>, specifically, on the upstream side of the downstream side end in the conveying direction of the conveyance belt 51 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref>.</p><p id="p0123" num="0123">In the above embodiment, the endless intermediate transfer belt 21 is provided as an intermediate transfer body for the toner image. However, the present invention is not limited to this but an intermediate transfer drum may be provided.</p><p id="p0124" num="0124">In the above embodiment, when the medium passes through the part between the secondary transfer roller 23 and the opposing roller 24, the toner image held on the intermediate transfer belt 21 is transferred to the medium by the electric field formed between the rollers. However, the present<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> invention is not limited to this but a transfer method of using a belt instead of the rollers or a method of transferring a toner image after electrically charging the medium with a corona charger (corona transfer method) may be adopted. It should be noted that the pass-through portion for the medium provided in the transfer portion is formed differently in accordance with the transfer method needless to say but corresponds to a part through which the medium actually passes at the time of transfer.</p><p id="p0125" num="0125">In the above embodiment, the toner image is fixed by nipping the medium between the heated heat roller 26 and the backup roller 27. However, the present invention is not limited to this but a fixing method of using a belt instead of the rollers or a method of fusing the transfer image with irradiation light from a xenon lamp (flash fixing method) may be adopted. It should be noted that the pass-through portion for the medium provided in the fixing portion is formed differently in accordance with the fixing method needless to say but corresponds to a part through which the medium actually passes at the time of fixing.</p><p id="p0126" num="0126">In the above embodiment, the rotation speed of the fixing roller (heat roller 26) is controlled in order to adjust the slack degree of the die cut label S1. However, an object to be controlled is not limited to the rotation speed of the fixing roller. As long as the passing speed at which the medium passes through the pass-through portion provided in the fixing portion (fixing unit) is adjusted, speed other than the rotation speed of the fixing roller may be controlled. For example, in a case where fixing is performed by a non-contact heating method such as the flash fixing method, drive speed of rollers, a belt, or other delivery mechanisms that deliver the medium to the downstream side in the vicinity of the fixing point (in other words, delivery speed of the medium) may be controlled.</p><p id="p0127" num="0127"><!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> However, when the rotation speed of the heat roller 26 is controlled as in the above embodiment, the effects of the present invention are more effectively exerted. Specifically speaking, the heating temperature of the heat roller 26 is changed in accordance with a type (thickness or material) of the medium to which the image is printed, and the outer diameter of the heat roller 26 is changed in accordance with the temperature at the time and the circumferential speed of the heat roller 26 is accordingly changed. Thereby, the passing speed at which the medium passes through the part between the heat roller 26 and the backup roller 27 is changed. As a result, the slack degree of the medium is changed. In such a situation, adjustment of the rotation speed of the heat roller 26 is a favorable configuration upon fixing and maintaining the slack degree, so that the effects of the present invention are more effectively exerted.</p><p id="p0128" num="0128">In the above embodiment, the intermediate transfer belt 21 is controlled to have fixed circumferential speed in order to fix and maintain the transfer speed during image printing, and the primary transfer rollers 22, the secondary transfer roller 23, and the opposing roller 24 to be abutted with this are driven and rotated. However, an object to be controlled is different in accordance with the adopted transfer method as a matter of course. For example, in a case where the corona transfer method is adopted, a holding body that holds the toner image before transfer and rollers, a belt, or other delivery mechanisms that deliver the medium to the downstream side in the vicinity of the corona charger are used, and drive speed of these may be controlled to be fixed.</p><p id="p0129" num="0129">In the above embodiment, the endless conveyance belt 51 is provided as the mechanism for conveying the medium in the printer unit 2, that is, the conveyance mechanism main body. However, the present invention is not limited to this but a conveyance drum that conveys the medium by being rotated while<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --> holding the medium on a peripheral surface may be provided.</p><p id="p0130" num="0130">In the above embodiment, at the time of executing the first paper loading mode, that is, in a case of printing the image to the roll shaped medium, the slack of the above medium is adjusted. However, the present invention is not limited to this. As well as the first paper loading mode, the slack may be adjusted when the third paper loading mode is executed. Specifically speaking, the length of the medium created by cutting the roll shaped medium (that is, the cut paper S2) in the third paper loading mode is variable as described above, and may sometimes be not less than a distance between the secondary transfer position and the fixing position (interval length between the secondary transfer position and the fixing position in the conveyance route). In such a case, when the cut paper S2 is placed over both the secondary transfer position and the fixing position, the slack can be generated in a part of the cut paper S2 between the secondary transfer position and the fixing position. At this time, the slack degree may be adjusted by the same procedure as the time of executing the first paper loading mode. That is, at the time of executing the third paper loading mode, when the length of the created cut paper S2 is not less than the interval length between the secondary transfer position and the fixing position, the printer unit controller 71 may control the rotation speed of the heat roller 26 in accordance with the output signals from the slack detection sensors 61, 62 in order to bring the slack degree into a preliminarily set range. Thereby, in a case where the image is printed to the relatively long cut paper S2 under execution of the third paper loading mode, the slack degree is adjusted to be a proper amount and the failure generated due to excess or shortage of the slack is avoided, so that the quality of the printed image can be improved.</p><heading id="h0015">[Explanation of Reference Numerals]</heading><p id="p0131" num="0131"><!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>1:</dt><dd>Printer (label printer)</dd><dt>2:</dt><dd>Printer unit (printer unit)</dd><dt>2A:</dt><dd>Casing</dd><dt>3:</dt><dd>Paper feed unit (medium supply unit)</dd><dt>4:</dt><dd>Base</dd><dt>20Y, 20M, 20C, 20K:</dt><dd>Toner image formation unit</dd><dt>21:</dt><dd>Intermediate transfer belt</dd><dt>22:</dt><dd>Primary transfer roller</dd><dt>23:</dt><dd>Secondary transfer roller</dd><dt>24:</dt><dd>Opposing roller</dd><dt>25:</dt><dd>Belt cleaner</dd><dt>26:</dt><dd>Fixing roller, heat roller</dd><dt>27:</dt><dd>Fixing roller, backup roller</dd><dt>31:</dt><dd>Unwinder (feed roller)</dd><dt>32:</dt><dd>Roll feeder (take-up roller)</dd><dt>32A, 32B, 32C:</dt><dd>Conveyance roller</dd><dt>33:</dt><dd>Cutter unit (cutter)</dd><dt>34:</dt><dd>Cut paper feeder (supplying mechanism)</dd><dt>34a:</dt><dd>Tray</dd><dt>34b:</dt><dd>Delivery roller</dd><dt>35:</dt><dd>Rewinder</dd><dt>41:</dt><dd>Toner cartridge</dd><dt>42:</dt><dd>Housing</dd><dt>43:</dt><dd>Supply roller</dd><dt>44:</dt><dd>Developing roller</dd><dt>45:</dt><dd>Regulation blade</dd><dt>46:</dt><dd>Photosensitive drum</dd><dt>47:</dt><dd>Electrifier</dd><dt>48:</dt><dd>Photosensitive drum cleaner</dd><dt>49:</dt><dd>Electric remover</dd><dt>50:</dt><dd>Conveyance mechanism</dd><dt>51:</dt><dd>Conveyance belt (conveyance mechanism main body)</dd><dt>52:</dt><dd>Intake mechanism</dd><dt>53:</dt><dd>Paper loading roller</dd><dt>54:</dt><dd>Paper ejection roller</dd><dt>61, 62:</dt><dd>Slack detection sensor (detector)<!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --></dd><dt>61a, 62a:</dt><dd>Lever</dd><dt>71:</dt><dd>Printer unit controller (second control unit)</dd><dt>72:</dt><dd>Paper feed unit controller (first control unit)</dd><dt>S1:</dt><dd>Die cut label (first medium)</dd><dt>S2:</dt><dd>Cut paper (second medium)</dd><dt>Sb:</dt><dd>Release paper</dd><dt>Sf:</dt><dd>Adhesive medium</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90459570" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An electrographic type label printer, comprising:
