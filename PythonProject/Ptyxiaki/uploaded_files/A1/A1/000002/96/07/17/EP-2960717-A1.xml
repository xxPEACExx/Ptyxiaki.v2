To maintain the aperture ratio, metal electrodes of the pixels and line width of the color filter black matrix (BM) have to be narrower as well. However, it is difficult to realize narrower line width in known photolithography processes due to the diffraction effect of light.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Currently, to overcome the influence of the diffraction effect, a method realizes narrower line width by way of a sawtooth-shaped slit as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. The line width is adjusted by adjusting a width a, a gap b and an angle θ. The advantage of the method lies in that the narrower line width effect can be realized by simply changing the layout design of the mask slits. However, it has the disadvantage of having too many burrs, not smooth and lacking corner design. In fact, a straight line design is normally combined with the sawtooth design. That is, the straight line design is used in a direction not requiring narrower line width while the sawtooth design is inserted in the straight line design for a direction requiring narrower line width as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>. The joining part between the two designs lacks smooth connection design, making the line width at the corner too narrow as to being etched and causing broken-line defect. Furthermore, when both directions require the narrower line width design, the design as <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> cannot meet the requirement of having narrower line width design in both directions.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">To this end, an embodiment of the invention provides a mask.

The mask comprises a light-blocking region B and a slit-like light-transmitting region T; a slit is disposed on the mask, the slit has two opposite edges, that is, the upper edge e<sub>upper</sub> and the lower edges e<sub>lower</sub> of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>. Each edge comprises a plurality of continuous arcs (that is, a plurality of arcs connects with each other). The locations of ridge-and-valley of the two edges e<sub>upper</sub> and e<sub>lower</sub> correspond to each other, and the arcs of the upper and lower edges are symmetrical relative to a central axis along the slit direction.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As an example, the arcs are semicircles. A radius of the semicircle is defined as R; R is for example smaller than 0.5µm, preferably 0.3µm. Inner diameter tangent is a straight line (upper or lower dash dot line in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>) that touches endpoints of each semicircle; a distance between two inner diameter tangents is defined as an inner diameter of the slit (such as the inner diameter A1, A2 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>).</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As an example, the slit comprises a first slit and a second slit, the first slit and the second slit form a corner and are connected via corner arcs. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>, an angle of the corner is an angle formed between the central line of the first slit and the central line of the second slit, for example it is defined as β. The corner comprises an interior angle and an exterior angle, and the first slit and the second slit are connected via an interior arc C<sub>inner</sub> and an exterior arc C<sub>outer</sub> at the corner. The inner diameter tangents of the first slit and the second slit intersect at both an apex of the interior angle and an apex of the exterior angle. The inner diameters of the first slit and the second slit are respectively defined as A1 and A2, the radiuses of the arcs of the first slit and the second slit are respectively defined as R1 and R2, wherein A1 may be equal to or different from A2, and R1 may also be equal to or different from R2.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Specifically, for example, the interior arc C<sub>inner</sub> is an arc with a radian of β and the apex of interior angle is used as its center of circle, and an average of R1 and R2 is used as its radius (that is, the radius of the interior arc C<sub>inner</sub> is the average of the radius R1 of the arc of the first slit and the radius R2 of the arc of the second slit). A curved profile formed by the continuous arcs on one of sides of the interior angle starts from the endpoint of the interior arc C<sub>inner</sub> and extends along the inner diameter tangent on the same side of the interior angle. The center of circle, the radius and the radian of the interior arc C<sub>inner</sub> are not limited to<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> those disclosed in the embodiment of the invention. A person of ordinary skill in the art can make various modifications on condition that the slits are connected smoothly at the corner and the interior arc C<sub>inner</sub> connects the two endpoints of the arcs on both sides of and closest to the interior angle.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Each of two curved profiles respectively formed by the arcs on both sides of the exterior angle extends toward the apex of the exterior angle along the respective inner diameter tangent and stops at a point having a distance to the apex of the exterior angle less than a diameter of the arc. Thus, the exterior arc C<sub>outer</sub> is a semicircle with a diameter equal to a distance between two points where the two curved profiles stop. The radius and the radian of the exterior arc C<sub>outer</sub> are not limited to those disclosed in the embodiment of the invention. A person of ordinary skill in the art can make various modifications on condition that the slits are connected smoothly at the corner and the exterior arc C<sub>outer</sub> connects two endpoints of the arcs on both sides of and closest to the exterior angle.</p><heading id="h0007">Embodiment 2</heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">The embodiment provides a mask, with a configuration substantially same as Embodiment 1, except for the following difference: the exterior arc C<sub>outer</sub> is an arc of a circumscribed circle which circumscribes a triangle and touches its three vertices, the three vertices are the two points where the curved profiles stop and the apex of the exterior angle.</p><heading id="h0008">Embodiment 3</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">The embodiment of the invention provides a mask, with a configuration substantially same as Embodiments 1 and 2, except for the following difference: an angle of the corner is β=180 degrees, the central axes of the first slit and the second slit are the same and one central axis, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">When the inner diameters A1 and A2 of the first slit and the second slit are equal to each other, the curved profiles formed by the continuous arcs of the first slit are respectively and directly connected with the curved profile formed by the continuous arcs of the second slit without the need for a connection arc.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">When the inner diameters A1 and A2 of the first slit and the second slit are not equal to each other, as the case illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5</figref>, the inner diameter tangents of the slit having a smaller diameter intersect a boundary line at points D and E, the connection arcs are<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> respectively a quarter arc (1/4 of arc) with the point D or E as a center of respective circle and a half of the difference between the inner diameters A1 and A2 as a radius.
