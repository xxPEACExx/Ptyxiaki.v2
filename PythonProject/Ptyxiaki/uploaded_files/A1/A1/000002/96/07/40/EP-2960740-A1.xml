Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, generally, in an infant mortality period (i.e., a period of time started since the electric appliance is used for the first time), the electric appliance<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> has higher failure rate which is usually caused by the manufacturing side. Once the infant mortality period is over, the failure rate of the electric appliance is reduced to below a stable range (e.g., below 0.6%). The electric appliance starts to enter an aging period after being used for one year, two years or even longer, based on different extensions of life time made for the electric appliances. More specifically, different electric appliances enter the aging period at different time points. In the aging period, electric components in the electric appliance may show signs of aging or failure, such as decreases in capacitance or variations of inductance in the electric appliance. In this case, although the electric appliance can still be used, the efficiency thereof will begin to deteriorate evidently. In general, unless the electric appliance is in complete failure, the aging is undetectable by users.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In addition, when the electric appliance suddenly falls into the abnormal state, it is possible that the users may neglect such abnormal state, resulting in further influences or damages. Therefore, it is still one of the major subjects for person skilled in the art as how to effectively monitoring the electric appliance in order to detect the abnormal state and the aging sign earlier.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The invention provides an electric appliance monitor method and an electric appliance monitor system, which are capable of monitoring an electric appliance coupled to an electric supply power source, such that whether the electric appliance is in abnormal state or aging failure may be determined and the correspondingly protection<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> process may be executed.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">An electric appliance monitor method is provided according to embodiments of the invention and adapted to monitor an aging condition and an abnormal state of an electric appliance coupled to an electric supply. The method includes the following steps. A load boundary of the electric appliance is set, where the load boundary is related to a reflection coefficient of the electric appliance used in a normal state. The electric appliance is detected to obtain a measured power factor, a measured root-mean-square voltage and a measured power related to the electric appliance, and a supply frequency of the electric supply is recognized. A real part of a load current and an imaginary part of the load current are calculated based on the measured power factor, the measured root-mean-square voltage, the measured power and the supply frequency. The real part of the load current and the imaginary part of the load current are related to a reflection coefficient of the electric appliance in the current usage state. On a real-imaginary current coordinate system, the load boundary and a coordinate point representing to the real part of the load current and the imaginary part of the load current are displayed. Whether to execute a protection process corresponding to the electric appliance is determined according to the load boundary, the real part of the load current and the imaginary part of the load current.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to embodiments of the invention, an electric appliance monitor system is also provided for allowing at least one user device to connect thereto and monitoring an aging condition and an abnormal state of an electric appliance coupled to an electric supply. The electric appliance monitor system includes a cloud server and a monitor device. The cloud server sets a load boundary of the electric appliance. The<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> load boundary is related to a reflection coefficient of the electric appliance in the normal state. The monitor device includes a communication module, a detection module and a control unit. The detection module detects the electric appliance to obtain a measured power factor, a measured root-mean-square voltage and a measured power related to the electric appliance, and simultaneously recognizes a supply frequency of the electric supply. The control unit is coupled to the communication module and the detection module, and configured to receive the measured power factor, the measured root-mean-square voltage, the measured power and the supply frequency from the detection module and transmit the measured power factor, the measured root-mean-square voltage, the measured power, the supply frequency and a current measuring time to the cloud server through the communication module. The cloud server calculates a real part of the load current and an imaginary part of the load current based on the measured power factor, the measured root-mean-square voltage, the measured power and the supply frequency. The real part of the load current and the imaginary part of the load current are related to a reflection coefficient of the electric appliance. The cloud server further displays a real-imaginary current coordinate system on a display interface of the user device or the cloud server, and displays the load boundary and a coordinated point representing to the real part of the load current and the imaginary part of the load current on the real-imaginary current coordinate system. The cloud server determines whether to execute a protection process corresponding to the electric appliance according to the load boundary, the real part of the load current and the imaginary part of the load current.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Based on the above, according to the electric appliance monitor method and<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the electric appliance monitor system provided by the embodiments of the invention, the sampling is first executed to confirm the reflection coefficient of the electric appliance in the normal state in order to obtain the load boundary. Subsequently, the electric appliance in use is monitored to confirm changes in the real part of the load current and the imaginary part of the load current related to the reflection coefficient of the electric appliance, and whether the electric appliance is in the abnormal state or has the aging condition is determined by the load boundary. The electric appliance monitor method and the electric appliance monitor system further displays the load boundary and the coordinate point representing to the real part of the load current and the imaginary part of the load current, so as to allow the user to check and confirm the usage condition of the electric appliance. Accordingly, even non-professionals can monitor whether the electric appliance is abnormal whenever necessary, or detect the aging condition of the electric appliance in order to maintain or replace the electric appliance ahead of schedule. As a result, the risk of electric appliance failure may be minimized.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">To make the above features and advantages of the invention more comprehensible, several embodiments accompanied with drawings are described in detail as follows.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The accompanying drawings are included to provide a further understanding of<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the invention, and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification.

In addition, whenever possible, identical or similar reference numbers stand for identical or similar elements in the figures and the embodiments.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In general, the electric appliance is usually detected by measuring scalar parameters such as a power, a voltage, a current of the electric appliance, so as to determine the electric appliance if it has an abnormal power consumption or not. When the electric appliance has the abnormal power consumption, it may be considered as an abnormal state so that a relative protection process may be adopted. However, a usage condition and an aging condition of the electric pressure cannot be accurately learned based on only the scalar parameters such as the power, the voltage, and the current. Accordingly, the invention further proposes to use a reflection coefficient of an electric property of the electric appliance as a determination reference for the abnormal state and an aging phenomenon, and use various electric property parameters obtained in a normal state of the electric appliance as a determination standard for accurately determining the abnormal state and an aging tendency of the electric appliance, so as to achieve an instant management of the abnormal state as well as an effective aging prevention. It should be noted that, the reflection coefficient of the electric property also reflects an impedance<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> property of the electric appliance.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the electric appliance coupled to an electric supply through a socket So. Herein, the socket So is, for example, a common socket, or a socket on a power extension cord. When an electric appliance 10 is in the normal state, a reflection coefficient of an electric property thereof is relatively stable. However, once components in the electric appliance 10 fail or start aging, regardless of whether the electric appliance 10 shows obvious abnormalities, changes will correspondingly occur on the reflection coefficient of the electric property thereof. Therefore, according to an electric appliance monitor method and an electric appliance monitor system proposed by the invention, by estimating a reflection coefficient of the electric appliance 10, whether the electric appliance 10 is in the abnormal state may be determined or the aging tendency of the electric appliance 10 may be determined.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the electric appliance monitor system according to an embodiment of the invention. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, an electric appliance monitor system 100 is configured to monitor an aging condition and an abnormal state of an electric appliance coupled to an electric supply. The electric appliance monitor system 100 includes a cloud server 120 and a monitor device 140, and the monitor device 140 further includes a communication module 142, a detection module 144, a control unit 146 and a switch unit 148. The monitor device 140 is connected to the cloud server 120 via a network by the communication module 142, and the communication module 142 is, for example, a wireless communication module supporting various wireless communication standards such as Bluetooth protocol, WiFi (Wireless Fidelity) protocol, WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> Access) protocol, Zigbee protocol, LTE (Long Term Evolution) protocol, NFC (Near Field Communication) protocol and so on. The detection module 144 and the switch unit 148 are disposed between the socket So and the electric supply. The detection module 144 is configured to detect the electric appliance 10 in order to obtain various electric property parameters related to the electric appliance 10, and the switch unit 148 is configured to turn on or cut off a connection between the socket So and the electric supply.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The control unit 146 is coupled to the communication module 142, the detection module 144 and the switch unit 148, and configured to transmit and receive data and control the switch unit 148. In the present embodiment, the control unit 146 is, for example, a programmable microprocessor, a digital signal processor (DSP), a programmable controller, an application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), a programmable logic device (PLD) or other similar devices.
