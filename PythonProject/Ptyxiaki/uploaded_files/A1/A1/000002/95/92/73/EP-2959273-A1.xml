	 </invention-title><technical-field><heading id="h01">Technical Field</heading><p id="p02" num="1"> The field of this invention concerns a device for
		dosing a liquid detergent for soaking a cleaning cloth with a previously
		calibrated amount of liquid.</p><p id="p127" num="2"> In particular, the object of the invention concerns
		actuating devices for displacing the valve with which the above-mentioned
		dosing device is fitted. </p></technical-field><background-art><heading id="h03">Background Art</heading><p id="p217" num="3"> In the professional cleaning industry there are
		dosing devices that tend to optimise the consumption of the liquid detergent,
		not only to avoid waste, but above all as an aid for operators in carrying out
		the various operations.</p><p id="p216" num="4"> In fact, with the above-mentioned dosing device the
		various operations of dilution and soaking of a cleaning cloth with an optimal
		amount of detergent is easy and extremely precise.</p><p id="p215" num="5"> In fact, the amount of liquid detergent that has to
		soak a cloth varies according to the type of cloth, and also the nature of the
		surface to be cleaned.</p><p id="p214" num="6"> For these and other reasons, the dosing device in
		the professional cleaning industry is proving to be an essential instrument for
		professional operators.</p><p id="p213" num="7"> Evidently, because of its widespread use by the
		above-mentioned operators and because it is an article that can be used
		immediately, dosing devices need to be fitted with actuating devices that are
		simple and intuitive to use.</p><p id="p212" num="8"> It is equally evident that because these
		instruments are aimed at the professional sector it is indispensable that they
		are reliable over time.</p><p id="p211" num="9"> The dosing devices that are currently sold on the
		market do not meet the requirement of having actuating devices that are easy
		and intuitive to use, and above all they are completely unreliable.</p><p id="p210" num="10"> Indeed, some of them have operating controls that
		are not easy to see, or else difficult to use, and they are also not so
		intuitive with a movement that is opposite to what the operator might
		expect.</p><p id="p209" num="11"> Moreover, all the above-mentioned dosing devices
		have actuators equipped with interrelated moving parts that are located within
		the structure of each device and that are somewhat hidden, therefore they
		cannot be seen and are continually exposed to the aggressive detergents
		used.</p><p id="p208" num="12"> Indeed, with the continual cycle of dampness and
		dryness involved in the various cleaning operations, these moving parts get a
		layer of residue that over time obstruct and compromise the correct movement of
		the parts.</p><p id="p207" num="13"> Finally, as is well known to sector experts, the
		above-mentioned actuating devices, fitted with numerous metallic springs,
		require continual maintenance for replacing these metallic springs that
		deteriorate due to corrosion from the aggressive detergents used.</p><p id="p206" num="14"> Replacing these metallic springs inside the
		structure of the dosing devices, and working on the related moving parts,
		requires the complete disassembly, which should be carried out only by
		technically skilled personnel.</p><p id="p205" num="15"> So, these actuating devices of these dosing
		devices are quite unreliable and not very ergonomic, and above all they require
		continuous maintenance.</p><p id="p204" num="16"> Coming now to the actual modes of operation, we
		see that the operator, after gripping the respective actuating devices, is
		forced, after the displacement that induces the valve to open, to hold these
		same actuating devices in the opening position until the storage chamber with
		which the dosing device is fitted is completely empty.</p><p id="p203" num="17"> Because sometimes the operators are impatient, and
		above all because it cannot be verified how much time the operation for
		completely emptying the storage chamber requires, very often the emptying
		operation is terminated early by the operator, without the liquid detergent
		storage chamber being fully emptied, and thereby frustrating the meaning itself
		of using a dosing device.</p><p id="p202" num="18"> In fact, the operator tends to prematurely end the
		detergent release phase by closing the dosing device's valve, because in some
		dosing devices, especially in the final phase of releasing the last of the
		liquid detergent in the chamber, this liquid flows out at an exasperatingly
		slow rate.</p></background-art><disclosure><tech-problem><heading id="h05">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p154" num="19"> The purpose of this invention is to overcome one
		  or more of the above-mentioned drawbacks.</p><p id="p153" num="20"> Another purpose of this invention is to make
		  available actuating devices of a dosing device that is reliable over time.</p><p id="p152" num="21"> A further purpose of this invention is to make
		  available actuating devices of a dosing device that are visible, exposed for
		  easy gripping and which are easily used by the operator.</p><p id="p151" num="22"> An even further purpose of this invention is to
		  make available actuating devices of a dosing device whose movement is
		  intuitive, and does not require any particular training or special information
		  for the personnel.</p><p id="p150" num="23"> Another purpose of this invention is to make
		  available actuating devices of a dosing device that can easily be controlled,
		  and above all inspected, without the need for disassembling the internal parts
		  of the dosing device, and that can be carried out by technically competent
		  personnel.</p><p id="p149" num="24"> An additional purpose of this invention is to
		  make available actuating devices of a dosing device that are efficient from a
		  mechanical viewpoint, without requiring cumbersome operating levers or
		  prolonged and excessive force on the part of the operator.</p><p id="p148" num="25"> A different purpose of this invention is to make
		  available actuating devices of a dosing device that have none of the drawbacks
		  of a continual wetting-drying.</p><p id="p147" num="26"> An even further purpose of this invention is to
		  make available actuating devices of a dosing device whose elastic parts are not
		  exposed and/or subject to premature deterioration.</p><p id="p146" num="27"> An additional purpose of this invention is to
		  make available actuating devices of a dosing device that can be easily
		  maintained even by the operators themselves without the need to call skilled
		  technical personnel.</p><p id="p145" num="28"> Another purpose of this invention is to make
		  available actuating devices of a dosing device that can be operated immediately
		  without the operator being forced to waste an enormous amount of time moving
		  them and holding them.</p><p id="p144" num="29"> A further purpose of this invention is to make
		  available actuating devices of a dosing device that can provide an immediate
		  indication of how much time is left before the liquid detergent is completely
		  released from the storage chamber.</p></tech-problem><tech-solution><heading id="h07">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p157" num="30"> All the above-mentioned purposes are fulfilled
		  by the actuating devices of a dosing device as shown and characterised by the
		  attached claims.</p><p id="p156" num="31"> In particular, the subject of this invention
		  consists of actuating devices for displacing a valve inside a dosing device,
		  which is fitted with a storage chamber and on the bottom has an outlet pipe for
		  releasing the liquid detergent stored inside said chamber, and because said
		  outlet section of said outlet pipe is closed by said valve and forced to open
		  with a straight line movement along its main axis by said actuating devices,
		  beneficially said actuating devices are joined to said valve by means of a
		  connection on the outside of said dosing device.</p><p id="p155" num="32"> In particular, said connection between the valve
		  and the actuating devices, on the outside of said dosing device, is configured
		  as an extension of the valve outside the dosing device, which is joined to a
		  track whose generatrix has a diverging radius, at the end of an arm of a lever,
		  whose opposite arm, with respect to the hinging fulcrum, can be gripped for the
		  operating movement.</p></tech-solution><advantageous-effects><heading id="h09">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p164" num="33"> Advantageously said lever is pivoted on the
		  outside of said dosing device, and can be easily accessed and inspected.</p><p id="p163" num="34"> Said lever that can be gripped and operated by
		  the operator is ergonomically available at the front of said dosing device.</p><p id="p162" num="35"> The movement of said lever, which can be gripped
		  and operated by the operator, ideally reproduces the state of the flow of the
		  liquid detergent, facilitating the intuitive learning how to operate the dosing
		  device.</p><p id="p161" num="36"> Advantageously said lever has its rotation
		  travel limited at the top and bottom by an end stop corresponding to the
		  situation of the valve in the opening and closing conditions of the outlet
		  pipe.</p><p id="p160" num="37"> The travel of the of the lever from down
		  upwards, advantageously related to a linear lowering of the valve with the
		  respective opening of the outlet pipe of the liquid detergent stored inside the
		  dosing device, is carried out directly by the operator by gripping a handle on
		  the end of the front arm.</p><p id="p159" num="38"> The travel of the lever from down upwards,
		  advantageously related to a linear raising of the valve with the respective
		  closing of the outlet pipe of the detergent liquid that has already flowed from
		  the dosing device into the soaking basin beneath, is stimulated by elastic
		  devices, outside the dosing device, that act either directly on the valve, near
		  the lower end, or directly on the operating lever.</p><p id="p158" num="39"> Advantageously said travel of the movement of
		  the lever for reclosing the valve is conveniently slowed down by a motion or
		  clutch damper device that prolongs the closure of the valve, providing a degree
		  of certainty that all the liquid stored is drained off from the dosing device
		  before the outlet pipe is completely closed by the valve.</p></advantageous-effects></disclosure><description-of-drawings><heading id="h11">Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p172" num="40"> The technical features of the invention, according

		receiving, retaining and releasing upon a command a pre-determined amount of
		liquid detergent.</p><p id="p199" num="49"> On the top of the dosing device 1 there is a tank
		17 full of liquid detergent, with a hole on the bottom for a hydraulic
		connection, by means of an inlet pipe 3, with the inside of the body 2 of the
		dosing device 1.</p><p id="p198" num="50"> The inside of the body 2 of the dosing device 1 is
		composed of a chamber 5 for storing a variable volume, capable of storing a
		certain amount of liquid detergent coming from said tank 17 on top of said
		dosing device 1.</p><p id="p197" num="51"> The variation of this volume takes place using the
		rotation of a handle 7, on the front part of the body 2, which moves a
		partition 6 inside the chamber 5.</p><p id="p196" num="52"> After this variable volume chamber 5 has been
		filled with liquid detergent and the relative inlet pipe 3 has been
		hermetically closed by a gasket 11 coupled to the top part (9, 18) of this
		valve 8, the outlet pipe 4 opens to release said liquid detergent into a basin
		below for soaking the cleaning cloth.</p><p id="p195" num="53"> In particular said valve 8 has a special gasket 12
		on its lower part 10 for closing the outlet pipe 4.</p><p id="p194" num="54"> Advantageously the valve 8 of the invention both
		opens and closes the inlet pipe 3 and outlet pipe 4 of the dosing device 1.</p><p id="p193" num="55"> At the lower end of the valve 8 there is a
		connection 19 that joins with the actuating devices 20 for its displacement
		between the two pre-defined positions of opening and closing the outlet pipe
		4.</p><p id="p192" num="56"> Advantageously said actuating devices are composed
		of a pair of levers 14, whose front arms 21, protruding from the front of the
		body 2 of said dosing device 1, are, at their front end, connected together by
		a grip 15 that can be moved by the operator.</p><p id="p191" num="57"> Said levers are hinged on the outside of the
		dosing device 1 along the horizontal axis, so they can be moved by the operator
		with a rotation movement from up downwards, forcing the flow of the liquid
		detergent from the top tank 17 to the lower basin.</p><p id="p190" num="58"> Said hinging of the actuating devices 20 to the
		outside of the body 2 of the dosing device 1 corresponds to the pivot 26 of the
		levers 14.</p><p id="p189" num="59"> The arm 22 of the levers 14, opposite to the front
		one 21 protruding at the front, is connected, near its free end with the
		connection 19 protruding at the bottom 13 of the valve.</p><p id="p188" num="60"> Advantageously said connection 19 is solidly
		joined to said lower protruding part 19 of the valve 8, and can be a single
		piece.</p><p id="p187" num="61"> Advantageously said connection is made using the
		constraint between a linchpin 23 forced to move within a track slot 24 with a
		generatrix with an increasing radius.</p><p id="p186" num="62"> With this connection you obtain the linear
		displacement of the valve 8 by means of the rotation of the levers 14 of the
		actuating devices 20.</p><p id="p185" num="63"> The repositioning in the raised condition of the
		valve 8 for closing the outlet tube 4 for releasing the liquid detergent,
		occurs automatically stimulated by elastic devices (eventually protected by a
		protection 25), which can act directly on the lower part of the valve 8 or
		directly on the levers 14.</p><p id="p184" num="64"> However, to prevent the outlet tube closing too
		quickly, without all the liquid stored in said dosing device 1 being released,
		the return movement is dampened and slowed down by a clutch 16, which
		preferably acts on the levers 14.</p><p id="p183" num="65"> This clutch, however, is operational and effective
		preferably with the valve 8 in the condition of maximum opening to then fail or
		become non-operational, accelerating the transient state of closing near the
		repositioning closing phase of the outlet pipe 4 for the release of the liquid
		detergent.</p><p id="p182" num="66"> Fig. 7 shows an example of a device that allows
		the clutch to be active only for a part of the travel movement of the levers
		14, composed of a profile with 25 teeth, on which the clutch 16 engages for a
		partial stretch of said travel.</p><p id="p181" num="67"> With this differentiated movement in the
		repositioning speed of the valve 8 from the open position to the closed one, we
		get the advantageous effect of maintaining the outlet section of the outlet
		pipe 4 open for a longer period of time, which is favourable to the speedy
		release of the liquid detergent, and the advantageous effect of reducing the
		time and closing the outlet pipe 4 more quickly and safely by the valve 8
		repositioning in the closed state.</p><p id="p180" num="68"> In practice we have verified how the invention
		does the job and attains the pre-set purposes.</p><p id="p179" num="69"> In particular with this invention we have
		developed actuating devices that move the valve of a dosing device and which
		are joined to the outside body of the dosing device.</p><p id="p178" num="70"> In particular, with the invention, a joint was
		made between the actuating devices that is reliable, easily inspected and
		easily maintained.</p><p id="p177" num="71"> Furthermore, with the invention we have developed
		a movement of the operating levers whose travel ideally reproduces the state of
		the flow of the liquid detergent.</p><p id="p176" num="72"> And last but not least, with the invention we have
		developed a displacement of the valve for closing the outlet pipe that is
		opportunely differentiated to facilitate the discharge speed of the liquid
		detergent, in less time, slowing down the reclosing movement with a clutch, and
		deactivating and rendering inactive said clutch near the closing of the outlet
		pipe for a quick and secure closing displacement of the valve.</p><p id="p175" num="73"> The invention conceived in this way is open to
		numerous modifications and variants, all falling within the ambit of the
		inventive concept; moreover all the parts can be replaced by other technically
		equivalent components.</p><p id="p174" num="74"> In practice, the materials used, as well as the
		dimensions and the contingent forms, can vary according to requirements and the
		state of the technology.</p><p id="p173" num="75"> Where the characteristics and the technologies
		mentioned in any claim are followed by reference marks, these marks have been
		placed with the only aim of increasing the understanding of the claims and as a
		result these reference marks have no limiting effect on the interpretation of
		each element identified by way of example by these reference marks.</p></best-mode></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM70080144" ref-ucid="WO-2014128671-A1" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><claim id="c21" num="1"><claim-text><claim-text> Detergent dosing device for soaking cleaning cloths
