Technical Field </p><p id="p0004" num="0004"> This disclosure relates to laser diode driving systems, and, more particularly, to a laser diode driver system having multiple current sources. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005">2. Discussion of Related Art </p><p id="p0006" num="0006"> Diode pumping has become the technique of choice for use as pump sources employed in solid-state laser systems due to their relatively high electrical-to-optical efficiency. Prior to the use of diode pumping, flashlamps were used as pump sources. Typical system efficiencies were in the 1% to 2% range. The low efficiency was due mainly to the low electrical-to-optical efficiency. The use of diode pumping, with its higher electrical-to-optical efficiency, can result in a laser system efficiency of 10%, to 15%). Thus, a tenfold reduction in required input power can be achieved. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> As space requirements become more and more the norm, a current source that can drive multiple loads is advantageous. The applicant of the present application has previously developed a current source capable of driving multiple loads that is disclosed in United States Patent. No. 5,736,881, entitled "Diode Drive Current Source", the entirety is herein incorporated by reference, that utilizes a regulated constant current source to supply current to drive a load, and the load current is controlled by shunt switches. However, in this configuration, the current source can only drive one load at a time and does not combine the functions of multiple diode drivers into a single diode driver. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> Power scaling of a laser refers to increasing a laser's output power without substantially changing the geometry, shape, or principle of operation. Power scalability is considered an important advantage in a laser design. Usually, power scaling requires a more powerful pump source, stronger cooling, and an increase in size. It may also require reduction of the background loss in the laser resonator and, in particular, in the gain medium. One such approach for achieving power scalability is referred to as a master oscillator/power amplifier (MOP A) circuit configuration. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 A MOPA includes a master oscillator (MO), which is typically a stable, low- power laser source producing a highly coherent beam, which provides an input, or seed to an optical power amplifier (PA). The optical PA increases the power of the "seed" beam, while generally preserving its main properties. It is generally not required that the MO be high-power, since the PA provides power amplification based on the seed signal from the MO. The MO also need not operate at high efficiency, because the efficiency of the MOPA is determined largely by the PA. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> The MO is typically not used as a standalone entity, because of its low output. However, by series-connecting multiple laser diodes in a light emitting array, i.e., 5, 10, or more diodes, to pump a single gain medium, a power oscillator (PO) is created. The PO is conceptually the same as a MO, but with significantly more laser light output power. The PO is essentially a high-power MO that is suitable for medium power applications like near earth range finding. The PO typically has a lower output power than a MOPA. A MOPAPA can be created in which a first PA creates seed light for a second PA. By repeatedly adding more and larger PAs to the chain, kilowatt or even megawatt laser outputs are possible. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> Generally, optical PAs include a gain medium. The gain medium includes a host material which contains a particular concentration of dopant ions. An optical pumping source, e.g., a laser diode array, excites dopant ions of the gain medium to a higher energy state from which they can decay, via emission of a photon at the signal wavelength back to a lower energy level. Photonic emission may be spontaneous or stimulated, in which such transition of a dopant ion is induced by another photon. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Preferably, pumping of the gain medium is sufficient to achieve a population inversion, in which more ions exist in an excited state than a lower energy state. Stimulated emission is induced within the gain medium by incoming light introduced in the form of a seed beam. Exemplary structures include doped optical fiber waveguides, rods, slabs, and planar waveguides. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> Pumping such optical systems generally requires a substantial amount of energy. For example, when such pumping is accomplished using laser diodes, the diodes are driven at current levels that can reach into the hundreds of Amperes. Laser drive currents for pumping a gain medium can be both single-pulse and periodic in nature. Typically, 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 the pulses are provided periodically, for short durations, followed by an off or no-current period. In some applications, the pump current can be either a set DC current or a variable DC current. Suitable laser diode currents for pumping MOs and PAs can be provided by laser diode driver circuits. Traditionally, in such MOPA configurations, two fully independent current driver circuits are generally provided, one for the PA laser diode array and another for the MO laser diode array. Each current driver circuit generally contains its own separate charge source, such as a storage capacitor. In operation, such current driver circuits are configured to provide rectangular current pulses, i.e., on/off, current/no current, but can also be used to provide either a set DC current or a variable DC current. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> Each gain stage of a conventional multiple-stage diode-pumped solid state laser generally requires its own independently-controlled diode pump current to its pump diodes. As a result, each gain stage of a multiple-stage diode-pumped solid state laser requires its own diode driver, resulting in multiple diode drivers for a laser system. For example, some diode-pumped solid state lasers of the MOPA configuration utilize a MO stage and a preamplifier gain stage, as well as a PA stage. Each gain stage (master oscillator, preamplifier, power amplifier) generally requires a pump diode, or plurality of pump diodes. The use of a separate diode driver for each gain stage adds volume, mass, complexity and cost to the laser system. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> In some diode driver systems, "low-side-drive" current sink regulators are used to drive the diodes. In such systems, all of the current control is in the low- side-drive current regulators. A drawback of these systems is that a short circuit from a diode cathode to ground will cause unlimited current to flow in the diodes until an energy storage capacitor discharges, which results in damage to the pump diodes. In addition, in these systems, the input current is not well controlled. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015">SUMMARY </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> According to some exemplary embodiments, one or more high-side-drive current sources are used to provide regulated output current, instead of low-side-drive current sinks. With this use of high-side-drive current sources, the pump diodes can be directly shorted (shunted) to ground anywhere in the diode string with no resulting uncontrolled

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION </p><p id="p0075" num="0075"> Described herein are embodiments of systems and techniques for activating light emitting devices, such as laser diodes, as may be used in connection with an optical PA or MO or PO. Multiple PAs can be used with a single MO to further enhance the output energy of a MOPA system. The light emitting devices referred to herein may be configured as a single optical emitter or an array of optical emitters arranged in a series, parallel, or parallel sets of series connected optical emitters. For the purpose of simplicity, these light emitting devices will be referred to as light emitting arrays but could, in practice, be in any of the afore mentioned arrangements. </p><p id="p0076" num="0076"> A laser diode driver, in the most ideal form, is a constant current source, linear, noiseless, and accurate, that delivers exactly the current to the laser diode that it needs to operate for a particular application. In this configuration, one laser diode driver is used per load, such as a laser diode array that includes a varying number of light emitting diodes. However, as laser technology progresses to smaller and smaller footprints, a premium is placed on space, volume, and mass requirements for all laser components, including the laser diode driver. The present technology addresses these needs by providing a multiple output diode driver that in some configurations combines the functionality of multiple diode drivers, thereby eliminating the need for a one-to-one laser diode driver per load. </p><p id="p0077" num="0077"> In one aspect, at least one embodiment described herein provides a multi-stage laser drive circuit configured to draw current from a common potential source. The drive circuit includes a current node (a current node is defined here to be a particular voltage node through which current flows) and a first light-emitting array in electrical communication between the common potential input source and the current node. The drive circuit also includes first and second current sinks in electrical communication with the current node and in a parallel arrangement with respect to each other. The first current sink has a first control terminal and is configured to draw a first current from the common potential source, through the current node, in response to a respective current control output signal received at the first control terminal. Likewise, the second current sink has a second control terminal and is configured to draw a second current from the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"/>-->
 common potential source, through the current node, in response to a respective current control output signal received at the second control terminal. An aggregate current drawn through the first light-emitting array is determined substantially by a combination of the first and second currents. The first light-emitting array is further configured to emit light in response to current drawn therethrough. </p><p id="p0078" num="0078"> As described in detail herein, the first and second current sinks can be replaced by first and second current sources, wherein the current sources are located between the common potential input source and the light-emitting arrays, in which configuration, over-current conditions in the diodes is prevented, as described below in detail. It is noted that any descriptions herein of a system configuration using current sinks is applicable to current sources of the present disclosure, as described herein in detail. </p><p id="p0079" num="0079"> In another aspect, at least one embodiment described herein relates to a process for driving a first light-emitting array. The process includes receiving first and second current control signals. A first current is drawn from a common potential source through a current node in response to the received first current control signal. A second current is drawn from the common potential source through the current node in response to the received second current control signal. The first and second currents are in parallel with respect to each other. An aggregate current is drawn through a first light-emitting array. The aggregate current is determined substantially by a combination of the first and second currents {I <sub>M</sub>O + I<sub>P</sub>A), wherein the light-emitting array emits light in response to the aggregate current drawn therethrough. </p><p id="p0080" num="0080"> In some embodiments, the process further includes receiving a current-enable signal into the current-drive circuit. The current-enable signal includes at least two states, corresponding to "active" {i.e., drawing current) and "standby" {i.e., not drawing current). A current-level setting signal is also received, and at least one of the first and second current control output signals is determined in response to the received current- enable and current-level setting signals. In some embodiments, the received current-level setting signal varies while the current-enable signal is in the active state. This allows for Arbitrary Waveform Generation (AWG) of each current sink pulse. The respective one of the first and second currents is selectively drawn responsive to the current-enable signal being in the active state. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="13"/>-->
 In some embodiments, the process further includes emitting light from a second light-emitting array in response to the first current. </p><p id="p0081" num="0081"> In some embodiments, the process can include pumping a laser gain medium by light emitted from at least one said light-emitting arrays. </p><p id="p0082" num="0082"> In some embodiments, the current-level setting signal for the current-drive circuit includes a momentary peak configured to induce a momentary peak output current for at least one said light-emitting arrays. Such a momentary peak is adapted to optically excite the gain medium being pumped, thereby providing synchronization of the optical excitation with respect to the laser output. </p><p id="p0083" num="0083"> In yet another aspect, at least one embodiment described herein provides a MOPA laser optical pumping system, including means for receiving first and second current control signals. Means for drawing a first current from a common potential source through a current node in response to the received first current control signal and means for drawing a second current from the common potential source through the current node in response to the received second current control signal, are also provided. The first and second currents are in parallel with respect to each other. The MOPA current source also includes means for drawing an aggregate current through a first light-emitting array, means for emitting first pump light in response to the aggregate current (I<sub>M0</sub> + I<sub>PA</sub>), and means for communicating first pump light into a power amplifier (PA) gain medium. The aggregate current is determined substantially by a combination of the first and second currents, wherein the light-emitting device emits light in response to the aggregate current drawn therethrough. </p><p id="p0084" num="0084"> In some embodiments, the MOPA laser optical pumping system further includes means for drawing the second current through a second light-emitting array, wherein the light emitting array emits light in response to the current drawn therethrough (IMO)- Means for emitting second pump light in response to the second current (IMO) and means for communicating second pump light into a MO gain medium are also provided. </p><p id="p0085" num="0085"> The number of current sinks (sources) and control terminals for said current sinks (sources) can be three, four, five, or more current sinks (sources) in parallel to increase aggregate current capacity and to improve overall aggregate reliability. For ease of description, only two current sinks (sources) are described in detail herein, by way of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="14"/>-->
 exemplary illustration. Additionally, as noted above, the current sinks could be implemented as current sources located between the common potential source and the top first and second light-emitting arrays. </p><p id="p0086" num="0086"> According to this disclosure, a laser diode drive circuit is provided with at least two controllable low-side current sinks (or two high-side current sources). Unless specifically noted otherwise, the detailed description herein of the system using current sinks is equally applicable to the system using the current sinks as current sources. Each current sink can be operated to control current drawn from a common shared source, such as a storage capacitor, through pumping laser diodes. In some embodiments, each of the two current sinks draws a respective portion (e.g., half) of the total laser diode drive current, thereby reducing the current load of either current sink. Operating components, such as the current sinks, at reduced current levels allows for lower temperature operation thereby improving device and overall system reliability. </p><p id="p0087" num="0087"> In other embodiments, one of the current sinks is operated to draw a relatively high, first current through a first laser diode array configured to pump an optical gain medium. Another of the current sinks is operated to draw a relatively lower current through a second laser diode array to pump a laser MO which in turn provides an optical seed signal. Such a seed output is applied to and amplified by the optical gain medium, suitably pumped by the first laser diode array. In particular, both laser diode arrays are operated in a series arrangement. Such an arrangement allows for sharing a common storage capacitor. Such sharing results in less components (i.e., one storage capacitor and charging circuit) thereby offering improved efficiency over prior arrangements using independent storage capacitors. </p><p id="p0088" num="0088"> A block diagram overview of an embodiment of a multi-stage laser diode driver 100 (PO) is shown in FIG. 1. The laser diode driver 100 includes a first light-emitting array 102. In the illustrative embodiment, the light-emitting array 102 is series-coupled, including three semiconductor devices, such as laser diodes 104a, 104b, 104c (generally 104), arranged in series with respect to each other. One end of the laser diodes 104 is in electrical communication with a first terminal of a common potential source 106. The common potential source 106 can be any suitable source providing sufficient electrical charge to support an electrical current of a sufficient magnitude through a circuit 
<!-- EPO <DP n="15"/>-->
 including the laser diodes 104. Some examples include a battery, a storage capacitor, and a power supply. The opposite end of the series-coupled laser diodes 104 is in electrical communication with a current node 108. </p><p id="p0089" num="0089"> A first current sink 110 is in electrical communication between the current node 108 and an opposite (negative) terminal of the common potential source 106, thereby completing a circuit. The first current sink 110 is arranged to draw a first current /; from the common potential source 106 through the current node 108. In the illustrative embodiment, the first current sink 110 has a first control terminal 112 adapted to receive a respective current control output signal. A second current sink 120 is in electrical communication between the current node 108 and an opposite (negative) terminal of the common potential source 106. The second current sink 120 is also arranged to draw a second current from the common potential source 106 through the current node 108. In the illustrative embodiment, the second current sink 120 has a first control terminal 122 also adapted to receive a respective current control output signal. The first and second current sinks 110, 120 are arranged in parallel with respect to each other. Being positioned in a third independent circuit leg to the current node, a current drawn through the light-emitting array 102 is a sum of the currents drawn by each of the current sinks 110, 120 (i.e., Ii+ ). The series-coupled laser diodes 104 preferably emit light 105 in response to the aggregate current Ii+ drawn therethrough. </p><p id="p0090" num="0090"> Each of the current sinks 110, 120 draws a respective contribution of electrical current through the node 108 in response to stimulus at its respective control terminal 112, 122. Even though the term current "sink" is used in the illustrative examples described herein, it can be replaced or otherwise referred to as a current "source." The designation sink or source depends upon perspective. In the case of a high-side current source implementation, the dual current source is moved in between the common potential source 106 and the light-emitting array 102. The bottom of the light-emitting array is then tied to the negative terminal of the common potential source 106. At least one advantage offered by using high-side current sources (instead of low-side current sinks) is improved diode array protection, for example, from short circuits to ground, however, at the cost of greater circuit complexity. In a simplistic embodiment, each of the current sinks 110, 120 can be provided by a series combination of a resistor and a 
<!-- EPO <DP n="16"/>-->
 single-pole/single -throw (SPST) analog, or mechanical switch. Operation of such a switch can be accomplished by stimulus received at the respective control terminal 112, 122, for example by operation of a solenoid or other suitable actuator. It is contemplated that in some embodiments electronic switches, such as transistors can be used in place of the analog switch. Control of such electronic switches can be accomplished by stimulus received at the respective control terminal (e.g., a gate voltage). When the switch is open, no current is drawn by the respective current sink 110, 120. When either switch is closed, a respective current is drawn through the respective resistor. The magnitude of current drawn would be determined at least in part according to the electrical circuit traced through the common potential source and laser diodes 104 and the value of the resistor. In such configurations, the control terminal stimulus operates the current sink in a binary fashion, the current being either on or off according to the stimulus. In at least some embodiments, the circuit design is not a simple switch but rather a linear, closed- loop servo system, as shown in FIG. 4. </p><p id="p0091" num="0091"> It is also contemplated that any of the current sources or sinks described herein, such as the two current sinks 110, 120 of the illustrative example, can include a controllable current source, in which a current magnitude drawn by the current sink 110, 120 is determined by a voltage and/or current stimulus provided at the respective control terminal 112, 122. Such controllable current sinks 110, 120 can include one or more active elements, such as transistor devices. In a particular embodiment, at least one of the current sinks 110, 120 includes a power metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET), such as part no. IRFP4368PbF, HEXFET® power MOSFET, commercially available from International Rectifier of El Segundo, CA. In such a device, the drain-to- source current I<sub>D</sub>s is controllable by the gate-to-source voltage VQS, the device being capable of sinking a drain-to-source current I<sub>D</sub>s of over 250 Amperes at a gate-to-source voltage VQS of 10 Volts. </p><p id="p0092" num="0092"> In laser power scaling applications, light 105 emitted by the laser diodes 104 can be coupled into an optical gain medium 140. Preferably, wavelength of light 105 emitted from the laser diodes 104 resides within a suitable band and has sufficient amplitude to "pump" ions of the gain medium 140 to an elevated energy state. Such pumping can be accomplished with one or more pulses of radiant energy from the laser diodes 104. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="17"/>-->
 Under such a pumping mode, the electrical current drawn through the diodes 104 corresponding to a pumping current I<sub>PA</sub> = Ij + - Typically, I<sub>PA</sub> is an appreciable current {e.g., one hundred Amperes or more) being sufficient to cause laser diodes 104 to emit optical energy sufficient to pump the optical gain medium 140 and emit laser light 142. Since the first and second currents are additive, each can be less than the power amplifier current. For example, each current can be substantially equal, being one-half of the power amplifier current. At least some benefits realizable with such power sharing is reduced operating temperature and more generally, reduced stress on electronic components, such as the first and second current sinks 110, 120. Reduced electronic component stress translates to improved system reliability. Other embodiments are possible having more than two current sinks arranged in parallel to further share the total laser current load on each of the current sink modules. Although only two current sinks are shown in FIG. 1, it is contemplated that more than two can be used, particularly in view of constant current sinks/sources being high-impedance entities that are well suited to sharing current. In this case each current sink/source added contributes to the overall aggregate current through the light-emitting diode array at 102. </p><p id="p0093" num="0093"> A block diagram overview of another embodiment of a multi-stage laser diode driver is shown in FIG. 2. Once again, the laser diode driver 200 includes a first light- emitting array 102. In the illustrative embodiment, the light-emitting array 102 is series coupled, including three semiconductor devices, such as laser diodes 104a, 104b, 104c (generally 104), arranged in series with respect to each other. One end of the series- coupled laser diodes 104 is in electrical communication with a first terminal of a common potential source 206. The common potential source 206 in this example is provided by a storage capacitor 206. A capacitor charging circuit 207 is in electronic communication with the storage capacitor 206 and configured to charge the capacitor to a preferred voltage level VCA<sub>P</sub> at least during periods of charging. The capacitor charging circuit 207 is generally powered by another source, such as a power supply VSU<sub>PPLY</sub> (c-g-, an alternating or direct current power supply or facility power). </p><p id="p0094" num="0094"> A first current sink 110 is in electrical communication between the current node 108 and an opposite (negative) terminal of the storage capacitor 206.

Each of the second control terminals 213,</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">223 is configured to receive a current-level control signal corresponding to a preferred current level to be drawn by the respective current sink 1 10, 120. More generally, in at least some embodiments, a current-level control signal also controls a pulse shape of current to be drawn through the respective current sink 1 10, 120. In such embodiments, each of the current sinks 1 10, 120 is configured to draw a current during periods of stimulus at its respective first control terminal 212, 222, such that the magnitude of current drawn (constant or time-varying) corresponds to the respective current-level control signal received at its respective second control terminal 213, 223. In particular, variation of either current-level control signal during periods in which a current is being drawn results in the value of drawn current varying with respect to time. It is </p><p id="p0098" num="0098">contemplated that, in general, any arbitrary pulse shape to current drawn through either current sink 1 10, 120 may be obtained.

In the exemplary embodiment, the current value is the combination I<sub>T</sub> = I] + I<sub>2</sub>. As described above, pumping an optical amplifier requires appreciable power, such that the total current IT may be 100 Amperes or more. Beneficially, either current sink 1 10, 120 need only draw a portion of the total current (e.g., IT/2), allowing the devices 1 10, 120 to run at lower currents, also generating less heat. Consequently, overall reliability

 of the laser diode driver 200 can be improved. Emitted light 105 can be used to pump an optical gain medium 140, such that an amplified optical output 142 is produced through stimulated emission. </p><p id="p0100" num="0100"> In at least some embodiments, the laser diode driver 200 includes a controller 230. The controller 230 is in electrical communication with at least the first control terminal 212, 222 of each current sink 1 10, 120. The controller 230 is adapted to provide a stimulus (e.g., a voltage) to each of the current sinks 1 10, 120 causing each current sink to draw a respective electrical current to achieve desired operation of the laser diodes 104. Such stimulus may include, for example, a rectangular pulse distinguishing between current and no current states. Such stimulus may be pre-programmed, or otherwise configured to provide desired pulse durations at a desired duty cycle. </p><p id="p0101" num="0101"> For embodiments in which either of the current sinks 1 10, 120 includes a second control terminal 213, 223, the controller can also be in electrical communication therewith and configured to provide the respective current-level control signal. Once again, such stimulus may be pre-programmed or otherwise configured to provide for the desired current pulse shape. In at least some embodiments, the controller 230 provides a numeric (e.g., digital) stimulus. For embodiments in which either current sink 1 10, 120 is configured to receive an analog current-level signal, a respective digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 214, 224 is provided (shown in phantom) to convert a digital control signal to an analog signal, such as a voltage or a current. </p><p id="p0102" num="0102"> In some embodiments, the laser diode driver 200 includes one or more current sensors 215, 225. In the illustrative embodiments, a respective current sensor 215, 225 is provided in each leg of the circuit including a respective current sink 1 10, 120. In such a configuration, each current sensor 215, 225 is configured to sense a respective current drawn from the node 108. For example, the current sensor may be an inductive current sensor measuring current through an inductive field, or a precision resistor (e.g., 2.2 milliohms) shunted with a voltage sensor measuring a voltage across the precision resistor indicative of the current. A respective output 216, 226 of each sensor 215, 225 can be coupled to the controller 230. For embodiments in which the sensor output is an analog signal and the controller 230 is adapted to process digital values, a respective analog-to-digital (ADC) converter 217, 227 can be provided (shown in phantom) between

In some embodiments, the sensed current can be used by the controller 230 in a feedback loop configuration with the current-level control signals 213, 223 to more precisely control the value of current drawn by each current sink 1 10, 120. </p><p id="p0103" num="0103"> It is contemplated that in at least some embodiments, the controller 230 is in further communication with the capacitor charging circuit 207. For example, the controller 230 can provide a charge control signal 232 (shown in phantom) to the charger 207 for controlling charging of the storage capacitor 206. Such signal may control a rate of charging, or a voltage applied to the charge capacitor 206. Alternatively or in addition, the controller 230 can receive a charge status signal 234 (shown in phantom) from the charger 207, for example, indicative of a state of the storage capacitor 206 (e.g., fully charged, or a voltage level). The controller can be implemented on or otherwise configured for operation with a computer adapted to execute a set of pre-programmed instructions.

The driver 300 is similar in all respects to the driver 200 described above in FIG. 2, except for a second laser diode array 304 (MO diode array) coupled in series with one of the current sinks (MO current sink 220). In particular, in such an embodiment, the first current sink (PA current sink 210) and the second current sink (MO current sink 220), can be arranged to draw a power amplifier (PA) pumping current I PA + IMO from the storage capacitor 206 through the PA light-emitting array 202 and into the current node 208. The resulting diode laser light 205 pumps the PA gain medium 240 until laser light is emitted 242. The second current sink 220 (MO current sink), can be referred to as a master oscillator (MO) current sink 220, because it creates the current through the MO diode array that emits the diode laser light 305 that pumps up the MO gain medium 241. The resulting seed light 243 from the MO gain medium 241 is the optical drive frequency for the PA gain medium 240. An example would be if it was desired to set the PA diode array current to 200 amps and the MO diode array current to 150 amps (considering that in a planar waveguide the MO current is generally equal to or less than the PA current). Thus, the MO current sink is commanded to 150 amps by 
<!-- EPO <DP n="21"/>-->
 inputs 222 and 223 and the PA current sink is commanded to 50 amps by inputs 212 and 213. An advantage of this approach is that both laser diode arrays are series-connected and powered from a single common potential source. In at least some embodiments, the MO diode array 304 is capable of producing an amplified pulse through stimulated emission of suitably pumped ions in the MO gain medium 241. In this instance, the seed light pulse is the pulse that comes out of the MO gain medium 243 and drives the PA gain medium 240. </p><p id="p0105" num="0105"> Although a single laser diode 304 is illustrated, it can be replaced by an array of one or more laser diodes 304 arranged in series. Preferably, all of the diodes 204, 304 are arranged to emit light in response to electrical currents having common direction. In particular, such an arrangement provides for a greater number of laser diodes 204, 304 being arranged in series with a common storage capacitor 206, thereby providing an improved efficiency over traditional MOPA laser diode drivers in which PA and MO laser diodes are driven independently. </p><p id="p0106" num="0106"> With the various techniques and circuit topologies described herein, it is possible to command current from a first controllable current sink (e.g., PA current sink 210) around the second laser diode array (e.g., the MO laser diode array 304), which is configured in series with a second current sink (e.g., MO current sink 220). This enables operation of both the first and second laser diode arrays 202, 304, while simultaneously drawing different current amplitudes through each diode array from a common potential source. In the example illustrated in FIG. 3, a first current of I <sub>P</sub>A + I <sub>M</sub>O is drawn through the PA laser diode array 202, while a different current of Imo is drawn through the MO laser diode array 304, despite both diode arrays 202, 304 being series coupled. </p><p id="p0107" num="0107"> A more detailed schematic diagram of an embodiment of the MO current sink 220 is shown in FIG. 4. The MO current sink topology 220 and the PA current sink topology 210 can be identical. Thus, a single schematic is shown for the MO current sink. The circuit 220 includes a controllable current sinking device Q4 in electrical communication with the master oscillator diode array 304 (FIG. 3), and configured to draw or otherwise "sink" a controllable current I<sub>M</sub>O therethrough. In the illustrative embodiment, the current sinking device Q4 is a power MOSFET, such as device model no. IRFP4368PbF, commercially available from International Rectifier, of El Segundo, CA. The example

The gate driving circuit includes an integrator at U3B and a current sense differential amplifier at U5A connected to produce a closed loop, low-side current sink (the implementation can be either low- side or high- side). In a high- side configuration, the current sink would be arranged at the anode of MO diode 304. Once again, at least one advantage of high- side current drive is if the MO or PA laser diode array 202, 304 is inadvertently shorted to ground, the expensive laser diodes are protected. The cost of high-side drive is additional complexity, when compared to the low-side current sink approach. </p><p id="p0109" num="0109"> In the example embodiments, the integrator U3B is model no. LM6172, commercially available from National Semiconductor Corp. of Santa Clara, CA.

ADG1401, commercially available from Analog Devices, Inc. of Norwood, MA. In the example embodiment, the switch U8 is normally closed {e.g., DD FIRE2 being a logical 1), which connects the non-inverting input to a low voltage level {e.g., -0.6 Volts or N 0.6V2) and turns the current sink off. The control input of the controllable switch U8 is in electrical communication with a first signal input 222 {e.g., DD FIRE2). In response to a suitable control {e.g., DD FIRE2 being a logical 0), the switch U8 is opened, removing the low voltage reference of -0.6 Volts from the non- inverting input and allowing the input signal 223 {e.g. , I SET2) to control the amount of current delivered by the current sink servo loop {e.g., 50 amps per volt in this particular example shown in FIG. 4). </p><p id="p0110" num="0110"> The non-inverting input (+) of the amplifier U3B is in further electrical communication with a second signal input 223 through a resistive divider network including two resistors R44, R45.

In the illustrative example, the formula in amps-per-volt is: I/V in amps/volt = [(R52)x(R45)]/[(R49)x(R53)x(R45+R44)].

An output of the integrator U3B is coupled to the inverting input through an R-C circuit including feedback resistor R43 in series with capacitor C29. The capacitor C29, at least in part, configures the device U3B as an integrator, while R43 in combination with C29, at least in part, creates a "Laplace zero" for servo-loop compensation of the current sink. The R-C combination R43, C29 is shunted by a diode CR2 arranged with its cathode coupled to the amplifier output. The shunting diode CR2 in combination with pull-up resistor R42 form a negative clamp that guarantees that Q4 comes up in the "off state. The shunting diode CR2 clamps the integrator U3B output and thus the current sinking device's Q4 gate to about -0.7V. With the particular arrangement, an output of the amplifier U3B, when "fired" {e.g., when the switch U8 is open circuit) follows the integrated difference between one half of the second input signal 223 {I SET2) and an output of the current sensing circuit 225 or the I_SENSE2 signal 228. The amplifier output voltage is coupled to the gate terminal (G) of the current sinking device Q4 through a series resistor R48.

An opposite side of the sensing resistor R53 is coupled to the inverting input (-) through a series resistor R52. A feedback resistor R49 is coupled between an output of the amplifier U5 A and the inverting input. Resistors R49 through R52 form a differential amplifier topology with op-amp U5A. The current to voltage gain in the illustrative example is I/V = (R52)/[(R49) x (R53)] amps/volt.

A charging time constant rof the storage capacitor is determined at least in part by the capacitor value {e.g., 30,000 μFarads) and the series resistor R5. Here, τ = RC, or about 0.6 sec. After initial turn on and full charge of VCA<sub>P</sub>, R5 is shunted by a much smaller resistor {e.g., 1.00 ohm - not shown), so that VCA<sub>P</sub> can be much more quickly charged to its full voltage.

In one embodiment, the shunt device 920 is a switching device 924, such as a transistor, coupled in parallel with the pump diode 830b of gain stage 2 that essentially duty-cycle modulates the shunt current of the pump diode 830b for laser optimization.
