Due to the limit of suitcase's capacity, travelers, however, usually can only store the relatively important belongings in the suitcase and the relatively not important belongings can only be left. Travelers need to buy necessities which cannot be stored in the suitcase after arriving the destinations. Therefore, to avoid the waste caused by repeat purchases of the same necessities, travelers are often fond of high capacity suitcases, in order to store plenty of personal belongings in those suitcases.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Although the high capacity suitcase is able to accommodate more belongings, it may cause storage problems for travelers after their travels. For those families with limited storage spaces, they are particularly troubled by the storage of big suitcases.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Consequently, in order to store suitcases more conveniently, how to make a suitcase with the feature that the size thereof can be reduced after the travels is a problem to be solved for the designers.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The disclosure provides a suitcase for solving the storage problems to users<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> after traveling.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">An embodiment of the disclosure provides a suitcase including a back case component, a front lid component and a ring-shaped gusset component. Two opposite sides of the ring-shaped gusset component are connected to an edge of the back case component and an edge of the front lid component, respectively, to form an accommodating space. The ring-shaped gusset component includes a plurality of first supporting parts and a plurality of second supporting parts. The first supporting parts are disposed on the corners of the back case component, respectively. The second supporting parts are disposed on edges of the back case component, respectively. The ring-shaped gusset component includes a plurality of bending parts. The bending parts are disposed between the first supporting parts and the second supporting parts. The flexible deformation capability of each bending part is greater than the flexible deformation capability of each first supporting part and the flexible deformation capability of each second supporting part, and the bending parts are bendable, allowing the first supporting parts and the second supporting parts to be folded upward or downward on the back case component.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">An embodiment of the disclosure provides a suitcase including a back case component, a front lid component and a ring-shaped gusset component.

The first accommodating parts are disposed on corners of the back case component, respectively. The second accommodating parts are disposed on edges of the back case component, respectively. Each first accommodating part is parted from each second accommodating part. The first enforcement elements are detachably disposed on the first accommodating parts, respectively. The second reinforcement elements are detachably disposed on the second accommodating parts, respectively, to form a plurality of bending parts.

Two opposite sides of the ring-shaped gusset component are connected to the back case component and the front lid component, respectively, to form an accommodating space capable of being closed. The ring-shaped gusset component includes a plurality of sidewall parts and a plurality of sidewall parts<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> that are configured for connecting the flexible part. The flexible deformation capability of each flexible part is greater than the flexible deformation capability of each sidewall part. An acute angle is formed between one of the plurality of flexible parts and the ring-shaped gusset component. Each two of the sidewall parts that are adjacent to each other are able to be folded upward or downward on the back case component by the bending of one of the plurality of flexible parts which is connected therebetween.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to the suitcase as discussed above, since the ring-shaped gusset component is consisted of the plurality of bending parts and the plurality of supporting parts which have different flexible deformation capabilities, and the bending parts are bendable, thus the user is able to fold the supporting parts downward and stack the supporting parts on the back case component. By doing this, the size of the suitcase after being folded is much smaller than the size of the suitcase before being folded, allowing the user to store the suitcase conveniently.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In addition, since the ring-shaped gusset component is consisted of the plurality of bending sections and the plurality of sidewall sections with different flexible deformation capabilities, and the bending sections are bendable, thus the user is able to fold the sidewall sections downward and close the sidewall sections relative to the back case component.

Since the four bending sections 310, which are connected to the two opposite sidewall sections 320, are bendable, thus the two opposite sidewall sections 320 are able to be closed relative to the back case component 100.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0032">FIG. 31</figref>, the rest two opposite sidewall sections 320 are pressed or folded downward, that is, all of the sidewall sections 320 are stacked on the back case component 100 to be at the storage position.

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0033">FIG. 32</figref>, the back case component 100 and the stored ring-shaped gusset component 300 are stacked on the front lid component 200. Lastly, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0034">FIG. 33</figref>, the<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> first belt body 221 and the second belt body 222 of the belt 220 are buckled up to tie the back case component 100 and the front lid component 200 together. Moreover, by comparing <figref idrefs="f0026 f0034">FIG. 33 to FIG. 25</figref>, it is obvious that the size of the suitcase 10 at the storage position is significantly smaller than the size of the suitcase 10 at the use position.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Please refer to <figref idrefs="f0035">FIG. 34</figref>, which is a perspective view of a suitcase according to a seventh embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">In this embodiment, a suitcase 10 includes a back case component 100, a front lid component 200 and a ring-shaped gusset component 300. The back case component 100 and the front lid component 200 are made of relatively harder materials for providing better protection. For example, the back case component 100 and the front lid component 200 are made of plastic plates such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), EVA, PVC or ABS resin, or made of fabrics.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Two opposite sides of the ring-shaped gusset component 300 are connected to the an edge of the back case component 100 and an edge of the front lid component 200, respectively, to form an accommodating space 330. The ring-shaped gusset component 300 has a plurality of first accommodating parts 301, a plurality of second accommodating parts 302, a plurality of first reinforcement elements 910 and a plurality of second reinforcement elements 920. The first accommodating parts 301 are disposed on edges of the back case component 100, respectively. The second accommodating parts 302 are disposed on corners of the back case component 100, respectively. Each first accommodating part 301 and each second accommodating part 302 are spaced apart. The first reinforcement elements 910 are detachably disposed in the first accommodating parts 301, respectively. The second reinforcement elements 920 are detachably disposed in the second accommodating parts 302, respectively,<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> allowing the first accommodating parts 301 and the second accommodating parts 302 together form a plurality of bending parts 303 therebetween. In this embodiment, the first reinforcement elements 910 and the second reinforcement elements 920 are plates which are harder than first accommodating parts 301 and the second accommodating parts 302, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. In some embodiments, the first reinforcement elements 910 and the second reinforcement elements 920 are made of iron wire frame, wood plate, plastic plate, iron plate, aluminum plate, paper plate or magnesium alloy plate. In this embodiment, the ring-shaped gusset component 300 has first accommodating parts 301 and second accommodating parts 302, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. In some embodiments, the ring-shaped gusset component 300 only has the first accommodating parts 301, the first reinforcement elements 910 are detachably disposed in the first accommodating parts 301, and thus a plurality of bending part 303 is formed between the adjacent first accommodating parts 301.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">Since the first reinforcement elements 910 are disposed in the first accommodating parts 301, respectively, and the second reinforcement elements 920 are disposed in the second accommodating parts 302, respectively, thereby increasing hardness of the first accommodating parts 301 and the second accommodating parts 302 and improving the protection of the suitcase 10. Moreover, since the bending parts 303 have no reinforcement elements, the flexible deformation capability of each bending part 303 is greater the flexible deformation capability of each first accommodating part 301 and the flexible deformation capability of each second accommodating part 302. The bending parts 303 are bendable, allowing the second accommodating parts 302 are able to be folded upward or downward on the back case component 100.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">Besides, in some embodiments, the sidewall body 386 and the connecting body 387 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> are able to be applied to the aforementioned first<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> accommodating parts 301.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">According to the suitcase as discussed above, since the ring-shaped gusset component is consisted of the plurality of bending parts and the plurality of supporting parts which have different flexible deformation capabilities, and the bending parts are bendable, thus the user is able to fold the supporting parts downward and stack the supporting parts on the back case component. By doing this, the size of the suitcase after being folded is much smaller than the size of the suitcase before being folded, allowing the user to store the suitcase conveniently.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">Since the ring-shaped gusset component is consisted of the plurality of bending sections and the plurality of sidewall sections which have different flexible deformation capabilities, and the bending sections are bendable, thus the user is able to fold the sidewall sections downward and close the sidewall sections relative to the back case component. By doing this, the size of the suitcase after being folded is much smaller than the size of the suitcase before being folded, allowing the user to store the suitcase conveniently.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Besides, since the structural strength of the honeycomb board is stronger than that of the ring-shaped gusset component, thereby improving the overall structural strength of the suitcase.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">In addition, the zipper has the connection section, thus the front lid component and the ring-shaped gusset component are able to be maintained at a specific distance when the front lid component and the ring-shaped gusset component are separated from each other so as to ensure that the front lid component does not disturb users to fold the ring-shaped gusset component.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">Moreover, since the connecting body of the ring-shaped gusset component is disposed on or penetrating the depression located on the outer surface of the sidewall body, thus the user is able to pull the pull tab from outside of the suitcase<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> for tying or separating the chains.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">Furthermore, as the suitcase disclosed above, since the acute angle is formed between each flexible part and the back case component, the flexible deformation capabilities of the flexible parts are greater than the flexible deformation capabilities of all the sidewall part, and the flexible parts are bendable, thus the two sidewall parts, which are adjacent to each other, are able to be closed relative to the back case component by the bending of the flexible part which is connected therebetween, so that the size of the suitcase after being folded is significantly smaller than the size of the suitcase before being folded, allowing the user to store the suitcase conveniently.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90460343" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A suitcase (10), comprising:
