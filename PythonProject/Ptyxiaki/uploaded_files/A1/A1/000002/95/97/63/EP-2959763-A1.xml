Over time, the widths of such booms have increased to reach a level at which level differences in the surfaces of hilly fields may exceed what the boom can handle without some of the hoses (and, in worst case scenarios, parts of the boom itself) being pressed into the ground during the slurry distribution. Apart from complicating the distribution process, this can result in damage to both machinery and crops. Furthermore, the spreading booms with the largest widths are typically unstable, because they are only fastened to a central frame and, therefore, can be deformed during acceleration or deceleration, causing very great damage on the equipment.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It has previously been attempted to solve the problems related to level differences on hilly fields by placing hydraulic cylinders at the top of the wings, with which the side wings can be raised. Such solutions, however, are costly and often constitute a weak link in the boom construction. Ropes may be used between the vehicle and the side wings to avoid deformations of the boom during acceleration, but since such a solution only works when the ropes are pulled, it has no effect when braking.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0002"><b>Brief description of the invention</b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is an object of the present invention to provide a solution, which completely or at least partly overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages of known solutions within the art.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention relates to a spreading boom, for instance in the form of a so-called drip hose boom, for slurry wagons and trailers, wherein the side wings of the boom are mounted on respective parts of a divided main frame, the two parts of which are hinged to one another in a hinge having a substantially horizontal hinge axis and are furthermore connected to each other by one or more hydraulic cylinders in such a way that the two frame parts can be rotated relatively to each other about the hinge axis in a substantially vertical plane, so that one or both side wings are tilted upwards by this rotation, the outer part of the side wing(s) being lifted relatively to the inner part.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">This configuration makes it possible to tilt the two side wings upwards so as to take into account the level differences level in the underlying terrain along the longitudinal direction of the boom in that a given side wing can be lifted to ensure that it does not interfere with the terrain where this is higher than in the surrounding areas.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In an embodiment of the invention, the two parts of the main frame are hinged to one another at the top and the one or more hydraulic cylinders are positioned beneath the hinging between the two parts.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">By placing the hinging at the top and the cylinders beneath, problems related to the hosing of the slurry hoses when the two parts of the main frame are rotated relatively to each other are avoided, because this hosing is typically arranged along the upper edge of the spreading boom.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In an embodiment of the invention, the one or more hydraulic cylinders are arranged to perform the relative rotation between the two parts of the main frame by means of one or more telescopic joints.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The use of hydraulic cylinders combined with telescopic joints is a well-proven and reliable method for performing mechanical movements, which requires exertion of relative great force.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In an embodiment of the invention, the one or more hydraulic cylinders are arranged to be controlled individually.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In this manner, the side wings can be tilted independently of each other, which may be useful in a varying terrain.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In an embodiment of the invention, the boom is equipped with one or more distance sensors for determination of the boom height above the underlying terrain at one or more locations along the length of the boom.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The use of sensors for determination of the boom height above the terrain is very advantageous in relation to an optimized control of the height of the side wings.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In an embodiment of the invention, the spreading boom further comprises an automatic height adjustment controlling the tilting of one or both side wings so that, insofar as it is possible, the boom height above the underlying terrain is maintained within a predetermined range along the entire length of the boom.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In an embodiment of the invention, the main frame of the boom is equipped with movable connection rods, preferably with adjustable lengths, for hinging the boom to the rear end of the vehicle.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Such movable connection rods makes it possible to rotate and tilt the boom relatively to the vehicle. Furthermore, if the connection rods have adjustable lengths, the transport position of the boom relatively to the vehicle can be regulated.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In an embodiment of the invention, the main frame is arranged to be tiltable as a whole by rotation about a rotational axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The possibility of tilting the main frame (and thereby the whole spreading boom) together with the possibility of tilting the side wings of the spreading boom individually increases the flexibility when it comes to positioning the side wings of the spreading boom optimally in relation to the underlying terrain.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In an embodiment of the invention, each of the side wings of the boom is equipped with a rod connection to the respective side of the vehicle for stiffening the spreading boom, when it is in an expanded configuration with the side wings positioned substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In an embodiment of the invention, the rod connections are divided into two or more hinged parts so that they can be folded, when the spreading boom is collapsed into a transport configuration with the side wings positioned substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In an embodiment of the invention, the rod connections are equipped with one or more hydraulic cylinders for expansion and folding of the rod connections and/or for locking the rod connections in either the expanded or the folded position.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The use of a such rod connection between a point on the vehicle and a point on the boom, thus creating a triangular configuration, increases the stability of the spreading boom when in use, because compressive and tensile impacts on the boom are distributed to the vehicle. In order to secure the machine in case of collision, the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> outer parts of the wings may, for instance, be provided with springs, spring bolts or hydraulic pressure relief valves in the cylinders to ensure that the tip of the boom can yield if it, for instance, is hit by a fence, a tree or another obstruction.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In an aspect of the invention, it relates to a slurry wagon or trailer with a spreading boom as described above.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>The figures</b></heading><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the following, a few exemplary embodiments of the invention are described in further detail with reference to the figures, in which

By individual control of the hydraulic cylinders 10, a tilting of the main frame 4 and thereby of the spreading boom 2 as a whole can be obtained through a rotation about an axis, which is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle 1.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Furthermore, foldable rod connections constituted by an inner rod connection 16 and an outer rod connection 15, which are connected to each other in a double-hinged knuckle joint 18, are arranged in both sides.

A floating function can be obtained by interconnecting the lifting sides of the cylinders 10. A more fixed movement can be obtained by supplying oil to the cylinders 10 individually, whereby a tilting of the boom 2 as a whole can be achieved, for instance in the case of uneven terrain or single-sided slurry application. In order to enhance the tilt, an additional oil pressure can be applied on the pull side of a cylinder 10.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><heading id="h0005"><b>List of reference numbers</b></heading><p
