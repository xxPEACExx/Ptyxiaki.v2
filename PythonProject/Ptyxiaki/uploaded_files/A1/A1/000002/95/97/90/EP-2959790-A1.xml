The sleeve (81) is tightly engaged with the second stem (72), and a surface thereof has an outer threaded segment (811). A lower end of the annular compressible unit (82) shaped into a cone is connected to the outer threaded segment (811) of the sleeve (81), and a resilient claw portion (821) is formed at a bottom thereof. The sleeve (81) is inserted and engaged with a taper base (90), and a supporting portion (812) is formed at an upper portion thereof for supporting the taper base (90). The resilient claw portion (821) of the annular compressible unit (82) bears against the taper base (90) to grip an interior surface of the first stem (71). The user can adjust the length of the cane (70) by twisting the second stem (72) that simultaneously drives the sleeve (81) and the taper base (90) to spin. By tightening or loosening the outer threaded segment (811) of the sleeve (81), the relative positions between the annular compressible unit (82) and the taper base (90) can be changed for achieving<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the effect of adjusting the length of cane (70).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, conventional adjustable walking cane (70) is disadvantageous because: (i) by tightening the outer threaded segment (811) of the sleeve (81), the resilient claw portion (821) of the annular compressible unit (82) bears against the taper base (90) to grip the interior surface of the first stem (71). The user need to exert more strength to compress the sleeve (81) forward to the annular compressible unit (82) while the position of the outer threaded segment (811) of the sleeve (81) is more closer to the taper base (90). Also, when the user exerts more strength on the first stem (71), the outer threaded segment (811) of the sleeve (81) is compressed tightly by the annular compressible unit (82), so the probability of getting stuck between the annular compressible unit (82) and the sleeve (81) and the difficulty of disengaging the second stem (72) by twisting for the user are increased; (ii) the length of the cane (70) is adjusted by twisting the outer threaded segment (811) of the sleeve (81) and the annular compressible unit (82). the twisting action is difficult for the user to perform while a surface of the second stem (72) is smooth; and (iii) the length of the cane (70) is fixed by bearing against the resilient claw portion (821) of the annular compressible unit (82) made of the plastic material to grip the interior surface of the first stem (71), and the frictional resistance is insufficient while the interior surface of the first stem (71) is smooth. Thus, the cane (70) is not reliable while the annular compressible unit (82) and the first stem (71) can not be engaged tightly. Therefore, there remains a need for a new and improved design for an adjustable walking cane to overcome the problems presented above.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">The present invention provides an adjustable walking cane, which comprises an inner tube, an outer tube, a connecting rod, a pushing unit and an extending unit. The inner tube is connected to a first handle at one end, and a protruding portion is formed at the other end thereof. A controlling unit having a cover at one end is formed adjacent the first handle, and a through hole is formed on the first handle for penetration by the other end of the controlling unit. The outer tube comprises a non-slip plug received at one end and a restricting cover is secured on the other end. A block portion is formed at an inner edge of the restricting cover for engaging with the protruding portion of the inner tube while the outer tube is connected to the inner tube, and an inner threaded segment is formed at an inner surface of the outer tube. The connecting rod driven by pressing the controlling unit is secured with the controlling unit at one end, and a threaded segment formed at the other end is connected to the outer tube, and a blocking piece is formed at a central portion thereof. The pushing unit having a tapered surface at one end is secured at an open end of the inner tube with the protruding portion thereon, and a connecting portion is formed at the other end thereof. The connecting portion is compressed against the inner tube, and a plurality of axial slots are formed thereon for increasing the deformation of the connecting portion by compression. An annular portion protruding from a middle portion of the pushing unit is compressed against the open end of the inner tube, and a rod hole is formed at a top portion of the pushing unit for penetrating by the end of the connecting rod with the threaded segment, and a spring is formed between the pushing unit and the blocking piece. The<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> extending unit comprises an axial pore for connecting to the threaded segment on the end of the connecting rod, and a nut is fastened on the threaded segment for securing the positions of the extending unit and the pushing unit. A plurality of extending pieces is formed around the connecting rod, and a resilient sleeve is formed at an outer edge of an upper end thereof. A first tubular piece and a second tubular piece protruded from the extending pieces are formed for limiting the position of the resilient sleeve.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Comparing with conventional adjustable walking cane, the present invention is advantageous because: (i) the resilience of the spring compresses the connecting rod against the extending unit and the pushing unit, and the resilient sleeve bears against the inner threaded segment of the outer tube, and then the length of the outer tube and inner tube can be fixed. In extending process, the inner tube and the outer tube are extended outwardly by directly pulling the cane from two ends thereof, and the inner tube and the outer tube are released from compression while the resilient sleeve is detached from the inner threaded segment. In retracting process, by operating the controlling unit by the user, the inner tube and the outer tube are released from compression while the extending pieces on the extending unit driven by controlling unit is detached from the taper surface of the pushing unit, and the length of cane can be adjusted easily; (ii) the spring of the cane bears against the pushing unit and the blocking piece of the connecting rod, and the extending pieces on the extending unit compresses against the taper surface of the pushing unit, and the resilient sleeve compresses against the inner threaded segment while the taper surface compresses against the extending pieces. When the cane is in use, the pushing<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> unit driven by the inner tube compresses against the expending unit, and the expending pieces on the expending unit is expanded by the pushing unit. Thus, the resilient sleeve tightly compresses against the inner threaded segment while the user exerts more strength on the first handle, and the adjustable walking cane is much reliable while the rugged thread of the inner thread segment and the resilience of the resilient sleeve increase the resistance between the resilient sleeve and the inner threaded segment; and (iii) the spring of the cane bears the connecting rod against the extending unit and the pushing unit, and the resilient sleeve is expanded against the inner threaded segment on the outer tube, and then the length of the outer tube and inner tube can be fixed. The controlling unit can be easily operated by axially detaching the taper surface of the pushing unit from the extending pieces and the resilience of the extending pieces and the resilient sleeve.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a three-dimensional view of the adjustable walking cane of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a three-dimensional, exploded view of the adjustable walking cane of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view of the adjustable walking cane of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a partial enlarged drawing of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> of the adjustable walking cane in the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic view of the adjustable walking cane of the present invention in extending process.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic view of the adjustable walking cane of the present invention in retracting process.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> is a partial enlarged drawing of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG.6</figref> of the adjustable walking cane in the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> is a three-dimensional view of another embodiment of the adjustable walking cane in the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> is a sectional view of another embodiment of the adjustable walking cane in the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref> is a prior art.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11</figref> is a prior art.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b><u>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of the presently exemplary device provided in accordance with aspects of the present invention and is not intended to represent the only forms in which the present invention may be prepared or utilized.

The expanding pieces<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> (53) compressed by the taper surface (41) extends outwardly to compress the resilient sleeve (54) against the inner threaded segment (23) on the outer tube (20). When the present invention of the adjusted walking cane is in use, the strength pressed by user is transferred from the handle (11) of the cane to the inner tube (10). By compressing the resilient sleeve (54) against the inner threaded segment (23) of the outer tube (20) and pressing the taper surface (41) of the pushing unit (40) by the end of the inner tube (10), the extending pieces (53) on the extending unit (50) can be more expanded by the pushing unit (40). In other ward, the resilient sleeve (54) and the inner threaded segment (23) can be tightly attached each other when the first handle (11) is much pressed by the user, and the adjustable walking cane is much reliable while the rugged thread of the inner thread segment (23) and the resilience of the resilient sleeve (54) increase the resistance between the resilient sleeve (54) and the inner threaded segment (23).</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">FIGs. 1 to 5</figref>, by pulling the cane from two ends thereof, the inner tube (10) and the outer tube (20) are extended outwardly (the user may hold the first handle (11) or the inner tube (10) by one hand and hold the outer tube (20) or the anti-slip plug (21) by the other hand), and the cane can be extended into extending position without twisting or pressing action. In extending process, the pushing unit (40) can be driven directly by the inner tube (10) to detach from the extending unit (50) due to the resistance of the inner threaded segment (23) on the outer tube (20). Further, the inner tube (10) and the outer tube (20) can be extended easily while the extending pieces (53) releases the compression from taper surface (41) of the pushing unit (40), and the resilient sleeve (54) is no longer compressed against the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> inner threaded segment (23) on the outer tube (20). Moreover, the spring (45) bearing the blocking piece (32) of the connecting rod (30) compresses the extending unit (50) against the pushing unit (40) in any length of cane, then the length of the inner tube (10) and outer tube (20) can be fixed. When the cane is used for going down the stair, the cane can be adjusted to a variety of lengths to accommodate different sized people. In retracting process, referring to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIGs 6</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">7</figref>, the user can hold the first handle (11) by one hand to press the cover (601) of the controlling unit (60), and hold the outer tube (20) by the other hand to press toward the first handle (11). Specifically, the connecting rod (30) compressed by the controlling unit (60) is moved toward the end of the anti-slip plug (21), and the taper surface (41) of the pushing unit (40) is detached from the extending pieces (53) on the extending unit (50). In retracting process, the inner tube (10) and the outer tube (20) are released from compression while the resilient sleeve (54) is detached from the inner threaded segment (23). The controlling unit (60) can be easily operated by axially detaching the taper surface (41) of the pushing unit (40) from the extending pieces (53) and the resilience of the extending pieces (53) and the resilient sleeve (54). Also, the present invention of the adjustable walking cane has a function to retract the cane against the ground to help the user stand the body, when the user is in sitting position.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In one embodiment, referring to <figref idrefs="f0008">FIGs. 8</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">9</figref>, a slot (13) is formed at an upper end of the inner tube (10), and the controlling unit (60) comprises a plug (61), a sleeve body (62) and a second handle (63).
