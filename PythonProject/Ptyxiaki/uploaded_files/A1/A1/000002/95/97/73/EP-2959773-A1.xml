More specifically, the present invention refers to a structure for mariculture with the aim of creating a marine platform where marine species can be cultivated. The structure can be used to build a floating platform or a platform that can be submerged in order to decrease the battering of waves so that the cultivation can be better preserved, and it can also be raised to the surface to farm it.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">There are several commonly known floating structures comprising a framework of large girders, very large floats and nets or cages where marine species are confined so they can be cultivated. Occasionally, the frameworks incorporate ropes perpendicular to the framework, which sink in the water and where marine species grow, such as bivalve molluscs, mussels and oysters. In either of them, the weight of the cultivation puts a great flexing strain on the girders, causing traction and compression, shear strength on the support points in addition to torsion forces, which result in floating and stability problems as well as in cracking and breaking of the girders, that are normally caused by the deterioration of the materials comprising it and the links that connect them.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Several structures that have great floating capacity have been designed in order to fix these issues. These designs are based on using girders that are very resistant to outdoor conditions. The use of high density polythene is very widely spread in structures for mussel platforms, as shown, for example, in the document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="ES2268927"><text>ES 2268927</text></patcit>. Additionally, although there have been many attempts at improving the connecting links, the improvements up to date have not been definitive. Therefore, the common practice has been to use independent links made of synthetic plastic to connect the components of the framework of the mussel platforms, where these can be either the pieces with double fastening and fastening wires shown in the drawings of the aforementioned documents, or the connecting bolts going through the girders shown in either of the documents <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="ES1064198U"><text>ES 1064198U</text></patcit> or <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="ES1066093U"><text>ES 1066093U</text></patcit>. These designs have proven to be inefficient since, in addition to the constant adjustments that need to be made, the materials used frequently break due to tearing.</p><heading id="h0003">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><p id="p0004" num="0004">One of the objects of the invention is to provide a new structure aimed at being used as a platform to grow marine species, which has characteristics that reduce or eliminate the problems highlighted, improving the operating efficiency and extending the life cycle of these platforms.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">This aim is achieved by incorporating a first fastening part incorporated to the free end of the ties that extend obliquely upwards and outwards from the periphery of the metallic tubes, or first plurality of tubes that comprise the support girders of the framework, so that a second independent and complementary fastening part can encircle the periphery of the tubes that comprise the second plurality of tubes that need to be fastened to maintain the framework of the structure connected. Both the first and second fastening parts have a geometric design fitted to the periphery or the perimeter of the tubes comprising the second plurality of tubes that complete the framework of the structure.</p><heading id="h0004">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention, as described in the wording of this description, refers to a structure for cultivating marine species used in aquaculture, that features significant improvements in comparison with current reticular structures, in particular regarding the links between the components that comprise the framework, avoiding torsions and twists of the structure, and therefore improving the resistance and handling of any floating or submersible platform used in this field.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The design of the structure features metallic tubes closed at the ends that can be compartmentalised when they are used in submersible platforms, combined with tubes made up of materials resistant to outdoor conditions such as high density polythene, although other polymer plastics, metals or metal alloys could also potentially be used. The preferred choice of links for the structure is to put ties on the metallic tubes in order to give them a first fastening part, which receives a peripheral part of the plastic tube that it will support, completed by a second fastening part that can be easily added to or removed from the peripheral part of the plastic tube where it is set on and fastened to, aided by the first fastening part and by means of the interposition of elastic joints, since the assembly is done by means of screws or similar linking components.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Different configurations, cross sections and arrangement of the girders have been considered in order to pre-empt and solve the problems derived from the stresses that the structure can be subjected to; therefore, it is estimated that, preferably though not exclusively, the tubular configuration of regular circular section is the most appropriate one for the girders that comprise the main floating members or first plurality of tubes of the structure, and also for the girders that comprise the cross members or second plurality<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> of tubes of the structure; although the cross members could be solid instead of hollow and adopt a flat configuration since this makes it easier for the working staff to walk on the structure.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The layout of the ties on the main girders, or the first plurality of tubes of the structure, together with the fastening parts linked to it, ensures that the waterline of the structure is set below half of its thickness, and the torsion stresses that the tubes tend to suffer are compensated by the downwards vertical push caused by the weight of the marine species cultivated.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The vibrations that the movement of the waves in the water transmit to the structure are absorbed by the joints interposed between the fastening parts connected to the ends of the ties of the first plurality of tubes and the tubes of the second plurality of tubes that make the system rigid, thus decreasing the accumulation of breaking tensions in the connecting points between the tubes.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">More precisely, the floating structure comprises a first plurality of tubes, a second plurality of tubes that maintains the tubes of the first plurality of tubes parallel and equidistant along their lengths, and the first and second pluralities of tubes are connected by linking components in order to form a reticular structure.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Each tube of the first plurality of tubes has an alignment of pairs of ties that extend from the periphery thereof. The ties of each pair of ties extend obliquely outwards facing each other on both ends of a line that extends across the longitudinal axis of the tube of the first plurality of tubes, and parallel above the horizontal plane that divides it into two semi cylindrical parts. The pairs of ties on each tube of the first plurality of tubes are preferably equidistant.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">One of the characteristics of the invention is that the ties feature a first fastening part connected on its free end, aligned across the longitudinal axis of the tube of the first plurality of tubes and designed with a concavity fitted to the immediate lower part of the tubular component of the second plurality of tubes that needs to be fastened.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Said first fastening part is complemented by at least a second fastening part, designed with a complementary concavity in order to encircle the remaining periphery of said immediate part of the tubular component of the second plurality of tubes.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In one of the embodiments, said first fastening part can be connected to the free end of each of the ties of the pair of ties, and extended in a given length that is bigger than the thickness of the tie. It is also evident, according to the invention, that said first fastening part extends lengthwise between both ends of the ties in each pair of ties, although for the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> sake of economy, the second fastening parts are preferably similar in length, albeit longer than the thickness of the ties.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Another characteristic of the invention establishes that both the first and second fastening parts are dismountably connected, which makes it easier to repair or replace the main components of the structure.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Additionally, the invention features laminar joints or other kinds of parts that absorb the vibrations between the first and second fastening parts and the peripheral part of the tube they encircle.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In light of what has been explained above, it is evident that in order to use the platform for mariculture, the structure should be complemented with tops or clasps fitted on its ends, and all or part of the tubes that comprise the main or the cross girders of the structure should be compartmentalised by means of partitions, and, so that it can also be used as a submersible platform, it should be fitted with a valve system that can selectively bale out or flood each compartment. The structure can also be complemented with bars or other supports for mariculture ropes, nets or cages, or with gangways for the workmen, lateral fastening reinforcements or other components common in these types of platforms, and depending on the case, with storage facilities, transporters or growth controllers, among other things.</p><heading id="h0005">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">One of the embodiments, without limitation, of a floating structure is shown in the attached drawings, wherein:
