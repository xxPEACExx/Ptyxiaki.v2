preventing unnecessary consumption of the contents.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">Generally, cream type cosmetics, such as moisturized cream, massage cream, eye cream, foundation, has a lot of oil, and it is a common knowledge that it can easily be spoiled, compared to low viscosity cosmetics such as skin lotion and lotion. Since these cream-type cosmetics are stored in a container with a wide mouth so as to be taken out a little by a little by hand, it is likely to be oxidized by air contact, and also easily contaminated by foreign substances or moisture on the hand.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">To make up for these drawbacks, vacuumed cosmetic containers are widely used to make a certain amount of contents discharged under airtight state. In particular, without being discharged by hand, instead with a plate-shaped button provided are useful, contents can be used after a certain amount of contents is filled.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A traditional vacuum container of these kinds with a plate-shaped button is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig 1</figref>. Referring <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a traditional vacuum container with a plate-shaped button comprises a container body (11) containing contents like cosmetics, a dispenser (12) pumping and discharging a certain amount of contents onto a top portion of the container body, and a button (13) having a plate-shape on an upper portion of the dispenser.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In this configuration, the dispenser (12) comprises a cylinder (14) combined to a top portion of the container body (11) and a piston (17) installed at an inner wall of a suction hole (15) formed on the cylinder (14) so as for the button to repeatedly pump by a spring (16). Furthermore, a check valve (18) is installed at a lower end of the suction hole (15), a piston rod (19) is communicated with the suction hole (15) at the piston (17) and forms an outflow tract for contents to flow out, and a penetrating hole (20) is installed on the button (13), wherein the piston rod (19) is inserted in the middle. In addition, an assisting cap (21), made of soft synthetic resin, is installed on the penetrating hole (20) so as to be elastically deformed by outer pressure and to form a gap.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A vacuum container for cosmetics with a plate-shaped button composed of as the above has a configuration wherein an upper end of a button (13) has a plate-shape which goes deeper as nearer to the center of a top portion, and is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> formed to use contents by absorbing the contents discharged into a top portion of the button (13) by hand or by an applying tool. By a pumping operation according to pressurization of the button (13), a certain amount of contents is discharged onto a top portion of the button (13); however, since every user needs a different amount of contents, amount of contents by a pumping operation may happen to be more than needed. At this time, the contents which are discharged more than needed may be discarded without being used or unintentionally applied on a skin, thereby leading to unnecessarily consumption of contents and users' excessive cost burdens.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention is devised to solve the said problems above, and its goal is to provide a content absorption member attached to the upper portion of a button for absorbing the discharged content, which makes it possible to use the content absorbed in the absorption member as needed by hand or by a cosmetic applying tool, thus preventing unnecessary consumption of the contents.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Furthermore, it is possible for the contents to be absorbed evenly onto the content absorption member by forming many discharging holes on the content absorption member, thereby providing a vacuum container for cream type cosmetics for users' conveniences.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">To solve the above problems, it is featured that a vacuum container for cream type cosmetics according to the present invention comprises an outer container; an inner container which is combined to an interior of the outer container and where contents are kept, and a piston ascending upwards according to the use of contents inside is installed; a support body combined as encircling an upper portion of the outer container; supporting a pumping member; a pumping member which is<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> combined to the support body and discharges contents by pumping operation; a button part which is placed on the pumping member and pressurizes the pumping member, wherein a contents movement hole is installed for contents moving along; a content absorption member which is placed on upper portion of the button part and absorbs contents moving along through the contents movement hole; a button cap which encircles the button part and contents absorption member and is combined thereat, wherein a hollow is formed so as for the contents absorption member to be exposed to the outside as delivering pressure to the button part according to a user's pressurization.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Furthermore, it is featured that between the button part and the contents absorption member is installed the contents discharge member, comprising a multitude of contents discharging holes that is communicated with the contents movement hole of the button part and can deliver the contents moving through the contents movement hole to the contents absorption member.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Furthermore, it is featured that on a top portion is installed a pressing part that extends inward and pressurizes a top portion of the contents absorption member, and at a lower end is installed a fixed protrusion which fixes the contents absorption member.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Furthermore, it is featured that the contents absorption member includes one of the followings, a puff, a sponge, a foam, and a brush.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As mentioned above, the present invention has an advantage wherein on an upper portion of the button part is installed the contents absorption member that absorbs discharged contents, and it is possible to use the contents absorbed in the absorption member as needed by the hand or by a cosmetic applicator, thus preventing unnecessary consumption of the contents.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Furthermore, , the present invention has an advantage that a multitude of the contents discharging hole is installed on the contents discharge member and it is possible for the contents to be absorbed evenly, thereby providing users' convenience.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></b></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a configuration of a traditional cream-type vacuum container.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.2</figref> is an exploded cross-sectional view illustrating a configuration of a vacuum cosmetic container for cream type cosmetics according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.3</figref> is an assembled cross-sectional view illustrating a configuration of a vacuum cosmetic container for cream type cosmetics according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig.4</figref> is a constitutional view illustrating an operational state of a vacuum cosmetic container for cream type cosmetics according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b><u>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</u></b></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.
