Like the human body, the scrotum also shrinks and enlarges as room temperature decreases or increases respectively, which is also the result of homeostasis for keeping the temperature of the scrotum stable.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In other words, the rising ambient temperature leads to increase in the temperature of human body, which also results in increase in the temperature of the testicles. In this situation, homeostasis allows the scrotum to enlarge so that the testicles can cool down. The problem is that warm weather makes the scrotum expand a lot larger to cool off and in turn it requires more space in conventional briefs as they are typically tight between thighs. The result is that the penis is pressured downwards and that makes it sweatier. Furthermore, the sweat that covers the scrotum and the vicinity of men's genital organs is usually difficult to evaporate, which in turn increases the temperature of the testicles and causes uncomfortable feeling. This<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> recurring discomfort prompts men to relieve the sweat by reaching for the scrotum and raising it awkwardly upward by hand.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">This habit is an instinctive action to keep the temperature of the testicles constant so that deterioration in sexual function can be prevented.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The conventional arts have played a good role in fixing erect penis to point to hypogastric area. However, the briefs uncomfortably separating the penis and the scrotum make them shake from side to side and make the penis fall toward groin.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Especially, this condition can more commonly occur in the areas with high ambient temperature, which is why ergonomically designed functional briefs for men are sought to comfortably separate and contain the penis and the scrotum and keep the testicles cool.</p><heading id="h0003">[Disclosure]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Technical Problem]</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is the object of the present invention to provide functional briefs for men wherein the penis and the scrotum are smoothly separated without any means or physical force by putting and keeping the penis and the scrotum separated and contained under the circumstances of intensive exercise or when the penis expands or shrinks.</p><heading id="h0005">[Technical Solution]</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">To achieve the above object, the present invention is characterized in that the functional briefs for men (100) have a round triangle-shaped opening part for penis (200) and a crescent moon-shaped opening part for scrotum (210) sewed to a cloth for lining (140) on the front cloth (120), and the cloth for the lining (140) sewed with a containing cloth (330) comprising a containing part for penis (300) and the containing part for scrotum (310) in front of the cloth for lining (140) by the first cut part (201)<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> and the second cut part (202) are sewed with the front cloth (120).

The functional briefs for<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> men (100) of the present invention do not limit the shape of the cloth for lining (140) and the second cloth for lining (500) or the shape of the opening part for penis (200) and the opening part for scrotum (210) in the functional seamless briefs for men (800).</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">The opening part for penis (200), the opening part for scrotum (210) and the seamless separating cloth (810) are able to allow the penis (10) and the scrotum (20) to be separated regardless of situation where the penis (10) and the scrotum (20) expand or shrink, or when the wearer is intensively doing a work out, climbing or actively moving.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">Even though the penis (10) shrinks, the penis does not touch the scrotum (20) by the separating cloth (170) and the scrotum (20), the groin and the thighs are completely separated by the containing cloth (330). Plus, due to the fact that the size of the containing cloth (330) is big enough, the containing cloth (330) moves caused by the movement of the legs during sports events and various activities, which encourages air to be ventilated. As a result, the penis (10) and the scrotum (20) are protected from sweat, high humidity and temperature.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">It means that under the conventional arts that are focused on separating the penis (10) and the scrotum (20) with the groin and the thighs for the briefs to tightly cover the penis (10) and the scrotum (20), the temperature of some parts of the sexual organ can be reduced since thermal conductivity in the body is not considered. The problem is that thermal conductivity increases the temperature of the other part of the sexual organ, which in turn increases the quantity of heat overall.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">Unlike the conventional arts, the present invention is designed in an ergonomic way so that the total quantity of heat of the penis (10) and the scrotum (20) decreases and the penis (10) and the scrotum (20) are separated and contained while the wearer is putting on the invention, and the wearer feels fresh and comfortable<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> thanks to the flowing air caused by the movement of legs.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">As explained hereinbefore, the functional briefs for men with unique constitution provides different effects which cannot be seen in the conventional arts, enhances a sense of touch and prevent the scrotum (20) from getting warmer by increasing body temperature. In the end, the functional briefs for men can prevent male infertility.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">According to the first, second, and third preferred embodiment, due to the unique constitution which is completely different from that of the conventional arts, the penis (10) and the scrotum (20) are separated from each other and contained when the briefs are worn.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">Thanks to this uniqueness, an increase in the unit price caused by using high-end fabric is prevented and the level of uncomfortable feelings caused by the contact between parts of the sexual organs is minimized by the ease of the contact and the productivity of the briefs is improved.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the concept and specific embodiments disclosed in the foregoing description may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing other embodiments for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that such equivalent embodiments do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90460346" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A functional briefs for men, comprising:
