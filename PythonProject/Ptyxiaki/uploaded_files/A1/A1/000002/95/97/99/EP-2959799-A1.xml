In such way the roller, through the support means 3, is covered by the band means 4 whose fringes externally project and, as a result of the rotation of the roller, said fringes move away from the axis of the roller, arranging almost radially themselves.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The support means 3 comprises a flexible sheet means 6 assigned to be wound and fixed around the roller, and comprises a plurality of housing means 8 each delimited by a pair of walls 9 projecting from an outer face of a sheet means 6 with respect to the roller.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Each wall 9 is extended along the entire longitudinal dimension of the sheet means 6 of the support means 3.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">A set of such housing means 8 of the support means 3 houses the median transversal portions 5 of a plurality of band means 4 where such median transversal portions 5 are fixed to the bottom of the respective housing means 8.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The walls 9 are waved with generating lines perpendicular to the sheet means 6 of the respective support means 3. The mutual distance between two adjacent walls 9 of a housing means is almost constant and corresponds to the width of the respective housing means 8.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">It is important to observe that such waving or undulation of the walls 9 of the housing means 8 provides a set of benefits and advantages. The first advantage consists in that the waving of the walls 9 enables the constant contact between the latters and both sides of the bands in a wide variety of thicknesses and number of the bands folds, of realization materials of such band means 4 and of rollers radius; said contact causes two beneficial effects. The first advantageous effect consists in less wear on the zones of the bands adjacent to the edges of the walls of the housing means 8, in fact in the known devices there is an alternation of contact and detachment of the band means from the edges of the walls which then operate almost like a knife acting on the band means; vice versa the waving allows to maintain contact of the band means with the edges of the walls of the respective seat preserving such band means from friction damages and from an action of repeated contacts and detachment from the edges of the walls.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The second advantage consists in that the constant abutment of the waved walls with the sides of the band means 4 gives to the portions of the latter 4 that protrude from the housing means 8 a radial orientation. In fact, the tests carried out have shown that this<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> radial orientation of the band means in the operating condition favorably affect the cleaning action of the band means allowing them to work in a more effective way even at low speed of rotation.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Another advantage consists in that, particularly in case of assembled band means having medium and high thicknesses, the waving of the walls induce an identical or similar waving in the root portions of the band means 4 and in the portions protruding outward the housing means so stiffening the part from which are branched off the fringes. Tests have shown that such stiffening causes a further increase in intensity and force of cleaning action; this allows to modulate the intensity of the action of the washing roller increasing said intensity proportionally to the thickness of the band means in work with respect to the distance between the waved walls.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Another advantage provided by the waving of the walls consists in that the band means have an effective and intensity of cleaning poorly dependent from the diameter of the rollers on which they are mounted.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The housing means 8 have at least two respective and distinct first and second widths and the housing means 8 having the first width are alternate with the housing means 8 having the second width. In this way the support means 3 has an alternation of wide and narrow housing means.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The face of the sheet means 6 opposite to that carrying the walls 9 bears a plurality of spacer means 12 protruding and almost opposite to the walls 9 or to a subset of them. Such spacer means 12 can be rigid, as shown in the Figures, or may be flexible, for example they 12 can be leaf spring shaped or can be tapered or conical shaped and of a length equal to or greater than those illustrated. Such configuration facilitates the mounting of the support means 3 on the rollers having different diameters since the flexion of the flexible spacer means 12 allows the adaptation of the support means 3 to the various diameters of the rollers around which it is wound.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The bottom of each housing means 8 is constituted by the portion of the sheet means 6<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> interposed between the walls 9 that delimit said housing means 8.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">This bottom carries a set of first pass through holes 14 and the median transversal portion 5 of each band means 4 is provided with corresponding second pass through holes 10.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Such first 14 and second 10 pass through holes are engaged by fixing means for fixing the band means 4 to said housing means 8.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In particular the invention provides that the band means 4 is fixed in a housing means 8 by means of a yarn or thread seam passing through a set of first pass through holes 14 of the bottom of said housing means 8 and through a set of second pass through holes 10 of the median transversal portion 5 of said band means 4.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">As an alternative to the seam and preferably, the invention provides a plurality of fixing means 26 each provided with an elongated body means 27 having at least one protruding arm means 28.
