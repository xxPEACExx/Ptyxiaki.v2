Additional spinning steps might be present between consecutive rinsing steps during the rinsing phase.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The washing phase represents the portion of each washing cycle during which water is supplied into the appliance possibly together with the detergent to form a washing liquor (wetting step), the washing liquor is possibly heated (heating step), the laundry to be washed is subjected to tumbling of the drum in order to repeatedly expose it to mechanical action and to the washing liquor, so that dirt is removed from the laundry and stabilized in the washing liquor (tumbling step) and finally the washing liquor in which dirt is stabilized, is drained from the washing chamber (draining step).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The rinsing phase aims to remove the residuals of dirt and detergent coming from the washing phase. In many appliances, the rinsing phase is performed stepwise, e.g. generally two or three rinsing steps are performed.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In current laundry washing appliances, timing between subsequent steps of a washing phase are preset without taking into account the effective water and/or laundry conditions. In other words, each next step starts independent of the completion degree of the previous one. By way of an example, the heating of the washing liquor is usually started a preset time period from the beginning of the washing phase, independent of other conditions.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the present description and in the following claims, with "the beginning of the washing phase" it is meant the moment when the water inlet is opened for the first time during a washing cycle and fresh water is introduced into the washing<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> chamber.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">One exception is found with regard to the method for controlling a cycle of operation in a laundry treating appliance described in document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP2441875A"><text>EP 2 441 875</text></patcit> which provides for a pre-heating step, a subsequent measurement and analysis step in which the amount of at least one constituent product of the reaction of one or more enzymes contained in the detergent with the soils and stains in the laundry is measured and analyzed for determining if it has reached a plateau and, once the amount of constituent product is determined to reach a plateau, the effective heating step is started.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In other words, the above control method monitors the constituent products deriving from the reaction of the stains in the laundry with one or more enzymes contained in the detergent introduced into the washing liquor. The heating of the washing liquor is started when a plateau of the amount of constituent products is reached.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">This method provides for a correlation of the heater ignition with the water and/or laundry conditions. However, the control method described in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP2441875A"><text>EP 2 441 875</text></patcit> cannot be considered to be fully reliable.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In fact, in many cases the amount of constituent products deriving from the reaction of the stains in the laundry with one or more enzymes does not grow at all or it grows so less that it becomes extremely difficult to detect if a plateau has been reached. In such cases, a control based on that condition is not feasible.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">For example, if the stains in the laundry are not of the types reacting with enzymes (e.g. protein stains, triglyceride-based fatty stains, starch stains, guar gum stains etc.) or if the detergent contains just a low portion of enzymatic components (like e.g. powder detergents), then there will be just a very little amount of reaction constituent products and it will be not easily possible to identify a plateau in the related development.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In order to find an alternative and more reliable way to correlate the heater ignition with the water and/or laundry conditions, Applicant has made the following observations.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Applicant has noticed that liquid or gel detergents, due to their high content of enzymatic components, are better active during detergent dissolution in cold water,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> when these components are active on a multiplicity of stain types, such as e.g. protein stains as blood, eggs etc.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">This implies that in case the washing liquor is heated before the detergent is fully dissolved, the enzymatic components of non-dissolved detergent is partially or completely deactivated before having had the chance to act on these kind of stains. Thus, a too early heater ignition could worsen the washing performances on these stain types.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Detergents in powder form, containing a much lower portion of enzymatic components, suffer less from this inconvenient. However, the bleaching components of powder detergents give their best performances in warm/hot water. Applicant has thus also realized that best washing performances are reached if all bleaching components are already dissolved in water when heating begins. In fact, if part of the detergent dissolves only after the water has been heated, its bleaching components will have less time for acting on the load. Also in this case, a too early heater ignition is likely to worsen the washing performances.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The above considered, Applicant has realized that, ideally, the heater ignition should take place when a substantially full detergent dissolution degree is reached in order to maximize the washing performances.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Furthermore, Applicant has noted that the time required to reach a full dissolution condition varies from detergent type to detergent type.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Applicant has considered that setting a very long washing phase duration corresponding to the feasible longest detergent dissolution would imply, in most cases, an unnecessary extension of the overall wash program duration which could make the user believe that a deficiency is present in the washing apparatus itself, which is, in his/her opinion, not performing properly.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Applicant has thus understood that a modification in the washing appliance has to be made in order to establish a tuning between the heater ignition and the water and/or laundry conditions which offers high reliability irrespective of the detergent type used or the kind and quantity of dirt of the laundry, thereby optimizing the washing performances while keeping short the overall washing cycle duration. According to a first aspect, the invention relates to a method for operating a washing appliance comprising a washing chamber to wash goods according to a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> wash program selected by a user including at least a washing cycle, the method including:
<ul><li>Adding a detergent to a washing liquor which is circulating within the washing chamber during a washing phase of the washing cycle;</li><li>Performing a plurality of measurements of the conductivity of the washing liquor in order to collect a set of conductivity measurements;</li><li>Analyzing at least part of the set of conductivity measurements in order to determine if a condition of substantial invariability of the conductivity measurements is reached; and</li><li>Starting to heat the washing liquor when said condition of substantial invariability of the conductivity measurements has been reached.</li></ul></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The present invention is applicable to laundry washing appliances, such as for example a washing machine or combined washer-dryer, apt to wash goods in one or more washing cycles.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The washing appliance generally includes a washing chamber where the laundry to be washed is loaded and then removed, after the wash program has finished.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the washing chamber, water and detergent are introduced at the beginning of the washing phase of each washing cycle of the wash program selected by the user, in order to form the washing liquor which is used to wash the laundry loaded into the washing chamber.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the present description and in the following claims, with "washing cycle" it is meant the portion of a washing program comprising a washing phase, a rinse phase and possibly a spinning step.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the present description and in the following claims, with "washing phase" it is meant the portion of each washing cycle during which water is supplied into the appliance possibly together with the detergent to form a washing liquor (wetting step), the washing liquor is possibly heated (heating step), the laundry to be washed is subjected to tumbling of the drum (tumbling step) and finally the washing liquor is drained from the washing chamber (draining step).</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">When detergent is added to the washing liquor, it starts to dissolve into the water-based solution thereby increasing the detergent concentration of the washing liquor until all detergent is gone into solution and the detergent concentration does<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> not grow anymore.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Applicant has identified the necessity of a tuning between the detergent dissolution and the heating of the washing liquor so as to link the heater ignition to the real dissolution level of the detergent. As said above, ideally, the heating of the washing liquor should start only after all the detergent has dissolved into the same. In order to achieve this object, Applicant has had the idea of identifying the condition of detergent full dissolution and making the heater ignition dependent on the reaching of the said condition.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Applicant has considered that there is a correlation between detergent concentration and conductivity of water. Thus, an analysis of the washing liquor conductivity, leads to information on the detergent concentration and thus on the detergent dissolution degree into the washing liquor.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Applicant has also considered that through the measurement of the washing liquor conductivity and an appropriate analysis of the related curve, it is possible to determine if a condition of detergent full dissolution has been reached.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The condition of full dissolution of the detergent is considered to be optimal for the heater to be turned on. In fact, if the detergent is fully dissolved before heating of the washing liquor is started, it is assured that the action of the detergent enzymatic and bleaching components can be maxed out.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In detail, the condition of the conductivity course identifying a condition of full dissolution of the detergent is a condition of substantial invariability of the conductivity measurements.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Applicant has noticed that, when adding detergent to the washing liquor, its conductivity always grows rapidly as detergent dissolves into the same, until a steady condition is reached ("plateau") in which the conductivity value substantially does not vary anymore and keeps a high level.
