More particularly, exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a tracking system and tracking method using the same for surgery capable of detecting a spatial position and direction information of a target by tracking coordinates of markers attached on the target, in which the target are markers attached on a patient or surgical instrument.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Recently, a robot surgery have been studied and introduced to reduce the pain of patients and to recover faster in an endoscopic surgery or an otolaryngology surgery (ENT surgery).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In such a robot surgery, in order to minimize a risk of the surgery and to operate the surgery more precisely, a navigation system is used to navigate to an exact lesion of a patient by tracking and detecting a spatial position and direction of a target such as lesion portion or surgical instrument.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The navigation system described above includes a tracking system which is capable of tracking and detecting a spatial position and direction of a target such as lesion or surgical instrument.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The tracking system described above includes a plurality of markers attached on a lesion or a surgical instrument, first and second image forming units to form images of lights emitted from the markers, and a processor calculating a three-dimensional coordinates of the markers which are coupled to the first and second image forming<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> units and calculating a spatial position and a direction of the target by comparing pre-stored information of straight lines connecting the markers adjacent to each other and angle information formed by a pair of straight lines adjacent to each other with the three-dimensional coordinates of the markers.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Herein, in order to calculate the three-dimensional coordinates of the markers through a processor, conventionally, two detectors are required to use a triangulation method in an assumption that a coordinate of marker which is emitted from one marker and formed image in a first image forming unit and a coordinate of marker which is emitted from one marker and formed image in a second image forming unit are identical.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Thus, because conventional tracking system requires two image forming units to form images of lights which are emitted from each of the markers positioned different to each other, a manufacturing cost increases as well as a whole size also increases, and therefore a surgical space is restricted.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Therefore, the technical problem of the present invention is to provide a tracking system and method using the same capable of reducing a manufacturing cost as well as minimizing a restriction of a surgical space by achieving compact system through calculating three-dimensional coordinates for each marker using only one image forming unit.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">In one embodiment of the present invention, a tracking system includes at least three markers which are attached on a target to emit lights, a pair of light sources which emit lights in different position to each other, a lens portion which passes the lights emitted from the pair of the light sources and reflected by the markers, an image forming unit which forms a pair of maker images for each marker by receiving the lights which have passed by the lens portion, a processor which calculates three-dimensional coordinates<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> of the markers by using the pair of the maker images formed on the image forming unit for each marker and calculates spatial position information and direction information of the target by comparing the three-dimensional coordinates of the markers with pre-stored geometric information between the markers adjacent to each other.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Meanwhile, the tracking system may further include a beam splitter which is arranged between the lens portion and the image forming unit to partially reflect the light, which is emitted from one light source of the pair of the light sources, toward a center of the markers, and to partially pass the light, which is emitted toward the center of the markers, re-reflected by the markers, and flowed through the lens unit, toward the image forming unit.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Also, the tracking system may further include a diffuser arranged between the light source, which emits light toward the beam splitter, and the beam splitter to diffuse the lights emitted from the light sources.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In one embodiment, the image forming unit may be a camera to form a pair of images for each marker by receiving the lights reflected by the markers and sequentially passing the lens portion and the beam splitter.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In one embodiment, the geometric information between the markers may be length information of straight lines connecting the markers adjacent to each other and angle information formed by a pair of straight lines adjacent to each other.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In one embodiment of the present invention, a tracking method includes emitting lights from a pair of light sources which are positioned at different position to each other toward at least three markers, reflecting the lights emitted from the pair of the light sources toward a lens portion by the markers, forming a pair of maker images on an image forming unit for each marker through the lights reflected from the markers and passing the lens portion, calculating three-dimensional coordinates for each marker through a processor by using the pair of maker images formed on the image forming<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> unit for each marker, and calculating spatial position and direction of the target by comparing the three-dimensional coordinates of each marker with geometric information which is pre-stored in the processor between the markers adjacent to each other.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Herein, one light source of the light sources emits the light toward the beam splitter arranged between the lens portion and the image forming unit, and emits the light towards a center of the markers through the lens portion by partially reflecting the light by the beam splitter, and the other light source directly emits the light toward the markers.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Meanwhile, the light emitted toward the beam splitter may be emitted toward the beam splitter by a diffuser arranged between the beam splitter.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In one embodiment, the geometric information between the markers may be length information of straight lines connecting the markers adjacent to each other and angle information formed by a pair of the straight lines adjacent to each other.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In one embodiment, calculating three-dimensional coordinates of the markers may further include calculating two-dimensional central coordinates for each marker through the processor by using image formation position information of the pair of maker images formed on the image forming unit for each marker, and calculating three-dimensional coordinates of the markers by using the two-dimensional central coordinates of each marker.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Thus, according to an embodiment of the present invention, in a tracking system and tracking method using the same, one image forming unit is used to calculate spatial position information and direction information of a target by calculating three-dimensional coordinates of the markers through a trigonometry since it is possible to form a pair of maker images for each marker in different image formation positions by a pair of light sources positioned different to each other.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0020"
