More particularly, exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a stand for a medical optical instrument which is installed on medical optical instrument such as a microscope and capable of moving and stopping to a desired position.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Microsurgery has been studied and introduced as a medical optical instrument in various surgeries which uses a surgical microscope to observe an affected area.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In such a microsurgery, a stand is required to install a surgical microscope which is a weight and accessory equipment such that the surgical microscope and the accessory equipment are stopped and maintained in a desired position.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In general, in such a stand, a center portion of a link unit is rotatably coupled to a holding unit using a parallel link, and at the same time, a surgical microscope is installed on one end portion of the link unit, and has a balanced structure having counterweight installed on one end portion of the surgical microscope to counterbalance a weight of the surgical microscope of another end portion of the surgical microscope around a rotating point.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Since accessories, such as an assistant scope or a video camera, are installed in a surgical microscope, an overall balance adjustment operation is carried out by changing a position of a counterweight according to its weight such that a balance between a surgical microscope and a counterweight is caught.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is required to completely maintain a balance of both sides of a horizontal direction and a vertical direction of a surgical microscope to stop a surgical microscope and its accessories to a desired position, however, complete balance adjustment of both sides of a horizontal direction and a vertical direction of a surgical microscope of conventional stand is not performed easily.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">Therefore, the technical problem of the present invention is to provide a stand for a medical optical instrument in which a counterbalancing adjustment according to a change of a weight of a medical optical instrument such as microscope is easy, and a stable counterbalancing is maintained regardless of a position of a medical optical instrument.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">And the another technical problem of the present invention is to provide a stand for a medical optical instrument which is easily extended to user's desired length, as well as, easy counterbalancing and maintaining stably a counter balancing are capable when the length of the stand is extended.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a stand for a medical optical instrument includes a carrier arm including a first to fourth links rotatably coupled in a parallelogram shape with a first to fourth turning joints, in which the second turning<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> joint is rotatably installed on a holding unit and a front link is extended from the fourth link, and a counterbalancing unit coupled to the first and second links to rotate in connection with the first and second links on the second turning joint according to the rotation of a carrier arm, to maintain a counterbalancing of the carrier arm by compensating a torque generated in the second turning joint by a medical optical instrument installed on the front link according to the rotation of the carrier arm.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In one embodiment, the counterbalancing unit may include first and second balancing links which are extended from the first and second links, respectively, to rotate in connection with the first and second links on the second turning joint, and first and second counter weights installed on the first and second balancing links, respectively.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Herein, lengths of the first and second balancing links may be changed according to a weight of a medical optical instrument.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Also, the first and second counter weights may be installed on the first and second balancing links, respectively, to be replaceable according to a weight of the medical optical instrument.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Meanwhile, the stand for the medical optical instrument may further include a carrier arm for extension which is coupled to the carrier arm to extend a length of the carrier arm.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In one embodiment, the carrier arm for extension may include a base link portion<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> rotatably coupled to the first and second tuning joints in a parallelogram shape, an extension link portion rotatably coupled to the base link portion and the front link of the carrier arm in a parallelogram shape, and a front link for extension extended from the extension link portion.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Meanwhile, the carrier arm for extension is capable of extending the carrier arm for N stages by rotatably coupling the N arms to each other, and at the same time, rotatably and sequentially coupling the N arms to the carrier arm.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In one embodiment, the carrier arm for extension may include a base link portion rotatably coupled to the first and second tuning joints of the carrier arm in a parallelogram shape, an extension link portion rotatably coupled to the base link portion and the front link of the carrier arm in a parallelogram shape, an additional extension link portion for extension rotatably coupled to the extension link portions of the remaining carrier arms except for the carrier arm for extension coupled to the carrier arm to a first order, wherein N-1 additional extension link portions are rotatably and serially coupled to the carrier arm for extension coupled to the carrier arm to an N-th order, and a front link for extension extended from the extension link portion of the carrier arm which is coupled to the carrier arm to a first order and the additional link portion for extension of the remaining carrier arm for extension positioned at the most end portion.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Herein, except for a front link for extension of carrier arm for extension which is coupled to the carrier arm to a last order, a front link for extension of the carrier arm for extension, which is coupled to carrier arm to an N-th order, is rotatably coupled to an<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> additional extension link portion of the carrier arm for extension which is coupled to the carrier arm to an N+1-th order.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Thus, a stand for medical optical instrument is capable of installing first and second counter weights to be replaceable according to a weight of medical optical instrument which is installed on a carrier arm, as well as, easily adjusting a counter balance of weight according to a changed weight of a medical optical instrument by moving first and second counter weights in which first and second balancing links of carrier arm are rotated in connection with the medical optical instrument on a second turning joint when a position of a medical optical instrument is changed. And there is an effect of completely maintaining stable a counterbalancing in both sides, a horizontal direction and a vertical direction, regardless of a position of a medical optical instrument.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Also, even though a length of a stand is extended to a user's desired length by using carrier arms for extension, a front link of a carrier arm and front links for extension of the carrier arms for extension are organically coupled to adjacent carrier arms for extension and a movement of carrier arm positioned at the most end is transferred to first and second balancing links through passing first and second links of carrier arm, a position of the first and second counter weights are moved according to a changed position of a medical optical instrument, and therefore, a complete and stable counterbalancing on both sides, horizontal and vertical directions, is maintained regardless of a position of a medical optical instrument.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In other words, a length of a stand is easily extended to a user's desired length, as well as, easy counterbalancing and stably maintaining a counter balancing are capable when the length of the stand is extended.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIG.1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a stand according to an embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIG. 2</b></figref> is a figure showing a carrier arm for extension coupled to a carrier arm.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006"><b>FIGS. 3</b> to <b>6</b></figref> are figures showing a stepwise extension process of a stand by a carrier arm for extension.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">The present invention is described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which example embodiments of the present invention are shown.
