Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an endoscope in which an optical system for front and side observation is arranged at a distal end of an insertion unit.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In general, there has been known an endoscope having an insertion unit that is inserted into a lumen to observe an image acquired by an imaging unit provided at a distal end portion. An observation optical system provided in the imaging unit is configured with an optical system element (an imaging lens) that can perform not only front observation but also side observation in some cases. For example, in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP4955838B"><text>Japanese Patent No. 4955838</text></patcit>, a front observation window (a front observation lens) is arranged in a distal end face of a protruding portion provided to protrude from a distal end face of an insertion unit, and a side observation window (a dual purpose lens) having a circular curved surface is arranged on a peripheral surface of the protruding portion.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The front observation window takes in an observation target in a predetermined viewing field region in an inserting direction (an axial direction), and the side observation window takes in an observation target in a side periphery crossing the axial direction. In the observation<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> optical system according to this <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP4955838B"><text>Japanese Patent No. 4955838</text></patcit>, two lenses arranged in the respective windows are integrally configured so that they are aligned in an optical axis direction by a lens frame.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Further, as another example of this observation optical system, in regard to the side observation lens that guides a side observation image taken in from the dual purpose lens which is the side observation window to an imaging element by using a lens surface of the front observation lens as a reflection surface in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP4955838B"><text>Japanese Patent No. 4955838</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2010169792A"><text>Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 2010-169792</text></patcit> suggests an exit side observation lens that reflects a side observation image taken in from a side observation window on a lens of itself and guides the reflected image to an optical element. In this side observation lens, an exit surface (on a proximal end side) is scraped into a spherical shape, a rear end of the side surface observation window has an acute angle shape extending from a side surface to a back surface, and a side surface has a conical shape having a steps formed due to different diameters.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Furthermore, <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2001299677A"><text>Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 2001-299677</text></patcit> discloses a countermeasure technology for a problem that heat generated by a light-emitting element (an LED) provided in an insertion unit of an endoscope causes deterioration of quality of a lens or an imaging element.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Specifically, a holding member for the lens or the imaging element is made of a material superior in thermal<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> conductivity, and an outer peripheral surface of the holding member abuts on an outer case having a small wall thickness, thereby efficiently radiating heat.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, a frame structure of heat conduction is additionally required, miniaturization is difficult, and a complicated structure must be adopted to efficiently radiate heat to the outer case since there is a limit in structure. In particular, since the structure is devised mainly focusing on the front observation window, applying the structure to the side observation window is not easy, and its heat radiation effect is also limited. Further, the number of components in the endoscope is increased, and an assembling operation is complicated, thereby affecting a manufacturing cost.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide an endoscope that avoids a bad influence of heat generated by a heat generator arranged to be adjacent to a photographing optical system lens, has a simple structure in a distal end portion of an insertion unit of a narrow endoscope without degrading quality, has stable performance, and can be realized at a low cost.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an endoscope comprising: a projecting portion having a shape projecting in a tubular shape which is provided at a distal end of an insertion unit inserted into a lumen, and comprises a first observation window<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> which is arranged in a distal end face and formed of a cylindrical first lens used for observing a viewing field region of an inserting direction and a second observation window which is arranged in a peripheral side surface connected to the distal end face and formed of a truncated conical second lens used for observing a viewing field region in a direction crossing the inserting direction; a pedestal which is provided to be adjacent to the protruding portion and in which a first illumination window through which illumination light for illuminating the viewing field region of the first observation window is applied and a light guide portion which guides the illumination light to the first illumination window via a lateral side of the second lens are provided; a frame member which arranges and supports the first lens on a top face of the second lens while overlapping their optical axes; a frame member which fixes a bottom surface side of the second lens and supports a lens group that forms an observation image taken in from the first lens and the second lens; and a heat influence reducing portion which is provided on the bottom surface side of the second lens to abut on the frame member, and reduces concentration of heat, which is generated with light guiding of the light guide portion and conducted to the second lens, on a local part in the second lens.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a view showing an appearance configuration of an endoscope having an imaging unit provided with a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> front observation window and a side observation window mounted therein according to a first embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref> is a view showing an appearance configuration of a distal end of an insertion unit according to the first embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2B</figref> is a view showing a configuration of the distal end of the insertion unit seen from a front side;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a view showing a cross-sectional configuration of a distal end portion including a lens unit taken along a line segment A-A in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> is a view showing a cross-sectional configuration of a distal end portion including a lens unit according to a modification of the first embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5A</figref> is a view showing a cross-sectional configuration of a distal end portion of an insertion unit according to a second embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5B</figref> is a view showing a cross-sectional configuration of a lens unit taken along a line segment B-B in depicted in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5A</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6A</figref> is a view showing a cross-sectional configuration of a distal end portion of an insertion unit according to a modification of the second embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6B</figref> is a view showing a cross-sectional configuration of a lens unit taken along a line segment B-B depicted in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6A</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> is a view showing a cross-sectional configuration of a distal end portion of an insertion unit<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> in an endoscope according to a third modification;
