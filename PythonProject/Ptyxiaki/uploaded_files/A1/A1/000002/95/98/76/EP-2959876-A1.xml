More specifically, the present invention relates to a medical container comprising an upper member and a lower member each having a structure obtained by vertically dividing the medical container.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background Art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventionally, a resin-made medical container such as a vial has generally been molded by blow molding. However, since the blow molding is a molding method that does not use an inner mold, there has been a problem that the wall thickness of the container is liable to be uneven and the dimensional reproducibility is low.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A method of molding the medical container by injection molding has been known as a measure for solving the problem. Since the injection molding is a molding method that uses an inner mold and an outer mold, there is an advantageous point that it is easy to make the wall thickness of the container even and thus the dimensional reproducibility is high. However, die cutting of the inner mold cannot be conducted in the case of a container such as a vial in which the diameter on the opening side is smaller than the diameter on the body side, and molding the medical container cannot be conducted by the injection molding without some improvement. Thus, a method in which an upper member and a lower member each having a structure obtained by vertically dividing a container are separately injection-molded and thereafter the upper member and the lower member are integrally bound has been proposed.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For example, a method for producing a plastic bottle in which a bottomed tubular main body and a tubular head having a shoulder and a neck are separately molded with a metal mold, and the resultant main body-molded article and a head-molded article are joined with an organic solvent or by ultrasonic has been proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2002029538A"><text>2002-029538</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Moreover, a method for molding a synthetic resin container, in which, when molding a container having different diameters at a body and a mouth, a bottomed tubular body member and a mouth member having a shoulder are separately<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> injection-molded, the lower end of the mouth member is joined to the upper end of the body opening in such a manner that both ends are fitted, and a molten resin is injected in a ring shape along the fitted shoulder to conduct seal molding has been proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP52101180A"><text>52-101180</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Further, as a method for producing a resin-made bottle container in which a tubular neck having a diameter smaller than a diameter of a bottomed tubular body is provided at an upper end of the body, a method for producing a resin-made bottle container, in which an upper side portion and a lower side portion having a shape obtained by vertically dividing the bottle container into two portions at the upper end or the lower end of the body are separately molded with a resin by injection molding, thereafter, in a state where respective divided ends of the upper side portion and the lower side portion are joined, the joined face of the respective parts is shielded from outside, a molten resin is injected by insert molding in a fluid-tight manner, the molten resin is cooled and solidified to make a cover member, and the upper part and the lower part are integrated with the cover member has been proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2004217311A"><text>2004-217311</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Furthermore, as a cosmetic container having a container main body and a lid, a cosmetic container in which the container main body consists of a neck member, a body member, and a connecting member for connecting the two members, a fitting groove for fitting the neck and a body projection protruding from the circumference of the fitting groove are formed at the upper end of the body member, a neck projection is formed in the neck member so as to be adjacent to the body projection when the neck member is fitted to the body member, and the body member and the neck member are welded and fixed with the connecting member formed by a molten resin injected to the upper end of the body member passing through the body projection and the neck projection has been proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2010280089A"><text>2010-280089</text></patcit>.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of Invention</b></heading><heading id="h0004"><b>Technical Problem</b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, since the production method described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2002029538A"><text>2002-029538</text></patcit> is a method in which the main body-molded article and the head-molded article are joined with an organic solvent or by ultrasonic, there has been a problem that the production efficiency is low because facilities such as an ultrasonic generation apparatus become separately needed, which makes the production process complicated.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the technologies described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP52101180A"><text>52-101180</text></patcit>,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="JP2004217311A"><text>2004-217311</text></patcit>, and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="JP2010280089A"><text>2010-280089</text></patcit>, since the body member or the like and the mouth member or the like are joined with the molten resin, there has been a problem that the molten resin may enter the container although the joining strength between the body member or the like and the mouth member or the like is relatively high. In the case where the molten resin enters the container (hereinafter, such trouble is sometimes written as "resin leak"), it is not preferable in that the appearance becomes poor and there is a risk that an impression as if a problem in product quality exists is given even though there is actually no problem in product quality of the container or the contents thereof. Moreover, the medical containers among resin-made containers have a characteristic that they are often configured of cyclic olefin based polymers having excellent chemical resistance and non-adsorptive property, such as cycloolefin polymers (COP) and cycloolefin copolymers (COC). In the container configured of the COP or COC, it is not desirable from the standpoint of maintaining product quality of medical containers that a resin other than the COP or COC is used as the molten resin because there is a risk that the product quality of the medical container is degraded when the molten resin enters the container.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention has been made in order to solve the problems of the conventional technologies.
