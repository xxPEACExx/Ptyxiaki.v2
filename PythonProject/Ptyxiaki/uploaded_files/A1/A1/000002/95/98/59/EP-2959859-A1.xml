Traumas during surgery on osteogenic tissues (periosteum, bone marrow), and also on surrounding soft tissues and bone feeding vessels result in various complications, and as a consequence, prolong the time of healing. The method of transosseous osteosynthesis, developed by G.A. Ilizarov, as well as similar methods of other authors, applied to bone fractures of different etiology, severity and location, made it possible to create conditions for a favorable course of reparative osteogenesis and positive outcome of treatment. Yet these technical and technological possibilities of treatment for limb bone fractures in small home animals in some cases are not justified and require the development of new methods of osteosynthesis, systems and techniques due to the fact that:
<ul><li>universal versions of layout of external osteosynthesis devices for treatment of limb long bones, depending on species, age and sex of home animals, location and the nature of a fraction have not been adequately developed;</li><li>existing devices do not provide for accurate repositioning of bone fragments and their stable fixation until fracture healing and deformity correction are complete, and surgical intervention in the area of the fracture is required.</li></ul></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">There are known [see WWW document].

It contains (<figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>) polyfunctional single units 4, plates 5, rods and pins 6, beams 7, hardware 8, and tools 9. All kit components are marked for convenient recognition.
<ol><li>1. Polyfunctional single units 4 (MP 20.5 and MP 20.4) are designed to form a mounting assembly between the supporting beam and the bone anchor, or between the radial plate and the fixing rod. Depending on the size of an operated animal, the diameter of a hole in the single unit and the method of fastening make it possible to fix the supporting beam of 0.8 to 5.0 mm in diameter. Diameter of the bone anchor also ranges from 0.8 mm to 5.0 mm. When two single units are combined with the aid of the supporting beam, the arrangement with two degrees of freedom is formed which allows to insert the bone anchor at different angles and in different planes. The single unit design is the original development (see Patent # 76446, Ukraine).</li><li>2. Plates 5 (see Patent # 70025, Ukraine)
<ul><li>2.1. Reconstruction plates (RPSSH-5, RPSSH-7, and RPSSH-9) are used in external osteosynthesis. They are used with large and medium-size dogs, and have 5-9 holes for fixing screws<br/>
Features of reconstruction plates:
<ul><li>Low contact with tissue</li><li>Ability to fit different bone profile</li><li>Three-point bone fixation with a single screw</li><li>Solid stiffening rib over all fasteners<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></li><li>Absolute stability with a single fixation point</li><li>Compression capability due to different density (tension in the thread-bone system)</li><li>Significant antirotational capability</li><li>The same type of plates can be used in animals with different weight due to doubling the thickness of the plate in hazardous fracture areas</li></ul></li><li>2.2. Radial plates (PR-7 and PR-9) are designed to form monolateral, double plane and arc-ring sets of medium-small, medium and large diameter (up to 110 mm) with the use of polyfunctional single units.</li></ul></li><li>3. Rods and Pins:
<ul><li>3.1. A self-tapping fixing rod (SFS 100.5) is designed for fixating in the bone at an angle with capturing the cortical plates.</li><li>3.2. A self-tapping fixing rod (SFS 100.5.30) is used as the main anchor in arc-ring, bilateral, momolateral and large-size structures.</li><li>3.3. A fixing, one-side sharpened rod (SFS 100.3.0) is designed for transosseous and intraosseous insertion in small- and large-size structures.</li><li>3.4. A fixing, one-side sharpened rod (SFS 100.2.2) is designed for transosseous and intraosseous insertion in small- and medium-size structures.</li><li>3.5. A fixing, one-side sharpened rod (SFS 100.2.06) is designed for transosseous and intraosseous insertion in small- size structures.</li><li>3.6.

A transosseous, one-side sharpened pin (ST-150.1.6) is used for transosseous insertion with the possibility of tension.</li></ul></li><li>4. Beams
<ul><li>4.1. A supporting beam (BO 200.5, BO 150.5, and BO 100.5):
<br/>
It is used to form a stiffening rib and to support single units upon installation of monolateral and arc-ring devices compatible with the length of a limb. The stiffening rib is strengthened due to additional fixation in the single unit. The stiffening rib is strengthened upon additional arrangement with two or three beams connected through the single units.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> -->
</li><li>4.2. Supporting beam (BO 50.5)<br/>
It is used to form a stiffening rib and to support single units upon installation of monolateral and arc-ring devices. The supporting bean is extended due to additional fixation in the single unit (MP 20.5).</li><li>4.3. Supporting beam (BO 30.5)<br/>
It is designed for connecting the single units (MP 20.5, MP 20.4), and also forms a short lever arm between the radial plates (PR7, PR9).</li><li>4.4. Supporting beam (BO 15.5)<br/>
It is designed for connecting the single units (MP 20.4), and also is used for fastening the single unit (MP 20.5) to the radial plates (PR7, PR9).</li></ul></li><li>5. Hardware
<ul><li>5.1. Stabilizing screw (SSH 25, SSH 20)<br/>
It is used to fix reconstruction plates. Due to a fragment with metric thread, it makes an integral unit with the plate with the maximum rigidity.</li><li>5.2. Screw for fixation of VF plates<br/>
It is used for connecting the reconstruction plate when it is needed to increase plate thickness in the area of increased load, or when the area of fixation must be expanded.</li><li>5.3. Screw<br/>
