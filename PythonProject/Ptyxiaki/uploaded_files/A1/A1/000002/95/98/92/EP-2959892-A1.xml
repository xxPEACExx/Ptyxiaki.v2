When a conventional drug product containing such an ingredient is orally administered, the ingredient cannot fully exhibit a pharmaceutical effect of interest, due to degradation by gastric acid or the like.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Meanwhile, in the case of a therapeutic agent for an inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, a medicinal ingredient is preferably released in the intestinal tract; i.e., in an affected organ. One form of the pharmaceutical formulation containing such a medicinal ingredient is an enteric drug product, such as an enteric coated tablet.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Specifically, 5-aminosalicylic acid (mesalazine) and salazosulfapyridine, which are therapeutic ingredients for inflammatory bowel diseases, are commercially marketed in various dosage forms such as an enteric drug product, an<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> enema agent, and a suppository, and are widely used for the relevant therapy. Among such formulations, an enteric coated tablet is most generally used, by virtue of excellent oral availability, portability, ease of quality control, etc. Examples of such commercially available enteric coated tablet products include an enteric coated tablet which is dissolved in the second fluid for dissolution test (pH: 6.8) of the Japanese Pharmacopoeia and an enteric coated tablet which is dissolved at pH 7 or higher. Among them, an enteric coated tablet which is designed to be dissolved at pH 7 or higher is particularly useful for colonic diseases, since the tablet releases a medicinal ingredient when it has reached the lower gastrointestinal tract (from terminal ileum to colon); i.e., an affected organ.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Polaprezinc, which exhibits gastric mucosa protecting effect and cell protecting effect, has already been used as therapeutic drugs for gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer. Recently, research has been conducted to use the drug as an enema for ulcerative colitis and disorder of the rectal mucosa (Non-patent Documents 1 to 4). In a enema therapy of polaprezinc, an endoscopically significant improvement was observed only in a region where the enema had reached. Thus, it is obviously difficult for conventional oral administration drug products to reach a lower part of the colon. Accordingly, for effective treatment of ulcerative colitis and disorder of the rectal mucosa through use of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> polaprezinc, an enteric coated tablet of a large size which reaches the colon without fail and sufficiently acts on an affected area has been demanded from the viewpoint of drug compliance.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Another technique in relation to an enteric coating has also been reported.

Therefore, a tablet containing a unit dose of 5-aminosalicylic acid is desired. However, when a huge enteric coated tablet containing a medicinal ingredient in a large amount and having enough impact resistance is manufactured, the thickness of the enteric coating layer must be increased. In this case, drug release is problematically delayed. In contrast, when the thickness of the coating layer or the amount of diluent is reduced, acid resistance is poor, and impact resistance is impaired, which is problematic.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Under such circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide an enteric coated tablet containing a large amount of medicinal ingredient and having sufficient impact resistance, without forming a thick enteric coating. Means for Solving the Problems</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present inventors previously conducted extensive studies on the relationship between the composition of the coating, and the enteric property and impact resistance of an enteric coated tablet containing a large amount of active ingredient. As a result, when referring to Patent Documents 1 and 2, a large number of tablets were broken during a coating process of double enteric layers; and a coating process of triple layers for improving impact resistance made the steps cumbersome and prolonged the processing time. Thus, these techniques were difficult to apply for the industrial<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> production of huge tablets, from technical and economical viewpoints. Furthermore, each enteric coating layer must be appropriately controlled in coating process, making control of enteric properties difficult. Under such circumstances, the present inventors have conducted further studies, and have found that, by providing a double layer coated tablet including a water-soluble polymer coating layer and an enteric coating layer, with the water-soluble polymer coating layer serving as an inner layer, and regulating the total amount and each amount of two coating layers within specific ranges, both consistent drug release characteristics in the lower gastrointestinal tract and high impact resistance can be attained. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Accordingly, the present invention provides the following [1] to [10]:
