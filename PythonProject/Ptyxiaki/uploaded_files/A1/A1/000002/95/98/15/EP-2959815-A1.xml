In particular, it relates to a washable and re-usable essentially dry substrate comprising a cleaning composition, which can be wetted just prior to its use. The invention also relates to particular executions for the substrate as well as for the cleaning composition and to a kit of a substrate loaded with a cleaning composition. The invention further relates to a method for loading a washable and reusable substrate with a cleaning composition.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>Background</u></b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">For surface cleaning it has long been a desire to combine cleaning compositions, such as detergents or scouring fluids, with a substrate, such that a user does not need to add such a composition for easing the work and/or optimizing the amount of used compositions. The prior art as well as commercial products show two main approaches.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A first approach employs one-time usage substrates, which may be of particular composition, such as micro-fibres, or may be particularly treated, such as antistatically. They may also comprise additives, such as cleaning compositions, and are delivered to the user in a dry or in a wet state. It is also known to deliver essentially dry ("dry to the touch") substrates, which can be wetted, such as with water, for the cleaning. Upon cleaning, the substrate is loaded with dirt, and discarded once the additive is exhausted and/or the dirt level reaches a critical level.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Such systems not only have the disadvantage that they are inefficient in the use of substrate, which is undesirable both from an economical as well as an ecological point of view. Also, such systems require special precautions with regard to storing and distributing the substrates, particularly if these are wet and thusly are prone to microbial contamination.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2047397A"><text>JP-A-2 047 397</text></patcit> relates to paper containing soap in its fibre tissues. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US4935158A"><text>US4935158</text></patcit> describes a (non-washable) cleaning pad comprising a solid detergent cleaning composition, which is reusable by means of a slow release of the active agent constituents.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The other conventional approach employs re-usable substrates, which are washed and dried and delivered to the cleaning location. There, they may be used as such, as well known for microfiber substrates. Alternatively, a cleaning liquor is prepared, often by adding a cleaning composition to water such as in a bucket with a squeezing insert. A further alternative uses cleaning implements which comprise a dosing unit, such as may be fixed to the handle of the cleaning implement, and which is used to deliver the cleaning liquor to the cleaning surface or substrate.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Such systems typically require that the cleaning liquor is prepared at the cleaning location, which often results in misdosage of the cleaning composition and/or of the water, which may result in unsatisfactory cleaning results, such as poor dirty pick-up and/or streaking, and which, in the case of overdosing, may deteriorate economics. In particular for professional cleaning, the use of larger containers for the cleaning composition may lead to complications in the logistics chain or on site. Further a significant portion of the cleaning composition is discarded with the cleaning liquor after use.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP0153146A"><text>EP-A-0 153 146</text></patcit> relates to an article suitable for wiping surfaces including a substrate which can carry the detergent that is delivered to the surface during wiping. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US4014808A"><text>US-A-4014808</text></patcit> describes a detergent formulation useful in aqueous working solution for the treatment of soiled floor surfaces. Other wiping articles and the like have been described, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="GB1522759A"><text>GB No. 1 522 759</text></patcit> (Airwick); <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="EP66463A"><text>EP 66 463A</text></patcit> (Unilever); <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="EP68830A"><text>EP No. 68 830A</text></patcit> (Unilever); <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="GB1326080A"><text>GB No. 1 326 080</text></patcit> (Freudenberg); and <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="GB1304375L"><text>GB No. 1 304 375</text></patcit> (L'Oreal). Therein, the active material (liquid or solid but usually liquid) is generally encapsulated or compartmented in some way and can be released only by the application of some stimulus, for example, squeezing, rubbing or wetting.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="WO2004046302A"><text>WO2004/046302</text></patcit>, a wiping article for cleaning surfaces, such as of dishes, is disclosed, which comprises a surfactant, a water-soluble thickening polymer, preferably modified cellulose and a solid water-transfer agent.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">However, there is still a need for providing improved for providing washable and re-usable substrates, which are essentially dry and which are preloaded with a cleaning composition for being wetted upon use. Also, there is no disclosure of loading a washable substrate with a cleaning composition during or after washing and subsequently storing and/or transporting it in a dry state to the cleaning location.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Thus, in one aspect the present invention addresses the remaining problems by providing a re-usable and washable substrate, which has been loaded with suitable cleaning substances but which can be stored and transported in an essentially dry state. In another<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> aspect, the present invention relates to the method of preparing such a loaded, essentially dry substrate.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Detailed description</u></b></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present invention is directed towards cleaning of surfaces, often flat and/or hard surfaces, such as floors or windows and the like though it may be used for other purposes. A typical application relates to the cleaning of floors by using mop-like structures. To this end, the present invention is directed towards a cleaning composition which, in combination with a cleaning substrate and a cleaning carrier (such as water), can be used for wet cleaning of surfaces, such as a floor. It is an important element of the present invention, that the cleaning substrate is re-useable. After the cleaning, the dirt loaded substrate can be washed by means of a washing composition and a liquid washing carrier and re-loaded with the cleaning composition. Preferably, though not necessarily, the washing and the loading step are performed in the same location and even more preferably in the same process, such as in the same machine. After the washing and loading step, the loaded substrate is dried and can be stored and/or be transported to the cleaning location in the dry state, where it is wetted by the user with a liquid cleaning carrier for wet cleaning.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">A substrate is a porous material, typically a fibrous web or pad, exhibiting a thickness or z-dimension / direction and a length (x-) and width (y-) dimension / direction. Though less preferred, the substrate may be in the form of a sponge or of a bundle of yarns of typically more than 5 cm and less than 50 cm, fixed together at one end to a handle and loose at the other. In a preferred execution the substrate may be produced in the form of an essentially endless web and cut into shape to form a substrate pad. The substrate web may be produced by various well known methods, such as by being formed as a nonwoven material, knitted or by yarns attached - such as by stitching - to a base material. Optionally, and often preferably, the yarn may be looped and/or twisted. Such a cleaning pad as may be used for floor cleaning may have a width of from 0.25 m to 1.6 m or even more, and a length of from 0.02 m or 0.05 m to about 0.4 or 0.5 m, its thickness may range from 3 mm or 5 mm to over 30 mm, or even 50 mm. The pad may be rectangularly shaped in its x-y-dimension, often it is trapezoidally shaped. The substrate web or pad may comprise one or more zones, such as parallel stripes made of polyester and a polyester-polyamide composite respectively. The substrate may be used as such or it may be adapted to be connected to a pad- or substrate-holder by any conventional means.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The term cleaning composition relates to materials useful for the surface cleaning process, such as for the cleaning of floors. Such cleaning compositions may be applied to<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the surfaces by means of the substrate supported by a liquid cleaning carrier, such that a substrate comprising cleaning liquor, comprising the cleaning composition and the cleaning carrier, removes the dirt from the surface whilst leaving some cleaning liquor on the surface. In the most preferred execution of the present invention, such a cleaning carrier is water. Optionally, the cleaning composition may comprise additives, such as perfumes.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The term "compound" generally refers to chemically essentially identically behaving materials, such as can be described by a chemical name. The term "composition" generally refers to at least one but typically more than one compound. The term "carrier" refers to typically liquid matters containing compounds or compositions, which are dissolved or suspended therein.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The term "liquid" refers to substances, which are liquid at normal use and storage conditions, i.e. ambient conditions of between 0°C and 30°, typically at 22°C, in particular, if the composition comprises meltable compounds, such as waxes. A liquid may comprise a carrier, such as water or solvents, dissolved substances, or dispersed substances, such as colloids or dispersions.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The term washing composition relates to substances as may suitably be used for the washing of the dirt loaded substrates in a liquid washing carrier, such as water or solvents, such as liquefied CO<sub>2</sub>, in the case of dry-cleaning. The washing liquor comprises the washing composition and the washing carrier.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The term "impregnating" applies to the loading of the substrate with the cleaning composition. Preferably the substrate is treated with an impregnating aid. As is discussed in more detail herein below, the impregnating aid may be added in different forms at different stages of the process. Without wishing to be bound by the theory, it is believed, that the impregnating aid modifies the surface properties of the substrate and thusly enhances the deposition and/or retention of the cleaning composition in or on the surface of the substrate.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The term impregnating composition is used for substances, which are applied to the washed substrate, and which comprise the cleaning composition, typically though not necessarily in a fluid impregnating carrier, impregnating aids, a pH adjustment, and optionally other additives. At least the cleaning composition of the impregnating composition is intended to be deposited in or on the surface of the substrate so as to be available for the cleaning step. Often, the impregnating carrier is applied as a liquid, such as water or solvents. The impregnating liquor comprises the impregnating composition, which comprises the cleaning composition, and may further comprise a liquid<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> impregnating carrier, optionally an impregnating aid, and optionally other additives. The impregnating of the substrate is preferably executed in a separate process step after the washing process, such as when the substrate, for economic reasons preferably not fully dried, is impregnated with the impregnating liquor comprising the impregnating composition and optionally impregnating carrier. Particularly if the impregnating composition is in a liquid state, it may be applied as such without the use of an impregnating carrier. Thus the substrate is loaded in an impregnating step with cleaning composition by depositing the cleaning composition on the substrate such as by adding cleaning composition to the substrate in a post-washing step, such as - in analogy to adding a fabric conditioner - by impregnating the substrate with a cleaning liquor. Within the context of the present invention, at least some of the cleaning composition is adhered to or immobilized in or on the surface of the substrate. This refers to the condition that the cleaning composition is retained in the substrate under normal handling, such as may be assessed by a shake out test. This immobilization of the cleaning composition should however be non-permanent so as to allow the release of the cleaning composition upon contact with the cleaning carrier. Henceforth, it is desirable to not irreversibly adhere the cleaning composition to the substrate such as by covalent bonding.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The term "drying" refers in the general meaning to the removal of excess liquid carrier from the substrate, which may be achieved mechanically (like draining, wringing, squeezing, spinning, pressing, mangling, calendering) or in the more specific meaning of the term thermally, or by a combination thereof. The term "thermal drying" includes drying under ambient conditions, such as by evaporation of the liquid into the ambient air. During the drying step, other processes may occur simultaneously, such as an improvement of the immobilization of the cleaning composition in or on the surface of the substrate by the increased temperatures, though care should be taken to not irreversibly bond too much of the cleaning composition to the substrate..</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Without wishing to be bound by the theory, it is believed, that particular compounds as may be selected for the cleaning composition and combining these with an impregnating aid as well as employing particular components used for the washing composition enable relatively high amounts of cleaning composition on a substrate.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>Loaded dry Substrate</u></b></heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">In a first aspect, the present invention relates to an essentially dry washable and re-usable substrate loaded with cleaning composition.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Substrates useful in the present invention can be selected from a broad range of materials. Whilst conventional substrates can conveniently be employed, preferred executions are<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> selected for or adapted to provide good adhesion of the cleaning composition to the substrate or to portions or regions of the substrate. Thus, a preferred substrate comprises materials which are selected for or adapted to the specific properties of the compositions - in particular the cleaning composition - and carriers - in particular the impregnating carrier and the cleaning carrier. The substrate may also be selected as to its ability to absorb or retain cleaning or impregnating carrier. The substrate may be made out of fibres or other materials, which do not absorb liquids upon being in contact therewith, such as is typically the case with synthetic polymeric material, such as polyester, polyamide, or polypropylene etc. The substrate may also comprise fibres which swell upon contact with liquids, such as cotton fibres or yarns, or cellulosed based materials such a treated or untreated cellulose fibres or rayon / viscose fibres and the like. In a preferred execution, the structure comprises materials like polyester, polyamide, or cellulosic based materials like cotton, or Rayon/Viscose. Less preferred materials, such as, polypropylene, polyethylene, or wool may be treated, such as by surface treatment, or by being used in combination with other materials such as resin incorporated additives to improve properties.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">A substrate can be a homogeneous material, i.e. consisting essentially of the same composition and exhibiting essentially constant properties throughout its thickness (z-direction) and length (x-direction) and width (z-) direction, whereby the latter two are typically larger than the thickness and will typically be employed so as to be in contact with the cleaning surface. Typically, however, the substrate will be a composite material. Such a composite material may be a layered structure i.e. comprising a z-directional arrangement of different zones exhibiting different properties, such as may be achieved by layering different materials. It may also be a regioned structure, i.e. by comprising x-and/or y directional arrangement of different regions exhibiting different properties. Further, it can be a combination of both, e.g. a regioned structure being enveloped by a layer of a different material. The transition between the regions can be gradual, such as may be the case, if one and the same material has been treated by chemical or physical processes in different regions, or it can be a discontinuity, such as by positioning different materials next to each other. If various zones or regions are compared by their properties, such as composition, surface properties, or loading, the volume for such comparisons should not be less than about 125 mm<sup>3</sup> or not less than about 5 mm in each dimension or the area, where applicable. If the variation is across a volume or area smaller than this, the characteristics are to be averaged across such a volume.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The substrate exhibits a macroscopic surface such as may be optimized to be in contact<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> with the cleaned surface, and thus may be essentially flat. However, a substrate may often exhibit a varying thickness, e.g. when stripes of different materials are employed. In particular when the substrate comprises looped yarns, the substrate has an internal surface as created by the surface of the yarns and fibres, which may be significantly higher than the macroscopic one.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">When a cleaning composition is immobilized in or on the surface of the substrate, this refers to the fact, that essentially solid cleaning composition is distributed within or on the substrate, i.e. immobilized on any of the described surfaces and/or may be trapped between or within the substrate structures such as fibres or yarns.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">An important requirement, which the substrate has to satisfy, is its washability, i.e. it does essentially not disintegrate upon wetting with liquids, such as the carriers described above, such as water, preferably in conventional washing or cleaning machines of the "household" or of the "industrial" type. Further, it has to be re-useable, i.e. can be used and washed multiple times or even essentially endlessly.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A substrate according to the present invention is loaded with the cleaning composition by comprising at least 1 weight-%, preferably more than 5 weight-%, more preferably more than 20weight-% and most preferably more than 40weight-%, based on the dry weight of the substrate, as may be determined as described herein below. If the substrate is a composite zoned or regioned material, at least one of the zones or regions should satisfy the loading requirement.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The cleaning composition is preferably released readily but not too quickly from the substrate upon being in contact with the cleaning carrier, as can be assessed by the surfactant release method as described herein below.

Within the present context, "essentially dry" means, that it has to be "dry to the touch" but also, that it can be stored over an extended period between the washing and preparation and the use without requiring particular attention with regard to storage and/or packaging in view of the liquid level contained therein. Thus, a substrate according to the present invention comprises less than 15 %, preferably less than 10%, and more preferably less than 5 % of a liquid impregnating carrier and other liquid components of the impregnating liquor, based on the weight of the total weight of the loaded substrate.

Preferred impregnating aids may be poly-electrolytes and especially anionic poly-electrolytes. Anionic poly-electrolytes comprise anionic groups such as hydroxyl-, carboxylate-, sulfate-, and sulfonate- groups. These groups may be combined with a polymeric backbone, such as polymers of olefinically unsaturated compounds, such as being based on acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, or derivatives of sulfonic acid, such as allyl sulfonic acid, or vinyl sulfonic acid. The polymeric backbone may also be based on polyester. Such poly-electrolytes may be employed partially or completely neutralized or in their protonized form.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Preferred poly-electrolytes are sodium carboxy methylcellulose (CMC), sodium poly-styrolsulfonate, or acrylic amide / acrylic acid co-polymers or mixtures thereof.

Carriers on an aqueous basis may optionally comprise non-aqueous components such as alcohols, or a carrier may be on a non-aqueous base, such as oils. Preferably, the carriers are in a liquid state at room temperature but also during the temperatures of the washing, loading and drying cycle, i.e. up to about 90°C. Preferably, the carriers are sufficiently volatile to allow drying, but not too volatile to allow reasonably long cleaning episodes. Carriers should not be harmful to people and / or environment.

Other odour compounds like perfumes or fragrances may also camouflage an unpleasant smell or just add pleasantly smelling compounds. Any of these odour compounds should be selected and applied such that there is minimal loss in subsequent process steps. Thus they may be added as dry or micro-encapsulated ingredients to the substrate after this has been loaded with the cleaning composition and has been partly or completely dried.
