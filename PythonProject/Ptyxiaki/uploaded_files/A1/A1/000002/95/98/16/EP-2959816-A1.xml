The vacuum cleaner having such a traditional structure has the following problems:</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">When the vacuum cleaner is in operation, the motor in the internal motor cover rotates at a high speed, thus making the internal motor cover vibrate, and then the internal motor cover drives the external motor cover connected in contact therewith to vibrate; besides, in the process of vibration transmission, due to the resonance effect, the amount of vibration transferred to the external motor cover and the vacuum cleaner housing is great, which makes the entire vacuum cleaner noisy; when a user contacts the outer surface of the vacuum cleaner by hand, there is also a "numb" feeling of hand, weakening the user experience. However, there is no innovative solution for reducing vibration of the conventional vacuum cleaner, with the effect not greatly improved.</p><heading id="h0003">CONTENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">A purpose of the present invention is as follows: In order to solve the above problems, a vacuum cleaner having motor damping structure is provided, capable of weakening resonance of the entire machine caused by high speed rotation of the motor and reducing the vibration noise caused by resonance of the entire machine.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A technical solution of the present invention is as follows: A vacuum cleaner having motor damping structure, whose internal motor cover is hung and fixed inside an external motor cover through a cantilever.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Preferably, a hanging hole, formed on the external motor cover, is provided inside with a damping medium with a vertical through hole, the cantilever being hung at the vertical through hole of the damping medium.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Preferably, the cantilever comprises a connecting pin inserted into the vertical through hole of the damping medium, a support plate supported above the damping medium, and a screw for fixedly connecting the connecting pin to the support plate, wherein the connecting pin is integrally connected at its bottom with the internal motor cover. Preferably, the damping medium is made of a sponge, rubber or a spring. Preferably, there is one or more cantilevers.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Preferably, there are four cantilevers.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention has the following advantages: In this vacuum cleaner of the present invention, the internal motor cover used for mounting the motor is hung and fixed inside the external motor cover, and completely isolated from the external motor cover; besides, a damping medium is disposed at a suspension point of the internal motor cover and external motor cover, thus blocking the path of transmission of the motor vibration from the internal motor cover to the vacuum cleaner housing and reducing the amount of vibration transferred from the internal motor cover to the external motor cover, making the resonance phenomenon between the external motor cover and the internal motor cover disappear; in operation, the internal motor cover vibrates independently in the external motor cover with little effect on the external motor cover, which makes the vibration amplitude of the vacuum cleaner housing reduced greatly, thereby reducing the vibration noise of the vacuum cleaner in operation; besides, when a user's hand contacts the outer surface of the vacuum cleaner, the numb feeling of hand is weakened greatly or even disappears, enhancing the user experience.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention will be further described below with reference to drawings and examples.

The specific structure is as follows:
<ul><li>A hanging hole 4, formed on the external motor cover 3, is provided inside with a damping medium 5 with a vertical through hole (not shown in the drawing); the cantilever 2, hung at the vertical through hole of the damping medium 5, is in no direct contact with and completely isolated from the external motor cover 3; and the entire internal motor cover 1 is completely isolated from and in no direct contact with the external motor cover 3. The damping medium 5 can be made of a sponge, and certainly can also be made of other flexible materials such as rubber and a spring.</li></ul></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In this example, the detailed structure of the cantilever 2 may be as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>: The cantilever 2 is composed of a connecting pin 21 inserted into the vertical through hole of the damping medium 5, a support plate 22 supported above the damping medium 5, and a screw 23 for fixedly connecting the connecting pin 21 to the support plate 22, wherein the connecting pin 21 is integrally connected at its bottom with the internal motor cover 1, i.e., the connecting pin 21 is formed integrally with the internal motor cover 1. The support plate 22 is provided with a vertical mounting through hole, and the connecting pin 21 is provided with a vertical threaded hole. While assembling, first making the connecting pin 21 go from bottom to top into the vertical through hole of the damping medium 5, then placing the support plate 22 horizontally above the damping medium 5, making the mounting through hole in the support plate 22 aligned with the threaded hole in the connecting pin 21, and then screwing the screw 23 from top to bottom into the threaded hole in the connecting pin 21, thus making the connecting pin 21 fixedly connected together with the support plate 22, the support plate 22 being supported above the damping medium 5 and pulling the hung internal motor cover 1 to prevent it from falling down.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In order to ensure the connecting strength between the internal motor cover 1 and the external motor cover 3 as well as prevent the internal motor cover 1 from shaking substantially in the external motor cover 3, two or more cantilevers 2 are generally provided, there being totally four cantilevers 2 in this example. Certainly, we can also set one cantilever 2.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">When the vacuum cleaner is in operation, the motor 6 runs to drive the internal motor cover 1 to vibrate; the vibration of the internal motor cover 1 can be released in the presence of the damping medium 5 of a soft material, and the internal motor cover 1 is completely isolated from the external motor cover 3, which effectively reduce the effect of transmission of the vibration produced by the internal motor cover 1 to the external motor cover 3, and<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> make the vibration amplitude of the external motor cover 3 extremely small or even be zero, further reducing the amount of vibration of the vacuum cleaner housing 7, weakening the vibration noise caused by resonance of the entire machine resulted from high speed rotation of the motor, thus there being no "numb" feeling of hand any more when a hand is in contact with the outer surface of the vacuum cleaner housing 7.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Certainly, the above example is used only for explaining the technical concept and characteristics of the present invention. It is provided to make people understand the present invention and implement it, rather than limit the scope of protection thereof. Any equivalent alteration or modification made according to the spiritual essence of the main technical solution of the present invention should fall within the scope of protection of the present invention.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90460316" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A vacuum cleaner having motor damping structure, <b>characterized in that</b>: an internal motor cover (1) is hung and fixed inside an external motor cover (3) through a cantilever (2).</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0002" num="0002"><claim-text>The vacuum cleaner having motor damping structure according to claim 1, wherein a hanging hole (4), formed on the external motor cover (3), is provided inside with a damping medium (5) with a vertical through hole, the cantilever (2) being hung at the vertical through hole of the damping medium (5).</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0003" num="0003"><claim-text>The vacuum cleaner having motor damping structure according to claim 2, wherein the cantilever (2) is composed of a connecting pin (21) inserted into the vertical through hole of the damping medium (5), a support plate (22) supported above the damping medium (5), and a screw (23) for fixedly connecting the connecting pin (21) to the support plate (22), wherein the connecting pin (21) is integrally connected at its bottom with the internal motor cover (1).</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0004" num="0004"><claim-text>The vacuum cleaner having motor damping structure according to claim 2, wherein the damping medium (5) is made of a sponge, rubber or a spring.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0005" num="0005"><claim-text>The vacuum cleaner having motor damping structure according to claim 1, wherein there is one or more cantilevers (2).</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0006" num="0006"><claim-text>The vacuum cleaner having motor damping structure according to claim 5, wherein there are four cantilevers (2).</claim-text></claim></claims><drawings mxw-id="PDW20422988" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --><figure id="f0001" num="1"><img id="if0001" file="imgf0001.tif" wi="165" he="225" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --><figure id="f0002" num="2"><img id="if0002" file="imgf0002.tif" wi="157" he="187" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><search-report-data><doc-page id="srep0001" file="srep0001.tif" wi="157" he="233" type="tif"/><doc-page id="srep0002" file="srep0002.tif" wi="157" he="233" type="tif"/></search-report-data><copyright>User acknowledges that Fairview Research LLC and its third party providers retain all right, title and interest in and to this xml under applicable copyright laws.
