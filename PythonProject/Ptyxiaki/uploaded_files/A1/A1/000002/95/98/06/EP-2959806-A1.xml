These seasonal lights generally use two-wire conductors to provide power to each of the light bulbs on a particular strand. Since insulation covers the entire length of the wire and plug, risk of shock is minimal so grounding is not a major issue.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Further, artificial pre-lighted Christmas trees, where the seasonal lights are incorporated on or with the tree, have become a popular alternative to both live trees and unlighted artificial trees. These trees are usually sectional for easy storage, with some lighted trees routing power for the lights up through the trunk of the tree with electrical connectors built into the ends of each tree section to distribute power to each section. This mechanism, although convenient, brings with it the risk of exposed conductors at every electrical junction. If these exposed wires accidentally make contact with any other portion of the artificial tree, there is a risk of electric shock and other undesirable electrical dangers (e.g., fire).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Therefore, there is a need in the art for a lighted artificial Christmas tree with a 3-wire safety ground and electrical connectors which prevent electric shock when the contacts are accidentally touched. These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> explained and will become obvious to one skilled in the art through the summary of the invention that follows.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an artificial lighted tree with power routed through a hollow trunk and three-wire electrical grounding, where the trunk itself is conductive and grounded.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is also an object of the present invention to provide an artificial lighted tree where the trunk is divided into sections and safety electrical connectors at the end of each section prevent power from being connected to the exposed contacts at the top end of any trunk section until the bottom end of another trunk section is connected to it.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a multi-conductor system in the artificial lighted tree which is capable of carrying a variety of different voltages allowing for different types of lights to be used on the same tree.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a lighted artificial tree comprising a base configured to receive and hold a trunk.

Specifically, embodiments of the present invention provide for a decorative lighted Christmas tree with power routed through the trunk of the tree and three-wire safety grounding. The tree is divided into sections for easy assembly, disassembly, and storage. Safety electrical contacts at the ends of each section are not powered until the sections are assembled. The tree can also accommodate multiple lighting circuits utilizing different voltages simultaneously.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to an embodiment of the present invention, <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> shows an artificial lighted tree 100 comprising two primary parts: a base 101 and a trunk 102. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the trunk and base may be attached to each other by a variety of means. Examples of attachment means include, but are not limited to, welding, screws, bolts, adhesives, or the trunk may merely be held upright by the base while resting on a surface. The trunk 102 is preferably electrically conductive or has an electrically conductive wall, but it may also be made of an electrically insulating material to alleviate the need to ground the trunk itself. To reduce the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> risk of electric shock, the tree 100 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is safety grounded using a third wire that goes the third hole in a grounded power outlet. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, according to one embodiment of the present invention, grounding is accomplished by electrically connecting the neutral wire 103 to the ground wire 104 by attaching them both to the conductive trunk 102 of the tree 100. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize there are a variety of ways to achieve proper grounding. The neutral wire 103 and the hot wire 108 then run up the inside of the trunk routing power to lights that decorate the tree. One or ordinary skill in the art would recognize that wires are not necessary, and any conductor can be used, including, but not limited to, printed circuits, conductive paints, conductive liquids, or ionized gases. Embodiments of the present invention may incorporate one or more of these conductors in lieu of or in conjunction with the wires.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> also shows a side electrical connector 107 which provides access to the hot wire 108 and neutral wire 103 inside the trunk 102 from outside the trunk 102. The side electrical connector 107 may be as simple as a wire, electrically connected to the wires inside the tree 108, 104, and merely passing through a hole in the trunk 102 to the lights on the tree, or it may be a complex detachable multi-conductor connector as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, described later in this specification.

The branch attachment means 105 may permanently secure the branches to the tree or the branches may be removable. If the branches are permanently attached to the tree, they may be hinged 106 to allow the branches to fold upward for compact storage. Branch attachment means 105 may include, but are not limited to, screw fittings, snap fittings, hinged fittings, or any combination thereof.

According to an embodiment of the present invention, each trunk section has a male safety connector 203 in one end and a female safety connector 204 in the other end, allowing the trunk sections 202 to be assembled in any order. It is important to note that female electrical connectors and male electrical connectors are merely two connectors that connect to each other. Neither connector needs to be unambiguously anatomically male or female. So long as the connectors connect to each other, one may be accurately considered male and the other female. The trunk sections 202 need not all be of the same length. The male and female safety connectors 203, 204 are described in greater detail later in <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004">Fig. 3A-3E</figref>. The wires 205 connect the male safety connector 203 to the female safety connector 204, routing power to the side connectors 206 and the next trunk section.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">According to an embodiment of the present invention, The ground connection 208 is made in the base 201 itself which and incorporates a female safety connector 204 to allow any trunk section 202 to connect to the base 201.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a foot pedal 209 can be connected in line with the power cord to control the lighting of the tree. In other embodiments, the control of the lighting of the tree may be controlled by one or more control elements, such as a switch, a selector knob, an indicator panel, or any other human interface device (HID) or any combination<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> thereof.

This divider harness 206 allows power to be branched off to various side electrical connectors 207 and between the male safety connector 203 and the female safety connector 204. Alternatively, the divider harness 206 may enable the use of a plurality of circuits running at different voltages incorporated into the tree 200. With multiple circuits running through independent conductors, the user has the option of using both AC and DC voltages and a variety of different voltage levels simultaneously, including but not limited to 3VDC, 5VDC, 12VDC, 24VDC, 36VDC, 120VAC, 230VAC, 50Hz AC, or 60Hz AC. When using multiple independent circuits, the divider harness 206 serves the function of routing the correct wires to the correct side electrical connectors 207 and between the male safety connector 203, and female safety connector 204. A multi-conductor safety connector will now be explained, referring to <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">Fig. 3A-3C</figref>.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3A</figref> shows the cutaway side view of the male electrical connector 301 and female electrical connector 302 components of the multi-conductor safety connector. The mechanics of the safety connector will now be explained. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the male electrical connector 301 contains a common center male contact terminal 303 and multiple side male contact terminals 304. These terminals 303, 304 are embedded in or attached to a male insulator 306. These terminals 303, 304 pass through the male insulator 306 and fold over to rest against the top surface of the male insulator 306, securing them in place and providing a larger contact surface for the outgoing wires 305, 313 to make electrical contact. A male wire insulator 307 has outgoing wires 305, 313 passing through L-shaped holes. When the male wire insulator 307 is fastened to the male terminal insulator 306 with screws 308, the ledge formed by the L-shaped hole presses the exposed tip of the outgoing center wire 305 against the top end of the center male contact terminal 303 and the outgoing side wires 313 against the top end of the side male contact terminals 304, creating electrical connections. Optionally, the wires<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> 305, 313 may be soldered to the top ends of the terminals 303, 304. The bottom ends of the contact terminals 303, 304 will make contact with corresponding conductors (i.e., movable side safety contacts 317, movable center safety contact 318) on the female safety connector 302. The male connector is held together with screws and attached inside the trunk body 300 by securing indentations 321. Alternatively, the male safety connector 301 may be formed as a single piece with no screws, or as a snap-together assembly. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize there are a variety of ways to form both the male 301 and female safety connectors 302.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Referring now to the female electrical connector 302 in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3A</figref>, a fixed center terminal 309 is soldered to an incoming center wire 311 or held in electrical contact with an incoming center wire 311 by the female wire insulator 312. The incoming side wires 314 pass through the female wire insulator 312 and into the female terminal insulator 315, where they make an electrical connection, with or without soldering, with the fixed side terminals 310 embedded in the female terminal insulator 315. These fixed side terminals 310 and fixed center terminal 309 are folded in a hook shape with the ends embedded in the insulators 312, 315, exposing contact surfaces to air spaces 316. The fixed side terminals 310 and fixed center terminal 309 are situated in close proximity to the corresponding movable side safety contacts 317 and movable center safety contact 318 respectively.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">According to an embodiment of the present invention, one end of the movable center safety contact 318 is fixed to the female wire insulator 312, and the other end hangs free, extending into an air space 316 in the female terminal insulator 315 above it. The free-hanging end is exposed to the open air, but recessed into the air space 316 in the exposed surface of the female terminal insulator 315. The movable center safety contact 318 is made of a resilient flexible conductor which bends under force and returns to its original position when the force is removed. When the male safety connector 301 connects to the female safety connector 302, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3B</figref>, the center male contact terminal 303 presses against the movable center safety contact 318, moving the free hanging end into electrical contact with the fixed center terminal 309.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Both the movable center safety contact 318 and the movable side safety contact need to be pressed down at the same time in order to complete the circuit and make a connection which provides for safety from most accidental insertion of foreign bodies into the female socket.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The movable side safety contacts 317 are arranged corresponding to their fixed side terminals 310 in much the same manner as described above. One end of each movable side safety contact 317 is fixed in place and held between the safety terminal insulator 319 and the female securing insulator 320. The other end floats freely, exposed in the adjacent air space 316. The entire female safety connector 302 assembly is held together with screw 308 and attached inside the trunk body 300 by securing indentations 321. Because the movable contacts 317, 318 are not in electrical contact with anything, they can be safely touched even when the trunk section 202 is powered. Looking now at <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3B</figref>, when the trunk sections 202 are assembled, the movable contacts 317, 318 are pressed into a position of electrical contact with the fixed terminals 309, 310, passing power safely to the next trunk section.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">According to an embodiment of the present invention, in order to prevent the male safety connector 301 being inserted too far, a limiting collar 325 is attached to the trunk body 300 at the appropriate distance. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3B</figref>, when the safety connector is connected, this limiting collar, abuts the trunk body 300 of the other trunk section and prevents excess insertion.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig 3C</figref> shows the bottom view of the male safety connector 301, and the top view of the female safety connector 302. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the side terminals 304, 310 are arranged symmetrically and each side terminal 304, 310 corresponds to a separate circuit. In order to guarantee that the connectors 301, 302 are mated correctly, a key bar 322 on the body of the trunk section end with the male connector 301 slides into a key slot 323 cut into the body on the trunk section end with the female connector 302. If the key bar 322 and key slot 323 are not aligned, the trunk sections will not slide together. The key bar 322 and key slot 323 are also shown in the cutaway view of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3A-3B</figref>. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the keying mechanism 322, 323 can be arranged in any way either on the trunk body 300 or on the male and female safety connectors 301, 302.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">According to an embodiment of the present invention, it is also possible to have a safety connector without accommodating multiple circuits, as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">Fig 3D-3E</figref>. In <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3D</figref>, the side male contact terminal 304 is a cylindrical ring 324. This cylindrical ring can make contact with the movable side safety contacts 317 of the female safety connector 302 in any rotational orientation. Since rotational orientation is not important in this particular embodiment, there is no need for a keying mechanism in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">Fig. 3D-3E</figref>. Because the movable side safety contacts 317 will both contact the same cylindrical ring 324, the side contacts 317 become redundant, making the connection more reliable and able to accommodate more power.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">According to an embodiment of the present invention depicted in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">Fig. 3D-3E</figref>, the trunk body 300 has bare metal surfaces 326 where the two trunk sections connect. This allows a direct electrical connection to between the conductive walls of the trunk sections when the pieces are fitted together. This not only eliminates the need for a separate grounding pin, as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, but also produces a more reliable ground throughout the entire tree trunk so long as the contact areas are kept clean and free of corrosion. This direct electrical connection can be accomplished in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to a conductive paint, a conductive sleeve, or pattern of conductive traces. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that there are many ways to accomplish this direct electrical connection without departing from the spirit of the present invention.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> shows two-prong male 401 and female 402 connectors mounted inside the trunk sections 400. According to an embodiment of the present invention, a female ground clip 403 and a male ground pin 404 are spot welded 405 to their respective trunk sections. The trunk sections each have a flat side 406 that must be aligned with each other as a keying mechanism to ensure a properly grounded electrical connection. Another embodiment of the two-prong electrical connector incorporated into the tree is depicted in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7B</figref>.

In this particular embodiment of the present invention, the side electrical connector 502 snaps into the trunk body 501 by means of a securing tab 504. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that such a sophisticated connector is not necessary. The task of routing power from inside the tree to outside the tree could also be accomplished with something as simple as a wire, electrically connected to the wires inside the tree 103, 104, and passing through a hole in the trunk body. The connection could be either hard-wired or detachable.

The hot wire also passes through a pushbutton 606 which can be used to turn the lights on and off or control the lighting mode. Although only one fuse is necessary, on the hot wire 602, extension cords that do not have a ground conductor would prevent proper grounding, and the distinction between the hot wire 602 and the neutral wire 603 would become arbitrary.
