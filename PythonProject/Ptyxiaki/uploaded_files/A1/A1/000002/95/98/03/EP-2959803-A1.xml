If the baby goes off its parent care, the baby may confront various dangerous situations.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">More specifically, the baby is hard to support the weight of its head. For this reason, if the head turns around, the air duct may be blocked by a sleeping gear, for example, a blanket, etc. and may be suffocated to danger. The baby is still in a period where its body structure is being developed, and its skull is fixed loose. If the baby stays lay on its one side for a long time, the shape of the head may be easily deformed due to an external pressure.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In addition, when a baby is laid on a flat floor, the head and chest are on a straight line, whereupon<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the baby who has an immature digestive system may have a symptom that eaten food comes out, which means vomiting. In worse case, the baby may be suffocated.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As mentioned above, even though there is a strong need to protect babies who might be in dangerous situation, any special instrument has not been developed so far. In almost cases, the baby is simply cared by its parents, which may result in an over economical burden to its parents.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As an example of the baby seat, there are the US patent publication number <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20070283502A1"><text>US2007/0283502 A1</text></patcit> entitled "mattress incorporating a headrest for preventing and correcting non-synostotic cranial deformities in infants (hereinafter referred to the prior art document 1) and the <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="KR200444768"><text>Korean utility model registration number 20-0444768</text></patcit> entitled "mattress for baby" (hereinafter referred to the prior art document 2).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, the prior art documents 1 and 2 are mainly focusing on the growth of a baby's skull while simply mentioning the prevention of suffocation of a baby. There are not any detailed descriptions on a posture correction for a right growth of a body structure and a prevention of various dangerous situations along with a posture correction.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Disclosure of Invention</u></heading><heading id="h0004"><u>Technical Problem</u></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">Accordingly, the present invention is made to resolve the above-mentioned problems. It is an object of the present invention to provide a baby seat bed wherein any movement of a baby can be prevented, thus previously removing any dangerous situations of suffocation, and a head can be developed into a good shape without any deformation, and a reverse flow of foods can be prevented by correcting the posture of a baby, and the body structure<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> can be grown good, and the baby seat bed can help the baby to have comfortable sleep. The material of the baby seat bed can be light thanks to a compression and formation of the material.</p><heading id="h0005"><u>Solution to Problem</u></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">To achieve the above object, there is provided a baby seat bed which is manufactured integral by compressing and forming an elastic material, comprising a wall part 100; and a support part 200, wherein the wall part 100 is configured to surround the edges of the baby seat bed so as to prevent any movement of the baby in the baby seat bed, and the support part 200 includes a head support part 210 which is formed in a curved groove shape so as to smoothly support the head of the baby; a neck support part 220 which is formed in a curved and protruded shape below the head support part 210 so as to support the neck of the baby; and a back support part 230 which is formed below the neck support part 220 so as to support the back of the baby.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In addition, a leg support part 240 is obliquely formed upward below the back support part 230 so as to support the legs of the baby.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In addition, arm support grooves 110 and 110' are formed in groove shapes at both side ends of the wall part 100 in order for the arms of the baby to hang over.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In addition, a leg support groove 120 is formed in a groove shape below the wall part 100 in order for the legs of the baby to hang over.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In addition, a ventilation grove 300 is formed on the upper surface of each of the wall part 100 and the support part 200.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In addition, the ventilation groove 300 comprises a rim ventilation groove 310 formed on an upper surface of the wall part 100 and configured to surround the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> edges of the bed; and a support part ventilation groove 320 which communicates with the rim ventilation groove 310 and is formed on an upper surface of the support part 200, and the support part ventilation groove 320 comprises a head ventilation groove 321 formed at the head support part 210 of the support part 200; a back ventilation groove 322 formed at the back support part 230; and a leg ventilation groove 323 formed at the leg support part 240.</p><heading id="h0006"><u>Advantageous Effects</u></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">As mentioned above, the baby seat bed according to the present invention is advantageous in the way that any movement of a baby can be prevented with the aid of the provision of a wall part and a support part, thus preventing any dangerous suffocation situation wherein a baby's head turns, and an air duct is blocked.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In addition, an arm support groove is formed, thus preventing an arm-caught phenomenon due to self-weight and an accident wherein an arm contacts with the face.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">A baby's head may not be grown into a flat or asymmetrical shape thanks to the provision of a head support part of a support part, but can be grown in a good shape.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In addition, the posture of a body can be corrected with the aid of the shape of the support part while preventing any suffocation due to the reverse flow of foods.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Air can circulate good using ventilation grooves, thus preventing any skin disease which might occur due to sweat or moisture, and a baby's body temperature can be maintained at a proper level.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In addition, the material is compressed and formed, whereupon the lightness of the member can be obtained.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In addition, the baby does not have a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> complete body structure. For this reason, if the baby lies on a blanket with cushion for a long time, the posture may go wrong, which may have bad effects on a body structure development of a body. The above mentioned problems can be resolved using an elastic material while stably supporting the posture.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The present invention can provide a good posture to a baby when it sleeps, thus helping the baby to have a comfortable sleep.</p><heading id="h0007"><u>Brief Description of Drawings</u></heading><p id="p0024" num="0024"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1A and 1B</figref> are perspective views illustrating a conventional baby seat.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a baby seat bed according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> is a view illustrating a plane configuration, a side configuration and a bottom configuration of a baby seat bed according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating a baby seat bed according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref> is a view illustrating a use state of a baby seat bed according to the present invention.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0008"><u>Modes for carrying out the invention</u></heading><p id="p0025" num="0025">The exemplar embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawing.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1A and 1B</figref> are perspective views illustrating a conventional baby seat. The conventional baby seat is configured in such a way that a baby is laid with its head fixed. Since the bottom surface is formed constant irrespective of each portion of a body, the baby<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> may not have a proper posture, thus causing a reverse flow of foods. The conventional baby seat does not provide any effects to help a proper body structure development.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In addition, the conventional baby seat does not provide any thing to fix arms. To this end, the arm may be caught in under a baby's body or if any pressure applies to a baby's arm, blood circulation may go bad, thus causing the baby to feel uncomfortable.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">Figures 2 to 5</figref>, the baby seat bed M according to the present invention may be manufactured integral by compressing and forming an elastic material and may include a wall part 100 and a support part 200.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The elastic material may be formed of a foamed polyethylene or an EVA foamed material. It is preferred that a woven fabric is laminated on an elastic material and is compressed and formed. To this end, the baby seat bed M can have a predetermined elasticity and a predetermined strength, which allow to correct a posture, thus resolving the problems wherein a body structure development has a bad effect due to the wrong posture.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In addition, referring to the bottom configuration in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, the baby seat bed M may be manufactured in such a way to simultaneously apply pressure to the upper and lower portions during the compression and formation procedure and may be manufactured thinner with a thickness of 15mm to 20mm, thus advantageously obtaining lightness.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The wall part 100 is configured to surround the edges of the bed in an effort to prevent any movements of the baby. To this end, even though the baby moves a lot in the bed, it is possible to prevent the falling of the baby due to a capsize of the bed.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The support part 200 may include a head support part 210 formed in a curved groove shape to support the head of a baby; a neck support part 220 formed in a curved and protruded shape at the bottom of the head<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> support part 210 so as to support the neck of the baby; and a back support part 230 which is formed below the neck support part 220 so as to support the back of the baby.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The head support part 210 allows to primarily fix the baby in place and to assist the head of the baby to form into a good shape, wherein the shape of the head may be easily deformed by external pressure since the skull in immature.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Meanwhile, the neck support part 220 allows to loosen the load which may apply to the neck because of the head while preventing the head and the chest from lying on the straight line, whereby it is possible to prevent the baby whose digestive system is not completely grown from vomiting or suffocating due to the vomiting.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In addition, the back support part 230 may further include a leg support part 240 which is obliquely formed upward below the back support part 230 so as to support baby's legs.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">To this end, referring to <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>, the cross section line of the curved surface connecting the neck support part 220, the back support part 230 and the leg support part 240 allows to support the profile of the body structure by correcting the posture of the baby, thus providing a comfortable sleep to the baby and loosening any economical burden to the parents in terms of nursery care. It is possible to eliminate various dangers, for example, suffocation, capsize, etc. which might occur during the sleeping.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Arm support grooves 110 and 110' may be formed in groove shapes at both side portions of the wall part 100 in order for the arms of the baby to be supported thereon.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Here, the arm support grooves 110 and 110' allow to prevent an arm-caught phenomenon due to self-weight, which looks like an emergency situation that may occur if the arms of the baby are not fixed in place, and an accident wherein the face contacts with the face. With<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> this, it is possible to remove any pressure which may apply to the arms of the baby, thus enhancing a good blood circulation. To this end, the baby can sleep in a comfortable posture.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In addition, below the wall part 100, a leg support groove 120 may be provided, which is formed in a groove shape for the legs of the baby to hang over.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In case of the body of the baby, the center of gravity lies in the upper body. When the baby lies, the legs of the baby naturally stand upward, so the weight of the legs can be supported by the leg support groove 120, which allows the baby to take a comfortable posture.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Meanwhile, a ventilation groove 300 may be formed on the upper surfaces of the wall part 100 and the support part 200.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The ventilation groove 300 allows to circulate air into the portion where the body of the baby contacts with the baby seat bed M, thus preventing any skin disease due to sweat or moisture while maintaining a predetermined body temperature.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The skin of the baby is very keen. If the skin does not contact with external air for a long time, the temperature of the body may increase. If the sweat is not cooled, a skin disease, for example, rash or atopic disease may directly occur.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">At this time, the ventilation groove 300 may include, but is not limited to a rim ventilation groove 310 formed on an upper surface of the wall part 100 while surrounding the edges, and a support part ventilation groove 320 which communicates with the rim ventilation groove 310 and is formed on an upper surface of the support part 200.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Namely, the rim ventilation groove 310 and the support part ventilation groove 310 communicate with each other, thus efficiently guiding the flow of the air.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Meanwhile, the support part ventilation groove 320 may include a head ventilation groove 321 formed<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> at the head support part 210 of the support part 200; a back ventilation part 322 formed at the back support part 230; and a leg ventilation groove 323 formed at the leg support part 240. With these components, it is possible to uniformly circulate air through the body of the baby.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">A simple modification or change of the present invention may be easily implemented by a person having ordinary skill in the art, and it is obvious that such modification or change may belong to the scope of the present invention.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM90460330" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A baby seat bed which is manufactured integral by compressing and forming an elastic material, comprising:
