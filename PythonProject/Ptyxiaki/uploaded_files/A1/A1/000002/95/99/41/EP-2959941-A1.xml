The inventors have summarized the experimental results for oxyhemoglobin and melanin, and defined the relationship between the spectrum of cosmetic light for body hair and the reduction of side effects as well as the improvement in the cosmetic treatment effect. The side effects reduction herein refers to reducing the likelihood of unwanted side effects on the skin. The improvement in the cosmetic treatment effect herein refers to improving the body hair cosmetic treatment effect to inhibit the growth of body hair. The body hair cosmetic treatment effect herein refers to the effectiveness of inhibiting hair growth in a living body or removing hair from a living body. Inhibiting hair growth herein refers to an effect in which the reproduction or the growth of body hair is inhibited in a living body. Removing hair refers to an effect in which body hair is removed from a living body.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The unwanted side effects on the skin have a correlation with the amount of light energy absorbed by oxyhemoglobin. The unwanted side effects on the skin may increase as the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> amount of light energy absorbed by oxyhemoglobin increases. Light in a wavelength range of 400 to 500 nm is more easily absorbed by oxyhemoglobin than light in a wavelength range of 500 to 600 nm and light in a wavelength range of 600 to 700 nm. To mainly reduce unwanted side effects on the skin, it is preferable that light with a shorter wavelength within the wavelength range of 400 to 700 nm has a smaller amount of light energy.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The body hair cosmetic treatment effect has a correlation with the amount of light energy absorbed by oxyhemoglobin. The body hair cosmetic treatment effect may be improved when there is an increase in the amount of light energy absorbed by melanin in body hair. In the wavelength range of 400 to 700 nm, the melanin of body hair absorbs light more easily as the wavelength of the emitted light becomes shorter. Thus, to mainly improve the body hair cosmetic treatment effect, it is preferable that the amount of light energy be increased at short wavelengths in the wavelength range of 400 to 700 nm.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The facts described above indicate the following. The light irradiating the body hair is less likely to cause unwanted side effects on the skin when its light energy is small in the wavelength range of 400 to 500 nm. However, melanin absorbing a smaller amount of light energy may lead to an insufficient body hair cosmetic treatment effect. The light irradiating the body hair is likely to improve the body hair cosmetic treatment effect when its light energy in the wavelength length of 400 to 500 nm is large. However, oxyhemoglobin absorbing a larger amount of light energy may increase the likelihood of unwanted side effects on the skin.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Based on these findings, the inventors of the present application have identified cosmetic light for body hair that achieves a proper balance between the amount of light energy absorbed by oxyhemoglobin and the amount of light energy absorbed by melanin. Such cosmetic light for body hair can reduce the side effects and improve the cosmetic treatment effect. The inventors of the present application have defined such cosmetic light for body hair with the relationship between the amount of light energy in the wavelength range of 400 to 500 nm and the amount of light energy in the wavelength range of 500 to 600 nm. The cosmetic light for body hair has a smaller amount of light energy in the wavelength range of 400 to 500 nm than in the wavelength range of 500 to 600 nm. The amount of light energy is defined by the intensity integral in the wavelength range of 400 to 500 nm and the intensity integral in the wavelength range of 500 to 600 nm.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The cosmetic light for body hair has a smaller amount of light energy in the wavelength range of 400 to 500 nm than in the wavelength range of 500 to 600 nm.

The cosmetic light for body hair has a larger intensity integral in the wavelength range of 400 to 700 nm than in the wavelength range of 700 to 1200 nm, and thus is more likely to improve the body hair cosmetic treatment effect.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The optical cosmetic device for body hair of the present invention is less likely to cause unwanted side effects on the skin and is capable of inhibiting the growth of body hair.

third embodiments and the comparative example is smaller as the light energy density increases. The hair growth inhibition ratio of each of the first to third embodiments is substantially smaller than the ratio of the comparative example immediately after the irradiation and thereafter. The hair growth inhibition ratio of each of the first to third embodiments approaches 0 as the time elapses immediately after the irradiation. This increases the gap between the hair growth inhibition ratio of the embodiments and the hair growth inhibition ratio of the comparative example.
