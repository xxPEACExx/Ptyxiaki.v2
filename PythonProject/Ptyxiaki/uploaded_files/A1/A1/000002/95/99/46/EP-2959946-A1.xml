The system comprises a fire suppressant source, a distributor valve, a distribution system and a control system. The divert valve is movable between an initial first position which communicates extinguishing agent into a first distribution network and a second position which communicates extinguishing agent into a second distribution network.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">This fire extinguishing system has the drawback that the reliability may be regarded as relatively poor.

One single fire extinguishing medium container may thus supply fire extinguishing medium to one of two separate fire extinguishing sub-systems. Such a fire extinguishing system may be installed in applications where the space is limited and there is a need for separate extinguishing lines. Furthermore, a cost-efficient system may be provided since one single fire extinguishing medium container is needed.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Furthermore, this fire extinguishing system may be fully automatic since e.g. pressurized detection conduits or electrical detection arrangements may be connected to the valve assembly. Hence, a very robust and reliable fire extinguishing system may be provided.

The fire extinguishing system 1 may e.g. be installed in a vehicle, or in a building, with several compartments. On release of the extinguishing system 1 extinguishing liquid in the form of atomised mist is sprayed in the compartment where a fire has been detected to cool and extinguish the fire.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The fire extinguishing system 1 comprises a fire detection system, a container 3 for fire extinguishing medium, a first fire extinguishing sub-system 5, a second fire extinguishing sub-system 7 and a valve assembly 9 for distribution of fire extinguishing medium to the first or to the second fire extinguishing sub-system 5, 7. Each of the first and second fire extinguishing sub-systems 5, 7 comprises several nozzles 11, 13 and a piping system 15, 17 and is fluidly connected to the fire extinguishing medium container 3 by the valve assembly 9.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The fire detection system comprises a first and a second detection conduit 19, 21 each of which is filled with pressurized detection fluid, in the form of pressurized liquid, and connected to the valve assembly 9. In this embodiment the fire detection system comprises a common detection fluid container 23 holding pressurized detection liquid and connected to the valve<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> assembly 9 for pressurizing each of the first and second detection conduits 19,21.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The detection liquid container 23 is of a design known per se and comprises pressurized detection fluid. In this embodiment detection fluid in the form of detection liquid is used. On delivery the liquid container 23 is filled with detection liquid, such as e.g. glycol-based anti-freeze, and pressurized with nitrogen gas to approximately 20-24 bar.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The detection liquid container 23 is fluidly connected to the valve assembly 9 by a detection fluid tube 24.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Each of the first fire extinguishing sub-system 5 and the first detection conduit 19 is arranged in a first compartment 6, and each of the second fire extinguishing sub-system 7 and the second detection conduit 21 is arranged in a second compartment 8, as schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. The first and second compartments 6, 8 may be separated from each other by walls. By way of an example the first compartment 6 may be a first engine compartment and the second compartment 8 may be a second engine compartment. By way of a second example the first compartment may be an engine compartment and the second compartment may be a passenger compartment. Furthermore, one of the compartments may e.g. be a compartment for electrical components, battery, hydraulic components, cab heater or engine heater. Also, the fire extinguishing system may be installed in a building with separated rooms.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The fire extinguishing medium container 3 is of a design known per se and forms two chambers, a first chamber for extinguishing liquid and a second chamber for a driving gas. The container chambers are separated from each other by means of a piston displaceably arranged in the container 3 and sealed with regard to the cylindrical wall by means of sealing rings. On delivery the fire extinguishing medium container 3 may be filled with extinguishing liquid and drive gas to approximately 105 bars.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">A release valve 25, which is known per se, is arranged on the fire extinguishing medium container 3. The release valve 25 is fluidly connected to the valve assembly 9 by a tube 27. The release valve 25 is arranged to open supply of fire extinguishing medium from the fire extinguishing medium<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> container 3 to the valve assembly 9 when a fire is detected in one of the first and second compartments 6, 8 by the detection system. To this end the release valve 25 is fluidly connected to the detection medium tube 24 by means of a tube 28. The release valve 25 is thus arranged to open supply of extinguishing liquid from the fire extinguishing medium container 3 to the valve assembly 9 in response to a pressure drop in any of the first and second detection conduits 19, 21 caused by rupture of the first 19 or second detection conduit 21. When the pressure in the detection fluid tube 24 has fallen to approximately 7 bar the release valve 25 on the fire extinguishing medium container 3 is activated and the fire extinguishing system 1 is released. Then, extinguishing liquid is sprayed into the engine compartment where fire has been detected. When the release valve 25 is opened extinguishing liquid is discharged from the pressure container 3 to the valve assembly 9 through the tube 27 fluidly connecting the valve assembly 9 to the fire extinguishing medium container 3. The advantage of activating the release valve 25 this way. i.e. by means of pressurized detection conduits, is that it provides for an automatic system that works without the need of electricity or other external energy.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Now referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2a</figref>, the valve assembly 9 comprises a valve chamber 33 and a valve member, in the form of a cylindrical valve plunger 35, displaceably arranged in the valve chamber 33 and sealed with regard to a cylindrical wall of the valve chamber 33 by means of sealing rings 37. The valve chamber 33 comprises a first sub-chamber 33a to which the first detection conduit 19 is fluidly connected, and a second sub-chamber 33b to which the second detection conduit 21 is fluidly connected. The first and second valve sub-chambers 33a, 33b are separated from each other by the movable valve plunger 35.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The cylindrical valve member 35 comprises a fluid passage portion 39 for distribution of fire extinguishing medium from the fire extinguishing medium container 3 to the first or to the second fire extinguishing sub-systems 5, 7.
