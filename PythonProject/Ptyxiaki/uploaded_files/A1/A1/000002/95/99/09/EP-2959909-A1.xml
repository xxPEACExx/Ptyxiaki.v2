When these cells are isolated and transplanted into the uterus, they can develop into one perfect individual.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Pluripotent stem cells, which are cells capable of developing into various cells and tissues derived from ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal layers, are derived from an inner cell mass located inside blastocysts generated<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> 4-5 days after fertilization. These cells are called embryonic stem cells and can differentiate into various other tissue cells but not create new living organisms.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Multipotent stem cells are stem cells capable of differentiating into only cells specific to tissues and organs containing these cells and are involved in the growth and development of each tissue and organ during fetal, neonatal, and adult periods as well as the maintenance of homeostasis of adult tissues and the induction of regeneration of damaged tissues. These tissue-specific multipotent cells are collectively referred to as adult stem cells. Adult stem cells are taken from pre-existing cells in various organs of the human body and then developed into stem cells, and these cells are characterized by differentiation into specific tissues. However, experiments for differentiating adult stem cells into various tissues such as hepatocytes have been performed successfully and thus have attracted much attention.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Stem cells have properties such as self-renewal, differentiation, and immortality, and adult stem cells, which can be obtained from various tissues, can be derived from various sources, compared to embryonic stem cells. Moreover, adult stem cells can avoid ethical issues that researchers can encounter and thus have been widely used in studies. Furthermore, stem cells isolated from umbilical<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> cord blood do not cause any additional damage to a donor, unlike bone marrow or adipose tissue, and thus have more advantages than other adult stem cells.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Meanwhile, inflammatory brain diseases refer to inflammatory diseases occurring in the brain due to specific causes and encompass encephalitis, meningitis, meningoencephalitis, etc. Encephalitis is the generic term for inflammatory diseases of the cerebral parenchyma and is distinguished from inflammation of the meninges surrounding the brain (meningitis). When meningitis and encephalitis are both present, this is frequently referred to as meningoencephalitis. Depending on the causes, encephalitis can be broadly divided into infectious, vasculitic, tumoral, chemical, and idiopathic encephalitis and can be divided again into specific categories depending on the details. Moreover, the encephalitis can be divided into acute, subacute, and chronic encephalitis depending on the time course of the disease. Until now, antibiotics have been used for the treatment of inflammatory brain diseases, but even if the causative organisms are treated by the use of antibiotics, they cause side effects such as acute brain injury, hydrocephalus, hypacusis, epilepsy, etc., and thus there is a need to develop a new treatment for inflammatory brain diseases. However, there have been no systematic studies on the treatment of inflammatory brain diseases<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> using stem cells so far.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Accordingly, the present inventors have conducted research to develop a new medicine for treating inflammatory brain diseases and found that direct administration of stem cells into the ventricles of animal models with inflammatory brain diseases has excellent therapeutic effects on inflammatory brain diseases, such as causing less side effects such as significantly reduced brain injury due to inflammatory response such as edema and significantly reduced loss in weight, reducing the degree of apoptosis and reactive gliosis, and significantly reducing the number of activated macrophages and the number of inflammatory cytokines in the brain, thereby completing the present invention.</p><heading id="h0003">[Disclosure]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Technical Problem]</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition for treating inflammatory brain diseases, comprising stem cells as an active ingredient.</p><heading id="h0005">[Technical Solution]</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">To accomplish the above object, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for treating inflammatory brain diseases, comprising stem cells as an<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> active ingredient.</p><heading id="h0006">[Advantageous Effects]</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">When the stem cells according to the present invention are administered directly into the ventricles of animal models with inflammatory brain diseases, they have excellent therapeutic effects on inflammatory brain diseases, such as causing less side effects such as significantly reduced brain injury due to inflammatory response such as edema and significantly reduced loss in weight, reducing the degree of apoptosis and reactive gliosis, and significantly reducing the number of activated macrophages and the number of inflammatory cytokines in the brain, and thus can be effectively used for the treatment of inflammatory brain diseases.</p><heading id="h0007">[Description of Drawings]</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> shows the experimental design to determine the therapeutic effect of stem cells on inflammatory brain diseases.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> shows MRI images of brains that have been changed depending on the induction of brain inflammation and the administration of stem cells.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 3</figref> shows the changes in the ratio of the brain injury area to the total brain area depending on the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> administration of stem cells in meningoencephalitis animal models.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref> shows the changes in body weight depending on the administration of stem cells in meningoencephalitis animal models.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 5</figref> shows the results of immunofluorescence stainings of brain tissues depending on the administration of stem cells in meningoencephalitis animal models.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 6</figref> shows the changes in protein expression in brain tissues depending on the administration of stem cells in meningoencephalitis animal models.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 7</figref> shows the changes in inflammatory cytokine expression in brain tissues depending on the administration of stem cells in meningoencephalitis animal models.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0008">[Mode for Invention]</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for treating inflammatory brain diseases, comprising stem cells as an active ingredient.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the present invention, the stem cells refer to cells that are the source of cells or tissues that constitute an individual and may refer to undifferentiated cells that have the ability to differentiate into specific cells or multiple functional cells and the ability to self-replicate the same cells repeatedly.

The adult stem cells may be mesenchymal stem cells, human tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells, human tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells, multipotent stem cells, or amniotic epithelial cells, and the mesenchymal stem cells may be derived from at least one selected from the group consisting of umbilical cord, umbilical cord blood, bone marrow, adipose, muscle, nerve, skin, amnion, and placenta, but not limited thereto. In an embodiment of the present invention, umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells were used as the stem cells.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">More specifically, the stem cells used in an embodiment of the present invention were isolated from umbilical cord blood and cultured, and the stem cells express CD105 and CD73 markers but do not express CD34, CD45 and CD14 markers. Moreover, the stem cells are positive for HLA-AB and negative for HLA-DR and express pluripotent<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> markers such as Oct4 and SSEA-4.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In order to obtain the stem cells of the present invention, the way to isolate and collect umbilical cord blood is as follows. During normal vaginal delivery, umbilical cord blood is collected from the umbilical vein extracted from the uterus in which the placenta remains after childbirth, and during cesarean section, umbilical cord blood is collected from the umbilical vein while the placenta is expelled from the uterus after childbirth. When umbilical cord blood is collected from the umbilical vein extracted from the uterus after childbirth, it is collected from the umbilical vein connecting the placenta and fetus after an infant is born by aseptic technique. At this time, a method of collecting umbilical cord blood before the separation of the placenta from the uterus after childbirth or a method of collecting umbilical cord blood in vitro after the separation of the placenta can be used. During cesarean section, the method of collecting umbilical cord blood in vitro after the separation of the placenta is used, in which the umbilical cord blood is collected in a blood bag containing an anticoagulant using a collecting needle after securing the umbilical vein.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Methods of isolating and culturing mesenchymal stem cells from collected umbilical cord blood include a method disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="KR20030069115"><text>Korean Patent Publication No.: 2003-0069115</text></patcit> and<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> methods known in the art (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Pittinger MF et al.

First, the collected umbilical cord blood is centrifuged on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient, for example, to isolate mononuclear cells including hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells, which are then washed several times to remove impurities. When the washed mononuclear cells are seeded in a culture vessel at an appropriate density and cultured, the cells proliferate as a monolayer. Among these cells, those that are homogeneous with an elongated spindle shape and proliferate in the form of a colony, when observed by phase contrast microscopy, are mesenchymal stem cells.

Umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells subcultured for 5 passages were characterized.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As a result, it was found that the stem cells of the present invention expressed CD105 and CD73 markers, but did not express CD34, CD45 and CD14 markers. Moreover, it was found that the stem cells were positive for HLA-AB and negative for HLA-DR and expressed pluripotent markers such as Oct4 and SSEA-4.</p><heading id="h0010"><b>Example 2: Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells into ventricles of meningoencephalitis animal models and determination of effects on treatment of meningoencephalitis</b></heading><heading id="h0011"><u>2-1.

Furthermore, in order to identify the cerebrospinal fluid infection, each white rat underwent a cistern tap to obtain cerebrospinal fluid, which was cultured to identify <i>E. coli.</i> Then, the brains of all white rats at the age of 16 days (P16) were scanned by 7-tesla MRI to measure the degree of brain injury. Brain MRI images were analyzed with an Image J program to measure the increase in ventricle and the infarcted area of cerebral parenchyma, which was defined as brain injury, and "the volume ratio of the brain injury area to the total brain area" was calculated.
