In fact, the particular position of the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> USB ports of the computer is such that, when the USB connector is connected to the latter, it typically puts the delivery head in a position interfering for example with the support plane of the computer itself.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">One purpose of the present invention is to obtain an aroma delivery device that optimizes the diffusion of the vapors into the air.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Another purpose of the present invention is to obtain an aroma delivery device that is simple and economical.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The Applicant has devised, tested and embodied the present invention to overcome the shortcomings of the state of the art and to obtain these and other purposes and advantages.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present invention is set forth and characterized in the independent claim, while the dependent claims describe other characteristics of the invention or variants to the main inventive idea.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In accordance with the above purposes, the present invention concerns an aroma delivery device that comprises:
<ul><li>a containing body which houses at least a tank containing an aromatic substance and which is provided with an aromatic substance delivery head;</li><li>an activator electronic circuit configured to cause the delivery of the aromatic substance contained in the tank through the delivery head;</li><li>a USB connector associated with the containing body and connected to the activator electronic circuit to provide electric power to the latter.</li></ul></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to one aspect of the present invention, the containing body is defined by a first portion that develops mainly along a first axis and is provided with a first end with which the USB connector is associated, and by a second portion that develops mainly along a second axis, transverse with respect to the first axis, and is provided with a second end with which the delivery head is associated.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The development of the delivery device along the first and second axis allows to dispose the delivery head in a position that promotes a homogeneous and well-distributed diffusion of the aromatic substance with respect to the electronic device to which the USB connector is connected.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Moreover, the position of the delivery head, when the delivery device is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> applied to portable computers, facilitates the delivery of the aromatic substance in a direction that does not involve the user directly.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to a possible solution, the first axis and the second axis can be reciprocally angled with respect to each other by an angle of amplitude comprised between 90° and 175°, preferably between 110° and 160°. These angles between the axes increase the efficiency of distribution of the aromatic vapors.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to another form of embodiment, the first axis and the second axis lie on the same lying plane. This allows to limit the bulk of the delivery device also in relation to the electronic device to which it will be connected.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In variant forms of embodiment of the delivery device, it is provided that it comprises a memory card, contained in the containing body and that allows to store data. This increases the versatility of the delivery device.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In another variant form of embodiment, the first portion and second portion are angularly positionable with respect to each other, for example by articulation elements, to allow an optimum positioning of the delivery head with respect to the USB connector.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In another variant form of embodiment, the USB connector is retractable in the containing body, to limit the bulk and to prevent accidental damage thereto.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0023" num="0023">These and other characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of some forms of embodiment, given as a non-restrictive example with reference to the attached drawings wherein:
