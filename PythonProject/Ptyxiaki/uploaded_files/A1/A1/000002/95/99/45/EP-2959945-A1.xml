Traditionally, the majority of radiotherapy was delivered via an external radiation source, called external beam radiotherapy or EBRT. About 90% of radiotherapy is given via EBRT. The remainder is given via techniques where a radioactive isotope is placed within close proximity to a targeted tumor, called brachytherapy.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a subspecialty in which the radiotherapy is given at the time of surgery. Its primary advantage is the ability to surgically remove organs-at-risk from the post-operative field during treatment, enabling higher doses to be given safely. IORT has been in use for many years at specialized facilities and has a wealth of clinical data to support its safety and efficacy. Both EBRT and brachytherapy protocols have been developed for IORT. A disadvantage of IORT is the tremendous capital costs associated with<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> setting up a program, since a fully-equipped operating room (OR) and a shielded radiotherapy delivery room must be functionally united. This has limited the expertise to select centers.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Two concomitant developments have created an opportunity to overcome the current limitations of IORT. One is the development of electronic brachytherapy. A catheter-based radiotherapy system that produces ionizing radiotherapy from a very small source. It can effectively reproduce radiotherapy fields that were generated with seed-sized isotopes. Its treatment energy is low enough that expensive shielding is not required, and as it is not radioactive (when the machine is off), expensive procedures and protections are not required. This has just recently been FDA approved in for treatment of breast and skin cancers and has not been used intraoperatively yet as of the time of the filing of this document.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The second development is surgical robotics. A success story developing over the previous decade, surgical robots have facilitated more and more minimally invasive procedures, including oncologic resections. The rapid recovery time and shortened hospital stays have been well-received in all applications. Prostatectomies and hysterectomies comprise the majority of oncologic surgeries, though this is evolving. Patients are evaluated for post-operative radiotherapy in the same manner after either a robotic or traditional resection.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Combining the two technologies in the IORT setting would realize several practical advantages. Electronic brachytherapy does not require significant capital costs. It can be applied in ORs in use today. And the robotics would maintain the minimally invasive surgical advantage. This is clearly of interest to many.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The manner in which the systems can be integrated, however, is not particularly clear. Delivering radiotherapy at the time of resection requires precise calculations to be done in "real time" and these systems do not exist for electronic brachytherapy. Currently, balloon applicators are used, primarily because the dosimetry is simple. Balloon applicators, however, do not facilitate customization of the radiotherapy fields. It is possible that other traditional applicators can be used, though none of these would enable minimally invasive surgery, real-time dosimetry, and customization of the radiotherapy fields.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Therefore there is a need for a set of applicators that would satisfy both requirements, namely, be minimally invasive and permit real-time dosimetry, as well as customization of the radiotherapy fields. It is also contemplated, that the present invention can be used in non-robotic environments and achieve advantages over previous devices.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Brief Summary of Embodiments of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to an applicator for manipulating one or more catheters carrying a radiation generating device, for delivering a radiation field to a target, the applicator being<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> characterized by a spring mechanism, which settles into a predetermined arrangement, when moved out of a sheath, designed for covering the spring mechanism.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">An aspect of some embodiments of the present invention relates to an applicator for manipulating one or more catheters carrying a radiation generating device, for delivering a radiation field to a target, the applicator having a proximal end and a distal end.

Description in terms of these environments is provided to allow the various features and embodiments of the invention to be portrayed in the context of an exemplary application. After reading this description, it will become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art how the invention can be implemented in different and alternative environments.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All patents, applications, published applications and other publications referred to herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. If a definition set forth in this section is contrary to or otherwise inconsistent with a defmition set forth in applications, published applications and other publications that are herein incorporated by reference, the definition set forth in this document prevails over the definition that is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Before describing aspects and embodiments of the present invention, some term are to be defined. In this document, the term "proximal", when referred to a section of an object, refers to the section of the object which is farther from the target and closer to the device which holds and/or controls the object. Consequently, the term "distal" refers to a section of the object which is closer to the target and farther from the device which holds and/or controls the object. An "inner surface" refers to a surface, which faces the center of the object<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> referred to. An "outer surface" refers to a surface which faces away from the center of the object and towards the environment in which the object is contained.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The present invention relates to minimally invasive applicators for robotic-assisted and non-robotic assisted intraoperative radiotherapy.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">An aspect of some embodiments the present invention relates to an applicator for manipulating one or more catheters carrying a radiation generating device, for delivering a radiation field to a target. The applicator includes a sheath, a spring mechanism at least partially housed in the sheath, and a catheter grasper, attached to a distal section of the spring mechanism and designed for grasping and holding the catheter. The spring mechanism is controlled by a user, for example directly or through an arm of a surgical robot, and is designed for being moved in and out of the sheath, through an opening at a distal end of the sheath. When the spring mechanism moves out of the distal end of the sheath, the applicator is defined to be in an open configuration, and the spring mechanism is released into a predetermined arrangement.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The arrangement of the spring influences the location of the grasper with respect to the target. Once the position of the grasper is fixed, the grasper is designed to hold the catheter at a specific position along the catheter. The radiation field delivered to the target by the catheter depends upon the arrangement of the spring mechanism and the position at which the catheter is held out of any of a plurality of positions along the catheter. This radiation field<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> is generally mapped before radiation treatment, so that a known radiation field is delivered to the target.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the grasper may grasp the catheter at a plurality of different positions along the catheter. At each of such positions, the radiation delivery material is at a different distance from the target, and therefore a plurality of radiation fields may be delivered to the target, through the use of the applicator. These plurality of radiation fields may also be mapped before the treatment, so that a desired radiation field may be delivered to the target during the treatment.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Optionally, the spring mechanism may assume a plurality of arrangements, in the open configuration of the applicator. In each arrangement, the distance between the grasper and the target is different, and therefore at least one different radiation field corresponds each arrangement.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the spring mechanism of the applicator includes a plurality of spring wires, and each spring wire holds at a distal end thereof a grasper, which may hold a plurality of catheters. Such an applicator allows for a plurality of radiation fields. The desired radiation field may be chosen from the plurality of radiation fields and applied to the target, according to at least one property of the target, such as shape or composition, for example.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Another aspect of some embodiments of the present invention relates to a device for aiming a radiation field toward a target area. The device is<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> characterized by a film, optionally transparent, having markings which form a grid. The film is designed to be applied over a target area, and therefore defines sub-areas on the target area, the sub-areas being delineated by the shape of the grid. A selected radiation field is applied to the target by moving a delivery catheter into proximity with selected sub areas, and irradiating the selected areas for specific lengths of time. The film is held by a spring mechanism, which may be repeatedly moved into and out of a sheath through a distal end of the sheath. The spring mechanism is controlled by a user, for example through an arm of a surgical robot. When the spring mechanism is moved out of a distal end of the sheath, the spring mechanism is released into an arrangement, such that the film is stretched. Once the film is stretched, the film may be applied to the target area.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The above device may be used in conjunction with a radiation delivery catheter controlled by a user, for example through a surgical robot. Once the film is applied to the target area, the catheter is moved to deliver a desired amount of radiation to selected sub-areas. In this manner, a desired radiation field is applied to the target area, the radiation field being chosen according to at least one property of the target.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Referring now to the figures, <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a system for 100 delivering radiation to a target, according to some embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The system 100 includes a surgical robot 102, an applicator 104, and a radiation delivery catheter 106. The surgical robot 102 has at least one arm. At<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> first, the arm is designed for holding and moving the applicator 104. After the applicator 104 is brought to a position selected by the user, the applicator is externally secured to the selected position, and the arm of the surgical robot 102 is disconnected from the arm and is used for manipulating - for holding and moving - the catheter 106. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the applicator 104 is secured by an immobilized mechanical arm attached directly to an operating table upon which a patient is located - therefore maintaining the applicator 104 in a fixed position relative to the patient. The applicator 104 is inserted into a cavity near the target that is to be treated through a port or incision, and moved to a location in the proximity of the target. Once the desired location is reached by the applicator 104, the applicator 104 is set to an open configuration, a grasper of the applicator is set at a predetermined distance from the target and is ready to receive the catheter 106. The catheter 106 is introduced into the cavity, either through the same port as the applicator 104, or through a different port. The catheter 106 is moved so that the grasper of the applicator 104 grasps the catheter 106 at a desired position along the catheter 106. The radiation is then delivered, according to a predetermined dosage.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The target may be, for example, a malignancy of the brain, head &amp; neck, lung, esophagus, breast, stomach, pancreas, colon, rectum, uterus, cervix, prostate, skin, esophagus, kidney, bladder, ovary and soft tissues (sarcoma).</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Optionally, the applicator 104 includes a plurality of graspers, and therefore may hold a plurality of catheters. In such a case, a plurality of catheters are delivered one by one to graspers located near specific locations on a target<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> area, and each catheter delivers a desired dosage of radiation to the specific location. Such a setting allows the delivery of many localized radiation fields on a target area. Furthermore, in such a setting, only specific locations on the target area in need of treatment are exposed to radiation, rather than a whole target area.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In surgery, surgical robots are generally designed to be slaves of the user. Therefore, in this document, it is understood that the surgical robot 102 is a slave of the user, and cannot act independently of the user. The surgical robot 102 may be any surgical robot known in the art. In an exemplary embodiment, the surgical robot 102 is manufactured by Intuitive Surgicals. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the surgical robot 102 is designed for performing minimally invasive surgical procedures. The surgical robot 102 is controlled by a user, optionally via a joystick, a mouse, a keyboard, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the surgical robot 102 is not included in the system 100. Rather, the applicator 104 and catheter 106 are manipulated by the user in a different manner. For example, the applicator 104 and the catheter 106 may be manipulated directly by the user, or through other tools, which are available today or may be available in the future.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In some embodiments of the present invention, the catheter 106 generates radiation by electrical means, and radiation may be increased, decreased, and turned on and off by the user. An exemplary catheter includes a<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> miniaturized x-ray tube with its requisite power supply and cooling system. Such a catheter may be referred to in the art as "radiation delivery arm".</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Specific embodiments of the applicator 104 will be presented below.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2a and 2b</figref> are schematic diagrams illustrating an applicator 200 characterized by a spring mechanism, according to some embodiments of the present invention. The applicator 200 is an embodiment of the applicator 104 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The applicator 200 includes a sheath 202, a spring mechanism 204, and a catheter grasper 206 attached to a distal end of the spring mechanism 204.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2a</figref> illustrates a closed configuration of the applicator 200. The spring mechanism 204 is held within the sheath 202, and pushes against inner walls of the sheath 202. The sheath 202 therefore limits the extension of the spring mechanism 204. In the closed configuration, the applicator 200 is compact, and therefore the size of the incision through which the applicator 200 is inserted into a cavity is decreased.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Once the applicator 200 is inserted into the cavity, a user may switch to an open configuration of the applicator 200, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2b</figref>. In the open configuration, the spring mechanism 204 is moved out of a distal end of the sheath 202, and without being restricted by the sheath 202, the spring mechanism 204 is released into a predetermined arrangement. Such an arrangement may, for example, allow the grasper 206 to be moved to a desired position, which was unattainable in the closed configuration. Once the grasper 206 is fixed in the<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> desired position, a radiation delivery catheter 208 is moved into grasper 206, as explained in the description of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Optionally, the spring mechanism 204 is designed to be moved in and out of a distal end of the sheath 202, by keeping the sheath 202 in a fixed position, and pushing and pulling the spring mechanism 204. Optionally or alternatively, the spring mechanism 204 is designed to be moved in and out of a distal end of the sheath 202, by keeping the spring mechanism 204 in a fixed position, and pushing and pulling the sheath 202.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The sheath 202 may be of any shape. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the sheath is a capless cylinder. In another exemplary embodiment, the sheath is made of steel. Alternatively, the sheath may be made of aluminum or plastic.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">The spring mechanism 204 may include a spring and a rod to push the spring along the sheath 202. As will be described below, the spring mechanism 204 may include one or more wire springs. The wire springs may be made of steel, or other suitable alloys.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the grasper 206 is made of steel. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the grasper is designed to hold a catheter having a diameter of about 2 mm. Optionally, the grasper 206 is adjustable for holding catheters having different diameters. The shape and properties of the grasper 206 do not affect the scope of the present invention, and any kind of grasper may be used as part of the<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> applicator 200. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the grasper 206 is designed to hold a plurality of radiation delivery catheters. Optionally, the grasper 206 is configured to hold the catheter at any of a plurality of predetermined positions along the catheter. Optionally, more than one grasper is attached to the distal end of the spring mechanism 204. In a variant, the spring mechanism 204 may assume a plurality of arrangements on the open configuration, each arrangement corresponding to a predetermined radiation field, or a predetermined set of radiation fields.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">According to some embodiments of the present invention, a mapping procedure is performed prior to the use of the applicator 200. In the mapping procedure, radiation fields are measured for each a plurality of arrangements of the applicator 200. For example, for each arrangement of the grasper or graspers in the open configuration, catheters are inserted into one, some, or all the rods. The different radiation fields are then measured, and matched to the arrangements. In addition, further arrangements are created, as the catheters are moved along the graspers to approach or move away from the target. The catheters are held by the graspers at different positions along the lengths of the catheters. The radiation fields corresponding such arrangements are also measured. Finally, if more than one catheter is present, some catheters may turned on and off at different times according to predetermined patterns. The radiation fields created by these patterns are measured, and matched to the patterns. A more detailed explanation of the mapping procedure is provided below, in the description of <figref idrefs="f0014">Fig. 13</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --></p><p id="p0064" num="0064">The mapping procedure is used for composing an atlas of a plurality of predetermined radiation field that may be delivered to the target via the applicator 200. In a radiation treatment procedure, a desired radiation field is chosen among the plurality of radiation fields within the atlas, according to at least one property of the target. Once the desired radiation field is chosen, the applicator 200 is set in the arrangement which corresponds to the desired radiation field, and the catheter or catheters are turned on and off according to the pattern which corresponds to the desired radiation field. In this manner, the desired radiation field is delivered to the target.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3a and 3b</figref> are perspective drawings illustrating an applicator 300 characterized by a single spring wire, according to some embodiments of the present invention. The applicator 300 is an embodiment of the applicator 200 of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2a and 2b</figref>.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The applicator 300 includes a cylindrical sheath 302, a bent wire spring 304, a first catheter grasper 306 attached to a distal end of the wire spring 304, and second catheter grasper 308 attached to a distal end of the wire spring 304. The applicator 300 is similar to the applicator 200 of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2a and 2b</figref>. The spring mechanism used in the applicator 300 is the bent wire spring 304. Optionally, the wire spring 304 is made of steel.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">In <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3a</figref>, the applicator 300 is in a closed configuration. The wire spring 304 is compressed by the inner walls of the sheath 302. In <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3b</figref>, the wire spring is moved out of a distal side of the sheath 302 along a direction of a<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> central axis 309 of the sheath, and a distal portion of the wire spring 304 expands and assumes a curved shape. In this manner, the graspers 306 and 308 are set into a predetermined arrangement with respect to each other and to the target. A first radiation delivery catheter 310 is moved into the first grasper 306 and a second radiation delivery catheter 312 is moved into the second grasper 308. The predetermined arrangement between the graspers 306 and 308, and therefore between the catheters 310 and 312, allows the delivery of a predetermined radiation field to the target, which is measured during a mapping procedure, as described above.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Optionally, the open configuration may allow for a plurality of predetermined arrangements. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the shape assumed by the wire spring 304 varies with the size of the portion of the wire spring 304 which is outside a distal end of the sheath 302. The shape of the wire spring 304 therefore affects the arrangements between the catheters 310 and 312 and the target, and each arrangement corresponds to one of or a set of a plurality if radiation fields. The radiation fields may be predetermined through the mapping procedure described above.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4a</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">4b</figref> are perspective drawings illustrating an applicator 400 characterized by three wire springs, each wire spring holding a catheter grasper which may hold three catheters, according to some embodiments of the present invention. The applicator 400 is an embodiment of the applicator 200 of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2a and 2b</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --></p><p id="p0070" num="0070">In the applicator 400, the spring mechanism includes three wire springs 402, 404, and 406. Three graspers, 408, 410, and 412 are attached to the distal ends of the wire springs 402, 404, and 406, respectively. Each grasper is characterized by three orifices, and is therefore designed to hold up to three radiation delivery catheters.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">In <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4a</figref>, a closed configuration of the applicator 400 is illustrated: the wire springs 402, 404, and 406 springs are inside a sheath 408, and the graspers 408, 410, and 412 are bunched together. In the close configuration, the applicator 400 is compact, and therefore easy to insert into a cavity via a small incision.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">In <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 4b</figref>, an open configuration of the applicator 400 is illustrated: the wire springs 402, 404, and 406 are moved out of a distal end of the sheath 408, and are released into a predetermined arrangement. The graspers 408, 410, and 412 are elongated panels each having three orifices, each orifice designed for receiving a catheter. In this manner, the graspers form a 3x3 grid of catheter receiving orifices, allowing the insertion of up to nine catheters. A user may deliver a desired radiation field to the target, by choosing a desired number of catheters inserted into desired orifices, and turning on each catheter for a desired period of time. The above choices allow a plurality of radiation fields to be applied to the target with the help of the applicator 400, and a desired radiation field may be chosen according to at least one property of the target.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --></p><p id="p0073" num="0073">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the middle wire spring 404 is a straight wire, which does not form a curved shape, when moved out of the distal end of the sheath 414. Optionally, a different number of wire springs, such as 2, 4, 5, for example, is used in the applicator 400. Optionally, differently shaped graspers are used. Optionally, the graspers are designed for holding a different number of catheters, such as 1, 2, 5, 6, for example.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the applicator 400 includes an anchor 416. The anchor 416 is an element attached to the wire springs, and is designed for keeping a distance between the wire springs fixed at an anchoring location along the wire springs. The anchor 416 moves with the wire springs along a direction of the central axis of the sheath 414. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4a</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">4b</figref>, the anchor 416 is a disk characterized by three holes, each hole configured for being traversed by and welded to one of the wire springs. The anchor 416 ensures that the distance between the wire springs at the anchoring position is fixed. This ensures that the arrangement of the wire springs does not change, when the wire springs are moved out of the distal end of the sheath 414. Therefore, a user knows that the arrangement of the wire springs is the same, when the anchor 416 is at a specific location along the length of the sheath 414. In this manner, the arrangement of wire springs, and consequently the predetermined radiation fields are repeatable.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">Optionally, the diameter of the disk-shaped anchor 416 is about equal to the diameter of the inner wall of the sheath 414. This ensures that the wire do<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> not move toward the sides of the sheath 414 at the anchoring position, and therefore the distance between the wires and the sheath 414 at the anchoring position is fixed as well. In this manner, the repeatability of the predetermined radiation fields is further enhanced.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">In some variants, proximal sections of the wire springs are joined together, and form a rigid body called a wire mesh, which makes it easier for a user to move the wire springs along the sheath 414, and ensures that all the wire springs are moved together along a direction of a central axis of the sheath 414. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the portions of the wire springs that are proximal of the anchor 416 are fastened to each other, while the portions of the wire springs that are distal of the anchor 416 are separate from each other. Optionally, the proximal portions of the wire springs of are joined to each other by being welded together. Alternatively, the proximal portions of the wire springs of are joined to each other by being glued to each other.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4a</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">4b</figref>, the manner in which the graspers are attached to the wire springs deserves some attention. The grasper 408 is attached to a front surface of the of the wire spring 402; the middle grasper 410 is welded onto the middle of the central wire spring 404; the grasper 412 is attached to a back surface of the wire spring 406. In this manner, when the spring wires are fully retracted into the sheath 414, the graspers are offset from each other and therefore do not bump into each other, but are ordered side by side in the compact configuration shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4a</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --></p><p id="p0078" num="0078">In some variants, the spring wires assume a plurality of arrangements within the open configuration of the applicator 400. As the spring wires are moved further and further out of the distal end of the sheath 414, the sheath 414 limits the releasing of the spring wires less and less.

In <figref idrefs="f0017">Fig. 15b</figref>, the applicator 1400 is shown in an open configuration thereof.</p><p id="p0145" num="0145">The applicator 1400 includes an oblong flat panel 1401 for supporting all the elements of the applicator 1400. The applicator includes a left sphere 1420 and a right sphere 1422, the spheres 1420 and 1422 being located at opposite ends of the panel 1401. In a variant, the spheres have a diameter measuring about 6 millimeters. Each sphere sports four holes, like the hole 1424, for receiving the rivets of a grasper. Two holes are in the half sphere below the plane of the panel 1401 and two holes are in the half sphere above the plane of the panel 1401. The dimensions and locations of the holes on the spheres are chosen according to the dimensions of a clasp, so that each sphere tightly grasped by an independent clasp to secure the applicator 1400 at two points. In a variant, the graspers are joined to robotic arms. In another variant, the graspers are DaVinci Prograspers. Securing the applicator 1400 at two points stabilizes the applicator 100 and ensures that the applicator 1400 does not move when the measurements are taken and when the treatment is given.</p><p id="p0146" num="0146">At least one of the spheres further includes a channel, such as the channel having an entrance at the hole 1426 and an exit at the hole 1427 on the sphere 1420. The channel is designed for being traversed by a hook attached to a long thin shaft for introducing the applicator 1400 into a patient's body and for<!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --> withdrawing the applicator 1400 out of the patient's body. In a variant, the shaft has a length of about 15 centimeters and a diameter of about 5 millimeters, and is designed for being inserted through a minimally invasive abdominopelvic wall incision. In another variant, the diameter of the channes is about 2 millimeters.</p><p id="p0147" num="0147">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the applicator 1400 comprises six catheter grippers (1402, 1404, 1406, 1408, 1410, and 1412), for holding the catheters containing the radiation sources at predetermined positions with respect to the target. The grippers are set in pairs, each pair being joined to a spring mechanism. When the spring mechanism is wound, the grippers are retracted onto the surface of the board 1401, decreasing the surface area of the applicator 1400. This mode will hereafter be called "closed mode", and is shown in <figref idrefs="f0016">Fig. 15a</figref>. In the closed mode, the applicator 1400 is inserted into and withdrawn from the body of the patient via an incision. According to some embodiments of the present invention, in the closed mode, the applicator 1400 has a length of about 70 millimeters and a width of about 8 millimeters. When the spring mechanism is released, each gripper rotates about a peg, out of the surface of the board 1401, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0017">Fig. 15b</figref>. This mode will hereafter be called "open mode". After being inserted into the patient's body in the closed mode, the applicator is released into the open mode, and one or more catheters are inserted into the grippers.</p><p id="p0148" num="0148">To explain the open mode and closed mode, we refer <figref idrefs="f0016 f0017">Figs. 15a-15b</figref>. The gripper 1402 is joined to the board 1401 via the peg 1414, and is joined to the spring mechanism 1416. The gripper 1408 is also joined to the spring mechanism<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> 1416.

In <figref idrefs="f0017">Fig. 15b</figref>, the spring mechanism 1416 is released, and the gripper 1402 is rotated counterclockwise about the peg 1414. Similarly, the gripper 1408 is rotate clockwise about the peg 1415. The rotation of the gripper 1402 stops when a section of the gripper 1402 reaches a stopping pin 1418, setting the gripper 1402 at a predetermined distance from the board 1401. Similarly, the gripper 1408 is set into its predetermined position when a section of the gripper 1408 reaches a stopping pin 1419.</p><p id="p0149" num="0149">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the board 1401 sports one or more openings, such as the opening 1428, for holding one or more catheters containing the radiation sources.</p><p id="p0150" num="0150">In order to decrease the number of incisions made, the applicator 1400 is first introduced into the patient's body via a first incision, by using the hook and shaft described above. The applicator 1400 is disengaged from the hook and shaft by sliding the hook out of the first incision. The shaft and hook are then withdrawn from the operative field. The applicator 1400 is then grasped on the left sphere 1420 by the DaVinci prograsper, which has been inserted into the patience body via one of the four incisions required by the DaVinci robot. The applicator 1400 is manipulated into a desirable position, generally directly above or in close proximity to the target. A second DaVinci prograsper inserted through another one of the incisions required by the DaVinci robot then secures the right sphere 1422 to maintain immobility at two secure points. At this point, the target<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> is ready for treatment planning, and the port through which the applicator was introduced is available for use, for delivering one or more catheters containing the radiation source. In a previous rendering, two separate incisions were required: one for the introduction of the applicator and one for the introduction of the catheters.</p><p id="p0151" num="0151">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0018">Figs. 16a</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0019">16b</figref>, a second spring based applicator 1500 for delivering a radiation source close to a target tissue is illustrated.

The applicator 1500 includes a planar panel 1502, a first rotating arm 1504, a second rotating arm 1505, a first planar holder 1506, a spring anchor 1508, a spring 1510, a piston 1512, and a shaft 1514.</p><p id="p0152" num="0152">The first rotating arm 1504 is joined to the planar panel 102 by a first pivot 1516, and is rotatable with respect to the planar panel 102 about the first pivot 1502. The first rotating arm has an elongated main body 1504a and a slanted extension 1504b, which extends from the main body 1504a at a non-zero angle with the central axis of the main body 1504a. The planar panel 102 includes a stop 1518, which is configured for stopping the rotation of the first rotating arm 1504 when the slanted extension 1504 reaches and contacts (pushes against) the stop 1518. The stop may be in the form of an element which extends perpendicularly to the planar panel's surface to be in the path of rotation of the slanted extension 1504.<!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --></p><p id="p0153" num="0153">The second rotating arm 1505 is joined to the planar panel 102 via a second pivot 1520 and is configured for being rotatable with respect to the planar panel around the second pivot 1520.</p><p id="p0154" num="0154">The first planar holder 1506 is joined to the end of the man body 1504a which is distal from the slanted extension 1504b.

Similarly, the first planar holder 1506 is joined to the first second arm 1505 via a fourth pivot 1524 and is configured for being rotatable with respect to the second rotating arm 1505 around the fourth pivot 1524. The rotation of the first rotating arm causes the second rotating arm to rotate as well, and gives rise to the rotation of the first planar holder 1506 with respect to the first and second rotating arms. This rotation enables the closure of the applicator 1500, in which the first planar holder, the first rotating arm, and the second rotating arm are overlap the planar panel 1502, thus decreasing the profile of the applicator 1505. The rotation also enables the opening of the applicator 1500, in which the first and second rotating arms extend away from the planar panel 1502 and place the first planar holder 1506 at a location which does not overlap the planar panel.</p><p id="p0155" num="0155">When the applicator 1500 is open, catheters can be inserted into the one or more apertures 1526 of the first holder panel 1506, in order to be held at desired positions with respect to the target area within the patient's body.

The spring 1510 surrounds the shaft 1504, has a first end connected to the spring anchor 1508 and second end connected to the piston 1512. The piston also surrounds the shaft 1514 When the spring is its retracted configurations, the piston 1512 does not contact the first rotating arm 1504.
