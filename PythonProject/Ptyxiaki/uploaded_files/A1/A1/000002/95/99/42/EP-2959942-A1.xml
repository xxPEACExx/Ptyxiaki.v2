Therefore, a large amount of optical energy in the wavelength range of 400 nm to 600 nm increases the amount of optical energy absorbed by the oxygenated hemoglobin. Accordingly, there is an increased risk in the occurrence of an unwanted side effect for the skin.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">The inventors of the present application conducted experiments related to the absorptivity of eumelanin and pheomelanin and obtained the following results. Eumelanin has a high absorptivity in the wavelength range of 400 nm to 1200 nm. Pheomelanin has a high absorptivity in the wavelength range of 400 nm to 700 nm. In the wavelength range of 400 nm to 700 nm, the absorptivity of pheomelanin further increases as the wavelength becomes shorter. Therefore, a large amount of optical energy in the wavelength range of 400 nm to 700 nm increases the amount of optical energy absorbed by both of the eumelanin and pheomelanin. This increases the risk of occurrence of an unwanted side effect for the skin.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">The cosmetic light for body hair has a relatively small amount of optical energy in a wavelength range that allows for easy absorption of light by the oxygenated hemoglobin and melanin. Therefore, the cosmetic light for body hair obtains an excellent side effect inhibition effect.

third embodiment and the comparative example decreases as the energy density of light increases. The hair inhibition rates of the first embodiment to the third embodiment are generally smaller than the hair inhibition rate of the comparative example from immediately after irradiation. The hair inhibition rates of the first embodiment to the third embodiment approaches 0 as time elapses from immediately after the light irradiation, and the difference of the hair inhibition rate of each embodiment increases from that of the comparative example. More specifically, the cosmetic light for body hair of the first to third embodiments have a body hair cosmetic treatment effect for a longer period than the light of the comparative example.</p><p id="p0180" num="0180">The skin in the observation areas of the light irradiated mice and the non-light irradiated mice was observed to quantitatively evaluate the influence of the cosmetic light for body hair of the first to third embodiments and the comparative example on the skin.</p><p id="p0181" num="0181">A granular layer was collected from the skin of the observation area of each mouse immediately after the irradiation. The granular layers were compared. There was substantially no difference between the granular layers from the light irradiated mice irradiated with the cosmetic light for body hair of the embodiments and the granular layers from the non-light irradiated mice. There was a substantial difference between the granular layers from the light irradiated mice irradiated with the light of the comparative and the granular layers from the non-light irradiated mice. This finding indicates that the influence of the light of the comparative example is greater than the influence of the cosmetic light for body hair of the embodiments.
