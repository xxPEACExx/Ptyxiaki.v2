The MED process includes multiple stages or "effects". In each stage saline feed water is sprayed on tubular evaporators heated by steam flowing through the evaporator tubes. Part of the sprayed water evaporates and composes steam which feeds evaporator tubes of a subsequent stage. Once flowing through the evaporator tube the steam loses heat resulting in partial condensation. This releases thermal energy which heats and evaporates sprayed saline feed water collected on the evaporator tube. The condensed water flows from the evaporator tubes to a distillate reservoir. Since, from the second stage on, each stage reuses thermal energy from a previous stage, energy consumption of the process is low, e.g., 1,7 kW.h per m<sup>3</sup> of produced distilled water. A conventional MED reactor comprises 8 to 16 stages.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The non-evaporated volume of water in each stage passes between the evaporator tubes and is collected as brine. It is generally drained into a next stage, where it may flash off to generate additional vapor.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The evaporators should be arranged to maximize the contacting area for contacting sprayed feed water. This requires relatively large reactor space per volume of sprayed feed water.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A problem occurring with MED reactors is scale formation on the evaporator tubes. Scale formation in MED reactors hinders heat transfer process, increases specific energy consumption and reduces production capacity. It also creates costs due to allowance for scale formation by over-sizing heat transfer surface area and due to scale prevention methods, cleaning methods, and production losses during plant shutdown. Scaling occurs on the outside of the tubes, which hinders use of mechanical cleaning methods such as metallic ball cleaning systems.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to prevent scaling, the evaporator tubes should be fully wetted and dry spots should be prevented. Lower evaporator tubes are typically harder to wet than upper tubes of an evaporator tube bundle and particularly the lower sides of the tubes are difficult to wet and prone to scaling.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is an object of the invention to provide a reactor for the treatment of water, with improved efficiency, enabling a compact design and reducing the risk of scaling.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The object of the invention is achieved with a multiple effect distillation reactor, comprising a plurality of stages, at least part of the stages comprising a spray assembly and one or more evaporators operatively connected to a supply of a heating medium, such as steam. The spray assembly comprises electrospray nozzles configured to spray charged droplets. The evaporators are connected to one or more chargers for electrically charging the evaporators with a charge opposite to the charge of the sprayed droplets.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Less evaporation surface needs to be used since the charged droplets can be manipulated to collide with the evaporator<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> surface. This allows a more compact evaporator bundle consuming less reactor space.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The evaporators may for example include evaporator tubes or similar channels for transporting a heating medium, such as steam. The evaporator tubes can for example form a bundle of parallel tubes or tube sections, or a spiral or any other suitable configuration.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The reactor can be provided with a control unit for performing a process for desalination of seawater. The control unit can for example be programmed to manipulate the sprayed and charged droplets, the droplet deposition rate, the droplet size or the simple-jet mode (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>M. Cloupeau and B. Prunet-Foch, Electrohydrodynamic spraying functioning modes: A critical review, Journal of Aerosol Sciences, Vol. 25, p. 1021 - 1036, 1994</text></nplcit>) or other relevant flow control parameters.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">By manipulating the sprayed liquid wetting of the evaporator tubes can be increased. Particularly the lowers sides of the electrically charged evaporator tubes are easier to wet. The evaporator tubes can be covered with a liquid film of a more even thickness.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">By varying the droplet's charge, deposition on the evaporator surface can be controlled. This allows effective control of the film thickness on the evaporator tubes. Reduction of water film thickness improves heat transfer. Such system can allow a parallel sprayed wetting rate below 100 L.m<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup>.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The droplet deposition rate can be such that the liquid flows around each tube as a closed film curtain to a lower tube instead of dripping down. This results in improved wetting rate with the same total coverage (100% of the available area)<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> as obtained in current systems. This decreases the total sprayed volume without increasing the risk for scaling. Optionally, the potential difference between the sprayed droplets and the evaporator tubes may vary between the tubes, in particular the potential difference may be higher for lower tubes. This promotes a more even distribution of the collected liquid over the upper and lower tubes.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In an exemplary embodiment, at least one of the stages may comprise non-evaporative surfaces provided with a charger for applying a charge corresponding to the charge of the sprayed droplets. This causes repulsion of the charged droplets and reduces droplet deposition on other places than the evaporator.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A further advantage of electrically charging the evaporator tubes is the protection it provides against corrosion.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The flow rate per nozzle is a function of applied potential, i.e. a balance of electrical and inertia forces has to be achieved. Current flow rates are for example 250 - 500 ml/hour per nozzle, e.g., 300 - 400 ml/hour per nozzle. The potential difference between the nozzles and their respective counter electrodes can for example be about 2 - 10 kV. The total current spent to apply the potential may for example be around 0.1µA.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Good distillation efficiency can for example be achieved with droplets having an average particle diameter of about 0.5 - 0.7 mm. Average particle diameter is a function of the nozzle inner diameter, electric field intensity, applied flow rate and liquid physical properties. These droplets can for example be obtained with a flow rate of about 300 - 450 ml/h combined with a potential difference of 5 - 8 kV.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Optionally, the reactor may comprise one or more vapour compressors to compress supplied and/or recycled steam. By compressing steam pressure and temperature of the steam are increased. Steam can be compressed by thermocompression or mechanical vapour compression, such as vapour compression (VC) or vacuum vapour compression (VVC). In VC systems the evaporation effect takes place at manometric pressure, and in VVC systems evaporation takes place at sub-atmospheric pressures, e.g., under vacuum.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The disclosed MED reactor and process can be used for separating metal salts, such as alkali salts, in particular sodium chloride, from water. The MED reactor and process are particularly useful for the desalination of water, such as brackish water or seawater. It has been found that for every 10 liter of sea water, about two liter of fresh water can be produced. This is a 20% recovery rate, while in prior art systems his ratio is typically about 10 %.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">An exemplary embodiment of a multi effect distillation reactor is shown in the accompanying drawings.

The condensate is discharged and collected via the condensate collection line 11.

The assembly 3 is configured to spray seawater by electrohydrodynamic atomization and comprises a seawater reservoir 21 where seawater 22 is collected via a central seawater supply (not shown). The reservoir 21 further contains air 23 pressurized by means of a pump 24 to a pressure of about 1.2 - 1.6 bar.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The reservoir 21 comprises a bottom 26 with an array of evenly distributed metallic electrospray nozzles 27. In <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, a row of three electrospray nozzles 27 is shown. The number of electrospray nozzles 27 will typically be larger, e.g., 100 - 500 nozzles. The electrospray nozzles 27 can for instance produce a flow rate of about 250 - 500 ml/hour per nozzle.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The electrospray nozzles 27 have a tubular outlet 28 surrounded by a metallic ring shaped counter electrode 29. The rings 29 and the electrospray nozzles 27 are separated by an insulating layer 31. The metallic electrospray nozzles 27 are grounded and electrically connected to the associated counter electrode rings 29, which are kept at a selected potential, e.g., of 6 - 8 kV.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Due to the back pressure of the pressurized air 23 in the reservoir 21 the seawater is sprayed via the electrospray<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> nozzles 27. Flow rate distribution over the electrospray nozzles 27 can be controlled by adjusting the pressure of the pressurized air 23. The size of the sprayed droplets can be adjusted by manipulating the potential difference.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The sprayed droplets are electrified, e.g., with about 10 - 20 % of their Raleigh limit.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The evaporator tubes 4 are electrified with a charge opposite to the charge of the droplets. To this end, the evaporator tubes 4 are connected to one or more charger units 32.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The sprayed charged droplets are attracted by the oppositely charged evaporator tubes 4. A larger part of the droplets is collected by the charged evaporator tubes 4 and the evaporator tubes 4 are better wetted.

As a result the potential difference between the droplets on the one hand and the lower evaporator tubes 4 on the other hand is larger than with the higher evaporator tubes 4.
