In particular, but not exclusively, the present invention relates to apparatus which can constantly push retail items towards a front of a display shelf but which can easily be placed in a mode of operation in which a pusher plate or pusher bar is locked out of service so that shelf re-stocking can be conveniently carried out. </p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Successful shop retailing revolves around the efficient display of goods for sale. As early as the 1930s there have been mechanical systems to push forwards goods on a shelf so that they can easily be seen and reached by potential customers. Without such systems, shop staff must spend time keeping the goods on the shelves tidy and accessible. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In addition, in a process known as stock rotation, shop staff must avoid unnecessary wastage by trying to ensure that older stock is picked before newer goods. During stock rotation shelf stackers periodically have to visit shelves and remove non-sold goods and then re-stock the shelves trying to make sure that older goods are placed towards the front of a shelf so that they will be the next to be taken items when a customer wishes to make a purchase. This avoids goods for sale being unsold by their "sell by" date. In practice, some older items can be left accidentally on a shelf and never moved towards a location where they are next to be picked. Also, some shelf stackers, under time pressure, may fail to fully empty a shelf of old stock prior to adding new stock items for display at the front of a shelf. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Various techniques are known for constantly moving goods to the front of a shelf as they are taken one by one by customers. Most of the systems utilise a so-called pusher plate which is a movable plate of some kind which is constantly biased towards the front of a shelf. These constantly urge display items in a forwards motion. Such systems are known to make re-stocking difficult because the constant biasing force applied to the pusher plate itself often hinders the location of display 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 items. This issue has at least partly been addressed in GB2304102 which discloses the use of a latch to temporarily secure a pusher plate that is of a type arranged to urge merchandise goods suspended on a rail. However, such a system is only applicable in circumstances where display items include packaging which has an aperture that can be threaded over the display rail. In any other circumstances, goods would interfere with operation of the latch that is disclosed. Also the system is only able to manage the location of a single row of goods. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is also known that the space available for the display of goods in a retail environment is limited and valuable. There is a constant need to help maximise the use that is made of any available space. Typically, goods for sale in the form of display items are sold resting either directly on an upper surface of a shelf or in a pre-packed format in an array of rows in a carton or box which itself rests on the shelf. This carton or box is torn or cut into a dispensing state immediately before being placed on the shelf. Because different items that are to be displayed have different heights, a space above the displayed items, between a top of the items and a lower surface of an upper shelf, can often remain un-utilised. This is often the case even in situations where the shelves of a display unit can be adjusted in height. This leads to wastage and thus a lost opportunity to maximise income for a store owner. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is an aim of the present invention to at least partly mitigate the above-mentioned problems. It is an aim of certain embodiments of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method that can locate one or more display items at a desired location. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is an aim of certain embodiments of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus which allows re-stocking of a shelf to occur conveniently and efficiently. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is an aim of certain embodiments of the present invention to maximise utilisation of the space between adjacent shelves in a retail environment.

Embodiments of the present invention will now be described hereinafter, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: </p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Figure 1 illustrates rows of display items on a shelf in a retail environment; Figure 2 illustrates an unlatched support; </p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Figure 3 illustrates a pusher plate system latched in a restocking mode of operation; </p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Figure 4 illustrates a latched support; </p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Figure 5 illustrates a pusher plate system including four pusher plates extending downwards from an extendable cross bar; </p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Figure 6 illustrates a pusher plate system secured to a lower shelf; </p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Figure 7 illustrates a cross bar used to push display items without a pusher plate; and </p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Figure 8 illustrates an alternative support and sliding latch. </p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In the drawings like reference numerals refer to like parts. </p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Figure 1 illustrates a pusher mechanism 100 for locating one or more display items at a desired location according to an embodiment of the present invention. </p><p id="p0055" num="0055">It will be appreciated that throughout this specification reference is made to one or more display items. A display item is an item which is put on display for a shopper or 
<!-- EPO <DP n="11"/>-->
 other type of selector to pick. Such display items may be goods put on display for sale in a retail environment or may more generally be items stored awaiting use. It is further to be understood that the display items, which can be located according to certain embodiments of the present invention, may have a rigid fixed external shape or may instead include a flexible outer body with a slightly variable shape (an example would be a flexible bag containing multiple packets of crisps). </p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The pusher mechanism 100 shown in Figure 1 is shown secured between a lower shelf 1 10 and an upper shelf 1 15. The lower shelf 1 10 has an upper surface 120 which supports a lower end or base (not shown) of items on display. The display items thus rest directly on, and slide with respect to, the lower shelf upper surface 120. The upper shelf 1 15 has an upper surface 120 which may be used to support further display items. The lower shelf 1 10 and upper shelf 1 15 are substantially parallel and arranged in a spaced apart relationship. It will be appreciated that certain embodiments of the present invention can be utilised where there is only one lower shelf used to support display items and then an upper pusher arrangement may be wall mounted. Also, the distance between shelves may be adjustable. </p><p id="p0057" num="0057">As illustrated in Figure 1 , the lower shelf 1 10 includes a front display board 125 which can be used to display indicia such as product descriptions and prices to a potential customer which views the shelf in the direction shown by arrow A in Figure 1 . This viewing angle corresponds to a user standing in front of the shelf. The shelf may be above eye level, at eye level or below eye level. Each display item 130 shown by way of example in Figure 1 is illustrated as a substantially rectangular box. Each box has a front panel 135 spaced apart from a rear panel 140 and spaced apart sides and ends. The displayed boxes are shown in rows with a left hand side row 145 being substantially parallel to a right hand side row 150. Each row shown in Figure 1 includes 5 display items. It will be appreciated that certain embodiments of the present invention are not restricted to the number of rows used nor indeed the number of display items in any one row. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"/>-->
 The rows of display items are urged forwards in a direction opposite to the viewing direction illustrated by arrow A (that is to say, towards the front of a shelf) by a left hand side pusher plate 155 and a right hand side pusher plate 160. Each pusher plate is an example of a pusher element. Each of these pusher plates is held in a substantially vertical orientation substantially perpendicular to the upper surface 120 of the lower shelf 1 10 and is secured to a cross bar 170 by a respective variable length connecting bar 175. The cross bar 170 is secured to a tube-like support 175 which slides along a cylindrical rigid shaft 180. The support 175 slides between a front end region 181 of the shaft 180 and a rear end region 182. At the front end of the shaft 180 is a connector 185 which connects an end of the shaft to an upper surface of the lower shelf or, as shown in Figure 1 , to an underside of the upper shelf and carries a rotatable handle 186 which it conveniently presents to a user. This is conveniently located so that a re-stocker can turn the handle which causes a corresponding turning motion for the rotatable rigid elongate shaft 180. At the rear end region 182 of the shaft 180 is a further connector 190 which is used to connect the elongate shaft 180 to either the lower shelf 1 10 or, as illustrated in Figure 1 , an underside surface of the upper shelf 1 15. A rolled leaf spring 195 extends between a coil 196 carried on the cross bar 170 to a coil end which is secured to the front of the shaft 180 via the front connector 185. The rolled leaf spring continually biases the cross bar 170 so that the pusher plates 155, 160 are constantly urged towards a front of the shelf. This biasing action means that as display items are removed from the front of the shelf new display items are continually brought forward for a customer's convenience and accessibility. </p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Figure 2 illustrates the handle 186 secured on the shaft 180 in more detail and helps illustrate a latching mechanism which is used according to certain embodiments of the present invention. As illustrated in Figure 2 the support 175 is an elongate hollow body that slides along an outer surface 200 of the shaft 180. Because the support is a relatively long piece and an inner surface of the support rides in a closely juxtaposed relationship with the outer surface 200 of the shaft, twisting is 
<!-- EPO <DP n="13"/>-->
 prevented. This means that multiple rows of display items, which might include one or more rows offset from a longitudinal axis X associated with the shaft 180 can be pushed by a single pusher system. Although the support 175 is illustrated in the embodiment shown as a substantially cylindrical body it will be understood that other hollow elongate shapes could be utilised such as hexagonal shapes so long as the outer surface 200 of the shaft has a configuration which means that the support can slide without a risk of substantial twisting. </p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Also illustrated in Figure 2 is a sliding latch illustrated as a hook 210. The hook 210 is secured to the support 175 at a fixed end 215 of the hook 210 via securing rivets. A free end 225 of the hook 210 includes a leg 230 which faces towards the outer surface 200 of the shaft 180. A tip 240 of the free end of the sliding latch is constantly urged against the outer surface 200 of the shaft due to the resilient and spring like nature of the material of the hook. </p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Also illustrated in Figure 2 is a shaft latch 250 which is provided as a groove cut out of the outer surface 200 of the shaft 180. The groove provides a recess in the shaft that does not extend circumferentially around the whole of the shaft. Rather, the latch 250 is a cut out section that aptly extends about around 90° of the circumference. Aptly, the cut out section extends about around 180°, 120°, 1 10°, 100°, 80°, 70°, 60°, 40°, 30° or 20°. By rotating the handle 186 the shaft 180 is made to turn and this causes a corresponding turning motion of the latch 250 of the shaft. It will be appreciated that in this way the latch can be rotated into a position in which it will align with the tip 240 of the sliding latch and engage together ultimately if the support 175 is urged in a rearwards motion. The shaft latch 250 is located a fixed distance from a back end of the rotatable shaft 180 near the connector 190. </p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Figure 2 also illustrates how the connector 190 supports an end of the shaft and includes a connecting plate 260 which carries apertures 270 for screws or bolts to be secured to an underside of an upper shelf and/or magnets 280 which can be utilised to secure the connector to an underside of the upper shelf if the upper shelf is of a 
<!-- EPO <DP n="14"/>-->
 metallic material. Similar securing mechanisms can be provided on the front connector 185. Alternatively, the front connector can remain free. </p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Figure 3 illustrates how the support 175 may be latched to the shaft 180. In the position shown, the support 175 has been pushed backwards either by hand or by personnel using a rod (not shown). The cross bar is pushed backwards with the handle 186 turned into an orientation whereby the shaft latch is arranged to receive the tip 240 of the latch which slides with the support 175. Pushing the cross bar 170 backwards towards a rear of the shelf occurs until the tip which slides on an outer surface of the shaft urges itself into the cut out recess 250. When this occurs, the cross bar no longer needs to be pushed backwards but forward motion of the cross bar is prevented. Operation of the latch thus provides three separate modes of operation. In a first mode of operation the shaft is in a rotational position whereby the cut out section is rotatably orientated so that it would receive a tip of the sliding latch. This may be referred to as an active state. In the mode of operation illustrated in Figure 3, the sliding latch is secured to the shaft latch by virtue of the tip being located in the cut out section. This restrains movement of the pusher plates 155, 160, cross bar 170 and support 175. Motion in a longitudinal direction along the shaft is thereby prevented. </p><p id="p0063" num="0063">In a second mode of operation, it will be appreciated that the shaft may be rotated so that the cut out section 250 is no longer aligned in a way which allows the tip of the sliding latch to engage in the recess. This orientation will occur when a re-stocking procedure has been carried out and a re-stocker twists the handle 186 to release the sliding latch from the shaft. Immediately thereafter the pusher plates move to a rear of the backmost items and will begin to push those items towards a front of the display. Figure 3 illustrates how movement of display items may in fact be limited by part of the packaging 300 in which the display items are delivered to a store with parts of the packaging 300 being torn away prior to use. A front edge 310 of the packaging can be utilised as a stop to prevent the pusher plate urging items off the front of the shelf. The front 125 of the shelf may itself act as a stop if packaging 300 is not utilised or if the packaging itself needs a stop. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="15"/>-->
 In the second mode of operation, the shaft is thus not in a pre-determined rotational position to align the cut out recess for engagement with the sliding latch. The shaft latch is thus in an inactive state. The shaft latch is also in a state which is unsecured to the sliding latch to permit movement of the pusher plates and support along the shaft away from the shaft latch member. </p><p id="p0064" num="0064">It will be appreciated that in a third mode of operation which will occur when a re- stocker approaches a shelf and wishes to re-stock the shelf, the shaft is rotated by turning the handle 186 to align the recess 250, which constitutes the shaft latch, into an active state. At this time, the pusher plates 155, 160 may be well towards the front region of the shelf as they will have pushed items during a period of time towards that front region whilst items are removed by shoppers or other selectors. The pusher plates can thus continue to push items even though the shaft itself has been turned so as to align the recess in a pre-determined rotational position. A re- stocker can thereafter push the pusher plates, cross bar and support backwards to secure the sliding latch with the shaft latch and locate the system into the first mode of operation when the urging mechanism is effectively taken out of operation. The constant urging which would otherwise interfere with a re-stocking process is thus avoided. </p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Figure 4 illustrates the arrangement of the support 175, sliding latch 210 and shaft latch 250 in more detail. This corresponds to the first mode of operation. As illustrated in Figure 4, the tip 240 of the sliding latch 210 is engaged in the recess 250 of the shaft. This prevents motion of the support 175 towards the front of the shaft by overcoming the biasing force which is exerted by the spring 195. Figure 4 helps illustrate how, if the handle 186 is rotated, this will cause the recess 250 to rotate and eventually this will cause a disengagement of the tip 240 of the sliding latch from the recess. This releases the support which can thereafter slide along the shaft.

 Figure 5 illustrates parts of an alternative embodiment of the present invention in which the cross bar 170, which has a generally U-shaped cross section for rigidity purposes, can also carry one or more arms (two shown in Figure 5) which can be used to extend a length of the cross bar 170. As illustrated in Figure 5, a first extendable arm 510 extends from a first end 515 of the cross bar 170. The degree of extension of the first arm 510 from the cross bar can be selected by a user using a releasable securing pin 517 as will be understood by those skilled in the art. The first extendable arm 510 carries a respective pusher plate 518 which is connected to the side arm 510 by a variable length connector 519. A further extendable arm 520 extends away from a further end 525 of the cross bar 170 and a degree of extension of the arm 520 with respect to the end of the cross bar is likewise selected by a releasable pin 527 as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. The further extendable arm 520 carries a respective pusher plate 528 which itself is connected to the cross arm via a variable length connector 529. </p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Figure 5 also helps illustrate how the spring may be secured according to certain other embodiments of the present invention. It will be appreciated that the coil and coil end could be connected in other ways to create an urging force on the pusher mechanism. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 5, an end 530 of the spring is riveted to the connector 185 and the coil 596 is mounted on a bracket 598 which moves with the support 175 and cross bar 170. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the pusher system illustrated in Figure 5 can be utilised to push four rows of items simultaneously or can be utilised to push particularly wide items in one or more rows. The arrangement shown provides a good deal of versatility to those needing to display items and re-stock shelves of items. </p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The embodiments described with respect to Figure 1 to 5 each illustrate a method for locating display items at a desired location, such as at a front of a shelf. In each case, a pusher element provided by one or more pusher plates is mounted on a mounting member. The shaft 180 is an example of a mounting member. The mounting member is secured to an underside of an upper shelf 1 15. Display items are urged along a display surface on a lower shelf which is substantially parallel and 
<!-- EPO <DP n="17"/>-->
 spaced apart from the shelf on which the mounting member is fixed. By securing the mounting rod to an underside surface of an upper shelf, the space on the lower shelf is maximised for display purposes. Since this area under an upper shelf is often under-utilised in the retail environment, this makes for a very efficient and cost effective system. It will be appreciated that whilst certain embodiments have been described so far in which the mounting member is a rotatable shaft, certain embodiments of the present invention may utilise more conventional mounting techniques such as using a frame with a swan neck end or other elongate structure. Of course, such structures could not be utilised with the particular latching mechanism which has been described. The mounting shaft (or mounting frame or other such mounting member) can be secured to the underside surface of an upper shelf by one or more connectors of the type shown or of many different connecting types, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Figure 6 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the present invention in which a pusher mechanism 600 is not mounted on an underside of an upper shelf but rather is mounted on a shelf 610 on which display items are to be supported. More particularly, the display items can rest on an upper surface 620 of the shelf 610. The display items thus rest directly on, and slide with respect to, the shelf surface 620. It will be appreciated that if items are to be supported indirectly on the upper surface 620 via part of the packaging normally used to transport items, then a height of the pushing elements (described in more detail below) must be raised an appropriate distance above the surface 620. As illustrated in Figure 6, the shelf 610 includes a front display board 625. This can be used to display indicia such as product descriptions and prices to a potential customer and also acts as a stop to prevent items spilling over the front edge of the shelf when a pushing mechanism is energised. The row or rows of display items are urged forwards in a direction illustrated as an urging direction by arrow B. The urging of items is performed by an upstanding pusher plate 655 which extends upwardly via a variable length connector 660 
<!-- EPO <DP n="18"/>-->
 secured to an extendable arm 665 which extends outwardly from a cross bar 670. The cross bar 670 is secured to a cylindrical support 675 which slides along a cylindrical rigid shaft 680. The support 675 slides between a front end region 681 of the shaft 680 and a rear end region 682. At the front end of the shaft 680 is a connector 685 which connects an end of the shaft to the upper surface 620 of shelf 610. The connector 685 carries a rotatable handle 686 which it conveniently presents to a user. This is conveniently located so that a re-stocker can turn the handle which causes a corresponding turning motion for the rotatable rigid elongate shaft 680. At the rear end region 682 of the shaft 680 is a further connector 690 which is upstanding from and is used to connect the shelf to the shaft. </p><p id="p0068" num="0068">A rolled leaf spring 695 extends between a coil 696 carried on the cross bar 670 to a coil end which is secured to the front of the shaft 680 via that front connector 685. The rolled leaf spring continually biases the cross bar 670 so that the pusher plate 655 and extendable arm 665 and cross bar 670 are constantly urged towards the front of the shelf. This biasing action means that as display items are removed from the front of the shelf, new display items are continually brought forward for a customer's convenience and accessibility. </p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Figure 7 illustrates how certain embodiments of the present invention can be utilised without pusher plates. Rather the cross bar 670 and/or extendable arm 665 can alone be used to push items towards a desired location. As illustrated in Figure 7, a side surface 700 of the extendable arm 665 and a side surface 710 of the cross bar 670 will, in use, provide an abutment surface which can be urged by the pusher system against an external opposed surface of one or more items on display on the surface 620. The cross bar could be T-shaped or H-shaped according to certain other embodiments of the present invention where pusher plates weren't wanted. </p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Figure 8 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the present invention which in many respects is similar to that shown in Figure 6. Figure 8 illustrates a reverse view to 
<!-- EPO <DP n="19"/>-->
 that of Figure 6 and helps illustrate how according to certain other embodiments of the present invention the support 875 may be a body such as a block-like body which is drilled through with a cylindrical hole. The inner surface of the hole thus slides along the cylindrical outer surface of the shaft 680. The sliding latch 880 illustrated in Figure 8 is in the form of a plate 885 which pivots about a pivot point 887. A free end 890 of the plate 885 is urged towards an outer surface of the shaft by a sprung plate 892. It will be appreciated that other forms of biasing mechanism can be applied to the plate 885 so that the free end 890 of the plate 885 is constantly biased against the outer surface of the shaft. The thickness and shape of the free end of the plate are selected so that they can be located in the groove formed in the shaft to engage the sliding latch with the shaft latch. The plate 885 can be disengaged from a latched mode by rotating the handle 686 to rotate the shaft 680 which rotates the groove in the shaft out of an orientation which allows the plate to lock into the groove. Once rotation has occurred, linear movement of the support 875 along the shaft can occur. </p><p id="p0071" num="0071">Certain embodiments of the present invention have been described hereinabove with respect to a slidable latch in the form of a hook which can be driven into engagement with a recess in a rotatable shaft. Rotation of the shaft causes the latch to be able to lock in and out of engagement. It will be appreciated that certain other embodiments of the present invention utilise different mating parts on the rotatable shaft and the sliding support. For example, an eye and pin mechanism could be utilised. Rotation of the shaft into and out an active orientation can release a latch from engagement or can align a latch for engagement when the support and pusher plate mechanisms are pushed towards the rear of the mounting member. </p><p id="p0072" num="0072">Throughout the description and claims of this specification, the words "comprise" and "contain" and variations of them mean "including but not limited to" and they are not intended to (and do not) exclude other moieties, additives, components, integers or steps.
