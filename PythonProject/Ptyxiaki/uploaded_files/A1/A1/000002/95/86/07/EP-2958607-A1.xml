Moreover the present invention relates to a method for coating catheter balloons with a pharmacological active agent and an aqueous solution of shellac. Implantation of vessel grafts such as stents has become a well-established surgical intervention for the treatment of stenosis. In this context, so-called restenosis (recurrent stenosis), i.e. the reocclusion of the vessel is a frequently occurring complication. There's no exact definition of the term restenosis to be found in literature. The most frequently used morphological definition of restenosis defines restenosis as a reduction of the vessel diameter to less than 50% of the normal value subsequent to successful PTA (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty). Said definition describes an empirically determined value and its hemodynamic meaning and association with clinical symptoms lack scientific background. In practice, clinical deterioration in a patient is often considered a sign for the occurrence of restenosis in the previously treated vessel section. </p><p id="p0003" num="0003">To avoid such problems, a so-called "biological stenting" may be performed using only a coated catheter balloon without any stent, i.e. the vessels are dilated at a constricted site by the dilatation of a coated catheter balloon, wherein, while the catheter balloon is dilated for a short period of time, a sufficient amount of pharmacological agent is transferred to the vessel wall to avoid re-constriction or reocclusion of the vessel due to the dilatation of the vessel and the delivery of active agents. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Nowadays, it is known that active agents can be applied to a balloon catheter with various matrix-substances, including substances such as the terpenoid shellolic acid. The active agents are released during the balloon inflation at the stenosis, in order to penetrate the arterial wall segment, in order to evolve their antiproliferative and anti- inflammatory effects on the smooth muscle cells and to suppress proliferation in the vessel lumen. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Suppression of cellular reactions is mainly accomplished during the first days and weeks by means of preferably antiproliferative, immunosuppressive and/or antiphlogistic agents and their likewise active derivatives /analogues and metabolites.

 The international patent application WO 2004/028582 A1 discloses multifold balloons which are coated, especially within the folds, with a composition of a pharmacological agent and a contrast medium. A method for spray coating catheter balloons is described in WO 2004/006976 A1 . </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">WO 2008/046641 discloses coatings for implants, not mentioning catheter or catheter balloons comprising a combination of shellac and paclitaxel. Thereby WO 2008/046641 refers to stents in particular showing in vitro release kinetics of stents coated with 1 .0% / 0.5% shellac composite. It was shown that stents coated with rapamycin only released the drug more efficiently in contrast to shellac and rapamycin coated stents, which released the drug much slower. Shellac was deemed to be useful to modulate the release kinetics of an implant-based, e.g. stent- based compound to slow the release kinetic (more than 60 days). Such a retardation of drug release is not favourable for a catheter balloon, where it is the main goal, in contrast to a stent, to release as much of the coated drug in a time frame as short as possible. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">EP2421572 discloses coating method of a catheter balloon using a solution of paclitaxel together with shellac in a suitable organic solvent such as acetone, ethyl acetate, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, THF, chloroform, methylene chloride. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The authors of a publication in Circulation 2004, Vol. 1 10, 810 - 814 demonstrated that catheter balloons coated with pure Paclitaxel did not show any therapeutic effect. A therapeutic effect was only achieved when the Paclitaxel was combined with the contrast agent solution ULTRAVIST<sup>®</sup> ULTRAVIST<sup>®</sup> is a solution of the contrast agent iopromide. The same observation was made by Cremers et al., Clin. Res. Cardiol., 2008, 97 - Suppl.1 . Therefore, it is an objective of the present invention to apply an active agent, especially preferred the active agent paclitaxel or sirolimus, onto a catheter balloon in such a manner that a coating is created which is homogenously detached from the balloon and can be effectively transferred to the vessel wall so that an optimal bioavailability of the active agent and a therapeutic effect concerning reduction of restenosis can be achieved. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Said objective is solved by the technical teaching of the independent claims. Further advantageous embodiments of the invention result from the dependent claims, the description, the figures and the examples.

 Surprisingly it has been found that a catheter balloon comprising a coating with an active agent and a shellac alkali salt or preferred a shellac ammonium salt, is suited for resolving said objective. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Thus the present invention relates to a catheter balloon comprising a coating with an active agent and a water soluble shellac salt such as a shellac alkali salt or a shellac ammonium salt. In the following such a coating with an active agent and a water soluble shellac salt such as a shellac alkali salt, preferred a shellac ammonium salt, is called "Shellaqua"-coating. The preferred water soluble salt of shellac is a shellac ammonium salt. The term "water soluble" refers to a solubility in water at 25°C of at least 30 g/L, preferably of at least 40 g/L, preferably of at least 50 g/L, preferably of at least 60 g/L, preferably of at least 70 g/L, preferably of at least 80 g/L, preferably of at least 90 g/L, and most preferably at 25°C of at least 100 g/L. Thus the term "Shellaqua" refers to a coating comprising or consisting of a water soluble shellac salt, especially an ammonium salt of shellac, and an active agent, preferably an antirestenotic agent and most preferably paclitaxel or rapamycin. This coating called Shellaqua may further comprise a fatty acid, preferably an unsaturated fatty acid but does preferably not contain any further ingredients and does especially not contain synthetic polymers. Thus the Shellaqua coating preferably consists of a water soluble shellac salt, especially an ammonium salt of shellac and an antirestenotic agent preferably paclitaxel or rapamycin or consists of a water soluble shellac salt, especially an ammonium salt of shellac and a fatty acid preferably an unsaturated fatty acid and an antirestenotic agent preferably paclitaxel or rapamycin. The term "ammonium" refers to NH <sup>+</sup>. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The inventor could show that using a catheter balloon having the inventive "Shellaqua"-coating increases the amount of active agent transferred during balloon inflation about ten times compared to a catheter balloon coated with the active agent and shellac in its acid form. Furthermore it's the first time that such high concentrations of the active agent paclitaxel could be observed in the vessel wall after deployment of a coated catheter balloon. The "Shellaqua"-coating is apparently much better suited to facility a transfer of the active agent from the catheter balloon to the vessel wall than shellac in its acidic form. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The term "alkali salts" or "alkali" as used herein refer to a basic, ionic salt of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal element. The water soluble shellac salt also called herein shellac alkali salt may be a potassium salt, an ammonium salt, a basic amino acid salt and/or a mixture thereof.

 Shellac is the general term for the refined form of lac, a natural polyester resin secreted by insects. Lac insects belong to the order of Hemiptera, superfamily Coccoidea such as Metatachardia, Laccifer, Tachordiella, and others, however, members of two families— Lacciferidae and Tachardinidae are more prominent in lac secretion. The one that is commercially cultured is Kerria lacca, which is also known by such synonyms as Laccifer lacca Ker, Tachardia lacca, and Carteria lacca. Kerria lacca is an Indian scale insect, which infests branches of numerous trees from the East Indies, such as Butea frondos Rosch, Acacia arabica Willd and Ficus religiosa Linn. Broken branches are sold as stick lac and, after grounding and washing with water to eliminate wood and red pigments (lac dye), seed lac is obtained. Raw material shellac consists of 70-80% resin, 4-8% dye, 6-7% hard and high gloss finished wax, 3% water, up to 9% vegetable and animal impurities and aroma substances. Purification of seed lac gives the more homogeneous product known as shellac. The major components of shellac are aleuritic, jalaric and shellolic acids, as well as butolic and kerrolic acids. Seed lac and orange shellac contain approximately 5-6% wax and two coloring components, the water soluble laccaic acid and the water insoluble erythrolaccin. A possibility for chemical description of resin molecule is a structure model where in each case 4 molecules jalaric or laccijalaric acid and aleuritic acid are connected by ester bonding alternately. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><img id="imgf000006_0001" he="43" wi="143" file="imgf000006_0001.tif" img-format="tif" img-content="drawing" orientation="portrait" inline="no"/></p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> jalaric acid (I) laccijalaric acid (II) Its chemical composition is almost constant, although the amount of some components changes depending on the nature of host trees on which the insects grows. By Cannizzaro-type disproportionation under alkaline hydrolysis will be synthesized from these acids shellolic acid (IV) and derivate compounds. Purified shellac consists of two main components. These components are 9,10,16- trihydroxypalmitic acid (aleuritic acid) CAS [53-387-9] and shellolic acid (IV).

Their properties and color depend on the raw material (seedlac), the method for refining, and the processing parameters. Three very different processes are used for refining the seed lac to shellac (bleaching, melting, and solvent extraction), resulting in products with different characteristics and properties. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017">By the bleaching process refined bleached or white shellac is obtained by dissolving seed lac in an aqueous alkaline solution, which is then filtered, dewaxed, and bleached with sodium hypochlorite to completely remove the color. However, changes in the molecular structure and the addition of chlorine substituents may lead to self-crossl inking and polymerization. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018">After melting the seed lac, the highly viscous molten lac is pressed through a filter and drawn to a thin film. Once cooled, the film breaks into thin flakes. The shellac wax is not removed by this process and the color depends on the type of seed lac used. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Solvent extraction is a very gentle process for refining shellac. The seed lac is dissolved in ethanol, and wax and impurities are removed by filtration. Activated carbon is used to produce light-colored grades. After a further filtration step and the removal of ethanol, the resin is drawn to a thin film, which breaks into flakes after cooling. The properties of the final product depend on the type of seed lac used and are influenced by the processing parameters and the grade of activated carbon. </p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Followings are the commercial grades of shellac: </p><p id="p0021" num="0021"> - Seedlac </p><p id="p0022" num="0022"> - Hand Made Shellac </p><p id="p0023" num="0023"> - Machine Made Shellac

Shellac has been used for pharmaceutical and controlled release coatings for a long time. It has usually been applied in the form of alcoholic solutions (pharmaceutical glazes) or solutions using other organic solvents. </p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Shellac, like other polymers with carboxyl groups, is not soluble in water. It is soluble in ethanol, methanol and partially soluble in ether, ethyl acetate and chloroform. However, it is possible to prepare aqueous shellac solutions of alkali salts or ammonium salts. The selection of the base and the method for dissolving will influence the properties of the film, in regard to the present invention ammonium is preferable. Therefore ammonium carbonate was chosen as a preferred base. Another preferred embodiment refers to ammonium bicarbonate as base. Ammonium bicarbonate is also known as ammonium hydrogen carbonate (NH HCO3). The preferred water soluble shellac salt in regard to the present invention is shellac ammonium salt having CAS number [68308-35-0]. There are several disadvantages associated with the use of organic solvents in general: </p><p id="p0027" num="0027"> 1 . They are flammable and toxic </p><p id="p0028" num="0028"> 2.

The application of aqueous shellac solutions of water soluble shellac salts, such as Aqualacca<sup>®</sup> or Aquagold<sup>®</sup> does not only avoid the problems with organic solvent systems but also reproves the performance of the obtained coating by stable dissolution or respectively release characteristics, especially after extended storage time and result in improved mechanical properties compared to coatings comprising shellac but not the basic shellac salt. A balloon catheter coated using a shellac salt according to the invention and especially an ammonium shellac salt has a coating being less brittle so that less particles of the coating crumble away during deployment. Less number or particles released during catheter balloon placement decrease the risk of micro embolism clearly. The solubility and transfer rate of the coating is increase by using a basic shellac salt instead of shellac as such. It seems that this increase in solubility is caused by the presence of shellac as basic salt not by the solvent. Therefore it is also possible to use an aqueous solution of an ammonium salt of shellac sediment the salt and the active agent and solve the resulting pellet in an organic solvent in order to coat the catheter balloon. This method is preferred if the used active agent is not soluble in an aqueous solution. </p><p id="p0056" num="0056">One aspect of the method according to the invention comprises that a catheter balloon and preferably an uncoated catheter balloon or a catheter balloon without any releasable active agent in its surface is provided. Than a solution of an active agent and an aqueous shellac solution is prepared and applied sequentially using conventional coating methods such as spray coating, dip coating etc. in order to obtain after the drying step a solid coating on the surface of the catheter balloon.

 Another aspect of the inventive method comprises that one aqueous solution containing an active agent and shellac is prepared. Subsequently, this solution is applied on the surface of a catheter balloon and preferably an uncoated catheter balloon or a catheter balloon without any releasable active agent in its surface using conventional coating methods like the one mentioned above. Shellac contains carboxyl groups. It is not soluble in water, but it can dissolve at higher pH, so it is possible to prepare aqueous shellac solutions of alkali salts or ammonium salts. Therefore the term "aqueous solution of shellac" as used herein refers always to shellac dissolved in aqueous solution of inorganic alkalis so that a shellac alkali salt originates. By the physical drying of the aqueous solution of shellac a film of the shellac alkali salt forms wherein at least one active agent is incorporated. The term "inorganic alkali" refers to substances which are basic in water (pH &gt; 7.0) and which contain cations which form a water soluble salt with shellac. Aqueous solutions are easy to handle and allow the production of films that lack the aging instability of films made using organic solvents. Therefore using aqueous shellac solutions the performance of the resulting polymer film is improved by stable dissolution characteristics even after extended storage time. A suitable alkali salt in regard to this invention may be selected from the group consisting of sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, calcium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, ammonia, ammonium carbonate, and ammonium bicarbonate. Preferably the salt is a solution of an alkali salt is a solution of ammonia, ammonium carbonate, or ammonium bicarbonate. The solutions may be prepared by dissolved shellac directly in the alkali solution. For example shellac is directly dissolved in ammonium carbonate solution and the excess ammonia evaporates as NH<sub>3</sub>. Alternatively a ready to use aqueous shellac solution may be used like AQUALACCA 25<sup>®</sup> distributed by Chemacon GmbH or SSB AQUAGOLD (based on shellac SSB 57 dewaxed Orange shellac) distributed by Stroever GmbH &amp; Co. KG. It is preferred that the aqueous solution of shellac alkali salt, preferably shellac ammonium salt, contains 10 - 30% solids, more preferably 20 - 25% solids and has a pH of 7 - 7.5.

In addition to this vertical concentration gradient a longitudinal or horizontal concentration gradient can be present so that the concentration of the active agent decreases from the middle of the catheter balloon to the distal end and proximal end of the catheter balloon.

 present invention relates to a balloon catheter comprising a "Shellaqua"-coating with sirolimus. </p><p id="p0095" num="0095">It was surprisingly found that an "Shellaqua"-coating, comprising paclitaxel or sirolimus is therapeutically highly useful in keeping blood vessels open, in reducing the late lumen loss and in reducing restenosis. The film which results from the aqueous shellac solution after drying is more elastic or less friable compared to the coatings obtained with alcoholic solutions so that an optimized transfer of the active agent to the lesion site is obtained. Furthermore this causes that the risk of thrombosis is reduced. </p><p id="p0096" num="0096">An active agent, especially sirolimus or paclitaxel, itself is no warrant for an optimal prophylaxis of restenosis. The active agent-eluting catheter balloon has to meet the requirements in its entirety. Besides the determination of dosing the active agent elution has to be effective during the short time of dilatation (around 30 sec). The active agent elution does not depend only on the physical and chemical properties of the active agent but depends also on the properties of the utilized matrix and the interactions of the matrix and the active agent. The inventive balloon coating ensures that the at least one an antiproliferative, immunosuppressive, anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and/or anti-thrombotic agent, preferably sirolimus or paclitaxel, is released directly and clearly to the vessel wall during balloon inflation because the active agent in the coating is approximate to the surface of the coating. The active agent is immediately and clearly purer and highly concentrated when brought into contact to the vessel wall. </p><p id="p0097" num="0097">The clinical benefit is the purer drug delivery, leading to a significantly higher bioavailability in arterial tissues having less unwanted side effects. The inventive coating is compared to the coating made from alcoholic solutions less sticky so that the transfer to the vessel wall is more uniform having less residuals on the balloon after dilatation. The use of a water soluble shellac salt such as Aqualacca<sup>®</sup> or Aquagold<sup>®</sup> enables manufacture of a more homogenous coating which causes a homogenous transfer and a homogenous release of the active agent to the area of the lesion site. This higher drug concentration in the tissue of the vessel wall provides increased effectiveness against migration and proliferation of vascular muscle cells towards the lumen of the artery at the site of the treated stenosis (lesion site). Neointimal hyperplasia is more effectively suppressed.

 In addition to this vertical concentration gradient which is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the catheter balloon, a horizontal concentration gradient could be present in a further preferred embodiment. Such a horizontal concentration gradient means that in the middle of the catheter balloon the highest concentration of the active agent is present and this concentration of the active agent will decrease in proximal and also in distal direction so that the lowest active agent concentration is present at the proximal and distal ends of the catheter balloon. </p><p id="p0110" num="0110">Since the "Shellaqua"-coating is hard to characterize, the present invention relates also to coated balloon catheters obtained according to the inventive coating methods disclosed herein as well as to balloon catheter and dilatation catheter comprising such a catheter balloon. In comparison to coatings prepared using alcoholic solutions of shellac the stability of the release kinetics from this coating is increased and the polymeric film on the balloon catheter has better mechanical properties.

Subsequently, an arterial sheath was introduced to the left or right femoral artery utilizing percutaneous Seldinger technique. An initial bolus of heparin (~ 400 U/kg) was administered and ACT was measured every 30 minutes to maintain ACT time of at least 300 seconds. Coronary angiograms were performed after administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin (200 g). The selection of the target site was made based on visual assessment of anatomy and quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) analysis. These sites were chosen for the avoidance of side branches and segments with tapering greater than 10% to ensure uniform interaction of the stent coating with the arterial wall. The injury balloon was then inflated at a steady rate to a pressure sufficient to achieve a balloon to artery ratio of 1 .2-1 .3:1 .0.

 Comment: The present study revealed a tissue paclitaxel level of mean 28.79 g /g 1 h post dilation, which is lower than the desired tissue drug level (according to the literature).
