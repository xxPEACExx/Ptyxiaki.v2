Even training systems which were developed some time ago, for example "Pilates", invented at the start of the twentieth century, have greatly come back into favour based on new knowledge and innovations relating to exercise machines and devices. Background art </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> The most basic and widespread of such devices include thick and thin mats used for supporting the bodies of those persons who carry out "floor" exercises. Initially the fact that they were made from traditional materials guaranteed simply a certain degree of mechanical and thermal insulation, avoiding contact between the body and the bare floor. Subsequently, more specific materials were adopted, such as rubbers, sponges, paddings of various types, until the arrival of expanded (foam) plastic materials, such as polyurethane, EVA and others, able to guarantee greater effectiveness and comfort during use. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> Recently, in the technical field of the sector, more technologically evolved 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 apparatuses have become widespread, being able to improve and expand the range of performance. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> For example, this is the case with mats made of soft plastic material, having through holes which allow the application of accessories and shaped members on them for performing exercises. One such device is described in US patent 2010/0299833, but it shows several significant limitations. The first of them is due to the fact that, at the shaped members applied on the upper face of the mat, rigid fixing plates project on the lower face, which tend to alter the planarity of the mat. Moreover, the fitting and removal of such shaped members are quite laborious, making the device in question not very versatile, particularly if it needs to be used for a wide range of exercises and for various exercise disciplines. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Moreover, since such mats are usually made of flexible material, they cannot support tall accessories, such as vertical handles or rods for gripping or pushing, able to cause bending stresses on the mat which it cannot withstand. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Multi-layer mats are also used for floor exercises, comprising rigid layers able to guarantee a flat shape for the whole assembly, and soft layers, particularly in contact with the body of the person exercising, able to guarantee comfort and safety. However, in that case, as described for example in patent DEI 0200013, accessories cannot be applied to the mat. That means limitations making such devices incompatible with multi-purpose use, which in contrast is preferably required by operators in the sector. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Disclosure of the invention </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> The aim of this invention is, therefore, to eliminate the above-mentioned limitations and disadvantages. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> The invention, whose features are described in the claims, achieves the aim by using a supporting platform for various exercises, consisting of alternating soft and rigid layers and having a plurality of cavities, in which supports can be inserted using a quick-coupling system. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The main advantage of this invention is basically the fact that the presence of supports, associated with slots in the thickness of the platform, guarantees the platform stability and maximum comfort for the user. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 Another advantage of the invention is the fact that the association of the supports with the slots by means of quick couplings allows fast, easy changing of the setup of the device depending on the exercises to be performed, making it particularly versatile and practical. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A further advantage of the invention is the fact that the shape of the platforms makes them easy to move manually and to reposition in limited spaces. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Finally, the shape of the supports allows them to be associated with accessories which have various outlines, depending on the exercises to be performed. Brief description of the drawings </p><p id="p0018" num="0018"> Further advantages and features of the invention are more apparent in the detailed description which follows, with reference to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate a preferred embodiment without limiting the scope of the invention, in which: </p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Figure 1 is a perspective assembly view of the invention; </p><p id="p0020" num="0020"> Figure 2 is a cross-section of the invention according to the line II - II from Figure 1 , with some parts cut away to better illustrate others; </p><p id="p0021" num="0021"> Figure 3 is a bottom view of the invention, with some parts cut away to better illustrate others; </p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Figure 4 is a cross-section of the invention according to the line IV - IV from Figure 3; </p><p id="p0023" num="0023"> Figure 5 is a bottom view of a possible alternative embodiment of the invention, with some parts cut away to better illustrate others; </p><p id="p0024" num="0024"> Figure 6 is a cross-section of the invention according to the line VI - VI from Figure 5; </p><p id="p0025" num="0025"> Figure 7 is a cross-section similar to that shown in Figure 4 of a further alternative embodiment; </p><p id="p0026" num="0026"> Figure 8 is a bottom plan view of a detail of the invention; </p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Figure 9 is a perspective view of the detail of Figure 8. </p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention </p><p id="p0029" num="0029"> An exercise device comprises a multi-layer platform 1 , intended to support a user,

 consisting of at least a soft upper layer la and at least a rigid lower layer lb, and provided with cavities 2, in which it is possible to insert from above a plurality of anchoring elements 3 for anchoring to the platform 1, which can be removably connected at one end 3b to the cavities 2, without any projection emerging below said platform 1. </p><p id="p0030" num="0030"> The mutual connection of the platform 1 and the anchoring element 3 occurs, as illustrated in Figures 5 and 6, thanks to the interaction between matching surfaces 10b, 30b, respectively located on the rigid lower layer lb of the platform 1 and on the end 3b of the anchoring element 3, as a result of a rotation applied to the anchoring element 3 in the cavity 2. </p><p id="p0031" num="0031"> It is evident that the cavities 2 may be either through cavities, as shown in Figures 1 to 6, or not through cavities, as shown in Figure 7, provided that in any case the end 3b of the anchoring elements 3 does not project below the platform 1. </p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, as illustrated in Figures 1 to 4 and in Figure 7, the platform 1 comprises a soft third layer lc, associated with the rigid lower layer lb, in such a way as to prevent the platform 1 from slipping relative to the floor. In that case, the mutual connection of the platform 1 and the anchoring element 3 occurs thanks to the interaction between matching surfaces 10c, 30b, respectively located on the third layer lc and on the end 3b of the anchoring element 3, as shown in Figure 7. The surface 10b of the rigid lower layer lb may also cooperate with that interaction, as shown in Figures 2 and 4. </p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In any case, the matching surfaces 10b, 10c, 30b which cooperate with the interaction are located partly on the platform 1 and partly on the anchoring element 3: the surfaces 30b, relative to the anchoring element 3, are on a shaped protuberance 4, present on the end 3b of the anchoring element 3, whilst the surfaces 10b, 10c relate to hollows 5, 6 shaped to match the protuberance 4. In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 5 and 6, said hollow 5 is made in the rigid lower layer lb. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, in which the platform 1 comprises three layers la, lb, lc, the hollow 6 can be made in the third layer lc, as shown in Figure 7, or it may involve both the rigid lower layer lb and the third layer lc, as shown in Figures 2 4. Figures 8 and 9 show, in the case of a platform 1 with three layers la, lb, lc, a preferred embodiment of the hollows 5; 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 6 for housing the protuberance 4. It can be seen how the hollow 5; 6 comprises a butterfly-shaped recess 51; 61, whose walls are suitable for interfering with the shaped protuberance 4 of the anchoring element 3, following a rotation of the latter. The shape of the butterfly-shaped recess 51; 61 is preferably symmetrical relative to the orientation of the cavities 2 of the platform 1, in such a way as to make rotation of the protuberance 4 of the anchoring element 3 symmetrical. </p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The end 3b of the anchoring element 3 also comprises a stop 40, located above the protuberance 4, suitable for interacting with the soft upper layer la when the anchoring element 3 is connected to the platform 1, in such a way as to improve its stability during exercising. </p><p id="p0035" num="0035"> The anchoring elements 3 comprise a rigid core 7 and at least one covering element 7a, which may be a soft coating sleeve, or solid shaped members or special shaped members for performing specific exercises, which can be removably associated with the core 7, in such a way as to create various device geometries. Moreover, said rigid core 7 may comprise a transversal hole 7b, which can be used to allow the connection of two or more supporting elements 3, in such a way as to create complex structures. </p><p id="p0036" num="0036"> The rigid lower layer lb of the platform 1 is preferably made of multi-layer wood, whilst the soft upper layer la and the soft third layer lc, are preferably made of EVA expanded plastic material. </p><p id="p0037" num="0037"> The multi-layer platform 1 also comprises a plurality of through slots 20, which allow easy manual gripping of it for moving and positioning the device 11. </p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The device 11 comprises an elastic coupling system 23, suitable for determining and stabilising the mutual connection position of the platform 1 and the anchoring elements 3. In a possible embodiment, schematically illustrated in Figures 3 to 6, said elastic coupling system 23 comprises at least one ball 4a, housed in a blind hole 4c present in the protuberance 4 and pushed towards the surface of the latter by a spring 4b, and an indentation 5a; 6a shaped to match it located in the hollow 5; 6, in such a way that the ball 4a engages in the indentation 5a; 6a in a predetermined connection position.
