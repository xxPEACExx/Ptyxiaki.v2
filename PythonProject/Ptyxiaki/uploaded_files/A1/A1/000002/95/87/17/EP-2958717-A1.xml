THE INVENTION Shaving hand held device typically include a head unit head and a handle which releasably or permanently attaches to the head unit at one end. Hand held device handles are typically rigid elongated rods. Recently, many hand held devices have been described to hold batteries, electronic components, as well as sachets and so forth, contributing to the hand held device handles becoming larger and longer. See for example the Schick Hydro Silk Power Select hand held device and the Gillette ProGlide Styler trimmer. See e.g. USD644789 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2011/0219620. These hand held devices, like the majority of hand held devices in the market rely on elongated rigid handles. </p><p id="p0003" num="0003"> Although many razor handles are made of metal and/or plastic, the addition of softer gripping materials to the exterior of the razor have also been disclosed. See U.S. e.g. 7,975,389; 7,874,076. 5,497,551. These handles, however, merely add an external surface layer of the gripping material to an otherwise rigid metal or plastic handle. Although the addition of the grip material can help with gripping and surface feel, most handles remain rigid and have an elongated shape. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004"> Hand held devices with differently shaped handles have also been described. For example handles having elongated oval shaped handles have been described and marketed. See e.g. USD349242, USD363142, USD364707, and USD381768. Various hand held devices having cylindrical shaped handles for receiving fingers have also been described. See e.g. US Patent App. No. 2011/0016734 Al, US Patent Nos. 6,018,877 and 6,112,421. Convenience and space saving hand held devices have also been described. See e.g. US Patent App. No. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005">2011/0088268 Al describing a hand held device with an articulated handle extension having an adjustable length. WO 97/25189 also describes a hand held device with two hand held device heads attached to a flat oval shaped handle. See also, U.S. Patent Publication No. 2012/0042478. Further, storage of various forms of compact hand held devices within containers have also been described. See e.g., US 1,234,834. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006"> Despite the handles which have been described, there remains a need for a handle which has a gripping portion made of a component which can easily be changed and is preferably flexible and elastic but allow users to have a portable handle which is ergonomic and user friendly but still provide the responsiveness needed to control the device head unit.

The handle comprises docking member for permanently or removably connecting to the head unit, and a gripping portion, wherein said gripping portion and said docking member are positioned distally away from one another, wherein said docking member permanently or detachably connects to said head unit base, and wherein said gripping portion fixedly or releasably retains at least one substrate therein. </p><p id="p0027" num="0027"> The gripping portion forms a substrate retaining member forming a substrate receiving region which can be an enclosed aperture or an open receiving region which is adapted to retain a substrate. Preferably the substrate is an elastomeric substrate but it could also be designed such that the substrate has a rigid core and has elastomeric material layered on one or both sides. In 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 13148-DW 4 one embodiment, the retaining member is a partial or full peripheral ring forming at least one aperture. Fixedly or releasably retained within said substrate receiving region is a substrate. In one embodiment the substrate comprises an elastomeric material, such as an elastomeric coating, in another embodiment, the substrate consists essentially of elastomer and forms a unitary body made of said elastomeric material. </p><p id="p0028" num="0028"> The substrate comprises a first (top) surface forming a first finger receiving region and a second (bottom) surface forming a second finger receiving region, wherein the first surface is on the opposite side of the substrate than the second surface. In use the first finger receiving region can be contacted by the thumb while the second finger receiving region is contacted by one or both of the index and middle fingers. Or vice versa where the thumb is on the second finger receiving region and so forth. </p><p id="p0029" num="0029"> The substrate is fixedly or removably attached to said substrate retaining member. This is particularly useful as it allows for added flexibility in manufacture by making the portion of the handle which is the primary gripping portion component driven such that the substrate can be changed if the manufacture desires a stiffer or softer handle. The component nature of this substrate also allows for modifications based on consumer preferences without need to change the rest of the handle; for example, by changing the materials in the substrate, or adding a surface treatment, the rest of the gripping portion can remain the same (such as the retaining member), but the handle can look and perform very differently. It may also be useful to allow consumers to change the substrate themselves based on their usage needs. For example, if a user tends to use the device in a wet of soapy environment, he or she may want a substrate that has enhanced grip. If, however, the user prefers a smoother look and finish, they could obtain a substrate which is metallic or chromed in appearance. </p><p id="p0030" num="0030"> Where the substrate is an elastomeric substrate, it can provide particularly desirable user feel and response. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that hand held devices which are used in such a way allows the handle to react to forces applied by the user in an adaptive and responsive way with the elastomeric material provides for dynamic resistance to forces applied by the opposing fingers. In effect, the elastomeric substrate is a moving and flexible membrane which allows the user to apply force to the device but still has some elastic give and flexibility. </p><p id="p0031" num="0031"> One important benefit of having the body portion of the handle consist of the elastomeric substrate, as opposed to mere layers of elastomer coating on the surface of a rigid handle, is that the elastomeric material provides a softer feel allowing for a sense of feeling through the entire 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 13148-DW 5 thickness of the handle. Some of the performance improvements related to having an elastomeric substrate forming the first and second finger receiving regions is that the user has enhanced control over the handle while maintaining comfort during use from the soft, pliable nature of the elastomers. Further since the elastomeric substrate is pliable, the user can apply force in different regions or angles onto the elastomeric substrate but it will naturally contour based on how the head unit contacts the body. The elastomeric substrate can also, provides enhanced grip due to any surface treatments which can be applied onto the elastomeric material, </p><p id="p0032" num="0032">1. HEAD UNIT </p><p id="p0033" num="0033"> The head unit can be a toothbrush, a writing or cosmetic utensil such as a pen or pencil, or a wide scraping surface such as for hair removal. Nonlimiting examples of hair removal device include those used with a depilatory or for skin exfoliation, or razors with a blade unit, such as a safety razor. Where the hair removal head is a razor cartridge razor may be power or manual, disposable or a refillable system. The razor cartridge may also include multiple blades. For example, U.S. Patent 7,168,173 generally describes a Fusion® razor that is commercially available from The Gillette Company which includes a razor cartridge with multiple blades. Additionally, the razor cartridge may include a guard as well as a shaving aid. A variety of razor cartridges can be used in accordance with the present invention. Nonlimiting examples of suitable razor cartridges, with and without fins, guards, and/or shave aids, include those marketed by The Gillette Company under the Fusion®, Venus® product lines as well as those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 7,197,825, 6,449,849, 6,442,839, 6,301,785, 6,298,558; 6,161,288, and U.S. Patent Publ. 2008/060201. The head unit can also be a brush or a toothbrush, such as shown in FIG. 6b where bristles extend away from the head unit. </p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The terms "forward" and "aft", as used herein, define relative position between features of the blade unit (i.e., razor cartridge). A feature "forward" of the at least one blade, for example, is positioned so that the surface to be treated with by the device encounters the feature before it encounters the at least one blade. For example, if the device is being stroked in its intended cutting direction, the guard is forward of the blade(s). A feature "aft" of the blade(s) is positioned so that the surface to be treated by the device encounters the feature after it encounters the blade(s), for example if the device is stroked in its intended cutting direction, the cap is disposed aft of the blade(s).

In one embodiment, the substrate retaining member forms a ring which defines an aperture, suitable for retaining one or more substrates. The retaining member need not form a full ring yet still be able to retain a substrate. Also, the retaining member could form a full ring but not wrap around the entire periphery of the substrate (i.e. the retaining member can define a perfectly circular ring, while the substrate forms a half circle, or other void space where a through hole or other passage can be defined).

This can be useful if users desire the entire gripping portion to have an elastomeric feel. In one embodiment, the entire exterior surface (the surface not contacting the docking member or the elastomeric substrate) of the gripping portion or the exterior surface of the retaining member is coated with one or more elastomer grip materials. These elastomeric grip materials are known in the art and include many of the elastomeric materials described for used in the elastomeric substrate. They can be the same or different than those used in the substrate. </p><p id="p0043" num="0043"> The gripping portion can have many different shapes, including but not limited to a flat rounded disk shape where the retaining member retains a round coin shaped substrate. The substrate can be removably or fixedly retained in the retaining member. In one embodiment, the substrate is an elastomeric substrate and can be molded or otherwise cast directly into the retaining member or peripheral ring. Alternatively, the substrate can be formed in a separate step, then fitted into the aperture. Various forms of retaining the substrate can be used. If a removable embodiment is desired, the substrate can be force fitted into the aperture, such as with a tongue and groove fitment along a portion or the entire retaining member, one or more pin and receiving holes, such as where the retaining member includes one or more pins projecting into corresponding receiving holes formed in the substrate. Various ways to fixedly retain the elastomeric substrate onto the substrate retaining member are possible, such as, but not limited to, use of adhesives, or thermal bonding. b. ELASTOMERIC SUBSTRATE </p><p id="p0044" num="0044"> In one embodiment, the substrate comprises or is made primarily of elastomeric material, referred to herein as an elastomeric substrate. The elastomeric substrate of the present invention is retained within said substrate receiving region or aperture. The elastomeric substrate is a

The elastomeric substrate comprises a first surface forming a first finger receiving region and a second surface forming a second finger receiving region. </p><p id="p0045" num="0045"> In one embodiment, the elastomeric substrate is removable and or replaceable. With replaceable elastomeric substrates, the consumer can select from different surface treatments or colors depending on their need. For example, if the user desires a smoother finish with lower friction, they can select an elastomeric substrate with a smooth finish. Correspondingly, if the user desires something with more friction and easier to grip, such as when used in a wet environment, they can select an elastomeric grip with more embossments or surface treatments to increase friction. The hardness of the elastomeric substrate can also be varied so the user can pick their desired firmness and feel. Further, the user can replace the substrate if it becomes dirty or otherwise worn from use. </p><p id="p0046" num="0046"> In one embodiment the substrate is easily removable from the retaining member, such as where it is slide in place and only requires a minor amount of force to separate and remove. In another embodiment, the elastomeric substrate is fixedly attached to the substrate such that it is not readily removable by the consumer but can be removed such as a force fit or tongue and groove fitment. In another embodiment, the substrate is permanently attached to said retaining member such as by heat bonding or adhesives. </p><p id="p0047" num="0047"> In one embodiment the elastomeric substrate is a unitary body. Unitary body, as defined herein, means that the elastomeric substrate is a self supported structure which does not include a supporting beam or internal structure such as other handles where an elastomeric grip material is layered over a rigid handle. The unitary body need not be made of one single material, and can have multiple layers but should be made entire of elastomeric materials such that if sufficient force is applied to one surface the unitary body can wholly deform and flex on the opposite side. In effect, aside from any portion of the retaining member which attaches to the elastomeric substrate, the handle need little to no additional rigid material necessary. The elastomeric nature of the substrate allows the handle to deform yet still allow the user control over the head unit with desirable ergonomic feel during use. </p><p id="p0048" num="0048"> In one embodiment, the elastomeric substrate comprises more than one layer of elastomeric material. This can be particularly useful as different materials can have different elasticity and hardness. The multiple layers can be of the same material or of different materials.

The compressibility index (CI) is defined as the slope of the force/compression distance curve at a distance of compression of 0.025 cm. as measured in accordance with the procedure described later. The CI value has been derived from extensive consumer test data involving test subject responses to numerous commercial and experimental finger gripping devices. The consumer test data was analyzed and evaluated to determine if some common factor or factors existed which could be used to reliably predict test subject's favorable ratings and acceptance for a given finger gripping device. Interpretation of the data indicated that favorable test subject response to a given device appeared to be primarily dependent on the combination of the softness and compressibility and resiliency properties provided by the tested device. These properties, in turn, are dependent on the combination of the compressible material and configuration selected to provide the device. In accordance with our invention, we have found that a close correlation exists between CI value and the test subjects' perception of increased comfort and decreased fatigue in use of the device. </p><p id="p0057" num="0057"> In one embodiment, the thermoplastic elastomer is polar and hydrophobic.
