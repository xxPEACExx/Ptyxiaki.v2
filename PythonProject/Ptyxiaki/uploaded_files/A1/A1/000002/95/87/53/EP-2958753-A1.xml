Referring first to FIG. 5, printing assembly 100 may be moved towards the front portion 350 of platform 304. As previously discussed, printing assembly 100 may move along first track 310 and second track 312. In preparation for printing, printing assembly 100 may travel to a forward most position, as seen in FIG. 6. In this forward most position, retractable screen assembly 120 may engage first support member 320 and second support member 322. In particular, edge portion 142 of screen member 140 may automatically fasten to first support member 320 and second support member 322. </p><p id="p0072" num="0072"> [0037] Different embodiments could utilize various techniques for automatically fastening edge portion 142 to first support member 320 and second support member 322. In some embodiments, magnetism may be used to fasten edge portion 142 to first support member 320 and second support member 322. In other embodiments, edge portion 142 may be mechanically fastened to first support member 320 and second support member 322. In other embodiments, still other methods of fastening edge portion 142 to first support member 320 and second support member 322 are possible. </p><p id="p0073" num="0073"> [0038] FIGS. 7 through 9 illustrate cross-sectional schematic views of one possible mechanism for automatically fastening edge portion 142 of screen member 140 to first support member 320. In the embodiment of FIGS. 7 through 9, screen member 140 may be automatically fastened to first support member 320 (as well as second support member 322) using a magnetic fastening system. In particular, edge portion 142 of screen member 140 may comprise a magnetic material while top portion 702 of first support member 320 may comprise a metallic material that feels magnetic forces in the vicinity of a magnetic field. Likewise, second support member 322 may include a portion that is susceptible to magnetic

 forces. With this arrangement, as retractable screen assembly 120 approaches first support member 320, edge portion 142 may be magnetically attracted to first support member 320, as indicated schematically in FIG. 7. At this point, edge portion 142 may tend to magnetically attach to first support member 320 (as well as second support member 322), so that the position of edge portion 142 on first support member 320 and second support member 322 is temporarily fixed, as shown in FIG. 8. In particular, the magnetic force may be strong enough so that as printing assembly 100 begins to move away from first support member 320 and second support member 322, edge portion 142 remains in place on first support member 320 and second support member 322. This causes screen member 140 to extend from housing member 130, as shown in FIG. 9. </p><p id="p0074" num="0074"> [0039] The extension of screen member 140 from housing member 130 is also shown in FIG. 10, which illustrates a schematic isometric view of printing assembly 100 moving away from front portion 350 of platform 304 following the temporary attachment of edge portion 142 to first support member 320 and second support member 322. Referring to FIG. 10, it can be seen that as screen member 140 is extended from housing 130, screen member 140 acts to cover upper opening 340 (see FIG. 3), thereby enclosing the region bounded by front wall 340, first side wall 342, second side wall 344 and screen member 140. Moreover, as printing device 101 may apply ink and UV curing to article 400 while passing from front portion 350 of platform 304 towards a rearward most position, screen member 140 is seen to provide UV protection during this stage of printing. For purposes of illustration, a printed graphic 499 is seen in FIGS. 10-13, which has been printed onto article 400 using ink and UV curing. </p><p id="p0075" num="0075"> [0040] FIG. 1 1 shows a final stage in which screen member 140 has been fully extended to cover upper opening 340 (see FIG. 3) of platform 304. Thus it can be seen that as the position of printing device 101 varies with respect to platform 304, the protective area provided by screen member 140 increases accordingly.

 [0041] Once the printing process has been completed, and especially after the UV light source has been turned off, screen member 140 can be disengaged from first support member 320 and second support member 322. In some embodiments, this can be accomplished by simply lifting first edge portion 142 upwardly, as seen in FIG. 12, and then allowing screen member 140 to retract into housing member 130, as seen in FIGS. 13 an 14. </p><p id="p0076" num="0076"> [0042] Alternate embodiments are also possible. For example, FIG. 15 illustrates in embodiment in which a retractable screen assembly 1502 is sized to fit over upper opening 340. In particular, in some embodiments, the length of retractable screen assembly 1502 may be approximately similar to the spacing between first side wall 342 and second side wall 344. In this configuration, screen member 1540 may cover upper opening 340 without substantially extending beyond the boundaries of first side wall 342 and second side wall 344. </p><p id="p0077" num="0077"> [0043] In still other embodiments, as shown in FIG. 16, it may be possible to use screen member 140 without any of front wall 340, first side wall 342 and/or second side wall 344. Such embodiments may still effectively block UV light along the direct viewing angles of operators and/or persons in the vicinity of printing station 300. In still further embodiments, one or more walls or other protective screens can be placed around the perimeter of table 302. In such an embodiment, when screen member 142 extends, the enclosed region may comprise a large region of table 302, rather than a region associated with platform 304. </p><p id="p0078" num="0078"> [0044] FIGS. 17 through 21 illustrate an alternative configuration for a printing station 1700 and printing assembly 1710.
