Moreover, there are many different types of heat transfer systems and heat transfer equipment, and in many cases it is important that the heat transfer fluid used in such systems possess a particular combination of properties that match the needs of the individual system. For example, systems based on the vapor compression cycle usually involve the phase change of the refrigerant from the liquid to the vapor phase through heat absorption at a relatively low pressure and compressing the vapor to a relatively elevated pressure, condensing the vapor to the liquid phase through heat removal at this relatively elevated pressure and temperature, and then reducing the pressure to start the cycle over again. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 For example, certain fluorocarbons have been a preferred component in many heat exchange fluids, such as refrigerants, for many years in many applications. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Fluoroalkanes, such as chlorofluoromethanes and chlorofluoroethanes, have gained widespread use as refrigerants in applications including air conditioning and heat pump applications owing to their unique combination of chemical and physical properties, such as heat capacity, flammability, stability under the conditions of operation, and miscibility with the lubricant (if any) used in the system. Moreover, many of the refrigerants commonly utilized in vapor compression systems are either single </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">components fluids, or zeotropic, azeotropic mixtures. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Concern has increased in recent years about potential damage to the earth's atmosphere and climate, and certain chlorine-based compounds have been identified as particularly problematic in this regard. The use of chlorine-containing compositions (such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and the like) as refrigerants in air-conditioning and refrigeration systems has become disfavored because of the ozone-depleting properties associated with many of such compounds. There has thus been an increasing need for new fluorocarbon and hydrofluorocarbon compounds that offer alternatives for refrigeration and heat pump applications. For example, it has become desirable to retrofit chlorine-containing refrigeration systems by replacing chlorine-containing refrigerants with non-chlorine-containing refrigerant compounds that will not deplete the ozone layer, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Another concern surrounding many existing refrigerants is the tendency of many such products to cause global warming. This characteristic is commonly measured as global warming potential (GWP). The GWP of a compound is a measure of the potential contribution to the green house effect of the chemical against a known reference molecule, namely, C0<sub>2</sub> which has a GWP = 1. For example, the known refrigerant R-410 has a Global Warming Potential of 2088. While this refrigerant has proven effective in many respects, it has become increasingly less preferred since it is frequently undesirable to use materials having GWPs greater than about 1000. A need exists, 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 therefore, for more environmentally friendly substitutes for high GWP refrigerants in general and R-410A in particular refrigerants having undesirable GWPs. For example, it has become desirable to retrofit certain systems, including chlorine-containing and certain HFC-containing refrigeration systems by replacing the existing refrigerants with refrigerant compositions that will not deplete the ozone layer, will not cause unwanted levels of global worming, and at the same time will satisfy all of the other stringent requirements of such systems for the materials used as the heat transfer material. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">With respect to performance properties, the present applicants have come to appreciate that any potential substitute refrigerant must also possess those properties present in many of the most widely used fluids, such as excellent heat transfer properties, chemical stability, low- or no- toxicity, low or non-flammability and lubricant compatibility, among others. With regard to efficiency in use, it is important to note that a loss in refrigerant thermodynamic performance or energy efficiency may have secondary environmental impacts through increased fossil fuel usage arising from an increased demand for electrical energy. Furthermore, it is generally considered desirable for refrigerant substitutes to be effective without major engineering changes to conventional vapor compression technology currently used with existing refrigerants, such as CFC-containing </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"> refrigerants. Applicants have thus come to appreciate a need for compositions, and </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> particularly heat transfer compositions, that are potentially useful in numerous applications, including vapor compression heating and cooling systems and methods, while avoiding one or more of the disadvantages noted above. Applicants have also come to appreciate that lubricant compatibility is of particular importance in many of applications. More particularly, it is highly desirably for 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 refrigeration fluids to be compatible with the lubricant utilized in the compressor unit, used in most refrigeration systems. Unfortunately, many non-chlorine-containing refrigeration fluids, including HFC's, are relatively insoluble and/or immiscible in the types of lubricants used traditionally with CFC's and HFC's, including, for example, mineral oils, alkylbenzenes or poly(alpha-olefins). In order for a refrigeration fluid- lubricant combination to work at a desirable level of efficiently within a compression refrigeration, air-conditioning and/or heat pump system, the lubricant should be sufficiently soluble in the refrigeration liquid over a wide range of operating </p><p id="p0017" num="0017">temperatures. Such solubility lowers the viscosity of the lubricant and allows it to flow more easily throughout the system. In the absence of such solubility, lubricants tend to become lodged in the coils of the evaporator of the refrigeration, air-conditioning or heat pump system, as well as other parts of the system, and thus reduce the system performance. Flammability is another important property for many applications. That is, it is considered either important or essential in many applications, including particularly in heat transfer applications, to use compositions which are non-flammable or of relatively low flammability. As used herein, the term "nonflammable" refers to compounds or compositions which are determined to be nonflammable as determined in accordance with AST standard E-681 , dated 2002, which is incorporated herein by reference. Unfortunately, many HFC's which might otherwise be desirable for used in refrigerant compositions are not flammable. For example, the fluoroalkane difluoroethane (HFC- 152a) and the fluoroalkene 1 ,1 ,1-trifluorpropene (HFO-1243zf) are each flammable and therefore not viable for use alone in many applications. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Higher fluoroalkenes, that is fluorine-substituted alkenes having at least five carbon atoms, have been suggested for use as refrigerants. U.S. Patent No. 4,788,352 - Smutny - is directed to production of fluorinated C<sub>5</sub> to C<sub>8</sub> compounds having at least some degree of unsaturation. The Smutny patent identifies such higher olefins as being known to have utility as refrigerants, pesticides, dielectric fluids, heat transfer fluids, solvents, and intermediates in various chemical reactions. (See column 1 , lines 11 - 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 22). </p><p id="p0019" num="0019">While the fluorinated olefins described in Smutny may have some level of effectiveness in heat transfer applications, it is believed that such compounds may also have certain disadvantages. For example, some of these compounds may tend to attack substrates, particularly general-purpose plastics such as acrylic resins and ABS resins. Furthermore, the higher olefinic compounds described in Smutny may also be undesirable in certain applications because of the potential level of toxicity of such compounds which may arise as a result of pesticide activity noted in Smutny. Also, such compounds may have a boiling point which is too high to make them useful as a refrigerant in certain applications. </p><p id="p0020" num="0020">SUMMARY </p><p id="p0021" num="0021"> According to one aspect of the present invention, applicants have found that one or more of the above-noted needs, and possibly other needs, can be satisfied by refrigerant compositions comprising, and in certain preferred embodiments consisting essentially of, from about 61 % by weight to about 69% by weight of difluoromethane (R- 32) and from about 31% by weight to about 39% by weight of tetrafluoropropene, more preferably 1 ,1 ,1 ,3-tetrafluoropropene (HFO-1234ze), and even more preferably trans ,1 ,1 ,3-tetrafluoropropene (transHFO-1234ze or HFO-1234ze(E)). </p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The term "HFO-1234" is used herein to refer to all tetrafluoropropenes. Among the tetrafluoropropenes are included 1 ,1 ,1 ,2-tetrafluoropropene (HFO-1234yf) and both cis- and trans-1 , 1 , 1 , 3-tetrafluoropropene (HFO-1234ze). The term HFO-1234ze is used herein generically to refer to 1 , 1 ,1 , 3-tetrafluoropropene, independent of whether it is the cis- or trans- form. The terms "cisHFO-1234ze" and "transHFO-1234ze" are used herein to describe the cis- and trans- forms of 1 , 1 , 1 , 3-tetrafluoropropene respectively. The term "HFO-1234ze" therefore includes within its scope cisHFO- 1234ze, transHFO-1234ze, and all combinations and mixtures of these. </p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The present invention provides also methods and systems which utilize the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
 refrigerant compositions of the present invention, in refrigeration systems, including particularly and preferably in systems and methods which have heretofore used the refrigerant R-410A, including particularly stationary refrigeration systems, including residential and commercial air conditioning equipment. Other aspects of the invention include methods and systems for replacing R-410A in an existing heat transfer system with a refrigerant of the present invention. </p><p id="p0024" num="0024">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS THE COMPOSITIONS </p><p id="p0025" num="0025"> As provided herein, the refrigerant compositions of the present invention include difluoromethane (R-32) and tetrafluoropropene. The relative amount of HFC-32 and the tetrafluoropropene in the refrigerant composition of the present invention is critically important to the provision of the properties and features provided by the preferred aspects of the present invention. More specifically, and as explained in detail in the examples here of, refrigerant compositions comprising the components in the amounts as required by the present claims produce a highly desirable but unexpected </p><p id="p0026" num="0026">combination of properties, including particularly heat transfer capacity and heat transfer efficiency that closely match and/or provide improvement over R-410, while at the same time providing dramatic improvement in the environmental properties of the refrigerant. As can be readily appreciated, this discovery is of potentially enormous advantage and benefit for the formulation of many important refrigerant methods and systems. </p><p id="p0027" num="0027"> It is generally preferred that the tetrafluoropropene of the present invention comprises, and in many preferred embodiment consists essentially of (trans)HFO- 1234ze. As is known, HFO-1234ze(E) has a normal boiling point of -19° C. In comparison, (cis)HFO-1234ze has a normal boiling point of +9° C. Thus, it is possible that in certain applications relatively small amounts, for example, up to 5% by weight of the composition, of the cis- and trans- isomers, and perhaps other tetrafluoropropenes such as HFO-1234yf, will be acceptable and/or preferred in many embodiments. </p><p id="p0028" num="0028"> Nevertheless, in certain highly preferred embodiments, the tetrafluoride are, and according to the present invention consists essentially of, and even more preferably in 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
 certain embodiments consists of, HFO-1234ze(E). </p><p id="p0029" num="0029"> Another advantage of certain embodiments of the present invention is the provision of compositions having exceptional flammability properties while retaining other important properties in the desirable range. Applicants have come to appreciate that both R-32 and HFO-1234yf have measurable flame limits at room temperature. However, applicants note that the flame hazard of the preferred compositions of the present invention based upon HFO-1234ze compare favorably to other HFCs such as R-152a and HCs such as R-290. One way of ranking the flammability of these materials is to measure the flame speed of each compound. The maximum flame speed of R-32, R-152a and R-290 have been reported (Jabbour) to be 6.7, 23.0 and 38.5 cm/s, respectively. The refrigerant compositions of the present invention have a flame speed of less than 6.7 cm/s. </p><p id="p0030" num="0030"> In certain preferred forms, the refrigerant compositions of the present invention, also have a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of not greater than about 1600, more preferably not greater than about 1000, and even more preferably not greater than about 500.

For example, heat transfer compositions of the present invention include the present refrigerant compositions and a lubricant, with the lubricant in preferred embodiments being present in the heat transfer composition in amounts of from about 30 to about 50 percent by weight of the heat transfer composition. Furthermore, the present compositions may also include a co- refrigerant, or compatibilzer, such as propane, for the purpose of aiding compatibility and/or solubility of the lubricant. Such compatibilizers, including propane, butanes and pentanes, are preferably present in amounts of from about 0.5 to about 5 percent by weight of the composition. However, such compatibilizers may be replaced with one or more of the additional components (e.g. fluorinated alkanes) discussed herein. </p><p id="p0036" num="0036"> Combinations of surfactants and solubilizing agents may also be added to the present compositions to aid oil solubility, as disclosed by U.S. Patent No. 6,516,837, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.

In some cases, hydrocarbon based oils are have sufficient solubility with the refrigerant that is comprised of an iodocarbon, the combination of the iodocarbon and the hydrocarbon oil might more stable than other types of lubricant. Such </p><p id="p0037" num="0037">combination may therefore be advantageous. Preferred lubricants include polyalkylene glycols and esters.

It is contemplated that in certain embodiments the present invention provides retrofitting methods which comprise replacing the heat transfer fluid (such as a refrigerant) in an existing system with a composition of the present invention, without substantial modification of the system. In certain preferred embodiments the replacement step is a drop-in replacement in the sense that no substantial redesign of the system is required and no major item of equipment needs to be replaced in order to accommodate the composition of the present invention as the heat transfer fluid.

Preferably the methods include the further step of compressing the refrigerant vapor, usually with a compressor or similar equipment to produce vapor of the present composition at a relatively elevated pressure.

 EXAMPLES </p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The following examples are provided for the purpose of illustrating the present invention. </p><p id="p0061" num="0061"> A representative air-to-air reversible heat pump designed for R410A was tested. This ducted unit was tested in Honeywell's Buffalo, New York application laboratory. The ducted unit is a 3-ton (10.5 kW cooling capacity) 13 SEER (3.8 cooling seasonal performance factor, SPF) with a heating capacity of 10.1 kW and an HSPF of 8.5 (rated heating SPF of -2.5), equipped with a scroll compressor. This system has tube-and-fin heat exchangers, reversing valves and thermostatic expansion valves for each operating mode. Due to the different pressures and densities of the refrigerants tested, some of the tests required the use of Electronic Expansion Valves (EEV) to reproduce the same degrees of superheat observed with the original refrigerants. </p><p id="p0062" num="0062"> . Tests were performed using standard (AHRI, 2008) operating conditions. All tests were performed inside environmental chambers equipped with instrumentation to measure both air-side and refrigerant-side parameters. Refrigerant flow was measured using a coriolis flow meter while air flow and capacity was measured using an air- enthalpy tunnel designed according to industry standards (ASHRAE, 1992). All primary measurement sensors were calibrated to ±0.25°C for temperatures and ±0.25 psi for pressure. Experimental uncertainties for capacity and efficiency were on average ±5%. Capacity values represent the air-side measurements, which were carefully calibrated using the reference fluid (R-410A). </p><p id="p0063" num="0063"> Using this system, testing was conducted on various R-32 and 1234ze containing compositions, including: (1 ) 60 wt. % R-32 and 40% 1234ze; (2) 68 t. % R-32 and 32% 1234ze; and (3) 73 wt. % R-32 and 27% 1234ze. Each of the above blends were tested in this heat pump in both cooling and heating modes along with the baseline refrigerant R-410A. System capacity and efficiency results are provided in Table A below. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="16"/>-->
 TABLE A </p><p id="p0064" num="0064"><img id="imgf000016_0001" he="83" wi="232" file="imgf000016_0001.tif" img-format="tif" img-content="table" orientation="landscape" inline="yes"/><!-- EPO <DP n="17"/>--></p><p id="p0065" num="0065">The test result reported in Table A illustrates that, for drop-in replacements, the capacity of the tested fluids increased as the amount of R-32 is increased. That is, the capacity of a fluid having 60 wt.% HFC-32 and 40 wt. % 1234ze was 89% in a cooling application, 88% with a Heat Rating conducted according to AHRI H1 , and 83% with Heat Testing at low temperatures in accordance with AHRI H4. When the amount of R- 32 is increased from 60 wt% to 68 wt. %, the capacity rose in all three tests -- i.e. to 95% for a cooling application; 93% for the AHRI H1 Heat Rating and 90% for AHRIH4 Heat Testing at low temperatures. An even further increase was shown as the amount of R-32 was increased to 73 wt. %. Such data demonstrates that as the amount of R-32 increased above 60 wt. %, the capacity, relative to R-410A, improved to be within critical levels that make it effective as an R-410A replacement fluid - i.e. within about 10%, and preferably within about 5%. What was further surprising was that the efficiency of the fluids also improved as R-32 was added. As one of skill in the art, I can attest that it is generally known in the art that as the capacity of a fluid increases, its efficiency decreases. This is, largely, because an increase in capacity generally results in increased load to the heat exchangers of the system. Thus, the expectation based on the data above was that the increase in capacity observed as the amount of R-32 is increased would result in a deleterious change to the effective evaporative temperature and condensing temperature. This, ultimately, makes the system less efficient and was expected to result in a decrease in the comparative efficiency percentage. Table A, however, surprisingly and unexpectedly demonstrates that the efficiency actually improves in the system as the amount of R-32 is increased. More specifically, the efficiency of the 60 wt.% 32 fluid was found to be 100% in a cooling application, 102% with a Heat Rating conducted according to AHRI H1 , and 94% with Heat Testing at low temperatures in accordance with AHRI H4. When the amount of R-32 is increased from 60 wt% to 68 wt. %, the efficiency increased to 103% for a cooling application; 103% for the AHRI H1 Heat Rating and 98% for AHRI H4 Heat Testing at low temperatures. It is also noteworthy that as the amount of R-32 increased from 68 wt. % to 73 wt. % the efficiency of the system in the cooling application and AHRI H1 Heat Rating appears to level off. That is, while an increase in efficiency is still observed with AHRI H4 Heat Testing at low temperatures, the efficiency in the cooling application and AHRI H1 heat 
<!-- EPO <DP n="18"/>-->
 rating remained relatively flat. Again, one of skill in the art would expect that the efficiency should have decreased as the capacity rose. Thus, the fact that they remained relatively the same in the actual test data was wholly unexpected. Moreover, the leveling off that is observed is surprisingly advantageous because it occurs within a capacity and efficiency range that make the compositions effective as a R-410A replacement fluid - i.e. within about 10%, and preferably within about 5%. </p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The developmental blend, L-41 was tested in this heat pump in both cooling and heating modes along with the baseline refrigerant R-410A. </p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the foregoing description and examples are intended to be illustrative of the invention but not necessarily limiting of the full and true broad scope of the invention, which will be represented by the appended claims as presented now or hereinafter.
