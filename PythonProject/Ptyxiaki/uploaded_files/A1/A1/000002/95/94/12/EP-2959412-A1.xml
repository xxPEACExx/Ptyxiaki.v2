 DETAILED DESCRIPTION </p><p id="p0069" num="0069">[0061] In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a triple -patterning lithography is used to print complex design intents with higher pattern density than the pattern density provided by direct photolithographic printing or by double -patterning technology. In some embodiments, the design intent includes two-dimensional patterns that correspond to a circuit design implementing any logic, analog, or analog-digital function. The embodiments of the present invention may be applicable to multiple-patterning lithography technology with higher pattern density than triple-patterning for future process technologies. </p><p id="p0070" num="0070">[0062] Validating design intent for a triple -patterning process, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, includes determining whether a graph representative of the design intent is three-colorable. Each vertex in the graph may correspond to a shape in the design intent, and each edge in the graph may correspond to two shapes in the design intent that violate at least one design rule, such as being separated by a space that is less than a pre-determined distance. The minimum spacing allowed between two shapes may depend on various parameters associated with the shapes. In some embodiments, the minimum allowable spacing between two shapes may be determined based on a set of design rules. </p><p id="p0071" num="0071">[0063] Determining whether a graph is three-colorable belongs to class of hard-to-soive computer problems, formally known as Noiideterministic-Polynomial-complete (NP- complete) problems. It is unlikely to have a fast algorithm to solve a NP-complete problem optimally, as is known. An algorithm and a system, in accordance with the present invention, relatively quickly and with a small probability of error solves the three-coloring problem associated with validating the design intent for a triple-patterning process. </p><p id="p0072" num="0072">[0064] When the algorithm or a system implementing the algorithm, collectively referred to herein as the "system", validates the design successfully, the shapes may be assigned to three masks to be used in a triple-patterning process. The design intent, however, may not be able to be partitioned into three masks due to the presence of unresolvabie conflict edges. A conflict edge is defined as an edge whose end vertices are colored with the same color. In some cases the system may fail to do the validation successfully, in which case it will output a small number of conflict edges. The designer can analyze these conflict edges and adjust the coloring, if possible, to fix the conflicts. When it is not possible to adjust the coloring, the whole design intent needs a reworking. Embodiments of the present invention provide a fast 
<!-- EPO <DP n="13"/>-->
 validation algorithm that has an acceptable failure rate that minimizes reworking the design intent. </p><p id="p0073" num="0073">[0065] Figure 1 depicts simplified exemplary steps in the design and fabrication of an integrated circuit. The process starts with a product idea 100, which is realized using Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software 1 0. Chips 170 can be produced fro the finalized design by performing fabrication 150 and packaging and assembly 160 steps. An exemplary design flow that uses EDA software 1 10 is described below for illustration purposes only. For example, an actual integrated circuit design may require a designer to perform the design flow steps in a different sequence than the sequence described below. </p><p id="p0074" num="0074">[0066] In the system design 1 12, a designer describes the functionality to be implemented. The designer can also perform what-if planning to refine the functionality and to check costs. Further, hardware-software architecture partitioning can occur at this step. In the design and functional verification 1 14, a Hardware Description Language (HDL) design may be created and checked for functional accuracy. </p><p id="p0075" num="0075">[0067] In the synthesis and design 1 16, the HDL code can be translated to a netlist, which can be optimized for the target technology. Further, tesis can be designed and implemented to check the finished chips. In the netlist verification 1 18, the netlist can be checked for compliance with timing constraints and for correspondence with the HDL code. In the design planning 120, an o verall floor plan for the chip can be constructed and analyzed for timing and top-level routing. Next, in the physical implementation 122, placement and routing can be performed. </p><p id="p0076" num="0076">[0068] In the analysis and extraction 124, the circuit functionality can be verified at a transistor level. In the physical verification 126, the design can be checked to correct any functional, manufacturing, electrical, or lithographic issues. In the resolution enhancement 128, geometric manipulations can be performed on the layout to improve manufacturability of the design. Finally, in the mask data preparation 130, the design can be taped-out 140 for production of masks to produce finished chips. The embodiments of the present invention may be used, for example at the steps of either physical verification 126 and/or mask data preparation 130. </p><p id="p0077" num="0077">[0069] Figure 2 depicts a simplified exemplary flowchart 200 for validating a design intent using a triple-patterning process, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. As discussed earlier, the triple-patterning design intent includes a multitude of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="14"/>-->
 shapes received 202 by the system. During validation 203 a graph is generated representative of the design intent. The graph may be decomposed into at least three color set s according to a hybrid-evolutionary population-search algorithm, as described further below, to generate a color for each vertex of the graph to form a colored graph including at least three colors, which is representative of the design intent. At 204, the results of validation generated in 203 are analyzed to determine whether any conflicts exit. If no conflicts are detected, the shapes in the design intent are assigned to three masks at 207; for example, the shapes that are associated with vertices of a first color can be assigned to the first mask. If conflicts are detected at 204, a stopping condition 205 is used to determine if the validation step needs to be performed again. A multitude of stopping conditions may be used. For example, one such condition may define limits on the run time of validation. Another condition may define a limit on the number of conflict outputs. Since the validation uses probabilistic calculations, repeated calls to the validation 203 may produce different conflict outputs. If the stopping condition is reached with conflicts, the designer tries to resolve 206 conflicts. Resolution of such conflicts may be earned out by reworking the design intent, which in turn may include moving or changing the shapes. After rework of design intent to resol ve 206 conflicts, the new design intent is received again at 202. </p><p id="p0078" num="0078">[0070] Figure 3A depicts a simplified exemplary design intent 300A including 4 shapes 301, 302, 303, and 304. Figure 3B depicts simplified exemplary construction of a graph 300B including vertices 301, 302, 303, and 304 associated respectively with shapes 301, 302, 303, and 304 in Figure 3 A, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. During the graph constnjction, two shapes are connected by a line, hereinafter also referred to as an "edge", if there is a design rule violation such as a spacing constraint between them; in other words the two shapes may not be assigned to the same mask. I<sup>7</sup> or example, shapes 301 and 302 in design intent 300 A may not be assigned to the same mask, hence a line is connected between vertices 301 and 302 in graph 300B.

 [0071] Figure 4A depicts a design intent 400A, which may not be printed using a triple- patterning process. Figure 4B depicts a graph 400B corresponding to the design intent depicted in Figure 4A. Referring simultaneously to Figure 3C and Figure 4B, graph 400B is not three-colorable no matter how the vertices are colored with three colors as is evident by comparing colored graph 300B with graph 400B, which includes an additional edge 410 constraint between vertices 401, 403. Since the vertices at the ends of each edge of the graph should be different colors to be colorable successfully, vertices 401, 403, which have the same coloring in this example, generate a conflict because of the added edge 410 between them. In such non-colorable graph eases, hereinafter also referred to as a "conflict", the designer should rework the design intent to resolve the conflict. Such rework may include moving or changing the shapes. </p><p id="p0079" num="0079">[0072] Figure 5 depicts a simplified exemplary flowchart 2.03 for validating triple patterning printability as depicted in Figure 2, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Flowchart 203 may be used to determine triple -patterning decomposability of a given design intent. Flowchart 203 depicts a graph G representative of the design intent is created 510 or generated by the computer. Vertices of graph G correspond to, or are associated with, the multitude of shapes in the design. An edge is added between two vertices when that pair of vertices may not be on the same mask due to design ide violation, such as a minimum spacing rule violation. </p><p id="p0080" num="0080">[0073] Graph G may be divided into a multitude of sub-graphs Gi created 520 or generated using graph simplification methods that do not degrade the future coloring solution quality. Graph simplification methods include connected component decomposition, bi-connected component decomposition and hiding of vertices with degree less than three. Vertices in a subset of the multitude of sub-graphs Gi are decomposed 530 into at least three color sets using a fast approximate coloring algorithm as described below. The at least three color sets of the sub-graphs are merged 540 to generate one of at least three colors for each one of the multitude of vertices in graph G to form the coloring of graph G. </p><p id="p0081" num="0081">[0074] Figure 6 depicts a simplified exemplary flowchart for decomposing vertices using an approximate coloring algorithm 530 as depicted in Figure 5. Figure 6 depicts an initial coloring of each sub-graph Gi is created 610 using a randomized graph coloring heuristic. Examples of graph coloring heuristics include Recursive Largest First algorithm, degree of saturation (DSATUR) algorithm, sequential vertex coloring algorithm or any other existing 
<!-- EPO <DP n="16"/>-->
 coloring algorithm with polynomial time complexity. Such heuristics may use more than three (3) colors to color the sub-graphs. Vertices having invalid colors (colors greater than 3) are randomly assigned a color from the first three valid colors (i.e., color 1 - color 3). The resulting 3-coloring of the sub-graphs may thus have conflicts. </p><p id="p0082" num="0082">[0075] Next, the initial coloring is modified 62.0 or processed using a randomized local search algorithm, such as the Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing algorithms. Such randomized local search algorithms improve the coloring by performing a neighborhood search guided by a cost function that defines the quality of the coloring. Possible cost functions for a coloring include cost functions characterized by the number of conflicting edges, the number of conflicting vertices, or any combinations of such functions. Cost functions may also include other criteria such as distribution of colors. After modifying the initial coloring 620 is completed, the coloring is returned 635 as a valid coloring of the subgraph when it is free of conflicts. </p><p id="p0083" num="0083">[0076] When the coloring has conflicts at 630 or otherwise fails to satisfy one or more conditions or criteria, such as color distribution uniformity, a hybrid-evolutionary population based search is performed for color selection on a pool of candidate solutions, as described further below . A pool or a multitude of candidate coloring solutions is created 640 or generated using, for example, a coloring heuristic, such as that described at 610. In one embodiment, coloring heuristic randomly assigns colors to vertices and processes this coloring using a local search, that may be similar to the local search at 620. In another embodiment, configurations of the coloring heuristics used at 640 may be different from those at 610 and 620; for example, they may have different cost functions. Cost functions may be defined by the number of conflicts, the number of conflicting vertices, and the like. Each candidate solution in the pool is a coloring of sub-graph Gi. </p><p id="p0084" num="0084">[0077] A hybrid-evolutionary population search algorithm is applied 650 or performed on the pool of candidate solutions until one or more stopping conditions or criteria such as exceeding 660 an iteration counter is met. Stopping criteria may be defined by finding a legal coloring, i.e. no coloring conflict is detected, exceeding the maximum number of iterations of population search, or reaching some other criteria of coloring quality. At 670 the solution candidate with the highest quality, defined in accordance with a cost function, is selected and returned as the coloring of graph G, i.e. as the decomposed first subset of the plurality of sub-graphs.

 [0078] Figure 7 depicts a simplified exemplary flowchart 650 for applying the population search, i.e. the hybrid evolutionary algorithm, on the pool of candidate solutions as depicted in Figure 6, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. A multitude of candidate coloring solutions in the pool of candidate coloring solutions are picked 710 or selected to become the multitude of parents. Such selection from the pool of candidate coloring solutions may be uniformly random, or biasing the selection towards higher quality candidate solutions according to a cost function, thus requiring additional computations. A new candidate solution, hereinafter also referred to as "offspring", is created 720 or generated by merging the color classes of the selected solution candidates, i.e. parents. Each color class of a coloring is a set of vertices assigned to the same color in that coloring. For example, referring to Figure 3C, color classes are {301, 303}, {302}, {304} . Merging of color classes from the selected candidate solutions results in the generation of new candidate solutions, thereby facilitating cooperation between the candidate solutions. </p><p id="p0085" num="0085">[0079] For example, Tables 1-5 show merging of the color classes from the parents, in which an example sub-graph is presented, which includes ten (10) vertices numbered from one (1) to ten (10).

The following description will refer to the BOX process flow by example, however as will be seen, it is understood that a single crystal silicon wafer without the BOX processing may be used in an alternative embodiment. </p><p id="p0105" num="0105">[0087] As depicted in Figure 8A, a multitude of layers including layers with different etching characteristics may be deposited 902 so as to overlay crystalline silicon layer 806. For example, a dielectric layer 808 may be deposited to overlay crystalline silicon layer 806 followed by depositing a mandrel 2. layer 810 to overlay dielectric layer 808. Then, a mandrel 1 layer 812 may be deposited to overlay mandrel 2 layer 810. In alternative embodiments, different layers than those described above may be used, such as for example a greater number of layers than the three deposited layers described above may be used depending on the etching characterist ics of the layers used. </p><p id="p0106" num="0106">[0088] After the deposition 902 of the multitude of layers, a photolithography sequence 904 applies photoresist (PR) (not shown), exposes the PR using a mask 1, develops the PR, and etches mandrel 1 layer 812, and removes the PR. leaving the pattern of mask 1 in mandrel 1 pattern 812E as depicted in Figure 8B, Various alternative steps for the photolithography sequence are possible. The pattern of mask 1 in mandrel 1 pattern 812E may include a pattern having a minimum process technology pitch, P, as shown by the arrow that includes the sum of a minimum line and minimum space. In other words, although the line within P may be processed wider or narrower, the sum of the line and space within P may not be processed any smaller for this technology example using just one photolithography sequence using just one mask. </p><p id="p0107" num="0107">[0089] Next, a spacer 1 layer 814 may be deposited 906 in conformal fashion so as to overlay the mandrel 1 pattern 812E as depicted in Figure 8C.

BARC 1 layer 816 may be etched leaving BARC 1 pattern 816E after PR removal as depicted in Figure 8H. Next, mandrel 2 layer 810 may be etched 916 using BARC 1 pattern 816E and spacers 1 structures 814S as hard- masks leaving behind mandrel 2 pattern 810E as depicted in Figure 81, Then, BARC 1 pattern 816E may be removed 918 as depicted in Figure 8 J. Next, Figure 8K depicts the cross-section after spacers 1 structures 814S are removed 920 and provide patterns having about one half the pitch available using a single photolithography mask. </p><p id="p0109" num="0109">[0091] Next, a spacer 2 layer 820 may be deposited 922 in conformal fashion so as to overlay the mandrel 2 pattern 810E as depicted in Figure 8L. Then, spacer 2 layer 820 may be etched 924 so as to leave behind spacers 2 structures 820S at the sidewalk of mandrel 2 pattern 81 OB as depicted in Figure 8M. Then, mandrel 2 pattern 810E may be removed 926 as depicted in Figure 8N. It should be noted that the pitch in spacers 2 structures 820S ma <sup>¬</sup> be about one fourth of P as shown by the arrows. Next, a planarizing bottom anti-reflective coating 2 (BARC 2.) layer 82.2 may be added 928 so as to overlay spacers 2 structures 820S and dielectric layer 808 as depicted in Figure 80. </p><p id="p0110" num="0110">[0092] Then, a third photolithography sequence 930 applies a PR layer, exposes the PR using a mask 3, develops the PR leaving patterned PR layer 824, which again may be patterned with pitch P as shown by the arrows in Figure 8P. BARC 2 layer 822 may be etched leaving BARC 2 pattern 822E after PR removal as depicted in Figure 8Q. Next, dielectric layer 808 may be etched 932 using BARC 2 pattern 822E and spacers 2 structures 820S as hard-masks leaving behind dielectric pattern 808E as depicted in Figure 8R. Then, BARC 2 pattern 822E may be removed 934 as depicted in Figure 88. Next, Figure 8T depicts the cross-section after spacers 2 structures 820S are removed 936. Then dielectric pattern 808E may be used as a hard mask to etch 938 crystalline silicon layer 806 as depicted in figure 8U. Next, dielectric pattern 808E may be removed as depicted in figure 8V leaving crystalline silicon pattern 806E, which in-turn includes crystalline silicon fins 806F. In an alternative embodiment, when the single crystal silicon wafer without the BOX processing may be used, the processing sequence of steps 904 through 940 may be similar, resulting in

Further, the resulting patterns in crystalline silicon patterns 806E and 802E may include a pitch that is about one fourth the pitch available using just a single mask. Thus, the pitch achievable using triple -patterning technology may be about half the pitch achievable using double -patterning technology and about one fourth the pitch achievable using a single mask, which leads to greater density integrated circuits using triple patterning, as depicted by the arrows in Figure 8 V and Figure 8W. </p><p id="p0112" num="0112">[0094] The complex crystalline silicon patterns 806E and 802E are made possible, in-part, because of the validation embodiments of the present invention referred to in Figure 2 through Figure 7, which may be performed for the design intents and associated shapes used in mask 1 through mask 3 referenced in Figures 8B, 8G, 8P and associated respective photolithography sequences 904, 914, 930 referenced in Figure 9, The crystalline silicon fins 806F, 802.F depicted in Figure 8 V and Figure 8W may be subsequently used in the fabrication of three dimensional transistors such as fin-FETs or triple-gate FETs requiring smaller pitch than that available using a single mask or double patterning technology.
