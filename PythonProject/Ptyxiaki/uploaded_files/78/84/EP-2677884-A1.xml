High energy, high protein diets have been developed including all required macro and micro nutrients. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In a next step of nutritional therapy of oncology patients, ketogenic diets are recommended for slowing the growth of tumors. Ketogenic diets are diets that cause a ketogenic status in a patient. E.g. it was shown that a ketogenic diet could slow the growth of brain tumors (The calorically restricted ketogenic diet, an effective alternative therapy for malignant brain cancer. Weihua Zhou, Purna Mukherjee, Mi- chael A Kiebish, William T Markis, John G Mantis and Thomas N Seyfried; Nutrition &amp; Metabolism 2007, 4:5-).

The experiments were done in mice that received whole brain radiation in combination with at libitum standard feed or ketogenic diet. Irradiated animals fed standard feed had a median survival of 44.5 days, while irradiated animals maintained on ketogenic diet demonstrated a complete loss of bioluminescence, suggesting the absence of viable tumor cells. These animals have been followed for 170 days with no visible signs of recurrent tumor (p=0.0061 ), and tumor tissue does not recur even when animals were switched back to standard (non-ketogenic) diet. Animals fed ketogenic diet in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy had a median survival of 37 days compared to 28 days for animals treated with TMZ and maintained on SD (p=0.0043). Previous studies with only chemotherapy or radiotherapy never showed complete loss of tumor cells, or cure of brain tumor patients.

 A preferred embodiment according to the present invention is therefore a ketogenic diet in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for the treatment of invasive solid tumors (cancers). The ketogenic diet should preferably have a weight ratio fat : protein and optionally carbohydrates of at least 2:1 , preferably at least 3:1 and even more preferably 4 to 5 :1 , and most preferably 4:1.

The use of fats as a primary energy source leads to a state of ketosis and the accumulation of ketone bodies in the blood. KetoCal<sup>®</sup> (Nutri- cia North America, Gaithersburg, MD) is a nutritionally complete, commercially available 4:1 (weight ratio fat : carbohydrate + protein) ketogenic formula that has been used as an effective non- pharmacologic treatment for the management of pediatric epilepsy. Diet-induced changes to brain homeostasis as a result of ketosis have shown potential as an alternative treatment for other neurological diseases including malignant gliomas.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant primary brain tumor in adults and children. Conventional GBM therapies are considered palliative, but rarely curative. Long-term progression free survival remains low for most GBM patients even after complete surgical excision, combined with the best available treatment. Standard therapy for GBM includes surgery followed by concomitant radiation and/or chemotherapy. These procedures, however, extend median survival by only a few months beyond the no therapy option. The ke- togenic composition according to the present invention is ideally

 suited as a non-toxic nutritional therapy in addition to the standard therapy for managing malignant brain cancer. Also other cancer types can be treated with a combination of a ketogenic nutritional composition and standard radiation and/or chemotherapy. It is well known in the art that cancer cells tend to become more dependent on glucose as a source of energy as they develop into later, more aggressive and malignant stages.

Muscle wasting (MW) in chronic disease is defined as an involuntary loss of body weight of more than 5% within one month. If loss of lean body mass occurs at a more gradual rate but during a longer period, the inventors refer to chronic muscle wasting (CMW), in particular if more than 10% of body weight is lost in a period of 6 months. MW is typically observed during recovery of trauma or surgery. CMW is typically observed in severe diseases such as cancer. The rate of muscle wasting is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The cause of muscle wasting as a result of a disease is thought to be multi-factorial.

A good quality of the fat is therefore essential for successful treatment and compliance. Ketones can be used as fuel by the brain and other cell types.

This is (in part) due to the fact that fatty acids containing 6 to 12 carbons do not require carnitine to cross the mitochondrial membrane in liver tissue of healthy well-nourished adults, which is in contrast to the carnitine-dependent beta-oxidation of fatty acids with 14 carbon atoms or more. Beta-oxidation of fatty acids results in the production of acetyl-CoA that enters the Kreb's cycle to produce energy, but acetyl-CoA can also be converted into to acetor acetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone, collectively called ketone bodies. </p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Therefore, the fat in the composition according to the present invention preferably comprises MCT.

Following intracranial implantation, animals were fed standard rodent chow (SD) and were randomized to treatment groups on day 3 (SD vs KetoCal<sup>®</sup> with and without radiation or TMZ) based on bioluminescent signal (MS<sup>®</sup> Spectrum in vivo imag- ing system, Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA). Blood levels of β- hydroxybutyrate (βΗΒ) and glucose were measured using a Keto- Site reflectance meter (GDS Technologies, Elkhart, IN) and HemoCue Glucose System (HemoCue AB, Angelholm, Sweden). βΗΒ and glucose levels were checked one and two weeks following the initiation of diet treatment. Mice were maintained on a 12 hour light/dark cycle and KetoCal<sup>®</sup> or SD was available ad libitum. </p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Results: 
<!-- EPO <DP n="21"/>-->
 Animals fed KetoCar had elevated levels of βΗΒ (p=0.0173), decreased levels of glucose (p=0.0224) and an increased median survival of approximately 6 days relative to animals on SD. To determine if KetoCal<sup>®</sup> enhanced the effect of radiation, mice received 2 x 4 Gy whole brain radiation in combination with SD or KetoCal<sup>®</sup>. Irradiated animals fed SD had a median survival of 44.5 days, while irradiated animals maintained on KetoCal<sup>®</sup> demonstrated a complete loss of bioluminescence, suggesting the absence of viable tumor cells. These animals have been followed for 170 days with no visible signs of recurrent tumor (p=0.0061). </p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Animals fed KetoCal<sup>®</sup> in combination with TMZ (5x50mg/kg) had a median survival of 37 days compared to 28 days for animals treated with TMZ and maintained on SD (p=0.0043). </p><p id="p0080" num="0080">In summary, the 4:1 fat: carbohydrate + protein ratio in KetoCal<sup>®</sup> ap- pears to provide appositive effect on the treatment of malignant glioma when used in addition to radiation or TMZ. The effect is particularly pronounced when used in combination with radiation. This suggests that cellular metabolic alterations brought about through changes in the diet may be useful for the adjunctive treatment of hu- man malignant gliomas.
