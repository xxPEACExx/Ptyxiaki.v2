num="0003">producing said feed additive, a feed comprising said feed additive and the use of said feed additive as additive to poultry feed. The feed additive may significantly reduce ammonia concentration in the manure of the animals kept and subsequently in the air of the breeding houses . </p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Commercial breeding of livestock is usually performed in livestock breeding houses , where large numbers of animals are kept in cages or as a group in pens . The excrements produced by the animals collect rapidly and due to the warmth and the moisture present in the breeding houses start rapidly to decay . Since the excrements of livestock are rich in nitrogen compounds large amounts of ammonia are released that </p><p id="p0005" num="0005">accumulate in the air inside the breeding houses . The ammonia concentration can reach levels up to 90 ppm . The ammonia has a high alkaline character and easily forms complexes with metals like iron and aluminium . Livestock therefore often show respiratory complications at ammonia concentrations of more than 25 ppm and at levels of more than 40 ppm the growth performance of young animals is reduced . Further, due to the weakening of the health of the animals by the impact of high ammonia concentrations a disease experienced by few animals can easily spread through a large number of other animals by contaminated litter which the animals ingest . Within the state of the art and in order to create a </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">favourable environment for the livestock, litter products have 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
been developed that also act as an adsorbent for the ammonia produced. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In US 5 , 960 , 743 is described a sulphuric acid- containing clay- based litter product useful in the control of ammonia </p><p id="p0008" num="0008">generated by decaying excrement in poorly ventilated poultry breeding houses . A raw clay is contacted with sulphuric acid to produce an acidulated clay which is then applied to the poultry brooding house floor . The raw clays used for the clay litter product can be from the hormite mineral group , the smectite mineral group and mixtures thereof . The hormite group of minerals includes the palygorskite and sepiolite varieties which have silicate ring, ribbon or chain structures . The smectite mineral group includes the montmorillonites , </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">nontronites , hectorite and saponite varieties , which are constituted by stacked layers of an octahedral sheet of alumina and one or more sandwiching tetrahedral sheets of silica . Other minerals not belonging to the hormite or </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">smectite groups which also may be included in the raw clay are opal , apatite, calcite, feldspar, kaolinite, mica, quartz and gypsum, amongst others . According to a preferred embodiment montmorillonite clay is used as the raw clay . The sulfuric acid content of the acidulated clay is at least about 15 percent by weight and is preferably in the range of from about 25 to about 35 percent by weight . The acidulated clay product can be applied directly to the existing floor bedding or litter in pens of poultry breeding houses . </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Within the EP 10 160 306.6 a litter product comprising a clay material with a mixture of an acid and at least one aluminium salt deposited thereon is described. This litter product shows a much improved absorbance capacity compared to litter </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">products so far known within the state of the art . </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">There are , however, several drawbacks associated with litter products . On the one hand, the absorbance capacity is often 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 very low. Further, a part of the ammonia firstly gets into the air before the rest is absorbed by the litter . On the other hand, the amount of litter to be used to guaranty a </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">satisf ctory ammonia absorbance is quite high. The obj ect to be solved by the invention is to provide a product , which already diminishes the production of ammonia by the animal . In particular, the object of the present invention is to provide a feed additive that has a high binding capacity for alkaline compounds , in particular nitrogen containing compounds like ammonia, and further has a high drying </p><p id="p0015" num="0015">capacity, such that the amount of ammonia present in the atmosphere of a livestock breeding house can be kept at low levels and the animals can be kept at good health and </p><p id="p0016" num="0016">spreading of diseases can be diminished . Further, the obj ect of the inventors of the present invention was to provide a product which has moreover additional health benefits and overall leads to a higher productivity of a breeding or fattening farm. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017">This object is solved by a feed additive according to claim 1. Preferred embodiments of said feed additive are defined in the depending claims . </p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In a first aspect, the present invention therefore relates to a feed additive comprising a clay material and at least one saponine deposited thereon .

 species . Specifically, saponins are amphipathic glycosides grouped phenomenologically by the soap- like foaming they produce when shaken in aqueous solutions , and structurally by their composition of one or more hydrophilic glycoside </p><p id="p0020" num="0020">moieties combined with a lipophilic triterpene derivative . </p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The aglycone (glycoside-free portion) of a saponine is termed sapogenine . The number of saccharide-chains attached to the sapogenin/aglycone core can vary, as can the length of each chain. A typical chain length is from 1 to 11 , with the numbers 2 to 5 being the most frequent , and with both linear and branched saccharide-chains being represented . </p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Monosaccharides such as D-glucose and D-galactose are among the most common components of the attached chains . </p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The lipophilic aglycone can be any one of a wide variety of polycyclic organic structures originating from the serial addition of ten- carbon (CIO) terpene units to compose a C30 triterpene skeleton, often with subsequent alteration to produce a C27 steroidal skeleton. The subset of saponins that are steroidal have been termed saraponins ; these saraponins are also encompassed by the term "saponine" according to the present invention . </p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Within the present invention "the at least one saponine" can be derived from any source known to a person skilled in the art as suitable for the inventive purpose . Thus , the at least one saponine can be plant-derived, but it can also be isolated from marine organisms . Saponins can for example be found in the botanical family Sapindaceae, with its defining genus Sapindus ( soapberry or soapnut ) , and in the closely related families Aceraceae (maples) and Hippocastanaceae (horse chestnuts ) .

 f milies , this class of chemical compounds are found in various parts of the plant : leaves , stems , roots , bulbs, blossom and fruit . Further, saponins can be extracted from the soapwort plant (Genus Saponaria, Family Caryophyllaceae) and from the soap bark (or soapbark) tree, Quillaja saponaria, and from yucca plants (Genus Yucca) . Saponins extracted from Yucca plants are preferred for the inventive purpose , whereas saponins extracted from Yucca Schidigera is particularly preferred. Further, artificially produced saponins are also suitable for the inventive purpose . </p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to the invention, at least one saponine deposited onto the clay is preferably a saponine derived from the Yucca plant , particularly preferred from Yucca Schidigera . Within the scope of the present invention, however, two or more different saponins from the same or different sources can be deposited onto the clay material . </p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Particularly preferred the at least one saponine is comprised in the feed additive in an amount of from 1 to 50 wt%, according to a preferred embodiment in an amount of from 5 to 45 wt% and according to a particular preferred embodiment in an amount of from 10 to 30 wt%, whereas from 15 to 25 wt% are most preferred.

The amount of saponine is calculated as the weight difference of the clay material before and after the mixing with the saponine containing extract (when mixing at room temperature , 21 °C) and the percentage refers to the weight of the dry clay. </p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The "clay material" comprised in the feed additive may be a raw clay or may be a clay activated by a corresponding </p><p id="p0030" num="0030">activation procedure, e.g. by acid leaching of a raw clay to increase pore volume and specific surface area of the clay.

Further, it has been observed that the meat production of broiler chickens fed with the feed additive of the present invention is increased and the meat comprises a higher amount of proteins and less nitrogen is excreted with the manure . The inventors of the present invention believe that this effect is due to the fact that the nitrogen is used to produce more muscular mass leading also to a higher quality meat product .
