The needle tip at the distal end of the needle is flared out and is slightly larger in diameter than the needle shaft and the inside diameter of the needle guard. A retaining ring is held tightly by a friction fit with the catheter hub wherein the outside diameter of the needle guard is less than the inside diameter of this retaining ring so that normally the needle guard can easily slide through the ring. When the needle is withdrawn and the flared out needle tip goes inside the needle guard, the needle guard end caps are free to close and the needle tip shoulder pulls the needle guard through the retaining ring thus forcing the flared end of the needle guard closed.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The McLees protective device requires an irksome, extra pulling action or tug on the needle guard through a retention ring to remove the protected needle from the catheter hub. The McLees device also requires the assembly of two separate components and is thus relatively costly to manufacture. In addition, the needle in the McLees device includes a larger diameter portion near and at the needle tip. This feature of the McLees device would require that the remainder of the needle be of a lesser diameter which would have the adverse effect of slowing the blood flashback through the needle.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Additionally this flared out needle tip is impractical for a number of reasons. The device can not be assembled in the usual manner by inserting the needle tip first through the catheter, without damaging the catheter. Further, when the user wants to withdraw the needle, the flared out needle tip must expand the catheter material to allow it to pass.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">I.V. catheters are primarily used to administer fluids, sometimes containing medications, directly into a patient's vascular system. The catheter is inserted into a patient's vein by a health care worker by using a handheld placement device that includes a sharp tip needle. The needle is positioned in the interior hollow portion of the catheter with its tip extended slightly beyond the edge of the catheter. The end of the apparatus opposite the needle tip is made up of the needle connected to a needle hub which is capable of being held by the health care worker during the insertion procedure.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The insertion procedure contains four basic steps: (1) the health care worker inserts the needle and catheter together into the patient's vein; (2) after insertion into the vein with the needle point, the catheter is forwarded into the vein of the patient by the health care worker pushing the catheter with his or her finger; (3) the health care worker withdraws the needle<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> by grasping the hub end (opposite the point end) while at the same time applying pressure to the patient's skin at the insertion site with his or her free hand; and (4) the health care worker then tapes the now inserted catheter to the patient's skin and connects the exposed end of the catheter, the catheter hub, to the source of the fluid to be administered into the patient's vein.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The problem is that immediately after the withdrawal of the needle from the patient's vein, the health care worker who is, at this time, involved in at least two urgent procedures must place the exposed needle tip at a nearby location and address the tasks required to accomplish the needle withdrawal. It is at this juncture that the exposed needle tip creates a danger of an accidental needle stick occurring, which under the circumstances, leaves the health care worker vulnerable to the transmission of various, dangerous blood-borne pathogens, including AIDS and hepatitis.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">This danger to the health care worker from accidental needle sticks has caused an impetus for the development of a safer IV catheter in which the occurrence of such accidental needle sticks is prevented. Safety catheters that have been developed to achieve this result are disclosed, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="USRE34416E"><text>Lemieux Reissue Patent No. Re. 34,416</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5558651A"><text>Crawford U.S. Patent No. 5,558,651</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5135504A"><text>McLees U.S. Patent No. 5,135,504</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US5697907A"><text>Gaba U.S. Patent No. 5,697,907</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US4978344A"><text>Dombrowski U.S. Patent No. 4,978,344</text></patcit>. <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US4929241A"><text>Kulli U.S. Patent No. 4,929,241</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US5053017A"><text>Chamuel U.S. Patent No. 5,053,017</text></patcit><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> disclose a protective needle guard for use with a hypodermic needle.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The prior art safety catheters all exhibit one or more drawbacks that have thus far limited their usefulness and full acceptance by health-care workers.' For example, in the safety catheter disclosed in the Lemieux patent, the force required to engage the needle slot within the guard flange is relatively great and would interfere with the removal of the needle. Reducing this force to a more acceptable level would create the possibility of the needle guard remaining in the catheter hub after the needle is removed from the catheter. As a result, the safety catheter disclosed in the Lemieux patent would not consistently function in a reliable manner.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Similarly, the user of the safety catheter disclosed in the Dombrowski patent would have to exert a considerable force to remove the protective cap from the catheter hub, when the cap engages a needle. The safety catheter disclosed in the Dombrowski patent would also be relatively expensive to fabricate because of its inclusion of a flexible flange and a tether.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a safety IV catheter, which reliably and automatically prevents accidental, inadvertent contact with the needle tip after use.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">It is a further object of the invention to provide a safety catheter which provides reliable protection to the health care practitioner against needle sticks without requiring any change in the manner of use of the safety catheter by the practitioner.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">It is another object of the present invention to provide a safety IV catheter of the type described which is relatively simple and inexpensive to manufacture.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a safety catheter of the type described in which removal of the needle from the needle guard after use is prevented.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">These objects are achieved by the features in the characterizing part of claim 1.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">To these ends, the safety IV catheter of the invention includes a resilient spring clip needle guard that includes a distal or front end and a proximal or rear wall. The spring clip is inserted into the catheter hub and is urged by the needle shaft into contact with the inner walls of the catheter hub so that the needle guard is reliably retained therein. When the needle is withdrawn from the catheter, the force it had<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> previously exerted on the needle guard is released causing the needle guard to pivot within the catheter hub until it clamps onto the needle shaft. At this time, the distal end wall of the needle guard blocks the distal pointed end tip of the needle. In addition, the spring clip and protected needle onto which it is clamped can be readily and safely removed from the catheter hub. The needle may be provided with a slot or a bulge which cooperates with the needle guard to prevent the inadvertent removal of the needle from the needle guard after their removal from the catheter hub.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In another embodiment of the spring clip safety catheter of the invention, a retaining groove or bump is formed in the inner wall of the catheter hub, which, in the ready position, engages a lower arm of the spring clip to add in the retention of the spring clip in the catheter hub.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In yet a further embodiment of the spring clip safety catheter of the invention, a slot is formed in the needle. After the spring clip has pivoted to its retracted position and the needle is clamped by the spring clip, further movement of the needle in the proximal direction will cause the rear or proximal arm of the spring clip to seat in the slot, thereby to more securely clamp the needle shaft to the spring clip.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In a further embodiment of the spring clip catheter guard of the invention, a tether is connected to the needle hub and the spring clip guard to prevent the spring clip guard from<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> being pulled off the protected needle without requiring an excessive clamping force therebetween.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">To the accomplishment of the above and to such further objects as may hereinabove appear, the present invention relates to a safety IV catheter as described with respect to presently preferred embodiments in the following specification, as considered with the accompanying drawings, in which:

A and 1B, includes a needle hub 12 that includes an axial opening 14 which securely receives the proximal end of a needle 16 having a sharpened tip 18. The needle hub 12, as is conventional, is hollow and includes a flash chamber 22. As is also conventional, the needle 16 is received within a hollow tubular catheter 24, the proximal end of which is concentrically affixed within the distal end of a catheter hub 26 having a distal section 28 and a contiguous, larger diameter proximal section 30.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The catheter hub 26 terminates at its proximal end in a luer fitting 32 adapted to receive a tubing set, which in a known manner, administers intravenous fluid into the patient. The catheter 24 is secured within an axial passageway 34 in distal hub section 28 by means of a sleeve 20 received within passageway 34, which engages the proximal end of the catheter.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> Passageway 34 communicates at its proximal end with a flash chamber 36 formed in hub section 30.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the ready position of the catheter shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref>, the distal end of the needle hub 12 is snugly received in the proximal end of the interior of chamber 36 such that the needle 16 extends through the chamber 36, the passageway 34 and distally beyond the catheter hub 26 and catheter 24 so that its tip extends beyond the tapered distal end of the catheter.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In use, the distal tip of the needle and the catheter are inserted into a patient's vein. Thereafter, the health care practitioner manually places the catheter further into the vein and then withdraws the needle by grasping and moving by hand the proximal end of the needle hub 12. The luer of the catheter hub 26 is then fitted with a source of the fluid that is to be administered into the patient's vein.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In accordance with the present invention, as the needle 16 is being withdrawn from the patient, a protective needle guard 40 located within hub chamber 36 automatically snaps into a retracted position in which it blocks access to the distal needle tip and prevents further distal movement of the needle tip, thereby to prevent accidental contact by the health care practitioner with the needle tip.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1A and 1B</figref>, the needle guard 40 is in the form of a unitary spring clip that is preferably made of a resilient metal such as stainless steel. The spring clip includes a distal arm 42 terminating at its upper end in a<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> curved lip 44, and at its lower end in a pointed end 46, which, in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, is received within a mating groove 48 formed in the lower interior wall of catheter hub section 30.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The spring clip needle guard 40 further includes a transverse segment 50 that extends upward and proximally from lower pointed end 46 and terminates at a U-shaped upper end 52. In the ready position of the spring clip shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref>, upper end 52 abuts against the upper interior wall of the catheter hub section 30. The spring clip guard 40 further includes a vertical arm 54 that extends downward from the U-shaped upper end 52 and terminates above the lower wall of catheter hub section 30. Transverse segment 50 and proximal vertical arm 54 respectively include axially aligned openings 56, 58 through which the shaft of needle 16 is free to pass and axially move.
