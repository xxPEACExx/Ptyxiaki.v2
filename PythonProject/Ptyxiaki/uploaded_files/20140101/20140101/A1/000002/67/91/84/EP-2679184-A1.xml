More particularly, the present disclosure relates to systems and methods including a controller, tuner and step motor configured to simulate an electrosurgical procedure for testing electrosurgical generators to support a variety of developmental and research activities associated therewith.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Description of Related Art</u></b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Electrosurgical generators that are utilized in conjunction with one or more types of electrosurgical instruments to electrosurgically treat tissue are well known in the art. For example, and in one particular instance, the electrosurgical generator and instrument may be configured to seal tissue. As is known in the art, sealing tissue, typically, includes (in the broadest sense) the steps of grasping tissue with jaw members associated with the electrosurgical instrument and providing electrosurgical energy to the grasped tissue to seal the tissue. To create an effective tissue seal, a specific gap distance (e.g., in the range from about 0.001 inches to about 0.006) needs to be maintained between the jaw members during the sealing process. In addition, a specific pressure (e.g., in the range from about 3 kg/cm<sup>2</sup> to about 16 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>) needs to be maintained on tissue during the sealing process. Moreover, one or more controllers are associated with the electrosurgical generator and are configured to control the amount of electrosurgical energy that is provided to the jaw members during the sealing cycle. All of these three factors contribute in providing an effective, uniform and consistent tissue seal. In certain<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> instances, after the tissue is sealed, one or more suitable devices may be utilized to sever the sealed tissue.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">During the sealing process, characteristics of tissue, e.g., impedance of tissue, change due to the fact that the tissue is being heated, desiccated fused and dehydrated. In particular, goes through this cycle, the tissue impedance characteristics change which, in turn, cause the real and imaginary parts of the impedance to behave differently. Most electrosurgical generators are equipped to handle these changes in impedance such that tissue can be effectively sealed. In particular, one or more control algorithms, sensors, etc., in operable communication with the electrosurgical generator are, typically, configured to monitor and compensate for these changes in impedance during the sealing cycles.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Electrosurgical generators may be tested prior to use to ensure that the electrosurgical generator and operable components associated therewith will function as intended during an electrosurgical procedure. As is conventional in the art, to test the electrosurgical generators, a sealing phase may be simulated utilizing a range of resistors with fixed values that are placed on an output of the electrosurgical generator. The fixed resistors are configured to represent tissue that is to be sealed. With the resistors in place at the output of the electrosurgical energy, the electrosurgical generator may be run through a simulated sealing cycle and relevant data pertaining to the sealing simulation may be collected. As can be appreciated, this testing method only provides data that pertains to "purely" resistive loads. As noted above, however, tissue impedance includes both real and imaginary parts, which behave differently. Accordingly, the aforementioned testing method may not provide an accurate or complete representation of the changes in tissue impedance as the tissue is being sealed.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>SUMMARY</u></b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In view of the foregoing, systems and methods including a controller, tuner and step motor configured to simulate an electrosurgical procedure for testing electrosurgical generators to support a variety of development activities associated therewith may prove useful in the medical field.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Embodiments of the present disclosure are described in detail with reference to the drawing figures wherein like reference numerals identify similar or identical elements.

As used herein, the measurement device 3 is configured to measure, collect, calculate and record one or more electrical parameters at a surgical site to determine an impedance of tissue as the tissue is being electrosurgically treated. Suitable measurement devices 3 may include without limitation spectrum analyzers, oscilloscopes, and the like.

The controls allow a user to adjust power of the RF energy, waveform parameters (e.g., crest factor, duty cycle, etc.), and other parameters to achieve the desired waveform suitable for a particular task (e.g., coagulating, tissue sealing, intensity setting, etc.).</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Generator 4 includes a DC power supply 10 that is connected to a conventional AC source (e.g., electrical wall outlet) and includes a low voltage power supply 12 ("LVPS") and a high voltage power supply 14 ("HVPS") (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>). The HVPS 14 provides high voltage DC power to an RF output stage 16, e.g., an RF amp module, which then converts high voltage DC power into RF energy and delivers the RF energy to the active terminal 18. The energy is returned thereto via the return terminal 20. The LVPS 12 provides power to various components of the generator 4 (e.g., measurement device 3, input controls, displays, etc.).

The plurality of impedance values are obtained by mapping passive components of the tuner 8 to a Smith Chart. Tuner 8 may be any suitable type of tuner including but not limited to those described in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figs. 2-6</figref>.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> illustrates an RF tuner, e.g., a passive tuner 8a. The passive tuner 8a includes a variable Pi network having a first variable capacitor C1 connected in parallel with one or more variable inductors L1 that is connected in parallel with a second variable capacitor C2 that is connected in parallel with one or more resistors R1. Each of the first and second variable capacitors C1 and C2 include a capacitance that can vary from about 40pF to about 2,000pF and the inductor(s) may include an inductance that can vary from about 50uH to about 200uH. An<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> advantage of a Pi network is that it covers an entire range of the Smith Chart with a minimal amount of passive components.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> illustrates a high frequency tuner 8b. Unlike the passive tuner 8a, however, high frequency tuner 8b does not cover the entire range of the Smith Chart. This type of tuner is suitable for testing the generator 4 when the generator 4 is configured to transmit electrosurgical energy in the high frequency range, e.g., Megahertz frequency range. One advantage of the high frequency tuner 8b is that it utilizes only three passive components, a capacitor C3, an inductor L2 and a resistor R2. To increase coverage around the Smith Chart without adding more passive components, an optional quarter wavelength of cable 40 may be positioned between the generator 4 and the tuner 8b; this functions to shift an impedance 180° around the Smith Chart.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref> illustrates a microwave tuner 8c.

In this particular embodiment, an adjustable tuning stub 42 that is connected to ground can be either an open or a short circuit node and may vary in length as dictated by controller 6. In certain embodiments, the tuning stub 42 can be moved towards or away from the load to shift the load around the Smith Chart. The location of the adjustable stub 42 shifts the load around the Smith Chart by placing the adjustable stub in parallel with the load. The microwave tuner 8b is relatively small when compared to the aforementioned tuners (or tuners yet to be described).</p><p id="p0048" num="0048"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref> illustrates a solid state tuner 8d. Solid state tuner 8d uses one or more pin diodes (two pin diodes 44a-44b illustrated) to "switch-in" respective tuning capacitors C4, C5 (which are connected to ground) and various taps on an inductor L3. Solid state tuner 8d includes a resistor R3 that is connected to ground. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>, a bias<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> line 46 is utilized to turn on and off the diodes 44a-44b and is isolated from the RF frequencies by a choke inductor L4 and a bypass capacitor C6. The bias line 46 includes a diode D1 in series with a capacitor C7 that is connected to ground. An advantage of the tuner 8d is that is has no mechanical parts and can have higher repeatability and reliability when compared to other tuners, e.g., tuner 8a.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 6</figref> illustrates an active tuner 8e that utilizes a FET 48 (or other suitable device) to increase or decrease a load of the active tuner 8e. In this instance, the controller 6 can adjust a gate voltage Vg, which adjusts an on resistance of the FET 48 which, in turn, increases and/or decreases the overall resistance of the active tuner 8e. Active tuner 8e includes a very fast response time and, in some instances, may be able to simulate an arcing event. An advantage of the tuner 8e when compared to the aforementioned tuners is that tuner 8e does not require mapping to a Smith Chart, i.e., the load of the tuner 8e is monitored using voltage and current.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref>, a step motor 50 is configured to operably couple to the controller 6 and one or more of the tuners 8 (for illustrative purposes, step motor 50 is described in terms of use with the passive tuner 8a) to control the tuner 8a to a specific impedance. Positions of the step motor 50 are utilized to vary one or more of the passive components in the tuner 8a and are then mapped to a corresponding value on the Smith Chart. In particular, step motor 50 is configured to couple to the tuner 8a to vary one or more of the first and second capacitors C1-C2, inductors L1 and/or resistor R1. The positions of the step motor 50 are then mapped to a corresponding value on the Smith Chart to control the tuner 8a to a specific impedance. To accomplish this, controller 6 is utilized to control the step motor 50 as the step motor 50 moves through each of the positions of the step motor 50 and measures an impedance value, e.g., complex impedance, of the load of the tuner 8a.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0051" num="0051">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref>, an impedance analyzer 52 is configured to operably couple to the controller 6 and one or more of the tuners 8, e.g., tuner 8a.

In particular, in a diagnostic testing or simulation sequence, the tuner 8 functions as a load "L" for an output of the generator 4 and an impedance of the load "L" of the tuner 8 may be varied by varying one or more of the passive components of the tuner 8.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Operation of the system 2 is described in terms of testing generator 4 for possible instabilities that may be associated with the generator 4 after and/or prior to use thereof.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">For purposes herein, it is assumed that calculated impedance values have been previously obtained during an electrosurgical procedure, mapped to a Smith Chart and stored into memory 26 of generator 4.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Generator 4 may be coupled to the controller 6 and one or more of the aforementioned tuners 8, e.g., passive tuner 8a.

Alternately, the external measurement device 3 may have been used to collect, record, calculate and, subsequently, store the impedance values into memory 26 of the generator 4.

Controller 6 activates the step motor 50 to move the step motor 50 to vary the inductance of the inductor L1 and/or capacitance of the first and second capacitors C1-C2 to vary the complex impedance of the tuner 8a. Varying the complex impedance of the tuner 8a around the Smith Chart "mimics" actual tissue response. The controller 6 can move through as many positions of the step motor 50 as needed to check for possible instabilities that may be associated with the generator 4.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">As can be appreciated, the aforementioned system 2 overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks typically associated with conventional methods that are utilized to test electrosurgical generators.
