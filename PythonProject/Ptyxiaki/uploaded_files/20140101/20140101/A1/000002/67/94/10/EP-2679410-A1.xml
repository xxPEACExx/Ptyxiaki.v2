In addition, in order to achieve low rolling resistance, it is performed to reduce the weight of a tire casing that is a constituent member of a tire exclusive of a tread by reducing the layer number of belts (PTL 2), replacing an inner liner rubber by a film (PTL 3), or the like.<br/>
However, the reduction of rolling resistance and the tire durability are in a relation of antinomy, and therefore, it<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> is difficult to reduce the rolling resistance of tire while keeping the durability of tire.</p><heading id="h0003">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT LITERATURE</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003"><ul><li>PTL 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2010041528A"><text>WO2010041528</text></patcit></li><li>PTL 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2006117099A"><text>JP-A-2006-117099</text></patcit></li><li>PTL 3: <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2007276581A"><text>JP-A-2007-276581</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">TECHNICAL PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">Under such circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide a tire in which both low rolling resistance and durability are compatible with each other.</p><heading id="h0007">SOLUTION TO PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In order to solve the foregoing problem, the present inventor has found that the problem of the present invention can be solved by regulating a rolling resistance coefficient of a tire casing so as not to exceed 4.0, leading to accomplishment of the present invention.<br/>

Incidentally, the "tire casing" as referred to in the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> present invention is a tire member exclusive of a tread portion and means both a tire member before sticking a tread portion and a tire member in which a tread portion is eliminated from a finished tire. To this tire casing, a base tread portion serving as a part of the tread portion may be stuck. In addition, the "tire casing" means the above-described tire member which has been vulcanized, and the above-described tire member that is unvulcanized is referred to as an "unvulcanized tire casing".</p><heading id="h0011">&lt;Tire&gt;</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The tire of the present invention is characterized in that a tire casing thereof has a rolling resistance coefficient according to the coastdown method of JIS D4234 of not exceeding 4.0. In this way, by controlling the rolling resistance coefficient of the tire casing such that it does not exceed 4.0, it becomes possible to make a reduction of rolling resistance and an enhancement of durability of the tire (tire including a tire casing and a tread portion) compatible with each other. This rolling resistance coefficient is preferably in the range of not exceeding 3.8, and more preferably in the range of not exceeding 3.7. Incidentally, in the present invention, as for a test condition at the time of subjecting the tire casing to a test according to the coastdown method of JIS D4234, a condition determined on the basis of a size of a tire including a tire casing and a tread portion, and the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> like is adopted. In addition, though the tire casing which is subjected to this test may be either a tire casing before sticking a tread portion or a tire casing in which a tread portion is eliminated from a finished tire, it is suitably a tire casing in which a tread portion is eliminated from a finished tire.<br/>
Furthermore, when a ratio of rolling resistance of the tire casing to rolling resistance of the whole tire is satisfied with a relation of {(rolling resistance of tire casing)/(rolling resistance of tire) ≤ 0.80}, the rolling resistance of the tire can be reduced to the last stage of running, and even in retreated tires after retreatment as obtained by exchanging a tread portion of the tire, the rolling resistance can be reduced. In addition, when this ratio is 0.1 or more, it is possible to contemplate to reduce the rolling resistance and to enhance the tire durability. From this viewpoint, the foregoing ratio is preferably from 0.1 to 0.8, more preferably from 0.3 to 0.8, and still more preferably from 0.5 to 0.8.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Examples of a method for reducing the rolling resistance coefficient of the tire casing include various methods such as change of a rubber species of the tire member, change of a vulcanization condition, change of a structure of the tire casing, etc. As examples thereof, suitable examples of<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> materials of a base tread, a belt coating rubber, a belt wedge rubber, a ply coating rubber, a belt undercushion rubber, and an inner liner rubber, each of which is located in the inside of the radial direction of a tread portion forming member in the tire casing, and suitable manufacturing methods of a tire and its members are hereunder described. However, these show merely a part of the embodiments of the present invention, and unless the gist of the present invention is deviated, these constitutions can be mutually combined, or various modifications can be made.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Each of the members of the tire according to the present invention is hereunder described. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional schematic view showing an example of the tire of the present invention.<br/>
This tire 1 is composed of a tread portion 11 and a tire casing 12. The tread portion 11 is constituted of a tread rubber 7. As described later, the tire casing 12 includes bead cores 2 and 2', a carcass ply 4, belt layers 5a to 5d, and a side rubber 8, and if desired, a base tread 13.<br/>
A structure of the tire casing 12 is as follows. Stiffeners 3 and 3' extend outward in the radial direction of the tire 1 from a pair of the bead cores 2 and 2', respectively. The carcass ply 4 has a shape in which it goes through the outside of the stiffener 3, is folded inside the stiffener 3<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> by the bead core 2 to form a shape of a horseshoe tire casing, is folded by the bead core 2' on the opposite side, and is seized outside the stiffener 3'. A belt portion 5 composed of a plurality of belt layers (four layers of 5a to 5d in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) is arranged outside the tire radius of the carcass ply 4. A belt undercushion rubber 6 is arranged in the neighborhoods of end portions of the belt layers 5a and 5b forming an intersecting layer. A belt end cover rubber (not shown) covering an end portion is arranged in end portions of the belt layers 5a to 5d. These belt undercushion rubber 6 and belt end cover rubber are generically named a belt edge rubber. A wedge-shaped belt wedge rubber 10 is arranged in the neighborhoods of an end portion between the belt layers 5b and 5c. The belt edge rubber and the belt wedge rubber 10 are also included in the belt portion 5.<br/>
If desired, the base tread 13 is arranged outside the tire radius of this belt portion 5, and the tread rubber 7 is further arranged thereon.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The side rubber 8 is arranged outside the tire axial direction (thickness direction) of the carcass ply 4 and between the tread rubber 7 and the stiffener 3. A portion where this side rubber 8 is arranged is named a side portion M, and the more inside of the tire radius than the side portion M is named a bead portion N. In this bead portion N, the bead cores<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> 2 and 2', the stiffeners 3 and 3', and the like are arranged. An inner liner layer 14 is arranged as an air permeation preventive layer in the inside of the carcass ply 4. The tire casing 12 has these bead portion N, side portion M and belt portion 5.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The belt undercushion rubber 6 is described in more detail. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the belt undercushion rubber 6 extends in the inside of the tire radial direction of the inner belt layer 5b forming an intersecting layer and the inside of the tire radial direction of the tread rubber 7 from the inside of the tire radial direction of the innermost belt layer 5a along the outside of the tire radial direction of the carcass ply 4 and extends to a space between the side rubber 8 and the carcass ply 4.</p><heading id="h0012">&lt;Members for tire manufacture&gt;</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">Next, members for manufacture of the tire 1 are described. <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional schematic view showing an example of a tire casing A and a tread portion forming member (precured tread member) B, the both being used for manufacture of the tire of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.<br/>
As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the tire 1 can be manufactured by sticking the tread portion forming member (precured tread member) B to the tire casing A prepared by vulcanizing an<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> unvulcanized tire casing using an adhesive rubber such as a cushion rubber, etc. In <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the same symbols as those in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> represent the same portions.<br/>
In the tire casing A prepared by vulcanizing separately from the tread portion, a part of the tread rubber 7 is arranged. That is, a part of the tread rubber 7 is arranged as the base tread 13 in the outside of the tire radial direction of the belt portion 5. This is made for the purposes of making adhesion to the precured member B good and enhancing durability of the tire.<br/>

At this time of vulcanization, an unvulcanized tire casing is first formed. The unvulcanized tire casing is formed in the same manner as that in a building step of a green tire in a known tire manufacturing method. For example, a carcass ply having been rubber-coated with an unvulcanized rubber is wound around a building drum; a bead core is set in both end portions thereof; the both end portions are then folded; and an unvulcanized rubber of a sidewall portion is further stuck thereto. Subsequently, a central portion thereof in the width direction is formed into an annular shape of a horseshoe cross section by expanding the diameter; an unvulcanized belt layer is then provided on the outer periphery of the carcass layer; and a thin layer (base tread 13) of a rubber composition which is preferably the same as or analogous to the inner layer of the tread rubber 7 is stuck thereonto. There can be thus obtained an unvulcanized tire casing.<br/>
By setting the unvulcanized tire casing in a vulcanizing mold tool (mold) and performing vulcanization molding, the tire casing A having a part of the tread rubber 7 or not having the tread rubber 7 at all can be obtained.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">A method for vulcanizing the unvulcanized tire casing<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> is preferably a method for surrounding the unvulcanized tire casing from the outside by a vulcanizing mold tool, in which a bead portion side of the unvulcanized tire casing is heated by a first heating unit; a belt portion side of the unvulcanized tire casing is heated by a second heating unit; and vulcanization molding is performed such that an amount of heat per unit volume to be given to the belt portion side by the second heating unit is smaller than an amount of heat per unit volume to be given to the bead portion side by the first heating unit.<br/>
In usual heavy duty tires (for example, pneumatic radial tires for trucks or buses), since a thickness of the belt portion side of the tire casing is thin as compared with a maximum thickness of the bead portion N, a most delayed point of vulcanization is present within the bead portion N. As described above, when a smaller amount of heat per unit volume is given to the belt portion side, whereas a larger amount of heat per unit volume is given to the bead portion side, the belt portion side does not become excessively vulcanized, and not only adhesion (both initial adhesion and adhesion after long-term use) of the coating rubber composition of the innermost belt layer 5a to the steel cord is enhanced, but the tan δ becomes low, and low heat generation properties are enhanced.
