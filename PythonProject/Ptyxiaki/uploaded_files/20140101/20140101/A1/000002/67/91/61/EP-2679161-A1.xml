More specifically, the present invention is related to a photoacoustic imaging apparatus and a photoacoustic imaging method that irradiate light onto a subject, detect acoustic waves generated within the subject by the irradiation of the light, and generate photoacoustic images.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">The ultrasound examination method is known as an image examination method that enables examination of the state of the interior of living organisms in a non invasive manner. Ultrasound examination employs an ultrasound probe capable of transmitting and receiving ultrasonic waves. When the ultrasonic waves are transmitted to a subject (living organism) from the ultrasound probe, the ultrasonic waves propagate through the interior of the living organisms, and are reflected at interfaces among tissue systems. The ultrasound probe receives the reflected ultrasonic waves and images the state of the interior of the subject, by calculating distances based on the amounts of time that the reflected ultrasonic waves return to the ultrasound probe.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Photoacoustic imaging, which images the interiors of living organisms utilizing the photoacoustic effect, is also known. Generally, in photoacoustic imaging, pulsed laser beams are irradiated into living organisms. Biological tissue within the living organisms that absorbs the energy of the pulsed laser beams generates ultrasonic waves (photoacoustic signals) by volume expansion thereof due to heat. An ultrasound probe or the like detects the photoacoustic signals, and constructs photoacoustic images based on the detected signals, to enable to enable<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> visualization of the living organisms based on the photoacoustic signals.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In photoacoustic imaging, it is necessary for comparatively high output laser beams to be irradiated into living organisms. From the viewpoint of safety, it is preferable for the output of the pulsed laser beams to be prevented when a probe is not in contact with the living organisms. In this regard, Patent Document 1 discloses an apparatus provided with a measurement target detecting means that detects measurement targets along an optical path, that irradiates light when the measurement target detecting means detects a measurement target. The properties of the measurement targets can be utilized to detect the measurement targets. For example, the light shielding properties, the reflectivities, unique temperatures, weights, and electrostatic capacities of the measurement targets can be utilized to detect the measurement targets.</p><heading id="h0002">[Background Art Documents]</heading><heading id="h0003">[Patent Documents]</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005"><ul><li>[Patent Document 1]<br/>

The addition of such physical means increases cost. In addition, measurement targets cannot be detected when a probe not equipped with these additional physical means is employed.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention has been developed in view of the foregoing circumstances.

The photoacoustic imaging apparatus 10 (photoacoustic image diagnosis apparatus) includes: an ultrasound probe (probe) 11; an ultrasonic wave unit 12; and a light source (laser unit) 13. The photoacoustic image diagnosis apparatus 10 is capable of generating both ultrasound images and photoacoustic images. The laser unit 13 generates a light beam (laser beam) to be irradiated onto a subject when generating a photoacoustic image. The wavelength of the laser beam may be set as appropriate according to observation targets. The laser beam output by the laser unit 13 is guided to the probe 11 by light guiding means, such as an optical fiber.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The probe 11 includes a light emitting section that emits the laser beam guided thereto from the laser unit 13 onto subjects. In addition, the probe 11 outputs (transmits) acoustic waves (ultrasonic waves) to subjects and detects (receives) ultrasonic waves reflected by the subjects. The probe 11 has a plurality of ultrasonic transducers which are arranged one dimensionally, for example. The probe outputs ultrasonic waves from the plurality of ultrasonic transducers when generating ultrasound images, for example, and detects reflected ultrasonic waves (hereinafter, also referred to as "reflected acoustic signals"). The probe 11 detects ultrasonic waves (hereinafter, also referred to as "photoacoustic signals") which are generated by measurement<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> targets within subjects absorbing the laser beam output by the laser unit 13 when generating photoacoustic images.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The ultrasonic wave unit 12 has a receiving circuit 21, an A/D converting means 22, an imaging means 23, a control means 24, a transmission control circuit 25, and a contact state judging means 26. The receiving circuit 21 receives ultrasonic waves (photoacoustic signals or reflected acoustic signals) detected by the plurality of ultrasonic transducers of the probe 11. The A/D converting means 22 converts the ultrasonic wave signals received by the receiving circuit 21 into digital signals. The A/D converting means 22 samples the ultrasonic signals at a predetermined sampling period, for example.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The imaging means 23 generates tomographic images based on the ultrasonic waves sampled by the A/D converting means 22. The imaging means 23 generates photoacoustic images based on photoacoustic signals detected by the probe 11, and generates ultrasound images (reflected acoustic images) based on reflected acoustic signals detected by the probe 11. The imaging means 23 includes an image reconstructing means 231, a detecting means 232, a logarithmic converting means 233, and an image constructing means 234. The functions of each component of the imaging means 23 may be realized by a computer executing processes according to predetermined programs.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The image reconstructing means 231 generates data corresponding to each line of tomographic images, based on the ultrasonic wave signals detected by the plurality of ultrasonic wave transducers of the probe 11. The image reconstructing means 231 adds data from 64 ultrasonic transducers of the probe 11 at delay times corresponding to the positions of the ultrasonic transducers, to generate data corresponding to a single line (delayed addition method), for example. Alternatively, the image reconstructing means 231 may execute image reconstruction by the CBP (Circular Back<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> Projection) method. As further alternatives, the image reconstructing means 231 may execute image reconstruction by the Hough transform method or Fourier transform method.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The detecting means 232 outputs envelope curves for data corresponding to each line output by the image reconstructing means 231. The logarithmic converting means 233 logarithmically converts the envelope curves output by the detecting means 232, to widen the dynamic ranges thereof. The image constructing means 234 generates tomographic images by converting the positions of ultrasonic wave signals (peak positions) along a temporal axis to positions in the depth direction of the tomographic images. An image display means 14 displays the tomographic images generated by the image constructing means 234 to a display monitor or the like.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The control means 24 controls each component of the ultrasonic wave unit 12. The control means 24 outputs an ultrasonic wave transmission trigger signal to the transmission control circuit 25 in the case that the imaging means 23 is to generate an ultrasound image. When the trigger signal is received, the transmission control circuit 25 causes the probe 11 to transmit ultrasonic waves. The control means 24 controls a sampling initiation timing at which the A/D converting means 22 samples reflected acoustic signals such that the sampling initiation timing is synchronized with the ultrasonic wave transmission trigger signal.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Meanwhile, the control means 24 transmits a laser oscillation trigger signal to the laser unit 13 in the case that the imaging means 23 is to generate a photoacoustic image. When the trigger signal is received, the laser unit 13 performs laser oscillation, and outputs a laser beam. The control means 24 controls a sampling initiation timing at which the A/D converting means 22 samples reflected acoustic signals such that the sampling initiation timing is synchronized with the laser oscillation trigger signal.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">When a photoacoustic image is to be generated, the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> control means 24 causes the probe 11 to transmit ultrasonic waves prior to outputting the laser oscillation trigger signal to the laser unit 13. The probe 11 detects the ultrasonic waves which are reflected as reflected acoustic signals. The contact state judging means 26 judges whether the probe 11 is in contact with a subject based on the reflected acoustic signals detected by the probe 11. More specifically, the contact state judging means 26 employs an ultrasound image generated by the imaging means 23 based on the reflected acoustic signals to judge whether the probe 11 is in contact with the subject.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The contact state judging means 26 has stored therein a typical ultrasound image generated in a state in which the probe 11 is not in contact with the subject as a reference image. The contact state judging means 26 compares the ultrasound image generated by the imaging means 23 against the stored reference image, and judges whether the probe 11 is in contact with the subject based on the results of the comparison. The contact state judging means 26 calculates a degree of similarity between the ultrasound image generated by the imaging means 23 and the reference image, for example. The contact state judging means 26 judges that the probe 11 is not in contact with the subject when the degree of similarity between the two ultrasound images is a predetermined threshold value or greater. The contact state judging means 26 judges that the prove 11 is in contact with the subject if the degree of similarity is less than the threshold value.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The control means 24 outputs the laser oscillation trigger signal to the laser unit 13 in the case that the contact state judging means 26 judges that the probe 11 is in contact with the subject, and causes a laser beam to be irradiated onto the subject. In contrast, the control means 24 prevents output of the laser oscillation trigger signal to the laser unit 13 in the case that the contact state judging means 26<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> judges that the probe 11 is not in contact with the subject, and does not cause a laser beam to be irradiated onto the subject.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is a diagram that illustrates an example of an ultrasound image which is generated in a state in which the probe 11 is not in contact with a subject.

When the probe 11 is in air, that is, when ultrasonic waves are transmitted and received while the probe 11 is not in contact with a subject, and an ultrasound image is generated based on the received ultrasonic waves, the generated ultrasound image will include high brightness echoes at the interface between the probe 11 and air, and multiple echoes thereof.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> is a diagram that illustrates an example of an ultrasound image which is generated in a state in which the probe 11 is in contact with a subject. When ultrasonic waves are transmitted and received while the probe 11 is in contact with a subject, the ultrasonic waves transmitted by the probe 11 propagate through the interior of the subject, and reflected waves are generated at the interfaces among tissue systems. Accordingly, when an ultrasound image is generated based on the received ultrasonic waves, the outline of a tissue system will appear in the generated ultrasound image, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>. If the ultrasound image of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> and the ultrasound image of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> are compared, it can be understood that generated ultrasound images greatly differ when the probe 11 is in contact with the subject and is not in contact with the subject.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The contact state judging means 26 has stored therein a typical ultrasound image generated in a state in which the probe 11 is not in contact with the subject such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> as the reference image.

The contact state judging means 26 administers a threshold value process on the degree of similarity between the two images, and judges that the generated ultrasound image is an ultrasound image that was generated in a state in which the probe 11 is not in contact with the subject. That is, if the generated ultrasound image is an image such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, the contact state judging means 26 judges that the probe 11 was not in contact with the subject when the ultrasound image was generated. In contrast, if the generated ultrasound image is an image such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>, the contact state judging means 26 judges that the probe 11 was in contact with the subject when the ultrasound image was generated.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">A case was described above in which the contact state judging means 26 has the reference image stored therein, and judges whether the probe 11 is in contact with the subject based on the degree of similarity with the reference image.

For example, the contact state judging means 26 may perform feature analysis of the ultrasound image generated by the imaging means 23, and may judge whether the probe 11 is in contact with the subject based on the results of the feature analysis.

Therefore, it is considered that the configuration of the present embodiment is preferable. Driving of the wavelength selecting element 60 may be ceased while the contact state judging means 26 judges that the probe 11 is not in contact with the subject, because the laser beam is not output during this time. In this case, power consumption can be suppressed compared to a case in which the wavelength selecting element is continuously driven.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">Note that the embodiments above were described as cases in which the photoacoustic images and the ultrasound images are displayed in an overlapped manner. Alternatively, it is possible for the photoacoustic image diagnosis apparatus to operate in a mode that displays only ultrasound images and<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> in a mode that displays only photoacoustic images. In the mode that displays only ultrasound images, a photoacoustic image may not be generated, an ultrasound image may be generated by executing steps corresponding to steps A1 through A4 of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>, and the ultrasound image may be displayed by the image display means 14, for example. In the mode that displays only photoacoustic images, a photoacoustic image generated at step A9 of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref> may be displayed at step A10, without displaying the ultrasound image generated at step A4 on a display screen, for example.</p><p id="p0105" num="0105">Particularly in the case that an ultrasound image is not to be displayed on a display screen, the ultrasound image is utilized only to judge the contact state, and therefore it is not necessary for the ultrasound image to be generated for the same range as an imaging range of a photoacoustic image. For example, in step A2 of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref> in the first embodiment, ultrasonic wave transmission may be performed not from all of the ultrasonic transducers of the probe 11, but ultrasonic wave transmission may be performed by ultrasonic transducers corresponding to a portion of an imaging range of a photoacoustic image, and reflected acoustic signals may be detected by the ultrasonic transducers corresponding to the portion at step A3. In this case, the contact state judging means 26 may generate an ultrasound image of the portion for which reflected acoustic signals were obtained in step A4 (generate a partial image based on ultrasonic waves), and judge whether the probe 11 is in contact with a subject based on the partial image.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">In greater detail, if there are ultrasonic transducers corresponding to 192 channels, an ultrasound image may be generated for a central portion by transmitting and receiving ultrasonic waves with the central 64 channels, and whether the probe 11 is in contact with a subject may be judged based on the ultrasound image of the central portion. In the second embodiment as well, ultrasonic waves may be transmitted and<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> received not by all of the ultrasonic transducers of the probe 11, but only by ultrasonic transducers corresponding to a portion of an imaging range of a photoacoustic image. In this case, whether the probe 11 is in contact with a subject may be judged based on the ultrasonic wave signal waveform of at least one channel within the range at which ultrasonic waves were transmitted and received, at step B4.</p><p id="p0107" num="0107">In addition, in the case that the imaging range of photoacoustic images is divided into blocks, the contact state judging means 26 may judge whether the probe is in contact with a subject based on reflected acoustic signals detected by ultrasonic transducers corresponding to at least a portion of each block. For example, if a range of ultrasonic transducers corresponding to 192 channels correspond to an imaging range for a photoacoustic image, the ultrasonic transducers corresponding to 192 channels are divided into three blocks of 64 channels each as a left side block, a center block, and a right side block. An ultrasound image (partial image) of the left side block may be generated based on reflected acoustic signals detected by the ultrasonic transducers of the 64 channels corresponding to the left side block, and whether the left side block is in contact with a subject may be judged based on the partial image. Similarly, partial ultrasound images may be generated corresponding to each of the center block and the right side block, and whether the probe 11 is in contact with the subject may be judged for each block. In the case that the contact state is judged based on the signal waveforms of reflected acoustic signals instead of ultrasound images as well, whether the probe 11 is in contact with a subject may be judged for each block.</p><p id="p0108" num="0108">For example, in the case that the range onto which the laser beam is irradiated by the probe is switchable in block units, ultrasonic waves may be transmitted and received for at least the blocks that the laser beam is to be irradiated, and the contact state judging means 26 may judge whether the<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> probe 11 is in contact with a subject at these blocks. In this case, the control means 24 may cause the laser beam to be irradiated from the probe 11 onto blocks that the contact state judging means 26 has judged as being in contact with the subject.</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">Specifically, assume a case in which the probe 11 is capable of switching irradiation of the laser beam onto the left side block, the center block, and the right side block. In the case that the probe is to irradiate the laser beam onto the center block, ultrasonic waves may be transmitted and received at at least the center block, and whether the probe 11 is in contact with a subject at the center block may be judged. When it is judged that the probe 11 is in contact with the subject at the center block, the control means 24 may output a laser oscillation trigger signal to cause the laser beam to be irradiated onto the center block from the probe 11.</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">In the embodiments described above, ultrasonic waves are transmitted and received to judge whether the probe 11 is in contact with a subject, and an ultrasound image based on reflected acoustic images obtained by the transmission and reception is displayed on the display screen. However, the present invention is not limited to such a configuration. Ultrasonic waves may be transmitted and received separately from the transmission and reception of ultrasonic waves for judging whether the probe 11 is in contact with a subject, and a separate ultrasound image may be generated based on reflected acoustic signals obtained by the separate transmission and reception of ultrasonic waves. For example, after a photoacoustic image is generated in step A9 of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>, ultrasonic waves may be transmitted from the probe 11, reflected acoustic signals may be detected by the probe 11, and the imaging means 23 may generate a separate ultrasound image based on the reflected acoustic signals. In this case, the ultrasound image which was generated separately after the<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> photoacoustic image was generated may be displayed in step A10 instead of the ultrasound image generated in step A4.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111">The contact state judging means 26 may judge whether the probe 11 is in contact with a subject based on reflected acoustic signals from a predetermined range in the depth direction of the subject. For example, in the first embodiment, the imaging means 23 may generate an ultrasound image within a range from 5mm to 10mm from the surface of the subject, and the contact state judging means 26 may judge the contact state of the probe 11 based on the ultrasound image generated for this range. In addition, in the second embodiment, the A/D converting means 22 may sample reflected acoustic signals for a temporal region corresponding to depths within a range from 5mm to 10mm from the surface of the subject, and the contact state judging means 26 may judge the contact state of the probe 11 based on the signal waveform of the sampled reflected acoustic signals.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">The fourth embodiment was described as a case in which the first photoacoustic data and the second photoacoustic data are complexified. Alternatively, the first photoacoustic and the second photoacoustic data may be reconstructed separately without administering the complexifying operation. In addition, the reconstruction method is not limited to the Fourier transform method. Further, the fourth embodiment calculates the ratio between the first photoacoustic data and the second photoacoustic data by employing the phase data obtained by the complexifying operation. However, the same effects can be obtained by calculating the ratio using the intensity data of the first and second photoacoustic data. In addition, the intensity data may be generated based on signal intensities within a first reconstructed image and signal intensities within a second reconstructed image.</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">The number of pulsed laser beams having different wavelengths which are irradiated onto a subject when generating photoacoustic images is not limited to two. Three<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --> or more pulsed laser beams may be irradiated onto the subject, and photoacoustic images may be generated based on photoacoustic data corresponding to each wavelength. In this case, the 2 wavelength data calculating means 246 may generate the relationships among signal intensities of photoacoustic data corresponding to each wavelength as phase data. In addition, the intensity data extracting means 245 may generate a sum of signal intensities of photoacoustic data corresponding to each wavelength as intensity data.</p><p id="p0114" num="0114">The fourth embodiment was described mainly as a case in which the wavelength selecting element 60 is constituted by a rotatable filter body having two band pass filter regions. However, it is only necessary for the wavelength selecting element 60 to be that which can change the wavelength of light that oscillates within the optical resonator, and is not limited to a rotatable filter body. For example, the wavelength selecting element may be constituted by a rotatable body having a plurality of band pass filters provided on the circumference thereof. It is not necessary for the wavelength selecting element 60 to be a rotatable body. For example, a plurality of band pass filters may be arranged in a row. In this case, the wavelength selecting element 60 may be driven such that the plurality of band pass filters are cyclically inserted into the optical path of the optical resonator, or the wavelength selecting element 60 may be reciprocally driven such that the plurality of band pass filters arranged in a row traverse the optical path of the optical resonator. As a further alternative, a wavelength selecting element such as a birefringent filter may be employed instead of the band pass filters.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">Preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described above.
