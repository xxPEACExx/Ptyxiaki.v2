More particularly, the invention relates to a tray device that may be attached to a surface by means of a clip or docking station, where the tray device catches and directs food and/or items dropped by the child onto the tray. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">[0002] Trays that are used to catch spilled items are known in the art. For example, TV trays have been used for many years on which a user may place items and may have an edge that is raised such that if liquid is spilled on the tray, it will not run off onto the floor or the user. Likewise, trays that attach to highchairs for children are typically provided with an edge that is raised so as to catch liquid in the tray or retain items within reach of the child. Additionally, trays that attach to a highchair are typically provided of a molded plastic shaped to retain spilled items therein. Further, such trays may selectively be slid (e.g. adjusted) closer to or further away from the baby as desired. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">[0003] However, a drawback of current tray systems is that the trays do not closely form to the child such that food and/or items often fall between the tray surface and the child. Highchairs provide for some adjustability in that the distance between the tray and the child may be selected from one of a plurality of positions. However, this adjustability does not solve the above- listed problem because the tray is not closely molded to the child. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 [0004] Another drawback of current tray systems that they cannot be attached to a variety of table surfaces. For example, TV trays may only be set up adjacent to the surface. Likewise, the trays used in a high chair are attachable only to the arms of the high chair. While it is possible to lay a the tray for a high chair on the table surface, the tray is not firmly secured to the surface such that the child or infant may grab / throw the tray, which often results in a mess. Accordingly, if a tray is to be used, typically the highchair must also be brought. However, highchairs are heavy and cumbersome, and often there is no room to place the highchair (e.g. in a restaurant where patrons sit at booths and aisles are kept free). </p><p id="p0008" num="0008">[0005] Another feature common with known trays is that they comprise a substantially rigid tray. In other words, the tray does not move with the child such that, an opening develops between the child and the tray as the child leans forward and/or backward. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">[0006] It is also known to place a mat on a table surface in front of a child, the mat being provided with a catch or bag positioned between the mat and the child. However, the while the bag may be effective in capturing objects dropped, the objects are not redirected onto the surface of the table in front of the child. Additionally, mats are typically formed as from a soft, flexible material and are not particularly effective in capturing spilled items (e.g., liquids and items). </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">[0007] What is desired then is a tray device that will conform to a child's body, such that, food and/or items are substantially prevented from falling between a surface and the child. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">[0008] It is further desired to provide a tray device that may be firmly connected and/or attached to various surfaces. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 [0009] It is still further desired to provide a tray device that is relatively light weight and portable and easy to connect to and disconnect from a surface. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">[0010] It is also desired to provide a tray device that will redirect items that may fall between a child and the table and redirect the item onto the tray surface in direct view of the child. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">[0011 ] It further desired to provide a tray device that will closely conform to a child even when the child moves forward and/or backward relative to the tray device such that an item dropped by the child will be directed onto the tray surface in direct view of the child. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015">[0012] These and other objectives are achieved, in one embodiment, by the provision of a tray device that catches food or an item that would usually fall between the table and the child and directs it onto the tray, such that the child can easily pick the item back up again. It is well known that typically children do not have well developed motor skills and often drop items they are holding. This situation results in a lot of work for the parents picking up the vast collection of items dropped by the child during a meal. For meals that occur in a restaurant, the floor surface is quite often not kept entirely clean and food items that are dropped must be discarded resulting in waste. The tray device that extends outwardly toward the child's body is positioned substantially, directly downward from the child's mouth such that, if the child drops the food, it will be caught by the lip of the tray device and directed onto the clean tray surface. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016">[0013] Additionally, the tray acts to protect the table and items placed thereon (e.g. mobile phones, wallets, bags, etc.) from damage due to food and liquid spills. The tray provides a stable surface eating (and/or play) area for the child and helps to keep clothes (both the child's and the parent's) protected from potential food and liquid stains. The tray also provides for a 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 relatively easy clean up due to, in one embodiment, a removable dish washer safe insert. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017">[0014] In one advantageous embodiment a lip of material (e.g., rubber, plastic or other material), protrudes out from the tray towards the child. The lip may be angled (and in one embodiment, flexible) such that, when the child drops an item it is caught by the lip and directed onto the tray surface. When the lip is provided as a flexible lip, when the child leans in toward the tray, the lip moves in with the child and when the child leans away from the tray, the lip moves out with the child to close gaps between the child and the table. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018">[0015] In an alternate embodiment, it is contemplated that the lip may comprise a substantially inflexible hard plastic or other material. In this embodiment, the lip would serve substantially the same purpose as the flexible lip (e.g., catching spills between the child and the table) and may comprise a concave U shape to closely conform to the child's body. This hard lip would be angled out toward the child's body to catch spills while being contoured in such a way as to be comfortable for the child to lean against (e.g. no relatively sharp or pointed edges against the child's body). </p><p id="p0019" num="0019">[0016] It is contemplated that the tray may be provided with a rubber base which grips the table to keep the tray stationary. This base grip material may be formed as feet or small circles, or as strips which would outline the bottom of the tray surface. In order to firmly secure the tray to a variety of different surfaces, it is understood that flexible clips or a docking station may be used. </p><p id="p0020" num="0020">[0017] Also provided is a removable insert tray or plate (insert) may be inserted substantially into the contour of the tray device. The insert is easy to remove (deformable plastic engagement with the tray) and clean separately, for example, in a dishwasher. The insert tray may be provided with either a flexible or solid lip while the under tray might be a solid tray. Alternatively, the under tray may also be provided with or without a flexible or solid lip. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 [0018] The components of the tray may, in one advantageous embodiment, comprise the following: a base tray (e.g., plastic) with upturned edges on three or four sides and/or part of the fourth side. The fourth side may be provided having a flexible (or non flexible) lip which extends from the tray towards the child. The underside of the tray may be provided with a grip material (e.g., rubber). Additionally, a clip(s) may be molded into the tray forming an attachment system. In one embodiment, the attachment system may comprise a clamp (e.g. a spring wound alligator type clamp) that is provided with a surface having rubber grip (or a series of grips) to provide a secure attachment to the surface. </p><p id="p0021" num="0021">[0019] Alternatively, the attachment system may be provided such that a base clip or docking station is attached to a table or other eating surface, and the tray snaps into the base docking station. The tray could then snap into the base unit that is clipped, screwed or fastened onto the eating table. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022">[0020] The purpose of the docking station is to secure the tray to a table in an efficient and safe manner. In the docking station embodiment, the docking station is provided with essentially two parts: 1 ) the portion of the station that affixes to the table; and 2) the portion that engages with the tray. </p><p id="p0023" num="0023">[0021 ] The first portion of the docking station is provided to attach to a table or eating surface by means of, for example: a clip; or a screw or vice-like mechanism, and the like. This attachment mechanism is part of the docking station allowing it to be secured to a surface. In the screw or vice version, a handle, or wheel may be turned facilitating opening / closing of the clip or vice. </p><p id="p0024" num="0024">[0022] The second portion of the docking station includes a portion (e.g., square flat seat-belt like piece) that sits on the surface and may, in one embodiment, be approximately 2" x 2" or 3" x 3" length / width and 3/16" height. It would serve as the snap in area for the tray to snap into. We envision this part 2 either being a Tupperware like snap in device or a seatbelt like snap in with a female and male part. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
 [0023] The components may be arranged and function together as follows: The base of the tray has grip material that helps to secure the tray to a surface. The Tray has a clip, clips, or a docking station which may attach to the rim of a table or other surface and secure the tray in place. The tray functions as, for example, an eating / play surface area. The insert tray may drop into the under tray providing a surface for the child to eat on that is easily removable and is dishwasher safe. The lip is provided as a permanent feature of the tray extending up at an angle toward the child. Where the lip is provided as a flexible lip, as the child leans in and out the lip flexes against the child in order to seal gaps between the child and the table and catch food and liquids. The lip is shaped in a manner to provide the most effective "catching" possible while at the same time being comfortable for the child to lean against. The tray may be left on the table and wiped down, or it can be removed and cleaned in the sink. It is removed by releasing the clips. </p><p id="p0025" num="0025">[0024] It is contemplated that the insert may be provided for use with the tray that attaches to a surface as described above, or may be used with conventional high chairs achieving substantially the same result of redirecting items that may fall back onto the tray or insert surface away from the child. The flexible lip may also be utilized in a different application where it is separately used on its own to attach to conventional height chairs, with the same intention of catching food which spills in between the tray and the child, bringing food back to the tray. </p><p id="p0026" num="0026">[0025] For this application the following terms and definitions shall apply: </p><p id="p0027" num="0027">[0026] The terms "first" and "second" are used to distinguish one element, object or thing from another, and are not used to designate relative position or arrangement in time. </p><p id="p0028" num="0028">[0027] The terms "coupled", "coupled to", "coupled with", "connected", "connected to", and "connected with" as used herein each mean a relationship
