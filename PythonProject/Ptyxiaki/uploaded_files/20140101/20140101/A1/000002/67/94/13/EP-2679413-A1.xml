The natural state of tires is under inflated. Accordingly, drivers must repeatedly act to maintain tire pressures or they will see reduced fuel economy, tire life and reduced vehicle braking and handling performance. Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems have been proposed to warn drivers when tire pressure is significantly low. Such systems, however, remain dependant upon the driver taking remedial action when warned to re-inflate a tire to recommended pressure. It is a desirable, therefore, to incorporate an air maintenance feature within a tire that will maintain correct air pressure within the tire without a need for driver intervention to compensate for any reduction in tire pressure over time.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">The invention relates to a tire in accordance with claim 1.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Dependent claims refer to preferred embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">According to an aspect of the invention, an air maintenance tire (or air maintenance tire and pump assembly) is provided, the tire including an elongate annular air passageway enclosed within a bending region of the tire, the air passageway operatively closing and opening segment by segment as the bending region of the tire passes through a rolling tire footprint to pump air along the air passageway.

A peristaltic pump assembly 16 is attached to one or both of the tire sidewalls 12 in generally a high bend region of the sidewall. The peristaltic pump assembly 16 includes an annular air passageway 18, 20 either in the form of an independent tube formed separately from the tie and assembled to the tire in a post-manufacture procedure; or an air passageway formed as an integral void within the sidewall during tire manufacture. The air passageway 20 is enclosed by the sidewall and extends along an annular path about a region of the sidewall that experiences a high flex or bend as the tire rotates. If in an independent tube form, the air passageway tube is formed of a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> resilient, flexible material such as plastic or rubber compounds that are capable of withstanding repeated deformation cycles wherein the tube is deformed into a flattened condition subject to external force and, upon removal of such force, returns to an original condition generally circular in cross-section. If the air passageway is integrally formed within the sidewall, the air passageway likewise must withstand repeated deformation and recovery cycles as the tire rotates and be of a diameter sufficient to operatively pass a volume of air sufficient for the purposes described herein. The general operation of an air tube in a peristaltic pump is described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US8113254B"><text>US-B-8,113,254</text></patcit> which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Opposite ends 22, 24 of the air passageway terminate at an inlet port assembly 28. The inlet port assembly is affixed to rotate with the tire as the tire rotates against a ground surface 132. Rotation of the tire creates a footprint 134 against surface 132 which in turn introduces compression force 138 into the tire. The compression force 138 in turn is applied at 140 into the air passageway 20 causing segment by segment collapse of the passageway as the tire rotates. The segment by segment collapse of the air passageway occurs regardless of whether the tire rotates in the counterclockwise direction 136 of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref> or the clockwise direction 133 of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 2B</figref>. The peristaltic pump assembly is thus said to be bi-directional or reversible in operating to pump air into the tire cavity 26 in both a forward or a reverse direction of air flow continuously throughout a 360 degree tire rotation.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As the tire rotates in both forward and rearward directions136, 133 of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref> or <figref idrefs="f0003">2B</figref>, the air passageway 20 is flattened segment by segment whether the passageway is in the form of a separate sidewall embedded tube or an integrally formed void. The segment by segment 137 sequential flattening of the air passageway moves in a direction 142 opposite to the direction of tire rotations of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">2B</figref>. The sequential flattening of the passageway 20 segment by segment causes evacuated air from the flattened segments to be pumped in the direction 142 to the inlet port assembly 28 where the air is directed to the tire cavity. Air pressure within the cavity 26 is thus maintained at a desired threshold pressure. Air admitted by the inlet port assembly 28 is introduced into the air passageway 20 to replenish air pumped into the tire cavity or recirculated out of the pump assembly if not needed to maintain tire pressure at a desired level.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The inlet port assembly 28 includes a regulator valve assembly 30 and a filtered air entry port 32.

It will be appreciated that the system is bi-directional, with air flow within the passageway 20 occurring in both directions as the tire rotates, with the direction of air flow within the passageway 20 dictated by the tire rotating in either a forward or reverse direction. Pumping along passageway 20 occurs in both directions, alternatively, throughout an entire 360 degree rotation of the tire.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">A filtered air entry port 32 is positioned at the outer surface of a tire sidewall 12 and outside air is admitted into the entry port through a cellular filter 34 housed within a cylindrical housing 36. <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 3A</figref> shows the assembly in the closed condition in which air from outside the tire is prevented from entering the entry port 32; a condition which will occur when the pressure within the tire cavity 26 is at or above a regulated pressure threshold Preg. An air passageway conduit 56 extends from the filter housing 36 to the regulator valve assembly 30 and passes inlet air to the valve assembly. From the regulator valve assembly 30 an outlet conduit 54 carries air flow to a connecting conduit 40 which conducts air flow into oppositely directed valves 62, 64 positioned adjacent and on opposite sides of the inlet junction 38. As used herein, "inlet junction" refers to the location of passageway branching of inlet air from the assembly 28 to the upstream sides of inline stop valves.

A biasing mechanism such as a spring 48 exerts a biasing force (see arrow 72 in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIGS. 3B</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0006">3C)</figref> on the piston 44, biasing the piston downward within cylinder 46 into an "open" or "tire-fill" location and position as indicated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 3B</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 3C</figref>. When the pressure within the cavity 26 is at or greater than the Preg pressure setting level, the pressure will overcome the biasing force of spring 48 and force (see arrow 50) the piston upward within cylinder 46 into the "closed" or "no-fill" location and position of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 3A</figref>. The piston 22 is provided with a transversely extending air conduit 52 extending across the piston body. In the "closed" position of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 3A</figref>, the conduit 52 is misaligned with<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> respect to the air conduits 54, 56 and air cannot flow across the piston to conduits 54, 56, and from there to the inlet junction 38. In the "closed" position, consequently, air flow is prevented from reaching the inlet control junction 38 and hence, prevented from reaching the upstream sides of valves 62, 64. Air flow into the passageway 20 is thus precluded with the valve assembly 30 in the closed position of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 3B</figref> shows the valve assembly 30 moving to an "open" position. The "open" position The tire rotates in a clockwise direction, causing air to be pumped along passageway 20 in a counter clockwise direction. A configuration of four one-way valves are provided and located as shown. Two inline valves 62, 64 are positioned along the conduit 40 on opposite side of the inlet junction 38. The two inline valves 62, 64 open in opposite directions along the conduit 40 and conduct air flow in such respective directions with the valves 62, 64 in an open condition. Conduit 40 connects at the downstream side of the valves 62, 64 with the air passageway 20. From the juncture of passageway 40 and the passageway 20, radially extending outlet conduit passageways 58, 60 extend to the tire cavity 26 as shown. Positioned along the conduits 58, 60 are two outlet one-way valves 66, 68, respectively. The valves 66, 68 are oriented to open in a direction toward the tire cavity to permit the flow of air through the valves 66, 68, along conduits 58, 60, and into the tire cavity 26.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The one-way valves 62, 64, 66, and 68 are of a type commercially available such as ball or diaphragm check valves or other known valve configurations.

The piston 44 moves downward under the biasing force exerted by actuator spring 48. When the air pressure, Preg, within the cavity 26 falls below a desired pressure threshold limit. Movement of the piston aligns the air conduit 52 across the piston 44 with the conduits 54, 56, allowing inlet air from the inlet filter port 32 to flow across the piston conduit 52 to the inlet control junction 38 and to the connecting conduit 40. The tire, in rotating clockwise against the ground surface 132 (See <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 2B</figref>), collapses the passageway 20 segment by segment opposite the created tire footprint 134. The collapsed segments create a vacuum which, in turn, are refilled segment by segment by a flow of air within the passageway in a counterclockwise direction 142, drawn in through the inlet port assembly 28. The counterclockwise flow of input air forces the one-way valve 64 open, allowing the air to flow into the passageway in the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> counterclockwise direction shown. The air circulates around the passageway 20. When the air flow reaches the juncture of conduit 40 and radial outlet conduit 60, it cannot flow through the closed valve 62 and must, instead, flow to the outlet valve 68. The air flow forces the valve 68 open and continues on to input air into the tire cavity 26 as indicated by the arrow 70. When air pressure within the tire cavity 26 reaches the desired preset level, tire pressure against piston 44 forces the piston into the closed position of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 3A</figref> and air flow to the cavity is discontinued as explained previously.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The above operation of the peristaltic pump assembly 16 operates the same in the reverse tire rotation direction, as will be understood from <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 3C</figref>.

The piston conduit 52 aligns with the conduits 54, 56 and air flow is directed to the junction 40. Rotation of the tire in the counterclockwise direction causes the flow of air to be in the clockwise direction 74 as evacuated segments of the passageway 20 are refilled. Air flow in the clockwise direction opens the one way valve 62 and allows air to circulate from the conduit 40 into passageway 20. The pressurized air circulates passageway 20 and enters conduit 58 where it is directed against valve 66, opening the valve, and thereby passing through valve 66 to the tire cavity 26 as indicated by arrow 70 of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 3C</figref>.

The valve 120 is a pressure controlled valve of a type commercially available that is connected to bypass the opening of check valves 106, 112 when the pressure within the tire cavity 26 exceeds a Pset or Preg value. The bypass valve 120 is intended to ensure that air cannot be introduced into the tire cavity 26 when the air pressure within the cavity is at or greater than the Pset pressure threshold. The bypass valve 120 is positioned to conduct air in either direction when the pressure within the cavity 26 is at or greater than the Pset value, whereby bypassing air to the outlet valves 106, 112 and preventing the introduction of more air into the cavity.

Air flow into the tire cavity is thus precluded. The Bypass Regulator thereby ensures that under no circumstances will air be forced into a tire cavity when the pressure within the cavity is at or regulator is at or greater than the Preg set threshold.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the peristaltic pump and regulator system provides the means for keeping the air pressure within a tire cavity at a desired pressure level but no greater pressure that the desired pressure.

The air passageway 20 operatively closes and opens, segment by segment, as the bending region of the tire passes through a rolling tire footprint to pump air along the air passageway. The pump assembly further includes the air inlet port assembly 28 positioned to channel outside air into the air passageway 20 at an inlet junction (38 or 90).

During the fill mode, air is not allowed to flow through the bypass passageway so long as the air pressure within the tire cavity is less than Preg. The air is thus directed to force open the outlet check valves and send the air into the tire. When the tire reaches the required pressure, the air is allowed to flow through the bypass valve.
