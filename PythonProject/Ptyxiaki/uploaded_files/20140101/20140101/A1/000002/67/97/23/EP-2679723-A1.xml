Furthermore, the present invention relates to a method of treating synthetic turf.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Synthetic turf has become increasingly popular in recent years. It is used to provide sports pitches and the like, particularly in areas where the cultivation of natural grass is difficult, for example, indoors and in locations where the climatic conditions are poor. Synthetic turf is also being increasingly used in or near airports, as it does not encourage birds to gather.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Synthetic turf has been accepted by many professional sporting organisations for use in official completion. One such organisation is Federation Internationale de Football Association, more commonly referred to as FIFA, the organizational body for soccer. FIFA have defined two grades of approved surface in their FIFA Quality Concept standards. These standards define two acceptable ratings for synthetic pitches, FIFA 1 Star and FIFA 2 Star. FIFA 1 Star is the minimum standard on which official club games, under the national association, e.g. FA in England, FAI in Ireland, USSF in the USA, and DBF in Germany, can be played. FIFA 2 Star is for pitches on which international club games will be played.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A typical structure of synthetic turf comprises a pile tufted into a backing sheet with an infill such as sand, crumb rubber or the like substantially filling the space between the tufted piles. The tufted piles resemble natural grass, while the infill provides the necessary surface resilience and drainage.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">On installation, synthetic pitches are tested to ensure they reach the required standard. Such tests include a ball roll test amongst others including shock absorption, vertical deformation, traction, vertical ball bounce, angled ball behaviour, slip resistance, slope and evenness. The ball roll test involves using a Standard FIFA ramp that releases a ball from a height of 1 m, then measuring the distance that the ball rolls along the pitch. The synthetic pitches will deteriorate over time, particularly if they are subjected to heavy<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> usage. There are many standard maintenance techniques known to keep the pitch in, or restore it to, good condition, for example brushing the pitch and redistributing infill. However, after a certain period of usage these techniques are not able to ensure the pile remains upright. This may be due to an old or excessively worn surface or defective material for example. Therefore, if a synthetic pitch becomes so worn that its ball roll characteristics no longer pass FIFA Quality Concept, it is not possible to restore that pitch to a suitable degree.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is an object therefore of the present invention to provide a composition and method that overcome at least some of the above-mentioned problems</p><heading id="h0002"><b>STATEMENTS OF INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the invention there is provided a composition for use in treating synthetic turf, the composition comprising a flexible acrylic resin polymer or a modified vinyl polymer or co-polymer together with a biocidal agent, a surface active agent and a de-foaming agent.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Advantageously, the application of this product to a synthetic turf pitch greatly improves its ball roll characteristics. This is achieved by coating the pile of the synthetic turf with the composition of the invention. The composition coats the pile of the synthetic turf, and so improves its rigidity. When the composition has dried, it possess an internal stress that provides each pile with recoil bias, such that when the pile is compressed or flattened, the recoil bias of the composition will cause the pile to become upright once more.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Synthetic turf treated with the composition of the invention also has increased protection against wear and tear. The composition forms a barrier against abrasion, reducing the likelihood of the fibres within the pile of the synthetic turf being subject to splitting, fraying or breaking.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The composition of the invention has the further advantage of reducing infill splash when a ball is bounced on the surface by loosely binding the top 2 to 5 mm of the infill together. The composition does not caulk the infill, allowing water drainage to continue.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">This loose binding of the infill is also useful in reducing movement of infill in heavy traffic areas of the synthetic pitch.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In one embodiment of the invention there is provided a composition wherein the composition is dispersed in water.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In another embodiment of the invention there is provided a composition wherein the composition comprises 25% to 50% solids by volume of polymer or co-polymer; 0.2% to 0.3% solids by volume biocidal agent; 0.5% solids by volume surface active agent; 0.2% to 0.5% solids by volume de-foaming agent; and 50% to 75% by volume water. This formula provides a reliable product that, when applied, exhibits the desired characteristics at a temperature range between -10° and 70° C.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In a further embodiment of the invention, there is provided a composition further comprises a friction reducing agent such as a silicone dispersion. In this way, the coefficient of friction of the treated area may be reduced.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In another embodiment of the invention, there is a provided a composition further comprising an identifying trace agent. This provides a security feature should some or all of the synthetic turf be stolen. The originating location of synthetic turf could then be identified by way of the identifying trace agent.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In another aspect, the invention provides a method for treating a synthetic turf which includes applying a surface coating composition to the fibres of the turf to improve abrasion resistance, strength and flexibility of the fibres.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In a preferred embodiment, the surface coating composition includes a flexible acrylic resin polymer, or a modified vinyl polymer or co-polymer.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In one embodiment of the invention, there is provided a method of treating an area of synthetic turf, the synthetic turf comprising a pile, the method comprising the steps of coating the area of synthetic turf with the composition of the invention, and brushing the area of synthetic turf.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In another embodiment, the method includes brushing the area of synthetic turf before and after coating the synthetic turf with the composition.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In a further embodiment of the invention there is provided a method comprising at least two brushing steps, wherein each brushing step is in a different direction. This ensures good coverage of the pile by the composition, and an even distribution thereof.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In an alternative embodiment of the invention there is provided a method comprising the steps of coating the area of synthetic turf a number of times with the composition and brushing the turf before and after each application of the composition to the turf.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">The invention will now be more clearly understood from the following description of an embodiment thereof given by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:-
<ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a flow chart of an exemplary method according to the invention.</li></ul></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Referring to the drawing, there is shown a flowchart indicating the steps of an exemplary method according to the invention.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In step 100, the area of synthetic turf to be treated is first brushed in a preparatory step. The area of synthetic turf is brushed in one specific direction.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Next, in step 102, area of synthetic turf is treated with the composition.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Next in step 104, the area is brushed again in another specific direction.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Next in step 106, the area is again treated with the composition.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Finally, in step 108, the area is brushed in a further specific direction.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Depending on the surface being treated, different directions of brushing will take place to achieve the desired effect. A multitude of brushes may be used depending on the severity of the brush required, the nap of the grass and any other factors which may become apparent when on site application takes place. The general procedure would consist of brush, spray, brush. This basic operation may be carried out a multitude of times until the desired effect is achieved.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The brushing steps may be carried out by drag mats, combs, static brushes, oscillating brushes, rakes, mechanical self-contained brushing machines, tractor mounted brushes and the like. In some embodiments, at least two types of brushing apparatus are used.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The treatment steps are preferably carried by spraying the area of synthetic turf, for example by hand, using a knapsack sprayer; or using a tractor mounted sprayer.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The treatment steps may alternatively be carried out by way of a transfer roller, transfer brushing, air-blasting, using a mist sprayer or the like. In some embodiments of the methods, at least two treatment methods are used.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">High traffic areas may be treated more frequently than other areas of the synthetic turf pitch. It may be convenient to treat small areas using a hand-held sprayer.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The method of the invention may be carried out as part of regular maintenance of the synthetic pitch, or less frequently. A lower concentration of flexible acrylic resin polymer is used when regular treatment is planned.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The composition comprises a flexible acrylic resin polymer, a biocidal agent, a surface active agent and de-foaming agent, the principal ingredient being the flexible acrylic resin polymer. One possible embodiment of the composition is 25% to 50% solids by volume flexible acrylic resin polymer; 0.2% to 0.3% solids by volume biocidal agent; 0.5% solids by volume surface active agent; 0.2% to 0.5% solids by volume de-foaming agent; and 50% to 75% by volume water. The ratio of ingredients used may be adjusted depending on the condition of the surface being treated. Should the surface/fibres be in very poor condition, it may require increasing the content of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> flexible acrylic resin polymer.
