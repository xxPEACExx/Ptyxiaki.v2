The chain guides described in Patent Literature 1 and Patent Literature 2 are formed in a curved shape along the running direction of the chain, in which rollers are arranged at a sliding-surface portion<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> which is brought into contact with the chain, and the rollers are rolled by being pressed against the chain running at high speed, and thereby the sliding resistance is reduced.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005"><ul><li>Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP9236157A"><text>9-236157</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Literature 2: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2010180900A"><text>2010-180900</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Meanwhile, the chain guides described in the above literatures are assembled by inserting the support shaft of each of the rollers from the side of a side wall member constituting the chain guide, and hence has a problem of low efficiency of the assembly work.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Further, the problem of low efficiency of the assembly work is also posed unless the rollers are easily incorporated into a guide base for supporting the rollers.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further, since the chain is brought into contact with the roller with strong frictional force, it is not only necessary to improve the mechanical strength of the roller which is brought into contact with the chain, but also necessary to reduce the sliding resistance between the chain and the roller. Since the timing chain is made of iron, the wear of the roller which is brought into contact with the chain may pose a problem, and hence high rigidity is required especially for the roller.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further, in the chain guides described in the above literatures, in order to give<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> tension to the chain, strong pressing force is applied to the guide base which supports the rollers. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the mechanical strength of the guide base. Especially, when the guide base is made of resin, the mechanical strength of the guide base may pose a problem.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the chain guides described in the above literatures, since the chain runs at high speed, the chain may flutter and thereby come off from the chain guide while running.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">For this reason, a method is also conceivable in which the coming-off of the chain is prevented by providing a step on the outer peripheral surface of the roller that is brought into contact with the chain. However, when the step is provided on the outer peripheral surface of the roller, there arises a problem of increasing processing costs of the roller.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Further, an object of the present invention is to effectively prevent the coming-off of the chain without providing the step on the outer peripheral surface of the roller.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Further, since the chain is brought into contact with the roller with strong frictional force in the chain guide, it is not only necessary to improve the mechanical strength of the roller which is brought into contact with the chain, but also necessary to reduce the sliding resistance between the chain and the roller.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Further, since the chain moves at high speed on the chain guide while vibrating, the vibration is transmitted to the engine via the chain guide, and hence the sound level of the vibration becomes high, causing a problem of noise.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In order to withstand such vibration, the chain guide needs to have high mechanical strength, and hence the size of the chain guide increases.

Note that the full-type roller bearing having a roller structure without using the retainer 12b may also be adopted.</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">Next, in order to attach the roller 12 to the side plate members 9a facing each other, the roller 12 provided with the roller bearing on the outer peripheral surface of the support shaft 13 is first prepared as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>. Further, each of opposite ends of the support shaft 13 of the roller 12 is arranged to face the insertion recess 14a of the support recess formed in each of the mutually facing wall surfaces of the side plate members 9a, and is then dropped into the insertion recess 14a, so as to be inserted into the fixing recess 14b from the insertion recess 14a. In the present embodiment, the opening section a is formed to be wide, and the insertion recess 14a is formed to have a tapered shape. Therefore, when the support shaft 13 is inserted, the support shaft 13 can be easily guided from the opening section a to the circular arc-shaped fixing recess 14b through the insertion port b.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">The assembling property is improved by subjecting outer comer portions of opposite end surfaces of the support shaft 13 to R chamfering.</p><p id="p0105" num="0105">Further, the support shaft 13 of the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref> has a cylindrical shape. However, when a D-cut or a partial cut-out is formed on the outer surface of the support shaft 13, the effect of preventing rotation of the support shaft 13 in the fixing recess 14b is improved.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">Further, the depth of the insertion recess 14a and the fixing recess 14b is 1.5 mm to 2 mm.</p><p id="p0107" num="0107">In the above-described embodiment, the diameter φ of the circular arc-shaped fixing recess 14b is formed to be smaller than the diameter of the support shaft 13, and hence the<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> support shaft 13 is press-fitted and attached to the fixing recess 14b. As a result, it is possible to suppress the rotation of the support shaft 13. In addition, the width of the insertion port b connected to the fixing recess 14b is formed to be smaller than the diameter φ of the circular arc-shaped fixing recess 14b, and hence the insertion port b performs a function of preventing the coming-off of the support shaft 13. Further, the support recess 14 is formed so as not to penetrate the side plate member 9, and hence the support shaft 13 inserted into the support recess 14 can be prevented from moving in the shaft direction.</p><p id="p0108" num="0108">In the state where the support shafts 13 of the rollers 12 are respectively fitted into the support recesses 14 of the mutually facing side plate members 9a, the outer ring 12a of the roller bearing constituting the roller 12 is lower than the end surface of the side plate member 9a as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref>.</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">That is, the side plate member 9a is formed to have a height higher than the level of the outer diameter surface of the roller 12.
