The present invention also relates to the products manufactured with this process. </p><p id="p0003" num="0003"> Known monocoques made of a composite material, in particular carbon fiber, are generally manufactured by fixing to each other by means of adhesives and/or mechanical members, for example bolts, composite material components which are moulded separately. Such known monocoques are characterized both by a high cost, since the whole structure is not intended for the exploitation of the potentialities of the composite material, and by a medium level of repeatability, substantially due to the high use of manual operations within the manufacturing process. As a matter of fact, the monocoques are made of numerous components, all moulded separately by means of a manual stratification, which are then assembled manually or by means of gluing templates. The components are therefore first produced and subsequently assembled, by following the classic production and assembly process typical of the motor vehicle industry. The components are generally obtained by means of moulding processes with fiber carbon substrates pre-impregnated with resin, known as pre-preg, which are layered manually and cured in an autoclave. This process requires long manual workings and expensive materials, furthermore it does not ensure a repeatability comparable with all the other parts of the vehicle. The monocoques produced until now are therefore also not much suitable for the mass production. The manufacturing processes further require very articulated systems which lead, in most cases, to have tens of moulds reserved for producing a single component. Moreover, the products must be disadvantageously worked within few days since the material highly degrades if left at room temperature before the cure cycle, so that such known process can hardly face sudden production stops and involves a high risk of producing rejects. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004"> The known monocoques are therefore very expensive and difficult to produce in a high mass due to the high number of few repeatable components. The parts are mainly made up of pre-impregnated fibers, which are expensive and require a high deftness. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 Their manufacturing process is further characterized by a clear separation between production and assembly, the used moulds have a limited life and the production cycle in which they are used provides for the use of a lot of moulds in view of a single manufactured piece. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005"> US 5079055 discloses a reinforcement member for composite material products, which member is provided with an insert with a threaded hole. However, during the moulding of the composite material with the reinforcement member, such threaded hole may be disadvantageously filled with resin, since it is open to the outside. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006"> In order to solve this disadvantage, FR 2783196 discloses a spacer provided with an insert with a threaded hole which is closed by one or more plugs. A plug is removed with a mechanical working after the moulding of the composite material. However, this known process is more expensive, since it requires the application and the removal of the plugs from the threaded hole, and further it does not allow a precise arrangement of the threaded hole with respect to the moulded product if the relative position of the inserts with respect to the product is not perfect. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process and products which are free from said disadvantages. Said object is achieved with a process and a product, whose main features are disclosed in claims 1 and 19, respectively, while other features are disclosed in the remaining claims. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> The process and the system according to the present invention allow not only to pull down the costs, thereby allowing the use of composite material products on a mass production volume, but also to ensure the repeatability required by the production standards. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> The process includes a co-curing step, in which at least two components are produced so that a main component acts as a mould for a secondary component. Both components are then cured together by means of intermediate substrates, thus avoiding gluing steps. This process can be obtained by means of a particular modular system which assumes different functions during the production process. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> The intermediate substrates further allow to compensate tolerances, if any, between the components, so that the final product has precise shapes and sizes. For this purpose, the main component is preferably moulded between two main moulds with an 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 RTM process, so that both its inner wall and its outer wall have surfaces with precise shapes and sizes. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> The present invention also relates to a monocoque comprising a shell which substantially corresponds to the compartment of a motor vehicle and a roof which covers this shell. These two components are preferably manufactured by means of the process and the system according to the present invention. The costs of the process are relatively low thanks to the massive use of production techniques differing from the pre- preg in autoclave, such as the RTM (Resin Transfer Moulding) and braiding processes. Both these processes are based on the laying of dry fibers inside moulds and on the subsequent injection of resin. The braiding process is based on the automatic weaving of the fibers on a mandrel and on the subsequent injection of resin, while the RTM process is based on the deposition of dry fabrics and the subsequent injection of resin. The shaping of the substrates and their subsequent deposition in the moulds can be automated, thus making more repeatable and economic the parts produced with these processes. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> The modularity of the moulds involves a reduction not only of the number of moulds but also of the number of moulds per number of pieces: some monocoques produced until now, for example, are produced in a single moulding step. The complexity of the geometries and the number of subsets requires several tenths of moulds for manufacturing a single component. In the process and the system according to the invention, however, there is the opposite situation, in which few moulds produce a high number of parts, exactly thanks the modularity of the system. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> A further advantage of the process and the system consists of the combination of the modular moulds, in which the produced parts become a mould for the subsequent ones, and of the massive use of processes less aggressive than the pre-preg, which leads to a life of the moulds expected in 400 pieces for the main moulds and 800 pieces for the secondary moulds, in view of a life of about 150 pieces of the traditional moulds used until now. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> The reduction of the equipments costs, thus, involves not only a reduction of the moulds number, but also lower maintenance and regeneration connected to the moulds during their use. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 Another advantage of the process and the system consists of the possibility of carrying out several production steps in parallel. The monocoques produced until now in few very complex moulding steps are very exposed to the risk of rejects. A single complex item is certainly more subject to errors and defects than another one made up of higher number of simple and especially unlinked steps. Various steps carried out in parallel allow to handle both possible remakings of some components and possible stops of the production. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"> Particular spacers allow both to increase the moment of inertia of the resistant sections of the monocoque, thus conferring a high structural rigidity to the latter, and to obtain space for housing metal inserts for the structural connection with other parts of a motor vehicle. These spacers are preferably arranged between substrates belonging to different sections of the monocoque but they can also be arranged in the middle of the stratification of some components. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> The process is advantageously simplified by moulding the inserts in given positions in the spacers, so that these inserts are not moulded between two substrates of the composite material components, thus decreasing the complexity of the working of the substrates. Furthermore, the inserts are worked, for example with threaded holes, at the end of the production process, so as to simplify this process and obtain also a final product worked with precision, since the position of the threaded holes does not depend on the position of the inserts but is determined by taking as an absolute reference the position of the final product. Thus, with this arrangement, possible imprecise arrangements of the inserts in the final product are compensated. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017"> The main component, namely the inner wall of the monocoque shell, is preferably produced with an RTM process, in particular the RTM process according to the Italian patent application MI2010A001072, by means of some main moulds, and houses, in the middle of its stratification, seven spacers preferably provided with metal inserts which are housed inside auxiliary moulds filled with epoxy foam which is cured to assume the final shape of the spacer. These inserts may also include elements made of a composite material, in particular carbon fiber. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018"> Particular spacers to be arranged between the main component and the secondary components, namely between the inner and outer walls of the monocoque shell, can be 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 produced in parallel always with the same process, namely by creating hollow composite material structures which contain the inserts and which are left empty or are filled with epoxy foam. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019"> Further advantages and features of the process, the spacer and the products according to the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed and non-limiting description of an embodiment thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: </p><p id="p0020" num="0020"> figure 1 shows an enlarged section of the auxiliary moulds in a first step of the process; </p><p id="p0021" num="0021"> figure 2 shows an enlarged section of the auxiliary moulds of figure 1 in a second step of the process; </p><p id="p0022" num="0022"> figure 3 shows a spacer obtained by means of the auxiliary moulds of figure 1 ; figure 4 shows a perspective view of the main moulds in a third step of the process; </p><p id="p0023" num="0023"> figure 5 shows a perspective view of the main moulds of figure 4 in a fourth step of the process; </p><p id="p0024" num="0024"> figure 6 shows an enlarged and partial section of the main moulds of figure 5; figure 7 shows the section of figure 6 in a fifth step of the process; </p><p id="p0025" num="0025"> figure 8 shows a perspective view of the main moulds of figure 4 in the fifth step of the process; </p><p id="p0026" num="0026"> figures 9 to 12 show perspective views of the secondary moulds in a sixth step of the process; </p><p id="p0027" num="0027"> figures 13 to 16 show perspective views of the secondary moulds of figures 9 to 12 in a seventh step of the process; </p><p id="p0028" num="0028"> figure 17 shows a perspective view of the moulds and of the components in an eighth step of the process; </p><p id="p0029" num="0029"> figure 18 shows a perspective view of the moulds in a ninth step of the process; figure 19 shows a enlarged and partial section of the moulds of figure 18; </p><p id="p0030" num="0030"> figure 20 shows the section of figure 19 in a tenth step of the process; </p><p id="p0031" num="0031"> figure 21 shows a perspective view of a shell manufactured by means of the process;
