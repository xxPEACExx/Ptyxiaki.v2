For instance, when an air conditioner is used for space cooling, it has to operate quickly because the temperature in the room is usually high at the time of staring the operation.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In such a case, the conventional practice is to perform high-speed operation (high-speed rotation) with a larger capacity at the time of start by using inverter control and, when the room space is cooled to some extent and a shift to a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> regular operating state takes place, low-speed operation (low-speed rotation) with a smaller capacity is performed. However, the low-speed operation in the regular operating state would mean operation at a very low rotating speed if in particular a case is assumed in which the air conditioner installed in a building to which today's energy saving is applied and provided with highly insulative materials.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, if a scroll compressor rotates at an excessively low speed, not only the inverter efficiency and the compressor efficiency will drop but also oil film ruptures in slide bearings will occur structurally, making the bearings susceptible to damage. Moreover, stable operational actions are made difficult, such as motor driving to turn the crankshaft is prevented from smooth operation on account of the low-speed rotation.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Hence, a usual practice is to keep the rotational speed at not too low a level at the time of small-capacity operation and to control the capacity; for instance, when the room space is cooled to a certain temperature, the scroll compressor is stopped, when the room temperature rises, it is started again, and this operational pattern is repeated.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, as this operational pattern of repeating stop and start during small-capacity operation is not only inefficient but also unable to provide comfortable air conditioning, techniques to devise capacity control are proposed.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> For instance, a structural improvement of part of a scroll compressor to accomplish control to make the discharge volume variable while keeping the rotational speed constant is described in Patent Literature 1 and elsewhere. According to what is described in Patent Literature 1, a bypass passage is provided to let refrigerant gas on the way of compression bypass to the suction side, an electromagnetic valve to open and close this bypass passage is further provided, and the refrigerant gas on the way of compression is discharged to the suction side by opening this electromagnetic valve to accomplish capacity control thereby to make the discharge volume variable.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009"><ul><li>Patent Literature 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004143951A"><text>2004-143951</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">In what is described in Patent Literature 1 cited above, when capacity control is attempted by opening the electromagnetic valve, the compression room on the way of compression and the bypass passage communicate with the suction side to make the refrigerant of the suction pressure circulate, and the path of this circulation is under the suction pressure during capacity-controlled operation. On the other hand, during capacity-controlled operation, too, the discharge side (for instance the inside of the discharge chamber) of the scroll compressor is under the discharge pressure.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> For this reason, when capacity-controlled operation is to be switched over to normal operation, since the compressed refrigerant can be discharged to the discharge side only after the suction pressure is raised to the discharge pressure in the compression room, the bypass passage and elsewhere, a time delay will result from the discharging of the refrigerant to the discharge side, resulting in a problem of a decrease in the circulating volume of the refrigerant. A decrease in the circulating volume of the refrigerant invites a drop in the work volume of compression relative to power consumption by the compressor and consequently a drop in compressor efficiency.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">An object of the present invention is to obtain a scroll compressor that can realize highly efficient capacity control even under a light load operating condition by improving the delay in the discharge of the refrigerant to the discharge side when capacity- controlled operation is switched over to normal operation.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">In order to achieve the object stated above, the invention provides a scroll compressor comprising a fixed scroll, an orbiting scroll disposed in a sealed vessel and meshed with each other to form a compression room, the fixed scroll having a release port with a discharge outlet formed toward the central part and causing the compression room and the discharge side to communicate with each other on the outer circumferential side and a release valve for preventing a reverse flow from the discharge side toward the compression room, and on the outer circumferential side of the fixed scroll a suction room and a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> suction passage communicating with the suction room, further provided with a bypass passage formed in the fixed scroll and causing the discharge side and the suction room or the suction passage to communicate with each other; a bypass valve for opening and closing this bypass passage; and a suction non-return valve that is disposed farther upstream from the suction room or part of the suction passage into which the bypass passage opens and prevents reverse flowing to the upstream side.

Namely, as the suction non-return valve 15 is provided between the suction room 10 and the suction pipe 2d, when the refrigerant in the discharge chamber 2f flows into the suction room 10, the suction non-return valve 15 is closed by the pressure difference between before and after it and closes the suction passage 5h.

Therefore, only a slight compression of the refrigerant in the compression room 11 causes the release valve 5a to open, and a channel for the refrigerant in the compression room to be bypassed from the release port 5b to the discharge chamber 2f is formed. A bypass circulation for the refrigerant discharged into the discharge chamber 2f to return to the suction room 10 past the release port 5b is formed.

First, for the purpose of comparison, actions in a prior art scroll compressor, such as the one revealed in Patent Literature 1, will be described. In the compressor of Patent Literature 1, a low-pressure bypass valve (156) and a high-pressure bypass valve (157) perform the role of switching over between normal operation and bypass operation. During normal operation, the low-pressure bypass valve (156) is closed, and compressed refrigerant is discharged toward the discharge side 109B past a discharge pipe or a high-pressure side bypass passage BH.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">On the other hand, during bypass operation, the low-pressure bypass valve (156) is opened in a state in which the high-pressure bypass valve (157) is closed. This causes a space disposed in the upper part of the fixed scroll (a bypass mechanism (140) that bypasses fluid present in the intermediate area between the suction side and the discharge side) to be connected to the suction side to be placed under the suction pressure thereby to open a bypass valve (146) to be opened by the differential pressure, and the refrigerant in the compression room to be discharged to the suction side almost uncompressed. In this way, in the conventional case described<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> above, the compression room is substantially filled with the suction pressure during bypass operation.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">This embodiment significantly differs from the foregoing case in that both the suction room 10 and the compression room 11 are substantially filled during bypass operation with the discharge pressure.<br/>
In this way, in a scroll compressor that performs operation in which the refrigerant is bypassed (bypass operation), a space in which the pressure differs between normal operation and bypass operation is present including the compression room.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7</figref> is a diagram illustrating relations among the low pressure bypass valve aperture control, the compressor discharge flow rate, input and pressure according to prior art. In <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7</figref>, "Bypass pressure" is the pressure in the space in which the pressure varies during bypass operation (hereinafter referred to as the bypass space), which in the above-cited prior art is the pressure in the space of the bypass mechanism (140) and the bypass passage BH.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7</figref>, the horizontal axis represents the lapse of time; along this lapse of time, relations among the discharge flow rate of the compressed refrigerant relative to the actions of the bypass valve and the compressor input and pressure will be described on a time series basis.<br/>
First, during normal operation during which the low-pressure bypass valve (156) is closed and the high-pressure bypass valve (157) is open, the refrigerant is normally<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> compressed and discharged, and accordingly the required discharge flow rate is obtained. Further, a normal compressor input is required as motive power for compressing the refrigerant. At this time, the bypass pressure (the pressure in the bypass space) is the same as the discharge pressure.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Next, when switching over to bypass operation in which the low-pressure bypass valve (156) is open and the high-pressure bypass valve (157) is closed takes place, the compression room is filled with the refrigerant under the suction pressure by communicating with the suction side. Also, the bypass space is placed under the suction pressure by communicating with the suction side.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">When a further period of time passes and normal operation is resumed, closure of the low-pressure bypass valve causes compression to start, but re-compression is required because the pressure in the bypass space then has dropped to the suction pressure level. For this reason, compression of the refrigerant to or above the pressure on the discharge side takes time, and a time delay arises from the closing of the low-pressure bypass valve until the discharging of the refrigerant, which invites a discharge delay and a decrease in discharge flow rate relative to the compressor input. Thus, the prior art product involves the problem of entailing a drop in compressor efficiency during operation under capacity control.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041"><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 8</figref> is a diagram illustrating relations among the bypass valve aperture control, the discharge flow rate of the<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> compressed refrigerant, the compressor input and pressure in this embodiment. For this <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 8</figref>, description will be dispensed with regarding the same parts as in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7</figref>.<br/>
In this embodiment, the bypass space comprises the suction room 10, the compression room 11 and the bypass passage 5f, and "Bypass pressure" is the pressure in the suction room 10 and the bypass passage 5f.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The diagram of <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 8</figref> will be described along a time series. First, during normal operation with the bypass valve 14 closed, as the refrigerant is normally compressed and discharged, it is obtained at the required flow rate. Also, the normal compressor input is required as motive power for compressing the refrigerant. At this time, the bypass pressure (the pressure in the bypass space) is the same as the suction pressure.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Next, when the bypass valve 14 is opened and switching over to bypass operation takes place, the suction room 10 communicates with the discharge chamber 2f, the suction room 10 and the bypass passage 5f are filled with the discharge pressure, and the compression room 11 is also placed under the discharge pressure. Thus it is a significant feature of this embodiment that the bypass pressure becomes substantially equal to the discharge pressure during bypass operation.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">When a further period of time passes, the bypass valve 14 is closed, and normal operation is resumed; as the compression room 11 is already filled with the refrigerant under the discharge pressure, there is no need for re-compression,<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> but discharging of the refrigerant can be immediately started, and the normal discharge volume can be secured. Thus, as this embodiment takes no long time to compress the refrigerant to or above the pressure level on the discharge side and discharge it and therefore can eliminate discharge delays, the discharge flow rate relative to the compressor input during operation under capacity control can be prevented from decreasing and thereby inviting a drop in compressor efficiency. Therefore, as the discharge volume can be increased to a higher level than by the prior art, the compressor efficiency during operation under capacity control can be enhanced.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">As hitherto described, this embodiment can prevent the compressor input during operation under capacity control from falling and moreover, it can regulate steplessly the capacity at any desired level between 0 and 100% by making variable the time ratio between the open and closed states in one open/closed cycle of the bypass valve 14, thereby enabling a scroll compressor that can realize high-efficiency capacity control even under low-speed and light-load operating conditions to be obtained.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Also, as capacity control by this embodiment switches over between normal operation and bypass operation at a constant time ratio, not only the capacity can be made steplessly variable in a broad range of 0 to 100% by regulating the time ratio but also the scroll compressor can be used under rotational speed conditions that permit high-efficiency and high-reliability operation.</p><heading id="h0011">Second Embodiment</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --><p id="p0047" num="0047">Next, a second embodiment of a scroll compressor according to the invention will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0007 f0008 f0009 f0010 f0011">Fig. 9 through Fig. 15</figref>.

Thus, as the pressure in the compressor is uniform at the time of start, the valve element 18a is pressed toward the fixed scroll 5 by the force of the spring 18b and closes the valve by blocking the switching valve passage 5g. As the<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> pressure in the suction room falls along with the operation of the compressor, the bypass valve 14 is held in the closed state by the pressure difference between the space 14a on its rear face side and the suction room 10 side.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">When, from the state of <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 11</figref>, electricity is supplied to the coil 18c of the switching valve 18 for a short period of time, the valve element 18a rises as long as electricity is supplied, and the switching valve 18 opens. When the switching valve 18 opens, the suction room 10 and the space 14a of the bypass valve 14 communicate with each other, and the space 14a is placed under the suction pressure. Also at this time, as the inside of the discharge chamber 2f is under the discharge pressure, the discharge pressure works on the part indicated by A in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 12</figref>. Therefore, the valve element 14b is lifted by the pressure difference; as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 13</figref>, the bypass valve 14 opens, the discharge chamber 2f and the suction room 10 communicate with each other, and bypass operation during which the refrigerant under the discharge pressure in the discharge chamber 2f flows into the suction room 10 via the bypass passage is started. To add, as the supply of electricity to the switching valve 18 is only for a short period, the switching valve 18 is immediately closed as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 13</figref>. For this reason, during the bypass operation, the pressure in the space 14a remains to be kept at the suction pressure level.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In this state of bypass operation, as the refrigerant of the discharge chamber 2f is flowing into the suction room 10, the discharge pressure is maintained.

As the valve element 14b is given a force by the spring 14c in the direction of closing the valve element 14b, the valve element 14b blocks the bypass passage 5f, and the bypass valve 14 is closed. As the supply of electricity to the switching valve 18 is only for a short period, switching over to normal operation shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 11</figref> takes place, and the scroll compressor starts normal compressive actions.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058"><figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 15</figref> is a diagram illustrating relations among bypass valve aperture variations the switching valve 18, pressure variations in the space 14a of the bypass valve 14 and pressure variations in the suction room 10 in response to the aperture control of the switch valve 18 in this second embodiment.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">As shown in this <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 15</figref>, by repeating the actions described above, the scroll compressor can be operated under capacity control. Thus, when electricity is supplied to the switching valve 18 and the switching valve is opened for a short period of time, the pressure in the space 14a of the bypass valve 14 varies from the discharge pressure to the suction pressure; as the bypass valve 14 is thereby closed, the suction room 10 is placed under the discharge pressure to accomplish bypass operation. When electricity is supplied again to the switching valve 18 and the switching valve is opened for a short period<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> of time, the pressure in the space 14a of the bypass valve 14 varies from the suction pressure to the discharge pressure; thereby the bypass valve 14 is closed, the suction room 10 is placed under the suction pressure to return to normal operation. Therefore, by controlling the opening and closing of the switching valve 18, operation under duty capacity control, by which the duration of normal operation and that of bypass operation are controlled, is made possible.

Therefore, as structural components including the communicating pipe 23 and the three-way valve 16 disposed outside the sealed vessel 2, such as the one shown in<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> the first embodiment, become dispensable, there is a further advantageous effect of making possible manufacture of compact products at low cost.</p><heading id="h0012">List of Reference Signs</heading><p id="p0062" num="0062"><ul><li>1: Scroll compressor</li><li>2: Sealed vessel (2a: case, 2b: lid chamber, 2c: bottom chamber,</li><li>2d: suction pipe, 2e: discharge pipe, 2f: discharge chamber)</li><li>3: Compressing mechanism part</li><li>4: Electric motor 4 (4a: stator, 4b: rotor)</li><li>5: Fixed scroll (5a: release valve, 5b: release port, 5c: lap,</li><li>5d: panel plate, 5e: discharge outlet, 5f: bypass passage, 5g: switching valve passage, 5h: suction passage), 6: Orbiting scroll (6a: lap, 6b: panel plate, 6c: orbiting bearing)</li><li>7: Crankshaft (7a: main shaft part, 7b: eccentric part, 7c: oiling passage)</li><li>8: Bolt</li><li>9: Frame (9a: main bearing)</li><li>10: Suction room</li><li>11: Compression room</li><li>12: Oldham's ring</li><li>13: Oil sump</li><li>14: Bypass valve (14a: space, 14b: valve element, 14c: spring)</li><li>15: Suction non-return valve</li><li>16: Three-way valve</li><li>17: Sub-bearing</li><li>18: Switching valve (18a: valve element, 18b: spring, 18c: coil)</li><li>21: Outer line side compression room, 22: Inner line side compression room</li><li>23: communicating pipe</li></ul></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977275" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A scroll compressor comprising a fixed scroll, an orbiting scroll disposed in a sealed vessel and meshed with each other to form a compression room, the fixed scroll having a release port with a discharge outlet formed toward the central part and causing the compression room and the discharge side to communicate with each other on the outer circumferential side and a release valve for preventing a reverse flow from the discharge side toward the compression room, and on the outer circumferential side of the fixed scroll a suction room and a suction passage communicating with the suction room, further provided with:
