This insulator is a solid element. In this method, a mould is filled with a ceramic powder and, while filling, the vibrations of the whole mould are induced. Then the mould is closed and pressed to achieve porosity of the finished element at the level of 20-36%. This process has several disadvantages. First, the produced elements are solid elements and not pipes, therefore they have large mass and are fairly expensive to manufacture. The final, relatively high porosity of up to 36% induces large dimensional inaccuracies when fired and thus the produced element requires additional mechanical<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> treatment by using costly diamond tools in order to obtain the desired dimensional tolerance. In addition, vibrations of the whole mould require high power vibrators.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The purpose of the present invention is to provide an alternative way of moulding ceramic electro-insulating pipes in order to achieve even greater dimensional accuracy and better electro-insulating properties.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The object of this invention is a method for manufacturing of ceramic electro-insulating pipes having an external diameter between 30 mm and 100 mm, a wall thickness between 5 mm and 10 mm, a length between 15 cm and 150 cm, the method comprising moulding in a mould, an element made from a ceramic powder, compacting the ceramic element in a press, glazing, firing of a glazed element in a furnace and shaping the fired element in order to produce the ceramic insulating pipe <b>characterised in that</b> the element is moulded in a mould (102) from a ceramic powder consisting of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> from 40% to 75% by weight, SiO<sub>2</sub> from 5 to 25%, kaolin (white clay) from 5% to 20%, and potter's clay from 5% to 20%, wherein the mould comprises a rigid cylindrical lower punch and a flexible cylindrical outer membrane placed around the lower punch so that between them a cylindrical gap is formed to be filled with the ceramic powder, wherein while filling the gap with the ceramic powder, the outer membrane is deformed from a circular cross-section to an oval cross-section with the use of at least one pair of vibrators positioned on the opposite sides of the membrane and operating in at least three stages, in which the vibration frequency increases and the amplitude of vibration decreases between successive stages, wherein the lowest vibration frequency is between 50Hz and 70Hz, and the highest vibration frequency is between 90Hz and 110Hz, and wherein the vibration amplitude causes a reduction of the diameter of membrane between the vibrators from the lowest value of about 0.5% to the highest value of about 2%, wherein the filled mould is placed in the isostatic press in order to compact the element, wherein the membrane of the mould is pressed isostatically in a first cycle that lasts from 15 s to 25 s, in which the pressure is linearly increased from 1 bar up to a value between 300 bar and 800 bar, a second cycle which lasts about 1 s, in which the pressure is maintained at the level reached so far, and in a third cycle that lasts from 25 s to 35 s, wherein the pressure is reduced linearly to 1 bar, resulting in forming an element having a porosity of below 20%.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention is distinguished from the closest prior art, which is considered to be the Russian patent document <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="RU2318657"><text>RU2318657</text></patcit>, in that it enables to manufacture ceramic pipes, but not solid elements, of a lower porosity when fired, which they require mechanical treatment after to the less extent in order to achieve the desired<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> dimensional accuracy. In this invention, the mould is not vibrated as a whole, but the vibration is applied pointwise on the flexible outer walls with the use of a set of vibrators spaced on the outside of the mould and controlled by stages with the decreasing vibration frequency in successive stages, by which the energy consumption for vibrations is optimised. The use of effective vibration method enables to compact effectively the mass, which in conjunction with high pressing pressure provides porosity of moulded pipe elements at a level below 20%.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The use of the way according to this invention enables to manufacture ceramic insulating pipes of a high quality, mainly resulting from a high dimensional accuracy. The dimensional accuracy reduces the amount of defected elements to a level below 4% of the total output. The high level of mass compaction in the process of isostatic pressing provides porosity of moulded elements below 20% and enables to reduce the wall thickness of pipes by about 10-15% compared with standard elements. Ceramic pipes manufactured according to this invention are also characterised by a higher strength measured as a lateral crushing force by about 10% as compared with standard elements owing to the higher density and thinner pipe wall. The reduced wall thickness also results in weight reduction of the pipe element by about 10-15%. In addition, the method according to the present invention eliminates the need to dry moulded elements since the elements compressed isostatically have a certain moisture content, which increases the energetic efficiency of the whole process.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention is shown by means of an exemplary embodiment on a drawing, in which:

To the lower punch 202, an elastic cylindrical polyurethane membrane 203 is fitted, so that a cylindrical gap 204 between them is formed to be filled. This invention concerns manufacturing of electro-insulating ceramic pipes having outer diameter between 30 mm and 100 mm, wall thickness between a 5 mm and 10 mm, and length between 15 cm and 150 cm. When the length of the pipe is increased, the slenderness ratio (i.e. the ratio of length to the wall thickness) of the gap to be filled increases, therefore the gap 204 has to be filled precisely with the ceramic powder. At least one pair of vibrators 213-214 is positioned on the side of membrane 203, wherein the vibrators that make a pair are located opposite each other. Vibrators 211-212, 213-214 operate in such a way that they press the membrane so that its cross section is slightly deformed from a circular to an oval shape, thereby facilitating the compaction of ceramic powder while the slot 204 is filled. The operation of vibrators is divided into stages, e.g. as shown in the example in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>. When the gap 204 is filled completely, vibrators 213-214 are stopped and the mould is closed from the top with a steel upper punch 205.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Then, the filled mould 102 is transferred to the isostatic press 104, where it is pressed isostatically, i.e. the uniform pressure is exerted on the membrane 203. The operational cycle includes a first stage, in which the pressure increases linearly from zero to the range from 300 to 800 bar in time from 15 s to 20 s, then the pressure maintains on the maximum level during 1 s, and after that the pressure is reduced in time from 25 s to 35 s, to zero.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The ceramic element moulded in such way is particularly well prepared for further step of the manufacturing process, which then is carried out in a typical way. As described above, the specific process of moulding guarantees high accuracy and high quality of the formed electro-insulating pipes.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> presents an example of the operation of vibrators. The filling process lasts about 40 s to 50 s. In principle, the operation of vibrators is divided into at least three stages, in which the vibration frequency is increased and the amplitude of vibration is<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> reduced in subsequent stages. The lowest frequency of vibration is between 50Hz and 70Hz, and the highest frequency of vibration is between 90Hz and 110Hz. The amplitude of vibration causes a change of the diameter of flexible membrane between vibrators, from the lowest value of about 0.5% to the highest value of about 2%.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977189" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A method for manufacturing of ceramic electro-insulating pipes having an external diameter between 30 mm and 100 mm, a wall thickness between 5 mm and 10 mm, a length between 15 cm and 150 cm, the method comprising moulding in a mould, an element made from a ceramic powder, compacting the ceramic element in a press, glazing, firing of a glazed element in a furnace and shaping the fired element in order to produce the ceramic insulating pipe <b>characterised in that</b> the element is moulded in a mould (102) from a ceramic powder consisting of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> from 40% to 75% by weight, SiO<sub>2</sub> from 5 to 25%, kaolin (white clay) from 5% to 20%, and potter's clay from 5% to 20%, wherein the mould (102) comprises a rigid cylindrical lower punch (202) and a flexible cylindrical outer membrane (203) placed around the lower punch (202) so that between them a cylindrical gap (204) is formed to be filled with the ceramic powder, wherein while filling the gap (204) with the ceramic powder, the outer membrane (203) is deformed from a circular cross-section to an oval cross-section with the use of at least one pair of vibrators (211-212; 213-214) positioned on the opposite sides of the membrane (203) and operating in at least three stages, in which the vibration frequency increases and the amplitude of vibration decreases between successive stages, wherein the lowest vibration frequency is between 50Hz and 70Hz, and the highest vibration frequency is between 90Hz and 110Hz, and wherein the vibration amplitude causes a reduction of the diameter of membrane between the vibrators from the lowest value of about 0.5% to the highest value of about 2%, wherein the filled mould (102) is placed in the isostatic press in order to compact the element, wherein the membrane (203) of the mould is pressed isostatically in a first cycle that lasts from 15 s to 25 s, in which the pressure is linearly increased from 1 bar up to a value between 300 bar and 800 bar, a second cycle which lasts about 1 s, in which the pressure is maintained at the level reached so far, and in a third cycle that lasts from 25 s to 35 s, wherein the pressure is reduced linearly to 1 bar, resulting in forming an element having a porosity of below 20%.</claim-text></claim></claims><drawings mxw-id="PDW16667904" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --><figure id="f0001" num="1"><img id="if0001" file="imgf0001.tif" wi="120" he="201" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --><figure id="f0002" num="2"><img id="if0002" file="imgf0002.tif" wi="120" he="201" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --><figure id="f0003" num="3"><img id="if0003" file="imgf0003.tif" wi="151" he="111" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><search-report-data><doc-page id="srep0001" file="srep0001.tif" wi="158" he="233" type="tif"/><doc-page id="srep0002" file="srep0002.tif" wi="161" he="233" type="tif"/></search-report-data><copyright>User acknowledges that Fairview Research LLC and its third party providers retain all right, title and interest in and to this xml under applicable copyright laws.
