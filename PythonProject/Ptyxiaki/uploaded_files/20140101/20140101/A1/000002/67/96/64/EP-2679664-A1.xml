At the time amplification of nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, and the like) and the fragments thereof (oligonucleotides, nucleotides, and the like) is performed for example, in tests that require quantitativeness, such as the analysis of gene expression levels, it becomes necessary to perform the amplification such that the ratio of the relative amounts of the respective nucleic acids can be known. Consequently, by using the real-time PCR method, and by using a device provided with a thermal cycler and a fluorescence spectrophotometer, analysis by electrophoresis is made unnecessary as a result of the generation process of the DNA amplification products in PCR being detected and analyzed in real time. Furthermore, as a DNA amplification method that performs amplification while maintaining the quantitativeness with respect to the ratio of the relative amounts of the DNA or RNA contained in the sample before amplification, the SPIA (Single Primer Isothermal Amplification) method is used. In the SPIA method, the linear DNA amplification method resulting from an isothermal reaction utilizing DNA/RNA chimera primer, DNA polymerase, and RNaseH has become used.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The temperature control in such nucleic acid amplification involves housing a container, which is formed from polypropylene or the like and houses the necessary reagents, such as the template DNA, primers, DNA polymerase, nucleotides, and reaction buffer solutions, within a block-shaped housing part of an constant temperature device formed from a material such as aluminum, and by heating or cooling the metallic block-shaped<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> housing part and waiting until the solution temperature becomes a uniform temperature distribution, it is made to perform heating or cooling at a constant temperature or at a next temperature (Patent Documents 1, 2 and 3).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">At that time, the container for performing temperature control is sealed with a lid, preventing the entry of contaminants from the exterior, and preventing fluid leakage from the interior, and it is particularly necessary in order to exclude the effect of the air and the air temperature as much as possible until the reaction mixture within the housing part is heated or cooled, and the solution temperature becomes a uniform temperature distribution.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Then, in the real-time PCR method and the like, which monitors the nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, and the like) that are amplified in real time by utilizing a fluorescent compound, it is necessary to observe the amplification during a temperature cycle. Consequently, with respect to a container sealed with a lid, it is necessary to perform light measurements from the exterior through a transparent lid or side surface. However, the use of a lid and the manual opening of the lid by a user are time-consuming, and becomes an obstacle with respect to the consistent automation of processing. Furthermore, at the time the lid is resealed, there is a concern of contamination occurring from making contact with the reaction mixture in the container interior. Moreover, at the time of temperature control, even if the lid is attempted to be removed from the container, it is difficult to easily open the lid due to the lid becoming adhered to the container opening as a result of moisture, and there is a concern in that rapid processing cannot be performed. At the time the lid is opened, there is also a concern of contamination occurring from the liquid attached to the inside of the lid dripping or splashing (Patent Document 4).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Furthermore, at the time of temperature control, in a case where measurements of the interior of the container are performed from the exterior of the container, although there is a need to make the lid of the container transparent and to perform the measurements from the exterior, there is a concern of the interior of the lid becoming cloudy from condensation, and the measurements becoming difficult.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> On the other hand, in order to perform processing such as nucleic acid amplification, as a precondition thereof, it becomes necessary to extract a small amount of nucleic acids from the sample and to perform processing within the reaction container together with various reagents, primers, DNA polymerase, nucleotides, reaction buffers, and the like, manually or using various devices for example. Therefore, in the present state, researchers and technicians that are specialized with regard to nucleic acids and the like are needed.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">This situation is preventing the generalization of genetic analysis and the expansion of clinical applications in hospitals, and the like. Therefore, at the time of clinical use, and the like, in order to prevent cross-contamination and to reduce user labor, and to easily perform from the extraction, the amplification, and further, by means of a measurement, the genetic analysis of nucleic acids, then in addition to the need for full automation which consistently automates steps from the extraction, the amplification, and further up to the measurement of nucleic acids, the miniaturization of the device, and the provision of an inexpensive, high-accuracy device are important.</p><heading id="h0003">[Prior Art Documents]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Patent Documents]</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009"><ul><li>[Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2622327B"><text>2622327</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 2] Published Japanese translation No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2000511435W"><text>2000-511435 of PCT</text></patcit> International Publication</li><li>[Patent Document 3] United States Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5958349A"><text>5,958,349</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 4] Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2002010777A"><text>2002-10777</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">[Summary of the Invention]</heading><heading id="h0006">[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">Therefore, the present invention is one that has been achieved in order to solve the problems mentioned above. A first object thereof is in providing a reaction container and a manufacturing method thereof wherein processing with a high reliability can be performed by preventing with certainty contamination due to the entry of contaminants from the exterior into the reaction container which performs reactions such as the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> amplification of nucleic acids in which temperature control is necessary, or splashing of liquids from the reaction container for example.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A second object is in providing a reaction container and a manufacturing method thereof that, at the very least, consistently automates processing including reactions, such as nucleic acid amplification, and optical measurements, reduces user labor, and can also be rapidly, efficiently, and inexpensively manufactured and utilized without expanding the scale of the device.</p><heading id="h0007">[Means for Solving the Problem]</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">A first aspect of the invention is a reaction container having one or two or more housing parts for reactions comprising: a narrow-mouthed piping part in which a reaction reagent or a portion thereof is housed or is housable; a wide-mouthed piping part that is communicated with the narrow-mouthed piping part and provided on an upper side of the narrow-mouthed piping part, and has an aperture that is wider than an aperture of the narrow-mouthed piping part; and a punchable film provided such that it partitions an interval between the wide-mouthed piping part and the narrow-mouthed piping part.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Here, the "reaction reagents or a portion thereof" represents the reagents used for a predetermined reaction or a portion of the reagents thereof, and can be housed in a liquid form or a dry state. In the case of a nucleic acid amplification reaction for example, the reaction reagent is a solution for amplification, and in a case where amplification is performed by the PCR method for example, it represents a template DNA solution which is the amplification subject, a primer solution, a DNA polymerase solution, a nucleotide solution, a reaction buffer solution, and the like. In a case where amplification is performed by the SPIA method, it represents a DNA/RNA chimera primer solution, a DNA polymerase solution, an RNaseH solution, and the like. Furthermore, generally, methods for performing real-time PCR using fluorescent reagents containing a fluorescent compound include the intercalation method, the hybridization method, and the LUX method. In the "intercalation method", a fluorescent compound such as SYBR (registered trademark) GREEN I or ethidium bromide, enters into double-stranded DNA at the time of the elongation reaction, and is a method in which the DNA amount is measured<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> by irradiating an excitation light and utilizing the fluorescent light-emitting characteristics. Therefore, at the very least, the fluorescent material and a quencher that suppresses the light emission of the fluorescent material must be contained within the amplification solution. The "hybridization method" is a method that detects only a target PCR product by using a DNA probe labeled with a fluorescent material in addition to a PCR primer. That is to say, as a result of the DNA probe labeled by fluorescent light hybridizing with the target PCR product, the hybridized DNA (amount) thereof is detected. The "LUX method" is one that utilizes a property in which the fluorescent light signal of the fluorescent compound labeling the oligonucleotide is affected by the shape (such as a sequence, a single-strand, or a double-strand) of the oligonucleotide thereof. In actual real-time PCR, a PCR primer (LUX primer) that is labeled with one type of a fluorescent compound and a contrastingly unlabeled PCR primer are used to perform real-time PCR. The LUX primer thereof is labeled with a fluorescent compound in the vicinity of the 3'-terminus, and is designed such that it takes a hairpin structure in the interval between the 5'-terminus. When the LUX primer takes a hairpin structure, the quenching effect is resolved, and the fluorescent light signal becomes increased. By measuring this signal increase, the amount of the PCR product can be measured.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Examples of the material of the reaction containers, which includes the housing part for reactions, the lid, and the like, include resins such as polyethylene (P.E.), polypropylene (P.P.), polystyrene and acrylic, glass, metals, and metal compounds. The size of the reaction containers is such that the narrow-mouthed piping part is a size in which, in addition to several µL to several 100 µL of liquid being storable, the ends of the dispensing tips are insertable for example. In the case of a cylindrical shape, the diameter of the size of one reaction container is several mm to several 10 mm, and the depth is several mm to several 10 mm for example. The inner diameter of the wide-mouthed piping part is approximately 9 mm, the inner diameter of the aperture of the narrow-mouthed piping part is approximately 4 mm, the capacity of the narrow-mouthed piping part is approximately 50 µL, the liquid amount to be housed is approximately 25 µL, and the thickness is approximately 0.2 mm for example.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> The interior of the reaction container is temperature controllable by means of a temperature controller.<br/>
The "temperature controller" has a temperature source that is able to raise or lower the temperature within the reaction containers which house the liquids that become subjected to temperature control, based on a signal from the exterior for example. The temperature source is one in which, for example, a Peltier element, a heater, a cooling device, and the like is provided on a block-shaped member. In order to perform processing such as PCR, the temperature controller is preferably a thermal cycler using a Peltier element. Furthermore, it is also possible to perform temperature control of an isothermal amplification by the LAMP method.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">"Temperature control" represents, with respect to a liquid or a container that becomes the subject thereof, the maintaining of one or two or more set predetermined temperatures for set time periods, according to a specified sequence, and the execution at a specified frequency. The instructions to the temperature controller are carried out by sending a corresponding signal based on a program.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The "predetermined temperature" is a target temperature that an object, such as a liquid that becomes the subject, is to reach. In a case where nucleic acids, such as the DNA contained in the liquid, or oligonucleotides and the like, which represent fragments of nucleic acids, are amplified by the PCR method for example, the predetermined temperature that is set is a temperature cycle performed in the PCR method. That is to say, it represents temperatures that are respectively necessary for the denaturation, the annealing or the hybridization, and the elongation of DNA of approximately 94°C, a temperature in the interval from 50°C to 60°C, and a temperature of approximately 72°C for example. On the other hand, in the case of the SPIA method (trademark), it becomes set at a fixed temperature, such as 55°C for example.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Furthermore, the predetermined temperature includes a temperature for transition acceleration that shortens the transition time and keeps the single cycle time within a predetermined cycle time as a result of, in the case of a transition from a high-temperature predetermined temperature to a low-temperature predetermined temperature, performing<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> cooling at a temperature for transition acceleration that is lower than these predetermined temperatures by means of the temperature controller, or, at the time of a transition from a low-temperature predetermined temperature to a high-temperature predetermined temperature, by performing heating at a temperature for transition acceleration that is even higher than these predetermined temperatures for example.
