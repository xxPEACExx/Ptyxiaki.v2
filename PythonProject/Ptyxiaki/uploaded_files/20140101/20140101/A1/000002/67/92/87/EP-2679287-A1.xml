Generally, the upper and lower brackets on a golf cart support the upper and lower parts of a golf bag. This means that a large spacing should exist between the upper and lower brackets of golf bags, which cause difficulties with storage or transportation of golf carts. The existing folding golf cart mainly comprises a bottom frame, pillar and handle etc and these parts are generally soldered together, which makes the golf cart impossible to be folded. Thus, the volume of the cart cannot be reduced during the transportation and storage and thus requires greater containers, bigger space or packing boxes to keep or collect such carts and finally increases the cost for transportation and storage. On the other hand, to the users, the cart requires bigger space for storage since it cannot be folded and thus makes it inconvenient to perform such operations.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary</b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">It is an aim of the invention to attempt to overcome at least one of the above or other disadvantage. It is a further aim to provide one model of easy-to-use space-saving folding golf cart aiming at deficiencies in existing technologies.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">According to the present invention there is provided an apparatus and method as set forth in the appended claims. Other features of the invention will be apparent from the dependent claims, and the description which follows.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">According to an exemplary embodiment, there is provided a folding golf cart having a lock device to lock the golf cart in an extended or unfolded state such that the golf cart cannot be folded without releasing the lock device. The lock device comprises a brake pillar, a locking piece and a button, wherein the brake pillar is on one part of the golf cart and the locking piece is on another part of the golf cart and the two parts are arranged to be automatically locked together as the two parts are moved towards each other during the operation of unfolding the cart. The lock device preventing the two parts from moving away from each other. The lock device being released by operating the button.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the exemplary embodiment, the locking piece is arranged to rotate in the direction of bias of an offsetting spring in order to abut the brake pillar and chuck the brake pillar to increase the locking force between the locking piece and the brake pillar and prevent the two parts of the golf cart unlocking. That is, the locking piece is biased to rotate from a first position, in which a restriction through which the brake pillar moves is widened to allow said movement and a second position, in which the restriction is narrowed thereby preventing withdrwal of the brake pillar through the restriction. Advantageously, because any force generated on the folding golf cart to collapse the cart, which requires movement of the two parts away from each other, acts to further chuck the brake pillar in the locking piece, the locking characteristics are improved as accidental or unintentional unlocking caused by a force acting to move the two parts away from each other is reduced.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the exemplary embodiment the locking piece and the button are disconnected, and the button is arranged to rotate the locking piece against the bias to release the brake pillar. Because the locking piece and button are disconnected, the button is not caused to move as the locking piece rotates against the force of the bias spring when the brake pillar abuts and rotates the locking piece to become locked. This is advantageous because the movement of the button can become hindered in use and can trap other items.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Suitably, the lock device prevents any movement of the two parts before the lock device is released. Furthermore, in the exemplary embodiments, the button is arranged so as to slide. Here, the button is a push button. Suitably, and as shown in the exemplary embodiments, the brake pillar has a bulbous head. The bulbous head is tapered so that as the brake pillar is brought towards the locking piece, the bulbous head abuts the locking<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> piece and causes the locking piece to rotate towards the first position wherein the restriction is widened so that the bulbous head can pass through the restriction. After passing through the restriction, the locking piece rotates to abut a shaft of the brake pillar thereby preventing withdrawal.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The folding golf cart is composed of a bottom frame, pillar, handle, the front wheel and rear wheel mounted to the front part of the bottom frame, two rear wheel carriers used to install the rear wheels, the folding connecting rod, the support rod, the connecting rod and the sliding seat set on the pillar. The bottom end of the pillar is connected to the back-end part of the bottom frame. The bottom of the handle is designed with a connector whose one end is connected to the near-top part of the pillar and the other to one end of the folding connecting rod. While, the other end of the said folding connecting rod is hinged to the back end of the bottom frame; the front ends of both the rear-wheel carriers are connected on both sides of the sliding seat and the two sides of the support rod are hinged to the pillar and the rear-wheel carrier. The two sides of the connecting rod are connected to the sliding seat and the bottom frame respectively.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The said pillar, connector, folding connecting rod and the bottom frame together compose a parallel four-connecting-rod structure where one action of the rod can drive and control the free folding and unfolding of the whole golf cart.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The top of the said pillar is designed with a lock device used to lock and fix the connector. The lock device consists of the fixed seat on the top of the pillar, the button designed on the fixed seat, the pushing slip sheet secured inside the fixed seat, the brake pillar fastened to the connector, two rotatable locking pieces secured from the vertical direction into the fixed seat, the two locking pieces are designed with opening-closing slope towards the brake pillar; the brake pillar is designed with a locking trough near to the head. The head of the brake pillar goes through the two locking pieces which are then geared into the trench respectively. The lock device is made secure because the gap for the brake pillar narrows when the locking pieces rotate which increases the locking force on the brake pillar. The raised toggle post is designed at the top of the locking pieces and the top of the pushing slip sheet is connected to the button while the bottom of the pushing slip sheet is designed with the thrust surface at the both sides. The two thrust surfaces are pressed against the toggle post of the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> two locking pieces.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The said button has one end hinged to the fixed seat and the top of the pushing slip sheet is connecting the two ends of the button. There is a press return spring between the button and the fixed seat. An offsetting spring helping move the locking piece is designed to connect the locking pieces and the fixed seat.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The mentioned brake pillar has the spherical surface in the head.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The said pillar has a locating fastener fixed at the bottom. The locating fastener goes raised and is designed with a trapezoid locating area; the sliding seat is designed with a trapezoid locating slot corresponding to that locating area. The trapezoid locating area is geared into the trapezoid locating slot when the golf cart is open.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The mentioned bottom frame is designed with a locating trough corresponding to the support rod and the support rod is geared into the locating trough when the golf cart is open.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The mentioned front wheel is mounted to the front part of the bottom frame through the front-wheel connecting device which contains the fixed fitting seat installed onto the front end of the bottom frame, the fitting shaft mounted onto the fixed fitting seat and the front-wheel seat set onto the fitting shaft by slipping ways. The front wheel is connected to the front-wheel seat and a front-wheel spring is designed to connect the fitting shaft and the front-wheel seat. The front end of the fixed fitting seat is square in structure and the back end of the front-wheel seat is designed with locating slot holes corresponding to the fixed fitting seat and the locating slot holes of the fixed front-wheel seat is set onto the front part of the fixed fitting seat.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The mentioned fixed fitting seat has certain taper at the front.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The said bottom frame is a single-tube or double-tube structure.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The advantages of this utility model: this model is composed of the bottom frame, the pillar, the handle, the front wheel and rear wheel, the rear-wheel carrier, the folding connecting rod, the support rod, the connecting rod and the sliding seat. The bottom end of the pillar is connected to the back-end part of the bottom frame. The bottom of the handle is designed with a connector whose one end is connected to the near-top part of the pillar and the other to one end of the folding connecting rod. While, the other end of the said folding connecting rod is hinged to the back end of the bottom frame; the front ends of both the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> rear-wheel carriers are connected on both sides of the sliding seat and the two sides of the support rod are hinged to the pillar and the rear-wheel carrier. The two sides of the connecting rod are connected to the sliding seat and the bottom frame respectively.

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">Figures 1-8</figref>, the folding golf cart contains the bottom frame(5), the pillar(1), the handle(2), the front wheel(11) and rear wheel(12) mounted to the bottom frame (5), the rear-wheel carrier (13) used to install the rear wheel (12), the folding connecting rod (6), the support rod (7), the connecting rod (8) and the sliding seat (9) set on the pillar (1) by sliding means. The bottom end of the pillar (1) is connected to the back-end part of the bottom frame (5). The bottom of the handle (2) is designed with a connector (21) whose one end is connected to the near-top part of the pillar (1) and the other to one end of the folding connecting rod (6). While, the other end of the said folding connecting rod (6) is hinged to the back end of the bottom frame (5); the front ends of both the rear-wheel carriers (13) are connected on both sides of the sliding seat (9) and the two sides of the support rod (7) are hinged to the pillar (1) and the rear-wheel carrier (13). The two sides of the connecting rod (8) are connected to the sliding seat (9) and the bottom frame (5) respectively.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The pillar (1), the connecting piece (21), the folding connecting rod (6) and the bottom frame (5) together forms a parallel four-rod mechanism where one rod piece action can control the free extending and folding of the whole cart. They bring stable structure and reliable transmission. The action of the connecting piece (21) in the four-rod mechanism can drive and control the corresponding actions of the rest components. The bottom frame (5), the pillar (1), the rear-wheel carrier (13), the support rod (7), the connecting rod (8) and the sliding seat (9) form another link mechanism too.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The top of the pillar (1) is designed with a lock device (3) used to lock and fix the connector (21). The lock device consists of the fixed seat (31) on the top of the pillar (1), the button (32) designed on the fixed seat (31), the pushing slip sheet (33) secured inside the fixed seat (31), the brake pillar (34) fastened to the connector (21), two rotatable locking pieces (35) secured from the vertical direction into the fixed seat (31), the two locking pieces (35) are designed with opening-closing slope (351) towards the brake pillar (34); the brake pillar (34) is designed with a locking trough (341) near to the head. The head of the brake pillar (34) goes through the two locking pieces (35) which are then geared into the trench (341) respectively. The raised toggle post (352) is designed at the top of the locking pieces (35) and the top of the pushing slip sheet (33) is connected to the button (32) while the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> bottom of the pushing slip sheet (33) is designed with the thrust surface (331) at the both sides. The two thrust surfaces (331) are pressed against the toggle post (352) of the two locking pieces (35). The locking device (3) of this utility model chucks the brake pillar (34) from the two sides by using the two locking pieces (35), making the lock more reliable. Press only the button (32) and then the pushing slip sheet (33) will push the two locking pieces (35) rotate and open and thus release the brake pillar (34) and finally unlock. This structure makes it easy to unlock and convenient to operate the cart.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The diameter of the brake pillar (34) head is bigger than the shortest distance between the two locking pieces (35), enabling the two locking pieces (35) to lock the head of the brake pillar (34). The shortest distance between the locking pieces (35) at the time when the two locking pieces (35) rotates to be parallel with the opening-closing slope (351) is bigger than the diameter of the brake pillar (34) head. The locking piece (35) is a cylinder structure and its peripheral surface is designed with troughs and then forms an opening-closing slope (351). Under normal conditions, the opening-closing slopes of the two locking pieces are angular. When the brake pillar (34) are inserted into the two locking pieces (35), the head of the brake pillar (34) will push the opening-closing slope (351) of the two locking pieces (35) and make the two rotate to be parallel with the two opening-closing slope (351) and then go through. Later, the two locking pieces (35) will rotate and return. At this time, the head of the brake pillar (34) is locked by the two locking pieces (35) and cannot get released and thus the locking device is locked. It means that the golf cart is fixed at the extending state and cannot be folded. Then press down button (32) and the button (32) will push the pushing sliding sheet to slide downwards and the two thrust surfaces (331) at the bottom of the pushing slip sheet will work on the toggle post (352) of the locking pieces (35) and make the two locking pieces rotate to be parallel with the opening-closing slope (351). This time, the head of the brake pillar (34) can go released from the lock of the two locking pieces (35) and thus the locking device (3) is unlocked and the handle(2) can be operated freely and fold the cart.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">One end of the button (32) is hinged to the fixed seat (31) and the top of the pushing slip sheet (33) is connected between the two ends of the button (32), making the moment arm of the button (32) longer and thus requires less strength to press the button to unlock. Between the button (32) and the fixed seat (31), there is a return spring (36) which makes the button<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> (32) capable to return upwards after being pressed. There is a rotatable return spring (37) between the locking piece (35) and the fixed seat (31) and it is used to help the locking pieces rotate and return and allow the locking piece (35) to rotate and reset automatically.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The head of the brake pillar (34) is spherical in structure, which makes the inserting of the brake pillar (34) into the two locking pieces (35) smooth and easy.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The pillar has a locating fastener (14) fixed near to the bottom and the locating fastener has a raised trapezoid locating area 141. The bottom of the sliding seat (9) is designed with a trapezoid locating slot (91) corresponding to the locating area (141). When the golf cart is open, the trapezoid area (141) is chucked into the locating slot (91). The trapezoid locating area (141) and the trapezoid locating slot (91) will work together to fix and lock the sliding seat (9) more reliably, preventing the sliding seat (9) from swaying.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The bottom frame (5) is designed with locating trough (51) corresponding to the support rod (7). When the golf cart is open, the support rod is chucked into the locating trough (51), bringing a better locating effect. It makes the golf cart open more stable without any swaying.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The front wheel (11) is mounted to the front part of the bottom frame (5) through the front-wheel connecting device (4) which contains the fixed fitting seat (41) installed onto the front end of the bottom frame (5), the fitting shaft (42) mounted onto the fixed fitting seat (41) and the front-wheel seat (43) set onto the fitting shaft by slipping ways. The front wheel (11) is connected to the front-wheel seat (43) and a front-wheel spring (44) is designed to connect the fitting shaft (42) and the front-wheel seat (43). The front end of the fixed fitting seat (41) is square in structure and the back end of the front-wheel seat (43) is designed with locating slot holes (431) corresponding to the fixed fitting seat (41) and the locating slot holes of the fixed front-wheel seat (43) is set onto the front part of the fixed fitting seat (41). Pull out the front-wheel seat (43) forwards to make it rotate freely. The swaying direction of the front wheel (11) can be adjusted according to actual needs. When folding the golf cart, you can pull out the front wheel (43) forwards and rotate it for 90 degree to make the front wheel stand horizontally and thus reduce the volume of the folded golf cart better.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The front end of the fixed fitting seat (41) has certain taper, which make the locating slot holes of the front-wheel seat can be set on the front end of the fixed fitting seat easier and connected more reliable. Of course, the fitting shaft (42) can be pulled out of the fixed fitting<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> seat (41) and thus the front wheel (11) can be detached and thus the volume can be further reduced to make the transportation easier.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The front wheel (11) is connected to the front-wheel seat (43) through the adjusting gear. You can adjust the axle of the front wheel (11) by two screws in order to line up the front wheel (11).</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The bottom frame (5) is a single-tube or double-tube structure.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The bottom frame (5), pillar (1), handle (2) and rear-wheel carrier (13) of this utility model realizes interlock through the folding connecting rod (6) and the support rod (7), the connecting rod (8) and the sliding seat (9). While using the cart, you should turn the handle (2) backwards to instruct the pillar (1) and the folding connecting rod (6) towards the bottom frame and thus fold the cart into a Z-shaped three-fold state. The cart can realize free and flexible extending and folding with only one action, providing easy folding and unfolding and convenient operation. When operating it, its volume can be cut down greatly and great space can be saved. It is easy to store or carry along with its simple structure.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Of course, the above mentioned explanations tell only the relatively good implementation cases of this utility model.
