This ultrasonic treatment device includes an ultrasonic probe configured to transmit ultrasonic vibrations from a proximal end to a distal end. The ultrasonic suction is carried out by using a distal face of the ultrasonically vibrating ultrasonic probe, and effected by exploiting a physical phenomenon known as cavitation. More specifically, as an ultrasonic probe repeats tens of thousands of high-velocity vibrations per second by ultrasonic vibrations, pressure periodically varies in a vicinity of the distal face of the ultrasonic probe. When the pressure in the vicinity of the distal face is lower than saturated vapor pressure for only a short time<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> because of pressure variation, small air bubbles (cavities) are produced in a liquid within a body cavity or in a liquid supplied from the ultrasonic treatment device to a vicinity of a treatment position of living tissue. The produced air bubbles disappear because of force that acts when the pressure in the vicinity of the distal face increases (compression). The above-described physical phenomenon is called cavitation. An inelastic living tissue such as a hepatic cell is shattered (disintegrated) and emulsified by impact energy when the air bubbles disappear. A suction path passes through an inside of the ultrasonic probe from the proximal end to the distal end. The shattered and emulsified living tissue is suctioned and collected from a suction opening at the distal end of the ultrasonic probe through the suction path. The above-described functions are continued to resect the living tissue. In this case, an elastic living tissue such as a blood vessel absorbs the impact and is therefore not easily shattered (disintegrated), so that living tissues are selectively shattered. However, while the living tissues are selectively shattered by cavitation, an elastic living tissue such as a blood vessel may also be damaged when the cavitation-effected treatment is carried out with the distal end of the ultrasonic probe remaining at the treatment position (affected part) of the living<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> tissue. Therefore, the cavitation-effected treatment is carried out with the ultrasonic probe moving along the surface of the treatment position (affected part).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Patent Literature 2 has disclosed an ultrasonic knife including a cutter formed at the distal end of an ultrasonic probe. The ultrasonic knife resects living tissue with the cutter (edge). A suction opening is formed in a side surface of the ultrasonic probe, and a suction path is formed inside the ultrasonic probe along a longitudinal axis. The living tissue resected by the cutter is suctioned from the suction opening through the suction path in the ultrasonic probe.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004"><ul><li>Patent Literature 1: Jpn.

Therefore, when the suction opening is open at the distal end of the ultrasonic probe, the living tissue which is not shattered by cavitation tends to adhere to the suction<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> opening. The stability of the primary (original) suction of the shattered and emulsified living tissue deteriorates because of the adhesion of the unshattered (non-shattered) living tissue to the suction opening. The adhesion of the unshatter living tissue to the suction opening also deteriorates operability when the ultrasonic probe is moved along the surface of a treatment position of the living tissue. This impairs operation continuity during surgery (operation) and causes problems such as increased stress on a patient, increased surgery time, and an increased risk of bleeding from an unintended part. Moreover, the surface area of the distal face is reduced by the provision of the suction opening at the distal end. That is, the effective area that permits the effective utilization of the cavitation phenomenon is reduced. This decreases treatment efficiency and increases surgery time. For higher treatment efficiency, it is possible to increase an outside diameter of the ultrasonic probe and secure the surface area of the distal face. However, the increase in outside diameter of the ultrasonic probe increases the size and weight of the ultrasonic probe, and degrades workability in operation during a treatment such as the movement of the ultrasonic probe. The increase in outside diameter of the ultrasonic probe, which is configured to be inserted into the body cavity, also increases the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> burden on the patient. It is possible to increase the amplitude of the ultrasonic vibrations to enhance the cavitation effect. However, the increase in amplitude of the ultrasonic vibrations also increases the strength of shattering (disintegration) by cavitation per unit area. This increases the risk of damaging the living tissue in an unintended part.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As the ultrasonic knife according to Patent Literature 2 has the suction opening in the side surface, the living tissue that is not resected does not easily adhere to the suction opening even when suction is carried out simultaneously with the resection of the living tissue by the cutter. However, as the distal end of the ultrasonic probe is the cutter, a part, in which a distal end of an outer peripheral portion is an outer edge, does not include a perpendicular plane which is a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the ultrasonic probe. In general, even when the part in which the distal end of the outer peripheral portion is the outer edge includes a plane or curved surface tilted (inclined) relative to the longitudinal axis and this part does not include the perpendicular plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis, cavitation is produced. However, if the part in which the distal end of the outer peripheral portion is the outer edge includes the perpendicular plane perpendicular to the longitudinal<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> axis, cavitation is produced more efficiently, and the living tissue is resected safely and efficiently. Therefore, the efficiency of producing cavitation is lower in the configuration in which the cutter is formed at the distal end of the ultrasonic probe. Accordingly, working efficiency and safety deteriorate when the living tissue is shattered and resected.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention has been made in view of the foregoing

When the ultrasonic treatment device 1 is used to ultrasonically suction the living tissue, a current is supplied to the ultrasonic vibrator 12 from the ultrasonic controller 8 via the electrical signal lines 13A and 13B, for example, by the operation in the input unit 10. As a result, ultrasonic vibrations are produced by the ultrasonic vibrator 12. The ultrasonic vibrations are then transmitted from the proximal end to the distal end of the ultrasonic probe 3. A liquid such as a physiological saline solution is supplied to the vicinity of a treatment position from the water supply unit 53. Cavitation is caused by the transmission of the ultrasonic vibrations to the surface continuous portion 25 of the ultrasonic probe 3 simultaneous with the supply of the liquid. Living tissue having low elasticity such as a hepatic cell is<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> shattered (disintegrated) and resected by cavitation. Here, the surface continuous portion 25 includes the perpendicular plane 23 perpendicular to the longitudinal axis C. As the surface continuous portion 25 is provided in the state that the distal end of the outer peripheral portion 21 is the outer edge with surface thereof being continuous, the surface area of the surface continuous portion 25 is increased.

Moreover, in the ultrasonic probe 3, the effective area that permits the effective utilization of the cavitation phenomenon is increased, and it is therefore unnecessary to increase the amplitude of the ultrasonic vibrations. Thus, the cavitation-effected treatment is carried out without the increase in the strength of shattering (disintegration) by cavitation per unit area. In this way, in the ultrasonic probe 3, cavitation is produced efficiently, and the living tissue is shattered and resected safely and efficiently.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The living tissue resected by cavitation is then suctioned.

The first suction opening 28A and the second suction opening 28B extend to the suction path 26 from the outer peripheral portion 21. Here, the living tissue is resected by cavitation while the surface continuous portion 25 is almost in contact with the living tissue. The resected living tissue is suctioned from the first suction opening 28A and the second suction opening 28B extending from the outer peripheral portion 21. Therefore, even if the living tissue is suctioned simultaneously with the resection of the living tissue by cavitation, the living tissue that is not shattered by cavitation does not easily adhere to the first suction opening 28A or the second suction opening 28B. Consequently, the living tissue resected by cavitation is stably suctioned.

In the ultrasonic treatment device 71, no current path of the high-frequency current is formed in the ultrasonic probe 3, and no current path of the high-frequency current is formed in the sheath 41 either.

When no hydrophilic coating 76 is provided as in the first embodiment, the liquid may locally adhere to the surface continuous portion 25 because of, for example, surface tension, and the liquid does not uniformly adhere to the surface continuous portion 25.

Thus, cavitation is produced efficiently, and the living tissue can be shattered and resected safely and more efficiently.<!-- EPO <DP n="53"> --></p><p id="p0080" num="0080">In the ultrasonic treatment device 1, the area increasing portion 91 is provided so that the ultrasonic probe 3 is thin in parts other than its distal end. When the jaw 47 is closed relative to the ultrasonic probe 3, the distal end of the jaw 47 is located to the proximal direction side of the distal end of the area increasing portion 91. Therefore, the entire jaw 47 can be located to inner peripheral side of the outer edge of the surface continuous portion 25 when the jaw 47 is closed relative to the ultrasonic probe 3. Accordingly, when the ultrasonic suction is carried out as well, the jaw 47 is closed relative to the ultrasonic probe 3 so that the entire jaw 47 is located to inner peripheral side of the outer edge of the surface continuous portion 25. Therefore, the operator's view is not blocked by the jaw 47. Consequently, visibility during ultrasonic suction is improved.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">In the ultrasonic treatment device 1, the area increasing portion 91 is provided so that the ultrasonic probe 3 is thin in parts other than its distal end. That is, the ultrasonic probe 3 is thin in the part where the jaw facing portion 57 is provided. Therefore, the living tissue is easily grasped between the ultrasonic probe 3 and the jaw 47. Consequently, the living tissue can be efficiently coagulated and cut between the jaw facing portion 57 of the ultrasonic<!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --> probe 3 and the jaw 47.</p><heading id="h0018">(Other Modifications)</heading><p id="p0082" num="0082">In the second to fifth embodiments as well, the hydrophilic coating 76 is preferably provided over the entire surface continuous portion 25, as in the fourth modification of the first embodiment. This allows the liquid supplied from the water supply unit 53 to uniformly adhere to the entire surface continuous portion 25. Accordingly, the living tissue can be shattered by cavitation more efficiently by using the entire surface continuous portion 25.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">Incidentally, the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments and various modifications can naturally be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">Other characteristic technical matters according to the present invention are additionally set forth below.</p><heading id="h0019">Notes</heading><heading id="h0020">(Additional note 1)</heading><p id="p0085" num="0085">An ultrasonic probe configured to transmit ultrasonic vibrations from a proximal end to a distal end, the ultrasonic probe comprising:
