More particularly, this invention relates to a hand-held dispenser for adhesive tape of the sort which is used for ordinary household and office purposes. Specifically, this invention is directed to a tape dispenser which has an improved plastic cutter assembly for severing BOPP (Biaxially-Oriented Polypropylene) adhesive tape, a protrusion for supporting a first region of the tape when a second region thereof is being severed, and a brake mechanism for halting rotation of the tape roll.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Adhesive tape is commonly used in households and offices to secure articles together. Typically, this tape is between 1 and 2 cm in width. For the purposes of the present invention, this type of adhesive tape will be referred to as "household tape". Household tape is generally sold and available in two formats: in rolls that are typically sold in boxes or already installed in small handheld tape dispensers. In North America, the majority of the household tapes in use are made using two different film substrates, namely, acetate and BOPP (Biaxially-Oriented Polypropylene).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Acetate film includes a backing of cellulose acetate, which comes from wood pulp and/or cotton fibers, treated with acetic acid and anhydride. One side of the film is treated with a release agent. The construction of the film is very brittle and it has very poor pull strength; therefore, the slightest incision in the substrate tends to tear the film apart. There are few commercial sources of this film<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> in the world and it is, therefore, a relatively expensive raw material. Furthermore, to minimize the naturally higher risk of breaking the web of film, causing exorbitant wastage rates in production, during the coating and converting processes, both activities are managed at a very slow pace.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">By contrast, BOPP film is manufactured using an extrusion process. The extruded film is stretched significantly from a 1 meter width (± 39") at extrusion to a 9 meter wide (± 354") finished roll. Such film is not brittle and does not tear easily, usually requiring a sharp blade to incite a tear. The 9 meter wide roll is slit into smaller manageable widths ranging from 1.27 meter (50") to 2 meters (79"), to accommodate desired machine capacities. BOPP is manufactured much more widely and efficiently, therefore, it is a much more cost-effective film to procure while generating significantly more manageable wastage levels.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">To facilitate the increased penetration of good quality BOPP film in North American household tapes in recent years, metal cutters have been installed in the cutters of the typical hand-held tape dispensers to ensure a satisfactory experience for the consumer. The increased strength of the film makes it more difficult to cut and the metal cutters have proven to be more successful at accomplishing this task than previous plastic cutters. Until the development of the present invention, which shall be described hereinafter, nobody has successfully designed a hand-held tape dispenser that includes plastic teeth which can tear BOPP adhesive film without compromising the film's performance. In those instances where BOPP film is able to tear on a plastic cutter, the actual film has had to be modified during the converting process by serrating the film's edges using a special knife, a process termed score-cutting. Though this ensures that the user is more easily able to dispense the tape on a plastic cutter, this type of tape product tends to fail industry tests under normal laboratory conditions with respect to tensile strength and elongation.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6612474B"><text>US Patent No. 6,612,474</text></patcit> discloses a hand-held tape dispenser that is suitable for dispensing acetate type adhesive tapes. Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6612474B"><text>6,612,474</text></patcit> is assigned to the same assignee as the present matter. In the tape dispenser disclosed in Patent<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> No. 6,612,474, the teeth on the plastic cutter have a relatively small height as it does not take much to tear the acetate tape when dispensing the product. However, this same patented dispenser is less able to consistently and satisfactorily dispense BOPP adhesive tape as this type of tape tends to stretch on the teeth instead of being cut thereby.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">There is therefore a need in the art for a tape dispenser including a plastic cutter assembly that is able to more consistently and satisfactorily dispense BOPP-based adhesive tapes.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The device of the present invention is a tape dispenser which incorporates a cutter that is able to consistently and satisfactorily dispense BOPP-based adhesive tapes. In this tape dispenser, the teeth on the cutter assembly remain below the height of the shields on each side of the cutter assembly. This arrangement ensures that the user will be less likely to scratch themselves while dispensing tape. The configuration of the teeth on the cutter is substantially different to the configuration of the teeth in the dispenser covered by <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6612474B"><text>US Patent No. 6,612,474</text></patcit>. Specifically, the teeth on the cutter assembly of the present invention include four faces that join each other along edges that are disposed at particular angles relative to each other. Additionally, the teeth of the present invention have edges that join the faces that cause the teeth to be longer in overall height that the previously known teeth.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Additionally, the device of the present invention includes a protrusion positioned rearwardly of the cutter assembly and between the cutter assembly and the axles that support the roll of tape. This protrusion allows the tape to rest thereon when a desired length of the tape is being dispensed. The dispenser further includes a braking mechanism which allows the user to cause the rotation of the tape roll to cease and to be held in a particular position before the tape is severed by the cutter assembly. The combination of the braking mechanism, the unique design of the teeth, and the protrusion before the cutter, all work together to ensure that BOPP adhesive tape can be successfully dispensed.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The tape dispenser in accordance with the present invention has the capability to successfully tear three types of BOPP film, namely, lustre film, matte film and clear film. Matte BOPP is used to manufacture invisible tapes and has a hazy or slightly opaque finish while the clear BOPP tape is crystal clear with a haze factor of 2% or less. In both instances, the dispenser is designed to function with films of 1.0 Mil (25 microns) thickness. The total thickness of the product generally dispensed on the tape dispenser of the present invention is 2.0 Mil (50 microns), i.e., 1.0 Mil or 25 microns of BOPP film and 1.0 or 25 microns of adhesive.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Thus, in accordance with the present invention, a cutter assembly suitable for cutting BOPP adhesive tape and a tape dispenser incorporating the same is disclosed. The cutter assembly has a row of plastic teeth where each tooth includes left and right front and rear faces, each face being disposed on a different plane, and where the planes intersect each other at the tip of the tooth. A front edge extends between the left and right front faces; a rear edge extends between the left and right rear faces; a left side edge extends between the right front and rear faces; and a right side edge extends between the left front face and the right rear face. The various edges are set at particular angles relative to each other. A protrusion is provided rearwardly of the row to teeth to support a first region of the tape when a second region is being severed by the teeth. A braking mechanism is also provided on the dispenser to stop rotation of the tape roll during dispensing of the tape.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Specific aspects of the invention - each describing either essential or optional, but advantageous features of the invention -are:

Peripheral wall 26 is disposed generally at right angles to side wall and extends inwardly for a distance therefrom. Side wall 24 forms the side of first side member 12 and peripheral wall 26 forms a top, bottom, front and back wall thereof. Side wall 24 and peripheral wall 26 bound and define approximately one half of cavity 16.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figs. 1-3</figref>, side wall 24 of first side member 12 has an exterior surface 24a and an interior surface 24b. Exterior surface 24a is provided with a central region 28 that is substantially planar and suitable for positioning one of a forefinger and thumb of a user thereon. A cylindrical first axle portion 30 (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>) extends inwardly from interior surface 24b disposed opposite central region 28. First axle portion 30 is disposed generally at right angles to interior surface 24b. First axle portion 30 is of a first external diameter "A". First axle portion 30 comprises a perimeter wall 32 that originates proximate interior surface 24b of side wall 24 and extends outwardly therefrom, terminating in an outermost edge 32a. Perimeter wall 32 and the interior region 28a of central region 28 bound and define a cavity 34 therein. Perimeter wall 32 is not circumferentially continuous in that it defines four longitudinal slots 36 therein.

Reinforcing ridge 40 is disposed a short distance away from perimeter wall 32 of first axle portion 30 and is disposed substantially parallel thereto. A plurality of channels 42 is defined in first side member 12, with each channel 42 extending between the exterior and interior surfaces 24a, 24b of side wall 24. Each channel 24 radiates outwardly from proximate perimeter wall 32 in an arcuate fashion. Channels 42 are arranged in pairs, with each pair including a shorter arcuate channel 42a and a longer arcuate channel 42b. The pairs of channels 42 are radially spaced from each other. The channel pairs cut through ridge 40 and ridge 40 is absent from the region between the shorter and longer channels 42a, 32b of each pair.

Side wall 44 forms the side of second side member 14 and peripheral wall 46 forms a top, bottom, front and back portion of second side member 14. Side wall 44 and peripheral wall 46 bound and define approximately one half of cavity 16, with side wall 24 and peripheral wall 26 of first side member 12 bounding and defining the other half of cavity 16, as previously described and illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Side wall 44 of second side member 12 has an exterior surface 44a (<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>) and an interior surface 44b. Exterior surface 44a is substantially planar. A cylindrical second axle portion 48 extends outwardly from interior surface 44b of side wall 44. Second axle portion 48 includes a perimeter wall 50 that originates at interior surface 44b and terminates at an outermost end 50a. Perimeter wall 50 of second cylindrical axle portion 48 bounds and defines a bore 52 that is of a second diameter "B". Diameter "B" is greater than diameter "A" of first axle portion 30 and first axle portion 30 is able to be received within bore 52 of second axle portion 48 when first and second sides 12, 14 are joined together. A pair of<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> opposed apertures 54 are defined partially in side wall 44 and partially in perimeter wall 50. Depressions 53 are provided adjacent apertures 54 to aid in correctly positioning the user's finger or thumb during application of the brake mechanism, i.e., when the user compresses first and second side members 12, 14 toward each other. When first and second side members 12, 14 are engaged, detents 38 on first axle portion 30 are received through the apertures 54, specifically those portions of the apertures 54 defined on perimeter wall 50. This situation is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>. The interlocking engagement of detents 38 in apertures 54 holds first and second side members 12, 14 together. Detents 38 prevent first axle portion 30 and second axle portion 48 from accidentally disengaging from each other. It will be understood, however, that dispenser 10 may be manufactured so that first and second side members 12, 14 can be separated from each other to replace roll 18 when tape 22 thereon is finished. In that instance, it is possible to disengage detents 38 from apertures 54.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A plurality of ribs 56 extend longitudinally along an exterior surface of perimeter wall 50 from proximate interior surface 44b of side wall 44 to outermost end 50a.

When tape 22 is to be dispensed from roll 18, the user will pull a sufficient length of tape 22 from roll 18 and will then squeeze first and second side members 12, 14 together by compressing the central region 28 and side wall 44 opposite central region 28 toward each other between their thumb and forefinger. This compressive force causes first axle portion 30 to slide inwardly deeper into bore 52 of second axle portion 48 in the direction of arrow "C" (<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>). This movement causes hub 20 of roll 18 to be compressed between ridges 40 on the interior surface 24b of first side wall 24 proximate central region 28 and brake spokes 58, causing all rotational motion of roll 18 to cease. The length of tape 22 extending outwardly from the roll 18 at that point can be severed from roll 18 as will be hereinafter described.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, first side member 12 is generally comprised of a major side region 12a and a minor side region 12b and second side member 14 is comprised of a major side region 14a and a minor side region 14b.

When the desired length of tape 22 has been attained, the user applies pressure using their finger and thumb to first and second side members 12, 14 to engage the braking mechanism. As central region 28 is pushed inwardly, hub 20 of roll 18 is engaged by brake spokes 58. Brake spokes 58 cause rotation of roll 18 to cease. A portion of the tape rearwardly of teeth 62 rests on apex region 64a of protrusion 64 and adheres slightly thereto. Thus, the application of the braking mechanism in conjunction with the adhesion of tape 22 on protrusion 64 anchors tape 22 in an ideal position to be severed by teeth 62. The length of tape extending beyond teeth 62 is then pulled downwardly in the general direction of arrow "K". This downward movement brings the adhesive underside of tape 22 into contact with tips 72 of teeth 62. Tips 72 perforate tape 22 and as the downward movement continues, the initial perforations are expanded as tape 22 slides down along front, back, left side and right side edges 74-80 to the point that the length of tape is severed from the roll 18.
