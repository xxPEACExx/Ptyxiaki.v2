This interface for controlling such an online game does not render a same gaming experience as a real poke game or chess game where people are present around a table and play the game with real cards or real pieces which creates a more immersive and social experience.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Disadvantageously, currently in such system and method it is not possible to provide a first communications device of a plurality of communications devices with control of a second and/or further communications device of a plurality of communications devices where each remote communications devices of the plurality of communications devices is involved in the joint activity.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An objective of the present invention is to provide a method, a system, a related communications device and server device of the above known type but wherein the joint activity of the second or further communications devices can be controlled by a first communications device.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to the invention, this object is achieved by the method for supporting a joint activity of a plurality of remote communications devices according to claim 1, a related system according to claim 5, a related remote communications device according to claim 9, a related server device according to claim 10 and a related second remote communications device according to claim 14.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Indeed by a first communications device capturing the presence of physical objects of a real environment at the first communications device and a respective<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> motion of such physical objects which step is succeeded, possibly by a server device analyzing the presence of physical objects and the respective motion of these physical objects of the real environment captured and generating a 3-Dimensional representation of the real environment at the first communications device based on the analyzing of the presence of physical objects of a real environment and a respective motion of such physical objects at the first communications device captured and subsequently a real environment of the second communications device is augmented with the generated 3-Dimensional representation of the real environment at the first communications device and optionally a conflict resolution instruction for a communications device of the plurality of communications devices may be generated at least based on the analyzing of the physical objects of a real environment and a respective motion of such physical objects at the first communications device captured.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Hence based on the analysis of the captured physical objects of a real environment at the first communications device and a respective motion of such physical objects, a 3-Dimensional representation of the real environment at the first communications device is generated that in turn is applied for augmenting a real environment belonging to the second and/or further communications device.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Such <i>joint activity</i> may be a gaming activity like a chess game, a poke game or but alternatively may also include joint document processing collaborative painting or any other suitable shared activity.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Such <i>physical object</i> may be chess-piece in case of a chess game, be a, or alternatively a pen a finger or other object forming part of the real environment of a communications device.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Furthermore the step of <i>augmenting</i> is the enriching of the real environment of a second or further communications device with a virtual component being a 3 dimensional representation of the real environment of the first communications device.

For instance, in the GO game (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29), there is a conflict when a piece gets surrounded by a few pieces from the other partner.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In one of the poke games (there are many poke games with different rules.), the conflict could be that the current card is bigger than the previous one.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">A server device may generate a conflict resolution instruction and subsequently send a notification to one or more of the involved communications devices, depending on the situation, notifying that one of the pieces is defeated.

Subsequently a conflict resolution part may detect conflicts and provide corresponding instructions to users. The conflict resolution part further is adapted to calculate some potential confliction based on game rules.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">For instance in the GO game, once the system detects a group of black pieces is surrounded by a group of white pieces being a conflict in this situation, an instruction may be sent to both players indicating that all the black pieces should be removed. So the player with black pieces should manually remove those real black<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> pieces from the board. As a consequence, the virtual black pieces on the screen of the other player disappear.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Another characterizing embodiment of the present invention is disclosed in claim 3, claim 7 and claim 12.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The generating of a conflict resolution instruction additionally is based on at least one rule of the joint activity. For instance in case the joint activity is a game, rules of such games are to be taken into account in determining such instruction. Such rule may deal with the avoidance of a collision between actions taken or a status of each of the remote communications devices.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Rule1: In chess game, if there is a collision between two pieces, remove the previous piece in that location</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Rule 2: In the GO game, if a white piece gets surrounded by a group of black pieces, remove the white piece</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Rule 3: In one of the poke games, if the current card is bigger than the previous one, remove the previous card.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Another characterizing embodiment of the present invention is disclosed in claim 4, claim 8 and claim 13.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The generating of a conflict resolution instruction additionally is based on the analyzing of the physical objects and their respective motion of these physical objects of the real environment captured at a second or further communications device of the plurality of communications devices.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">It is to be noticed that the term 'comprising', used in the claims, should not be interpreted as being restricted to the means listed thereafter.

It means that with respect to the present invention, the only relevant components of the device are A and B.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Similarly, it is to be noticed that the term 'coupled', also used in the claims, should not be interpreted as being restricted to direct connections only. Thus, the scope of the expression 'a device A coupled to a device B' should not be limited to devices or systems wherein an output of device A is directly connected to an input of device B.

In the second paragraph, all connections between the before mentioned network elements and described functional parts are defined. In the succeeding paragraph the actual execution of the method for supporting a joint activity of a plurality of remote communication devices, is described.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">A first essential element of this embodiment of the present invention, as presented in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, is a first remote communications device CD1. Such first remote communications device may be any data communications device being coupled with or including means for detecting the presence and movement of physical objects of a real environment and a respective motion of such physical objects at said first communications device CD1 where these object for instance are gaming pieces, cards, dices, or a pencil, a finger or on another object forming part of such real environment of such first communications device CD1.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Applicable technologies for detecting motion and presence of such a physical object are RFID technology, MultiTouch Screens, camera's for capturing motion etc. When RFID technology is used, the presence and motion detection is based on the decoupling of an RFID tag (a piece) from a previous location (reader) and the couple of the tag with a new location. The decoupling refers to move away and the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> coupling means arriving at. If Multi Touch Technology is applied, the similar principal is used to detect the movement of pieces.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">A further essential element of the present invention is a Server device SD that is able to deal with centrally processing of the detected motion of the physical objects of a real environment at the first communications device CD1 and subsequently taking care of generating a 3-Dimensional representation of the real environment at the second and/or further communications device and optionally being adapted to handle conflict resolution being the, in case of a conflict situation, generating of a conflict resolution instruction for a communications device of the plurality of communications devices at least based on the analyzing of the physical objects of a real environment and a respective motion of such physical objects at the first communications device captured.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">A further essential element of the present invention is a second or further remote Communications device CD2 which device is adapted to augment the real environment of this second or further communications device with the 3-Dimensional representation of the real environment at the first communications device. Such augmenting of the real environment of such second or further communications device may be applied with a module adapted to show a virtual object e.g. a chess piece in 3D. The 3-Dimensional model of the object can be derived in two ways. It can be a pre-stored 3D model or it can be a reconstructed 3D model where the 3D model is reconstructed based on the camera input.

Both the chess board of the first communications device CD1 and the chess board of the second communications device CD2 are in this embodiment assumed to be a Multi-Touch Table. The chess board belonging to the first communications device CD1 is equipped with black chess pieces only and the chess board belonging to the second communications device CD2 is equipped with white chess pieces only.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">During the chess game, one player only moves white chess pieces and the second player only moves the black chess pieces.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Further, the capturing part CP of the first communications device CD1 is implemented with a camera for capturing the presence and motion of the chess pieces located on the chess board belonging to the first communications device CD1.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Alternatively, the first communications device CD1 may be equipped with a capturing part CP being the multi-touch screen where the location and motion of each of the chess pieces is detected based on the touching of the pieces at the screen.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Hence the camera or a plurality of camera's capture the physical objects of a real environment, i.e. the black chess pieces on the chess board belonging to communications device CD1 and a additionally capture a motion of each of such chess pieces.

Subsequently the interfacing part IP1 receives the capture signal and provides the analysis part AP of the server device SD with the capture signal from communications device CD1. The analysis part AP upon receipt analyzes the capture signal, i.e. the signal representing the physical objects of a real environment of the first communications device which are the black chess pieces on the chess board and additionally their motion on the chess board. Based on the analysis of the capture signal, the analysis part AP constructs a three dimensional, further referred to as 3-D, virtual representation of the black chess pieces on the chess board belonging to the first communications device CD1.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Subsequently, the 3-dimensional representation generating part 3DGP generates a 3D representation of the real environment at the first communications device CD1 that is based on the analyzing of the physical objects of a real environment and a respective motion of such physical objects at the first communications device CD1 captured. A signal representing the three dimensional virtual representation of the black chess pieces on the chess board belonging to the first communications device CD1 is sent by means of the interfacing part IP1 towards the second communications device CD2. The interfacing part of the second communications device CD2 receives the signal representing the three dimensional virtual representation of the black chess pieces on the chess board belonging to the first communications device CD1 and hands the signal over to the augmenting part AUP that in turn augments the real environment of the second communications device CD2 with the three dimensional virtual representation of the black chess pieces on the chess board belonging to the first communications device CD1. The augmenting is performed by presenting realistically three dimensional virtual representation of the black chess pieces on the chess board belonging to the first communications device CD1 at the chess board belonging to the second communications device in complementing the present white chess pieces on the chess board belonging to the second communications device with the three dimensional virtual representation of the black chess pieces on the chess board belonging to the first communications device CD1.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">This realistic presentation of the three dimensional virtual representation of the black chess pieces on the chess board belonging to the first communications device CD1 in augmentation of the real white chess pieces on the chess board belonging to the second communications device may involve many different kind of technologies. For instance the virtual chess board can not only be displayed on a MTT 3D screen, but also on a projector screen. In that case both players have to wear 3D glasses to obtain the 3D effect. Alternatively goggle technologies instead of the MTT 3D screen can be applied as well. The virtual chess board can also be displayed on a 3D screen so that players without 3D glasses can also have a 3D view.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Additionally, based on the analysis of the capture signal the analysis part AP may detect a conflict caused by a movement of a chess piece where subsequently are found two pieces in the same location i.e. a virtual black chess piece and a real white chess piece (on the chess board belonging to the second communications<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> device). As long as the motion detection module detects a chess piece is moving onto a position where there is already a chess piece present, a collision is detected. It means the new corner is going to kill the old inhabitant in case of the chess game. Hence, further the conflict resolution part CRP, generates a conflict resolution instruction for the relevant communications device, i.e. the communications device CD2 at least based on the before described analysis by means of the analysis part AP of communications device CD1 that analyzed the chess pieces and their position on the chess board belonging to the first communications device movement physical objects of a real environment and a respective motion of such physical objects at said first communications device CD1 captured.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The motion of the black chess piece onto a location of a virtual white chess piece means that the newcomer (black chess piece) is going to kill the old inhabitant (virtual white chess piece) in case of a chess game. Hence the conflict resolution part CRP generates an instruction saying which white chess piece is killed. Then the real white chess piece is to be removed by the player.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Next the player at the second communications device CD2 is to make a move with a white real chess piece. The camera or a plurality of camera's present at the second communications device CD2 in turn capture the physical objects of a real environment, i.e. the white chess pieces on the chess board belonging to communications device CD2 and a additionally capture a motion of each of such chess pieces.
