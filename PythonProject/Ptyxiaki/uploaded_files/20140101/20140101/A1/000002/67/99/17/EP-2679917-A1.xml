Said known system has a pump, powered by an electric motor, which makes the water circulate in a closed circuit generated between a storage tank and heat exchanging pipes, placed in said fireplace. A thermostat control system automatically starts said pump as soon as it detects the reaching of a certain actual water heating temperature; in the same moment in which the water temperature inside said tank reaches a certain pre-determined maximum threshold, said thermostat determines said pump to stop and at the same time the opening of a exhaust valve, so obtaining the rapid discharge of the heated water from said pipes.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, the structure of said know system results of difficult realization and standardization and also requires, for its installation and following maintenance, rather invasive construction operations.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Adding to this, said know system presents evident limitations that do not allow the heat storage at temperatures higher than the water boiling one, and require automated means that, once detected the reaching of a temperature close to the water boiling one, determine the opening of apposite exhaust valves of said fluid, in order to obtain its flowing out.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">On the other hand, the structure of said know system is inevitably complex, of difficult assembly and almost expensive.
