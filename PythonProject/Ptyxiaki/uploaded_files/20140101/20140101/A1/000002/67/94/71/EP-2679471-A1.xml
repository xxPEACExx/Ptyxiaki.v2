Moreover, liquid that ingresses inside the cowl portion through the cowl louver may be guided toward the vehicle forward side by the guide plate.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The plural screen plates are joined by the guide plate. That is, the plural screen plates and the guide plate are made integral. Therefore, a number of components is smaller than in a structure in which plural screen plates and a guide plate are respectively separate bodies.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In a second aspect of the present invention, in the first aspect, at least a portion of each of the plural screen plates, at at least one of an upper side portion and a lower side portion relative to a boundary between the screen plate and the guide plate, is an inclined portion that is inclined from a vertical direction.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Accordingly, the inclined portion is inclined such that the inclination angle thereof increases when a load acts on the screen plate from vertically upward thereof. Thus, an impact of the load may be absorbed.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In a third aspect of the present invention, in the second aspect, the inclined portion includes: an upper inclined portion at the upper side relative to a region of the boundary; and a lower inclined portion at the lower side relative to the region of the boundary, the lower inclined portion being inclined in a different direction from the upper inclined portion, and a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> low-stiffness portion, at which the screen plate is locally low in stiffness, is provided between the upper inclined portion and the lower inclined portion.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Thus, the screen plate is in a shape that is inflected at the boundary region. This screen plate deforms so as to inflect further at the boundary region (the angle in the inflection becomes smaller) when a load acts on the shield plate from vertically upward thereof. Thus, the impact of the load may be more efficiently absorbed.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In a fourth aspect of the present invention, in the first aspect, each of the plural screen plates is flat and is disposed to be inclined with respect to a vertical direction.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Thus, when a load acts on the screen plate from vertically upward thereof, the whole screen plate inclines further while keeping the flat shape. Thus, an impact of the load may be absorbed.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In a fifth aspect of the present invention, in any one of the first to fourth aspects, the guide plate includes a weakened portion at which a bending strength of the guide plate with respect to a load from a vehicle outer side is reduced.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Thus, when a load acts on the guide plate from the vehicle outer side, the guide plate deforms by bending in accordance with the weakened portion at which the bending strength of the guide plate is reduced. Thus, an impact of the load may be absorbed.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In a sixth aspect of the present invention, in the fifth aspect, the weakened portion is a reduced plate thickness portion at which the guide plate is locally reduced in thickness along an up-and-down direction.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Thus, the weakened portion may be provided with a simple structure in which the weakened portion is simply formed along the up-and-down direction of the guide plate.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In a seventh aspect of the present invention, in the fifth aspect or the sixth aspect,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the weakened portion is plurally provided, the weakened portions being spaced apart in a vehicle width direction.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Because the weakened

automobile cowl structure 12 according to a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention is employed, in a perspective view. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> show the cowl portion 14 in sectional views taken along, e width direction is indicated by arrow W, and an upward direction is indicated by arrow UP.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the cowl portion 14 includes a cowl louver 18, which is disposed at the forward side of a front windshield 16 of the automobile. A plural number of inlet holes 20 are formed at predetermined positions of the cowl louver 18. Outside air may enter into the cowl portion 14 through these inlet holes 20.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A cowl outer 22 is disposed at the lower side of the front windshield 16. A cowl inner 24 is disposed at the lower side of the cowl outer 22. A cowl front 28 is disposed at the lower side of the cowl louver 18, at the forward side of a cowl lower 26.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The cowl portion 14 according to the present exemplary embodiment includes the cowl outer 22, the cowl inner 24 and the cowl front 28. The cowl portion 14 is covered by the cowl louver 18 from diagonally forward and upward thereof.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">An aperture that penetrates through the cowl lower 26 in a plate thickness<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> direction (a vehicle front-and-rear direction) is formed in the cowl lower 26. A duct member 31 is attached to the cowl lower 26 at a position at the upper side of this aperture. A duct aperture portion 30 is structured by this duct member and the aperture. As indicated by arrow F1, the outside air entering through the inlet holes 20 flows through this duct aperture portion 30 into the vehicle cabin.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, an example in which the duct aperture portion 30 opens downward is presented. However, a structure in which the duct aperture portion 30 opens to a vehicle direction is possible.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, a screen member structural body 32 is disposed inside the cowl portion 14. The screen member structural body 32 includes two screen plates 34A and 34B, which are provided standing inside the cowl portion 14, and a guide plate 38 between the screen plates 34A and 34B. The guide plate 38 is connected to each of the screen plates 34A and 34B, and thus joins the screen plates 34A and 34B to one another.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The screen plate 34A features an operation of impeding flows of air in the vehicle width direction and thus preventing, for example, high-temperature air that enters from an engine compartment 40 from ingressing into the vehicle cabin through the duct aperture portion 30, or the like. The engine compartment 40 is an example of a power plant compartment relating to the present invention. For example, in an electric automobile, the power plant compartment is a compartment in which a motor for driving is accommodated.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The guide plate 38 covers the duct aperture portion 30 from upward and forward thereof. The guide plate 38 guides a liquid such as water entering into the cowl portion 14 or the like such that the liquid does not ingress into the duct aperture portion 30.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In particular, the guide plate 38 according to the present exemplary embodiment is<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> disposed at the forward side at the lower side of the front windshield 16, and is formed in a shape that as a whole is inclined diagonally forward and downward. Thus, the guide plate 38 may cause water that has flowed down the surface of the front windshield 16 to flow diagonally forward and downward.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The guide plate 38 is disposed so as to cover the duct aperture portion 30 as viewed from the inlet holes 20 of the cowl louver 18.

Each of the screen plates 34A and 34B includes an upper inflected portion 36U, at the upper side relative to a boundary 44 with the guide plate 38, and a lower inflected portion 36L at the lower side of the same.

Thus, the screen member structural body 32 is structured. That is, the screen plates 34A and 34B and the guide plate 38 are made integral. Therefore, a number of components is smaller than in a structure in which the screen plates 34A and 34B and the guide plate 38 are respectively separate bodies.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In addition, because the screen plates 34A and 34B and the guide plate 38 are integral, the screen plates 34A and 34B and the guide plate 38 may be disposed at predetermined positions inside the cowl portion 14 simply by the integrated screen member structural body 32 being placed in the cowl portion 14.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Thus, in the automobile cowl structure 12 according to the present exemplary embodiment, assembly of the screen plates 34A and 34B and the guide plate 38 to the cowl portion 14 is easier than with a structure in which the screen plates 34A and 34B and the guide plate 38 are respectively separate bodies. Moreover, the number of components is<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> smaller than in a structure in which the screen plates 34A and 34B and the guide plate 38 are respectively separate bodies. Therefore, the automobile cowl structure 12 may be structured at low cost.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In a structure in which the screen plates 34A and 34B are separately disposed in the cowl portion 14, there is a need to engage the screen plates 34A and 34B with clips or the like in order to prevent the screen plates 34A and 34B from tipping over. In contrast, when the two screen plates 34A and 34B are joined and integrated as in the present exemplary embodiment, the screen member structural body 32 has a predetermined overall length in the vehicle width direction. Therefore, the screen plates 34A and 34B may be disposed so as not to tip over simply by the screen member structural body 32 being placed in the cowl portion 14.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In the screen member structural body 32, the guide plate 38 is retained between the screen plates 34A and 34B. Therefore, the guide plate 38 may be reliably retained at a predetermined position. Thus, a state in which the guide plate 38 is disposed upward and forward of the duct aperture portion 30 may be maintained. Therefore, liquids such as water flowing down from the front windshield 16, high-pressure washing water entering through the inlet holes 20 or the like may be effectively impeded from reaching the duct aperture portion 30.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">A liquid such as rainwater or the like flows down from the front windshield 16 to the guide plate 38. This liquid moves along the vehicle width direction on the guide plate 38 while flowing downward as illustrated by arrow F3 in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. The liquid is then drained through the cowl front 28 and the like.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In particular, in the present exemplary embodiment the whole area of the duct<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> aperture portion 30 as viewed from above may be covered by the guide plate 38. Therefore, even though the inlet holes 20 are formed in the cowl louver 18 at positions above the duct aperture portion 30, entry of liquids through the duct aperture portion 30 may be suppressed. In addition, because the inlet holes 20 are formed at positions above the duct aperture portion 30, a structure in which air may be efficiently introduced may be realized.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In the present exemplary embodiment, the guide plate 38 may be disposed at a predetermined position without being welded to the cowl louver 18 or the like. Therefore, a spacing between the guide plate 38 and the cowl louver 18 may be assuredly wider than in a structure in which the guide plate 38 is welded to the cowl louver 18. Hence, amounts of water that can be guided by the guide plate 38 may be assuredly larger.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In a structure in which the guide plate 38 is welded to the cowl louver 18, there is a need for the guide plate 38 to be locally protruded upward at a welded portion, and for a distal end of the protrusion to be welded to the cowl louver 18. However, because this welding portion is protruded upward, it acts as a dam when a liquid is flowing down. That is, it is difficult to guide water downward on the guide plate past the protrusion portion (the welded portion). Consequently, while flowing down the guide plate, the liquid may spill over from the two length direction ends of the guide plate 38 at positions close to the duct aperture portion 30. In contrast, in the present exemplary embodiment there is no need to provide an upward protrusion portion for welding at the guide plate 38. Therefore, a liquid flowing down on the guide plate 38 is not obstructed by a protrusion portion. Therefore, the liquid may be guided to front end positions of the guide plate 38, that is, positions that are distant from the duct aperture portion 30.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Furthermore, because there is no need to specify positions for welding the guide<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> plate 38 to the cowl louver 18, there are fewer restrictions on positions and shapes in which the inlet holes 20 are formed. For example, the inlet holes 20 may be formed at positions such that outside air may be more efficiently introduced.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In the automobile cowl structure 12 according to the present exemplary embodiment, both of the screen plates 34A and 34B are inflected at up-and-down direction middle portions thereof (the boundaries 44). In addition, the trough portion 36T is formed at each boundary 44. Thus, the stiffness of the screen plate 34A or 34B is locally reduced. Therefore, if an impact F4 is applied from the upper side as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> and a load acts on the screen plate 34A or the screen plate 34B, the screen plate 34A or screen plate 34B buckles at the boundary 44.
