For this reason, such a patient with a hemorrhoid disease is highly interested in toilet paper, which is improved in a wiping property, bulkiness, a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> moisture-retaining property, softness, and a surface lubrication property, so that he or she desires products satisfying these properties.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Further, the toilet paper is used not only after excretion, but also after urination for particularly a woman's cleaning operation. Here, since the woman's cleaning operation after urination is performed while the paper contacts a sensitive pubic region, there is a latent demand for toilet paper with a moisture-retaining property and softness.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Here, the toilet paper can be applied with chemicals which improve the characteristics such as a moisture-retaining property (wetness hand feel), flexibility (softness hand feel), and a surface lubrication property (smoothness hand feel).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, the conventional toilet rolls applied with chemicals are expensive with low productivity. Further, the toilet roll is not sufficiently improved in all the characteristics and does not satisfy the user's demand.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">For this reason, the conventional toilet roll products applied with chemicals have not been widely used.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Generally, in a conventional toilet roll, a paper roll manufactured by a paper manufacturing machine is conveyed to a winder and is rewound with the diameter of the toilet roll in the winder so as to manufacture a log<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> having a width plural times or more a toilet roll width, and the log is cut into the toilet roll width so as to manufacture the toilet roll. In a case of manufacturing multi-ply products, continuous sheets reeled out from a plurality of paper rolls are multi-plied before the rewinding in the winder.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Then, a method for manufacturing the toilet roll applied with chemicals is disclosed in, for example, Patent Literatures 1 to 3 below.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In a technique of Patent Literature 1, steel-rubber embossing is performed when manufacturing a log from a paper roll set in a winder, chemicals are applied to embossing convex portions of a convex embossing roll, and the chemicals are transferred to a continuous sheet reeled out from the paper roll.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">However, in the technique of Patent Literature 1, since the chemicals are applied only by the tips of the embossing convex portions to the continuous sheet, the amount of applied chemicals is small. Further, there is a concern that the chemicals may not be applied to an embossing concave surface. For this reason, it is difficult to sufficiently improve the surface lubrication property and the moisture-retaining property. Further, since chemicals applying process in which the paper strength is the lowest, and the embossing process, in which<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the continuous sheet are nipped with a predetermined pressure, are performed at the same time, paper breakage may be easily occurred and hence these processes need to be performed at a low speed. For this reason, it is difficult to improve the productivity.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Meanwhile, in a technique of Patent Literature 2, embossing is performed when manufacturing a log from a paper roll set in a winder and chemicals are applied in spraying.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">However, even in the technique of Patent Literature 2, since the log is manufactured immediately after applying the chemicals, the chemicals tend to spread in the sheet after manufacturing the log, and hence there is a disadvantage that the log tends to loose the shape and deviate in winding due to stretching of the sheet caused by stretching of crepe. Particularly, since the log is cut, at a post stage, into a toilet roll, once the log deviates in winding or looses the shape, which causes defective toilet roll products, this means the yield is degraded, leading to low productivity.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Further, as in Patent Literature 1, since the log is manufactured immediately after the chemicals application applying process, the tension control is difficult, paper breakage may be easily occurred on forming perforation lines on the sheet and the tension of the continuous sheet<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> is decreased, thereby the processing speed needs to be decreased. Accordingly, the productivity cannot be improved.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Further, in the technique of Patent Literature 2, since the chemicals are applied particularly by spray application after the embossing, the embossing may easily loose shape thereof. Furthermore, the amount of the ejected chemicals is limited because of the spraying in the winder, so, if the operation would not be performed at a low speed, the amount of applied chemicals to the continuous sheet would be insufficient, which leads inevitably to low productivity.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In a technique of Patent Literature 3, embossed crepe paper is obtained as base paper for toilet paper products. Here, continuous sheets are reeled out from a plurality of paper rolls; multi-ply forming is performed on continuous sheets, chemicals are applied to these multi-ply continuous sheets, water is further sprayed thereto so that the sheets become wet sheets, and embossing is performed on the sheets. Then, the respective multi-ply continuous sheets are separated before the rewinding.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">However, in the technique of Patent Literature 3, since water is sprayed before the embossing, the embossing is performed before the continuous sheet is sufficiently impregnated with the chemicals or the water. For this<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> reason, the chemicals, which are not impregnated yet into the surface of the continuous sheet, tend to adhere to a convex embossing roll and a receiving roll used for the embossing. Since this condition may cause the tearing of the sheet and stop of the manufacturing line for a cleaning operation, the productivity cannot be improved.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">It is known that if oily chemicals are used for application, decrease of paper strength can be suppressed, and a toilet roll, which uses such oily chemicals, is also known. In such a toilet roll, the surface lubrication property can be sufficiently improved, but the moisture-retaining property is not sufficient. This is because, the oily chemicals are, among chemicals, known to unlikely to be impregnated into sheet layers. Further, for the toilet roll which uses oily chemicals, it is difficult to obtain the water disintegration property necessary for the toilet roll.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0020" num="0020"><ul><li>Patent Literature 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP11323787A"><text>JP 11-323787 A</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Literature 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2009183411A"><text>JP 2009-183411 A</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Literature 3: <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2007015379A"><text>JP 2007-15379 A</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">Therefore, it is a main object of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> invention to provide a method for manufacturing toilet roll products that sufficiently improve a moisture-retaining property (wetness hand feel), flexibility (softness hand feel), and a surface lubrication property (smoothness hand feel) while sufficiently ensuring a performance such as a water disintegration property necessary for toilet paper and that is manufactured with good productivity.

Advantageous Effects of Invention</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In the present invention, a continuous sheet is applied with chemicals in a ply machine and is wound once to manufacture a secondary paper roll, and then a log is manufactured in a winder.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">A ply machine is often used to manufacture two-ply (two-layer) or multi-ply tissue paper.<br/>
However, on manufacturing toilet rolls, even if they are two-ply products, it is normal that a log is manufactured while multi-ply forming is performed in a winder and it is unusual that a winding process is performed purposely and separately for example in a ply machine.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In contrast, in the present invention, such a ply machine is used purposely, precisely, it is designed that the secondary paper roll to be supplied to the winder is<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> continuously manufactured from a primary paper roll obtained by manufacturing and winding a paper sheet in the ply machine and a chemicals applying unit is provided inside the ply machine so as to apply chemicals to the continuous sheet for manufacturing the secondary paper roll applied with the chemicals.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Accordingly, first, as a first advantage attained by using the ply machine, in a manufacturing factory equipped with a toilet roll manufacturing facility and a tissue paper product facility, a part of a toilet roll manufacturing line and a general tissue paper manufacturing line can be commonly used. In this case, there is advantageously no need to provide another chemicals applying unit for the toilet roll. Accordingly, the above advantage enables space-saving with low facility investment.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Further, even when an existing ply machine is not provided with a chemicals applying unit, only minor modification of the existing ply machine is required instead of the great modification, resulting in another advantage of less facility investment.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Meanwhile, in a case where toilet roll products applied with chemicals are manufactured through manufacturing of a secondary paper roll applied with the chemicals in a ply machine, since the secondary paper roll is obtained by winding the multi-ply continuous sheets<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> applied with the chemicals like annual growth rings, the chemicals diffuse with time into inner layers of the multi-ply-sheet from the secondary paper roll and between the multi-ply continuous sheets contacting mutually in the state of the secondary paper roll. Further, it is possible to ensure transfer period to processing treatment in the winder or intentional seasoning time, leading to the uniform diffusion of chemicals inside the multi-ply continuous sheet.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Thus, in the winder, on forming of a perforation line, although which originally degrades paper strength but is necessary for the toilet roll, there is little difference part to part in the continuous sheet, which enables stable operation and improved manufacturing speed in the winder.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">However, particularly when water-based chemicals are used, the chemicals diffuse in sheets. In this case, paper strength is degraded and uniform diffusion of the chemicals cannot be attained shortly.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Further, since the diffusion of the chemicals, the moisture absorbing to the sheet, and the growth of the crepe of the sheet are sufficiently performed at the secondary paper roll, for the log manufactured by winging with the winder, it is unlikely to cause an adverse effect such as deviating in winding, loosing shape and the like,<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> which would be caused by the diffusion of the chemicals, the moisture absorbing to the sheet, and the growth of the crepe of the sheet. For this reason, even when the log is manufactured by winding the toilet paper having a comparatively short length so as to have a predetermined diameter in a form of a so-called loosely wound manner, it is unlikely to cause deviating in winding, loosing shape resulting in stable operation with low incidence of defective log.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Meanwhile, in the present invention, it is possible to manufacture the embossed toilet roll. Such embossing can be performed by the ply machine or by the winder.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In a case of forming of the embossing by the ply machine, the embossing may be rapidly and stably performed without a perforation line applying unit. In a case of forming of the embossing by the winder, the embossing may be performed while the chemicals are uniformly diffused. In either case, it is possible to further rapidly and stably perform the embossing in the toilet roll applied with the chemicals than ever before.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Particularly, in a case of performing of the embossing by the ply machine, since the embossing is performed on the multi-ply continuous sheet with a relatively strong tensile strength, it is advantageous in that the ply machine may be operated at a high speed.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> Further, even in a case of double embossing, if one surface is applied with the chemicals, it is possible to reduce degradation in the paper strength, which would be caused by the application of the chemicals, and high speed of embossing can be sufficiently attained. In the manner where such double embossing is performed, it is possible to manufacture the multi-ply continuous sheet which is thick and bulky, resulting in advantageous texture.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Meanwhile, in a case of performing of the embossing by the winder, since the secondary paper roll applied with the chemicals is used, it is possible to perform the embossing while the chemicals are uniformly diffused inside the sheet. Then, it is possible to reliably perform the embossing without any unevenness and to ensure the stable production with a high speed.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Meanwhile, in the present invention, a single-ply secondary paper roll may be manufactured without operating the multi-ply forming unit in the ply machine. Then, the log may be manufactured by performing multi-ply forming on a plurality of the secondary paper rolls in the winder. Alternatively, the log may be manufactured in the winder in a non-multi-ply state. Even in these cases, it is advantageous in that the secondary paper roll can be rapidly manufactured in the ply machine. Further, in a case of performing the embossing in the winder, since the<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> secondary paper roll applied with the chemicals is used, it is possible to perform the embossing while the chemicals are uniformly diffused into the sheet and to reliably perform the embossing without any unevenness. That is, the products can be manufactured stably and at a high speed.</p><heading id="h0025">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0054" num="0054"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.

Then, the wet paper W is conveyed to a felt 33F of a press part 33 and is dewatered by being nipped between a pair of dewatering rolls 34 and 35 (dewatering process).</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Subsequently, the dewatered wet paper W is attached to a surface of a Yankee dryer 36 so as to be dried. Then, the dried paper was separated therefrom with a doctor blade 37 so as to be dry base paper S1 (single-sheet from the primary paper roll as described later) with crepe (drying process).</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Then, the dry base paper S1 is wound by a winding unit 38 with a winding drum 39 so that the rear surface of the dry base paper S1 faces the shaft of the primary paper roll JR (the rear surface thereof becomes the inner winding surface) and becomes the primary paper roll JR (primary paper winding process).</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The primary paper roll JR has the diameter of substantially 1000 to 5000 mm, the length (width) of 1500 to 9200 mm, and the winding length of 5000 to 80000 m,<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> although they may change depending on performance of paper manufacturing machine X1.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Furthermore, a calendering step (not illustrated) may be provided, for the dry base paper S1, which has been separated by the doctor blade 37 provided at a previous stage of the primary paper winding process, so that the front and rear surfaces are smoothened.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Here, the rear surface of the dry base paper S1 indicates a surface opposite to a surface contacting a cylinder of the Yankee dryer 36. Furthermore, although depending on the existence or non-existence of the calendering process, it can be considered that the front surface contacting the Yankee dryer that generally has a mirror surface is smoother with better surface property.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Here, the single-sheet S1 from the primary paper roll which defines the primary paper roll JR is to be processed into toilet paper 1 later, and the basis weight thereof is substantially equal to the basis weight of the toilet paper as final products. Specifically, by taking this into consideration, a basis weight of the single-sheet S1 from the primary paper roll is 10 to 25 g/m<sup>2</sup>, desirably 12 to 20 g/m<sup>2</sup>, more desirably 13 to 18 g/m<sup>2</sup> according to JIS P 8124. A basis weight less than 10 g/m<sup>2</sup> is preferable from the viewpoint of improving the paper in softness but makes it difficult to provide a sufficient strength<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> properly for practical use and to perform the rewinding (log manufacturing) in the winder provided at a post stage. Meanwhile, a basis weight of more than 25 g/m<sup>2</sup> makes the toilet paper too hard with deteriorated hand feel.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Further, the paper thickness (measured by a dial thickness gauge manufactured by Ozaki.

A crepe ratio of smaller than 10% causes easily paper breakage in processing treatment provided at a post stage, and the resultant toilet paper does not stretch sufficiently with small rigidity. Meanwhile, a crepe ratio of more than 30% makes it difficult to control tension in the processing treatment and causes easily paper breakage and makes the manufactured toilet paper deteriorate in an appearance due to formed wrinkles.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Here, the crepe ratio is expressed by the following equation. <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mi>Crepe ratio</mi><mo>:</mo><mfenced open="{" close="}" separators=""><mfenced><mi>peripheral speed of a dryer at paper manufacturing</mi></mfenced><mo>-</mo><mfenced><mi>peripheral speed of a reel in a winding unit</mi></mfenced></mfenced><mo>/</mo><mfenced><mi>peripheral speed of the dryer at paper manufacturing</mi></mfenced><mo>×</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">100</mn></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="145" he="32" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --></p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Further, the dry tensile strength (hereinafter, referred to as also a dry paper strength) of the single-sheet S1 from the primary paper roll in the longitudinal direction specified by JIS P 8113 is set to 300 to 900 cN/25 mm, desirably 350 to 800 cN/25 mm, and particularly desirably 400 to 700 cN/25 mm in a case of two plies. Meanwhile, the dry tensile strength in the transverse direction is set to 100 to 400 cN/25 mm, desirably 130 to 350 cN/25 mm, and particularly desirably 150 to 300 cN/25 mm in a case of two plies. Too low dry tensile strength of the base causes easily trouble such as paper breakage, stretching and the like at paper manufacturing and during use. Meanwhile, too high dry tensile strength deteriorates paper hand feel represented by softness hand feel.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">The paper strength can be adjusted as appropriate by known methods for example, by adding a dry paper strength enhancer to paper materials or wet paper; by decreasing freeness of paper materials (for example, to 30 to 40 ml or so); by increasing combination ratio of NBKP in raw material pulp (for example, to 50% or more); and by appropriately combining the above manners.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Furthermore, as the dry paper strength enhancer, starch, polyacrylamide, CMC (carboxymethylcellulose) and as salts thereof, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, carboxymethylcellulose calcium, carboxymethylcellulose zinc,<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> or the like may be used. As the wet paper strength enhancer, polyamide-polyamine-epichlorohydrin resin, urea resin, melamine resin acid colloid, thermal cross-linking polyacrylamide agent and the like may be used.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">In a case of adding the dry paper strength enhancer, an amount of addition may be set to about 0.5 to 1.0 kg/t as the weight ratio with respect to pulp slurry.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">Since the toilet paper needs to be disintegrated in water, it is desirable that the wet paper strength agent be not added or be added by a small amount. However, in a case of adding the wet paper strength agent, this agent conducts an advantageous action in manufacturing the log in the winder provided at the post stage. In consideration of this advantageous point, the agent may be added by a small amount, that is, 5 kg/t or less as the weight ratio with respect to the pulp slurry.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">A paper material, which becomes a raw material of the primary paper roll (the primary paper sheet), will be explained below. The paper material is obtained by adding appropriate chemicals to slurry (pulp slurry) mainly having pulp as a fiber raw material.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">In the present invention, the raw material pulp is not particularly limited, and appropriate raw material pulp used for the toilet paper may be selected for use.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">It is preferable that raw material pulp is a<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> combination of NBKP and LBKP. It is possible to blend recycled pulp, however, a mixture of only NBKP and LBKP of virgin pulp is preferable in terms of the favorable compatibility with lotion chemicals in accordance with the present invention, appropriate manufacturing of the log in the winder and desirable hand feel of the resultant tissue paper. In this case, the mixture ratio (JIS P 8120) is NBKP: LBKP = 20: 80 to 80: 20, in particular desirably NBKP: LBKP = 30: 70 to 60: 40.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">As the chemicals added to the paper material, there are a peeling agent, an adhesive agent, a pH adjuster such as caustic soda, a mucilaginous agent, an antifoaming agent, an antiseptic agent, a slime control agent, a dying agent, and the like may be exemplified other than the above dry paper strength agent and the wet paper strength agent.

Here, the multi-ply forming unit 51 includes a pair of nipping rolls and performs multi-ply forming on and nips the respective single-sheets S11, S12 from the primary paper rolls so that the respective single-sheets from the primary paper rolls are multi-plied and integrated.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Furthermore, in the example illustrated in the drawing, the single-sheets S11 and S12 from the primary paper rolls reeled out of the respective primary paper rolls JR and JR are supplied to the multi-ply forming unit 51 so that the surfaces thereof become the surfaces of the multi-ply continuous sheet S2 (here, the "surfaces" of the multi-ply continuous sheet indicate the front and rear surfaces of the multi-ply continuous sheet S2 as the outer surfaces thereof). The rear surfaces of the single-sheets S11 and S12 from the primary paper rolls may respectively become the surfaces of the multi-ply continuous sheet S2. Then, any one of the rear surfaces of the single-sheets S11 and S12 from the primary paper rolls may become the surface<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> of the multi-ply continuous sheet S2, and the other rear surface thereof may become the surface of the multi-ply continuous sheet S2. However, since the front surfaces of the primary paper sheets S11 and S12 contact the surface of the Yankee dryer during the drying process, the front surfaces are less fuzzy, smoother and better sensation of touch than the rear surfaces. For this reason, it is desirable to define the front and rear surfaces of the multi-ply continuous sheet S2 by the front surfaces of the single-sheets from the primary paper rolls (the dry base papers S1).</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Further, in the example illustrated in the drawing, two primary paper rolls JR are set and a so-called two-ply continuous sheet is wound.

Furthermore, a configuration may be employed in which the front and rear installation positions of the multi-ply forming unit 51 and the chemicals applying unit 53 are switched, the chemicals are applied to the respective single-sheets S11 and S12<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> from the primary paper rolls, and after that, the single-sheets from the primary paper rolls applied with the chemicals are multi-plied on each other.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">In order to apply the chemicals onto the multi-ply continuous sheet S2 in the ply machine X2, the chemicals applying unit 53 may employ flexographic printing, spray application, inkjet printing, or the like. However, the flexographic printing is suitable, because in flexographic printing, high-speed performance of the ply machine X2 can be handled, a printing plate cylinder is flexible, high-speed operation can be ensured, scattering of the chemicals can be prevented, and amount of applied material can be adjusted. Further, the spray application, the inkjet printing, and curtain coating as non-contact application where the chemicals are applied directly onto the paper surface without using a printing plate cylinder or the like are desirable in that paper thickness is not decreased since the printing plate cylinder or the like does not contact the paper surface. However, in the non-contact application, uniform application and adjustment of an amount of applied chemicals may not be performed rapidly compared to roll transfer type applying unit such as flexographic printing. Further, in an embodiment where embossing is performed, as discussed later, such disadvantage becomes noticeable. Accordingly, in the<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> present invention, the roll transfer type is desirable, and the flexographic printing is the most desirable from the general viewpoint.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">The number of the chemicals applying unit 53 may be either one or plural. In the example illustrated in the drawing, the embodiment is shown where two doctor chamber type flexographic printers 53A and 53B are provided so as to apply the chemicals to both outer surfaces of the multi-ply continuous sheet S2. In a case where a plurality of chemicals applying unit 53 are provided, the plurality of chemicals applying unit may be provided in parallel in the horizontal direction, the vertical direction, or the inclination direction or may be provided by combining these installation directions including the horizontal direction. When the plurality of chemicals applying unit are provided in parallel in the horizontal direction, the embracing angle can be set to be small, and hence the processing speed can be increased.

In order to uniformly spray the chemicals with respect to the width direction of the multi-ply-sheet from the secondary paper roll, nozzle diameter, number of nozzles, nozzle arrangement pattern, and number of arranged nozzles may be appropriately selected. Alternatively, spraying distance, spraying pressure, spraying angle, or concentration and the viscosity of the spraying liquid may be appropriately selected.</p><p id="p0208" num="0208">Further, as an atomizing method by a nozzle spraying device, two kinds of types, that is, a one-fluid type or a two-fluid type may be selected for use. Among these types: in one-fluid spraying type, mist drips are sprayed from a nozzle by directly pressurizing chemicals to be sprayed using compressed air; or mist drips are sprayed from a microscopic hole formed on the side surface of the nozzle in the vicinity of an ejection port. Further, as the two-fluid spraying type, exemplified are: an internal mixing type where inside of the nozzle, compressed air is mixed with liquid to be sprayed and the mixture is atomized for spraying; an external mixing type where outside of the nozzle, sprayed compressed air is mixed with sprayed liquid so as to be atomized; and a collision type where atomized mist drip particles are collided mutually for further<!-- EPO <DP n="86"> --> homogenizing and atomizing; and the like.</p><p id="p0209" num="0209">Meanwhile, in a rotor dampening spraying type, a spraying liquid is discharged onto a disk rotating at a high speed and atomized so as to be fine mist drip particles by a centrifugal force of the disk.

For this reason, in a case of spray<!-- EPO <DP n="87"> --> application, a spraying distance, a spraying pressure, a spraying angle, and a spraying speed can be adjusted so that a diameter of the mist drop particle can be adapted to meet application conditions. Additionally, in a case of the two-fluid type, a mixing ratio of the chemicals to be sprayed to compressed air, concentration or viscosity of the chemicals, and the like can be appropriately adjusted too.
