Typical artificial joints include knee prostheses, hip prostheses, shoulder prostheses, ankle prostheses, and wrist prostheses, among others. To facilitate the replacement of the natural joint with the prosthesis, orthopaedic surgeons use a variety of orthopaedic surgical instruments such as, for example, saws, drills, reamers, rasps, broaches, cutting blocks, drill guides, milling guides, and other surgical instruments.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The invention provides an orthopaedic surgical instrument which includes a cutting block having a bone-engaging surface and an outer surface positioned opposite the bone-engaging surface, a first cutting guide slot defined in the cutting block, and a second cutting guide slot defined in the cutting block. The first cutting guide slot defines a first imaginary plane, the second cutting guide slot defines a second imaginary plane that extends oblique to the first imaginary plane. The orthopaedic surgical instrument includes a first mounting system configured to secure the cutting block to a bone of a patient. The first mounting system includes a plate removably coupled to the cutting block, and a pair of spikes attached to the plate, each spike having a bone-engaging tip. The orthopaedic surgical instrument also includes a second mounting system configured to secure the cutting block to the bone of the patient.

The cutting block 12 includes an outer surface 22 and a bone-engaging surface 24 positioned opposite the outer surface 22. The surfaces 22, 24 of the cutting block 12 extend from a lower end 26 to an upper end 28. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the surface 24 of the cutting block 12 has an aperture 30 defined therein.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The modular mounting system 14 includes a plate or bracket 32 that is sized and shaped to be positioned in the aperture 30 of the cutting block 12.

The surgical instrument 10 also includes a plurality of cutting slots or guides 40, and each cutting guide 40 is defined by opposing guide surfaces 42, as described in greater detail below. Each cutting guide 40 is sized and shaped to receive the blade (not shown) of a surgical saw or other cutting instrument and orient the blade to resect the patient's bone during an orthopaedic surgical procedure.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the device shown in the drawings, the cutting block 12 and the brackets 32, 34 of the instrument 10 are formed from metallic materials such as, for example, steel, titanium alloy, or cobalt chromium alloy. It should be appreciated that the cutting block 12 and the brackets 32, 34 may be formed from polymeric materials such as, for example, polyamide, poly(phenylsulphone), or polyketone. The guide surfaces 42 of the instrument 10 may then be formed from a metallic material such as those described above. It should be understood that various combinations of polymeric and metallic materials may be used to form the cutting block 12 and the brackets 32, 34.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a posterior cutting guide 44 of the cutting guides 40 is defined at the lower end 26 of the cutting block 12. The cutting guide 44 is defined between opposing guide surfaces 42, which extend between an opening 46 defined in the outer surface 22 and another opening 48 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>) defined in the bone-engaging surface 24. An imaginary resection plane 50 is defined by the cutting guide 44. The resection plane 50 extends through the distal end 18 of the patient's femur 20 when the cutting block 12 is secured thereto. In that way, the posterior cutting guide 44 may be used by the surgeon during the resection of the patient's femur 20, as described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The cutting guides 40 of the instrument 10 also include an anterior cutting guide 54, which is defined at the upper end 28 of the cutting block 12.

An imaginary resection plane 60 is defined by the cutting guide 44. The resection plane 60 extends through the distal end 18 of the patient's femur 20 when the cutting block 12 is secured thereto. In that way, the anterior cutting guide 54, like the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> posterior cutting guide 44, may be used by the surgeon during the resection of the patient's femur 20.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The orthopaedic surgical instrument 10 also includes a pair of chamfer cutting guides 70, 72 positioned between the posterior cutting guide 44 and the anterior cutting guide 54.

The guide surfaces 76, 82 of the cutting block 12 are connected at an inner edge 90, and the guide surfaces 78, 80 are connected at an inner edge 92. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, a slot 88 is defined between the inner edges 90, 92, and the surfaces 80, 82 cooperate to define the aperture 30 in the bone-engaging surface 24.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, each of the brackets 32, 34 includes a planar upper guide surface 100 and a planar lower guide surface 102.
