In this cab box, a door is provided having a rear end portion rotatable in the front-rear direction by using the left intermediate pillar as a fulcrum in order to open/close an entrance way between the left front pillar and the left intermediate pillar.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Moreover, an engaging member is mounted on the rear surface portion of the left front pillar. This engaging member is composed of a mounting plate mounted on an intermediate portion in a height direction of the rear surface portion and a substantially U-shaped engaging ring provided protruding rearward from the mounting plate. Here, the engaging member is mounted on the left front pillar by screwing the mounting plate with the rear surface portion.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In this case, a door holding member engaged with the engaging ring and holding the door at a closed position is provided on the front end side of the door corresponding to the engaging member when the door is rotationally moved in a closing direction (Patent Document 1).</p><heading id="h0003">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT DOCUMENT</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2009215702A"><text>2009-215702 A</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">Regarding the hydraulic excavator according to the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> above-described Patent Document 1, since the door holding member is provided in a state extended to the operator's room side from the inside of the door, the door holding member increases the thickness of the inner surface side of the door. As a result, when the door is closed, the door holding member gives a feeling of oppression to the operator's room by the portion extended to the operator's room, and there are problems that a living space becomes small and a work environment deteriorates.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">On the other hand, in a case where the door holding member largely extends to the inside of the door, when a work is to be carried out by opening the door so as to follow the left rear side surface, the door holding member can be easily brought into contact with an obstruction around it. Thus, an operator should pay attention so that the door holding member does not touch an obstruction, which also causes a problem of deteriorated workability.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In view of the above-discussed problems with the conventional art, it is an object of the present invention to provide a construction machine which can improve a work environment in the cab or workability while the door is open by suppressing extension of the door holding member from the door to the operator's room side.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">(1) A construction machine according to the present invention comprises an automotive lower traveling structure; an upper revolving structure rotatably mounted on the lower traveling structure and having a cab provided on a revolving frame forming a support structural body; and a working mechanism provided on the front side in the front-rear direction of the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> upper revolving structure, capable of moving upward/downward; the cab being provided with a cab box in which five pillars are provided extending in the vertical direction by being located on left front, right front, left intermediate, left rear, and right rear and a space between each of the pillars is covered by a front surface, a left front side surface, a left rear side surface, a right side surface, a rear surface, and a top surface and the inside becomes an operator's room; and a door having the rear end side mounted on the left intermediate pillar rotatably in the front-rear direction in order to open/close an entrance way between the left front pillar and the left intermediate pillar of the cab box.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In order to solve the above-described problems, a feature of a configuration employed by the present invention is that the left front pillar is formed of a pillar-side stepped surface portion in which an intermediate portion in the front-rear direction of a left side surface portion is bent to the operator's room side, a pillar-side opposite surface portion provided extending to the rear side from a depth portion of the pillar-side stepped surface portion and opposed to the door in a closed state, and a rear surface portion extending from a rear end portion of the pillar-side opposite surface portion to the operator's room side; an engaging member composed of a mounting plate having a protruding portion protruding to the door side from the pillar-side opposite surface portion and an engaging ring protruding rearward from the mounting plate is provided on the rear surface portion of the left front pillar; the door has an outer surface plate forming an outer side surface of the door,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> an inner surface plate opposite to the outer surface plate and forming an inner side surface of the door, a door-side opposite surface plate arranged inside the outer surface plate by being located on the front side of the inner surface plate and opposed to the pillar-side opposite surface portion when the door is closed, a door-side stepped surface plate forming a step between the inner surface plate and the door-side opposite surface plate, and a mounting opening provided on the door-side stepped surface plate at a position corresponding to the engaging member; a door holding member opposite to the engaging ring of the engaging member and holding the door at a closed position by being engaged with the engaging ring when the door is closed is provided on the mounting opening of the door; a retreating recessed portion located on the front side of the door holding member and recessed toward the outer surface plate is provided on the door-side opposite surface plate of the door; and when the door is brought to the closed position, interference with the protruding portion of the mounting plate of the engaging member is avoided by the retreating recessed portion.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">With this arrangement, even if the mounting plate of the engaging member is mounted on the rear surface portion of the left front pillar in a state protruding further to the door side from the pillar-side opposite surface portion, since the retreating recessed portion is provided on the door-side opposite surface plate of the door opposite to the mounting plate, interference between the door and the protruding portion of the mounting plate can be prevented when the door is closed.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Therefore, since the engaging member can be arranged close<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> to the outer side (door side) so as not to protrude to the operator' s room side from the left front pillar, the door holding member engaged with this engaging member can be also arranged close to the outer surface plate side of the door. Therefore, the door holding member can be prevented from extending to the operator's room side in the cab and moreover, the thickness dimension of the door can be made small.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As a result, even if the cab to be mounted is small as in a super small-sized hydraulic excavator, for example, the operator's room in the cab can be effectively enlarged, whereby a work environment for an operator can be made favorable. Moreover, since the door holding member is configured not to protrude, even if the door is opened so as to follow the left rear side surface, the door extends only slightly to the outside. As a result, the operator can carry out a work without being excessively aware of the open door, and workability at this time can be improved.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">(2) The present invention is characterized by a configuration in which a seal member for sealing a space between the cab box and the door is provided on either one side of the pillar-side opposite surface portion of the left front pillar and the door-side opposite surface plate of the door; and the retreating recessed portion is arranged between the door holding member and the seal member.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">With this arrangement, the seal member provided between the pillar-side opposite surface portion of the left front pillar and the door-side opposite surface plate of the door seals a space between the cab box and the door and suppresses intrusion of dusts,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> outdoor air, noises and the like and prevents rattling of the door. Moreover, the retreating recessed portion can be arranged between the door holding member and the seal member.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">(3) The present invention is characterized in that a depth dimension of the retreating recessed portion is set to a value larger than a difference between a protruding dimension of the protruding portion provided on the mounting plate of the engaging member and a width dimension when the seal member is deformed by closing the door. With this arrangement, even if the seal member is largely deformed by closing the door in a rush, collision between the protruding portion of the mounting plate and the retreating recessed portion can be reliably prevented.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">(4) The present invention is characterized by a configuration in which the door holding member has a case mounted on the mounting opening of the door and an engaging pawl provided rotatably on the case and engaged with the engaging ring of the engaging member when the door is closed.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">With this arrangement, since after the mounting opening is provided in the door-side stepped surface plate on the inner surface side of the door, the case of the door holding member is mounted on this mounting opening, the door holding member can be contained between the outer surface plate and the inner surface plate.

The engaging member 23 is composed of a rhomboid flat plate-shaped mounting plate 23A and a U-shaped engaging ring 23B provided protruding horizontally rearward from the mounting plate 23A. This mounting plate 23A is firmly screwed to the convex portion 14D1 of the rear surface portion 14D. In this state, the engaging ring 23B protrudes rearward from the rear surface portion 14D.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Here, the engaging member 23 needs sufficient durability (strength) so as to be able to bear an impact acting when the door 24 is opened/closed for a long time. Thus, since the<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> engaging ring 23B is formed thick and large, the engaging member 23 becomes a component that cannot be easily reduced in size in accordance with a space for mounting. Therefore, the engaging member 23 has a width dimension of its mounting plate 23A larger than a width dimension of the rear surface portion 14D which is a place for mounting.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In this embodiment, the engaging member 23 is arranged close to the outer side so that the inner side portion of the mounting plate 23A does not protrude to the operator's room 13G side in the cab box 13 from the left front pillar 14.

As<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">Figs. 10</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0014">14</figref>, this retreating recessed portion 29 is located between the seal member 27 and the door holding member 28 and is formed by having the door-side opposite surface plate 24C recessed to the outer side (left side) in the substantially same height range as the door holding member 28, for example. The retreating recessed portion 29 is to avoid interference (contact) of the protruding portion 23A1 of the mounting plate 23A of the engaging member 23 protruding outward from the rear surface portion 14D of the left front pillar 14, and its deepest portion has a depth dimension L3. This depth dimension L3 of the retreating recessed portion 29 is set to a dimension large enough to avoid interference with the protruding portion 23A1 of the mounting plate 23A even if the door 24 is closed in a rush and the seal member 27 is largely deformed. Therefore, the depth dimension L3 of the retreating recessed portion 29 is set to a value larger than a value obtained by subtracting the width dimension L2 when the door 24 is closed and the seal member 27 is deformed from the protruding dimension L1 of the protruding portion 23A1 provided on the mounting plate 23A of the engaging member 23, that is, with a relationship of the following formula 1.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062"><maths id="math0001" num="[Formula 1]"><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">L</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">3</mn><mo>&gt;</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">L</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn><mo>-</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">L</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="35" he="19" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0063" num="0063">As described above, since the retreating recessed portion 29 is provided on the door-side opposite surface plate 24C of the door 24, the engaging member 23 can be arranged close to the outer side (outer surface plate 24A side). By arranging the<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> engaging member 23 close to the outer side, the extension dimension of the inner surface plate 24B of the door 24 can be kept small, and the door 24 can have a thin shape.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Indicated at 30 is a catch (See <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>) provided on the left rear side surface 13C of the cab box 13.

In this state, by operating the operating lever/pedal 12 for running, the lower traveling structure 2 can be made to run. On the other hand, by operating the operating lever 11 for work, the upper revolving structure 3 can be revolved, and the working mechanism 4 can be moved upward/downward so as to carry out an excavating work of earth and sand or the like.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Here, since the engaging member 23 and the door holding member 28 are arranged close to the outer side (close to the door 24 side), the extension dimension of the door holding member 28 extended into the cab 8 when the door 24 is closed can be kept<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> small and thus, the operator's room 13G in the cab box 13 can be made larger.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Moreover, when the hydraulic excavator 1 is to carry out a work, the work might be carried out in a state in which the door 24 is opened and the entrance way 21 is kept open. In this case, by opening the door 24 to the position following the left rear side surface 13C and by engaging the catch 30 and the striker 31 with each other, the work can be carried out in a state in which the door 24 is kept open. At this time, since the extension dimension of the inner surface plate 24B of the door 24 is kept small, interference between this inner surface plate 24B and a peripheral obstacle can be suppressed.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Thus, according to this embodiment, the left front pillar 14 is composed of the left side surface portion 14A curved from the right front side to the left side, the pillar-side stepped surface portion 14B extending to the right side which becomes the operator's room 13G side in the cab box 13 while bending from the rear end of the left side surface portion 14A, the pillar-side opposite surface portion 14C provided extending from the depth part of the pillar-side stepped surface portion 14B to the rear side and opposed to the periphery of the closed door 24, the rear surface portion 14D extending from the rear end portion of the pillar-side opposite surface portion 14C to the right side, and the inner surface portion 14E extending from the front end of the left side surface portion 14A to the right end of the rear surface portion 14D.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">The door 24 is composed of the outer surface plate 24A forming the outer side surface, the inner surface plate 24B<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> opposed to the outer surface plate 24A and forming the inner side surface of the door 24, the door-side opposite surface plate 24C arranged inside of the outer surface plate 24A by being located on the front end side of the inner surface plate 24B and opposed to the pillar-side opposite surface portion 14C of the left front pillar 14 when the door 24 is closed, the door-side stepped surface plate 24D forming a step between the inner surface plate 24B and the door-side opposite surface plate 24C, and the mounting opening 24E provided at a position corresponding to the engaging member 23 of the door-side stepped surface plate 24D. Moreover, the door holding member 28 is provided between the front end portion of the inner surface plate 24B and the rear end portion of the door-side opposite surface plate 24C, that is, on the recessed portion 24D1 of the door-side stepped surface plate 24D.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">Moreover, the mounting plate 23A of the engaging member 23 is mounted on the rear surface portion 14D in a state in which its protruding portion 23A1 is made to protrude to the door 24 side from the pillar-side opposite surface portion 14C of the left front pillar 14, and the retreating recessed portion 29 for avoiding interference with the protruding portion 23A1 of the mounting plate 23A is provided in the door-side opposite surface plate 24C of the door 24.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">Therefore, since the retreating recessed portion 29 is provided in the door-side opposite surface plate 24C of the door 24 opposite to the protruding portion 23A1 of the mounting plate 23A of the engaging member 23, even if the mounting plate 23A of the engaging member 23 is provided on the rear surface portion 14D of the left front pillar 14 in a state in which the protruding<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> portion 23A1 protrudes outward from the pillar-side opposite surface portion 14C, when the door 24 is closed, interference with the protruding portion 23A1 of the mounting plate 23A can be prevented.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">In this case, as illustrated in the formula 1, regarding the retreating recessed portion 29, its depth dimension L3 is set to a value larger than a value obtained by subtracting the width dimension L2 when the door 24 is closed and the seal member 27 is deformed from the protruding dimension L1 of the protruding portion 23A1 provided on the mounting plate 23A of the engaging member 23. As a result, even if the seal member 27 is largely deformed by closing the door 24 in a rush, collision between the protruding portion 23A1 of the mounting plate 23A and the retreating recessed portion 29 can be reliably prevented, and durability of the door 24 can be improved.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">In addition, since the engaging member 23 can be arranged close to the door 24 side so as not to protrude to the operator's room 13G side from the left front pillar 14, the door holding member 28 to be engaged with this engaging member 23 can be also arranged close to the outer surface plate 24A side (outer side) of the door 24. As a result, even if the cab 8 to be mounted is small such as in the case of the super small-sized hydraulic excavator 1, for example, the operator's room 13G in the cab box 13 can be effectively enlarged by a portion of arrangement of drawing back the door holding member 28 to the outside, and a work environment of the operator can be made favorable.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">As described above, by keeping the extension dimension of the door 24 to the inside small, the protruding dimension to<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> the outside when the door 24 is opened to a position following the left rear side surface 13C can be made small.
