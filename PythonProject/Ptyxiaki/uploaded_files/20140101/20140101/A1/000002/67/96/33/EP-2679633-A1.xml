Research and development studies have been performed actively on various biodegradable resins and biomass (plant-derived material) based resins, whose incineration will not increase the carbon dioxide load on the atmosphere, as means of solving the former and the latter problems, respectively. Expectations are growing for polylactic acid as it is able to meet both of the above purposes and relatively advantageous in terms of cost as well. Polylactic acid materials cannot be sufficiently high in flexibility and impact resistance if applied to uses where flexible films of polyolefins such as polyethylene have been conventionally adopted, and a variety of attempts are being made in an effort to improve them in these characteristics to provide practical materials.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the field of porous film production, Patent document 1, for instance, has disclosed a porous sheet that is produced by stretching at least uniaxially a sheet containing a polylactic acid resin, a filler,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> and a common polyester based plasticizer. Patent document 2 has disclosed a porous film produced from a polylactic acid based polymer, aliphatic aromatic copolymerization polyester, and in addition, a common plasticizer selected from the group consisting of an aliphatic multivalent carboxylate, aliphatic polyhydric alcohol ester, aliphatic polyhydric alcohol ether, and oxyacid ester, in which pores are formed by adding a fine powder filler.

The first aspect of the invention is polylactic acid based film comprising a composition containing a polylactic acid based resin, referred to as resin (A), a thermoplastic resin other than polylactic acid based resin, referred to as resin (B), and a compound treated with a surface treatment agent, referred to as filler (C);the polylactic acid based resin containing a crystalline polylactic acid based resin and an amorphous polylactic acid based resin; resin (A) accounting for 10 to 95 mass% and resin (B) accounting for 5 to 90 mass% of a combined total of 100 mass% of resin (A) and resin (B); and filler (C) accounting for 10 to 400 parts by mass per a combined total of 100 parts by mass<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> of resin (A) and resin (B).</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Described below is polylactic acid based film according to the first aspect of the present invention.</p><heading id="h0009">(Polylactic acid based film according to the first aspect)</heading><heading id="h0010">(Resin (A) (polylactic acid based resin))</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">It is important for polylactic acid based film according to the present invention to be one produced from a composition containing resin (A). Here, resin (A) is a polylactic acid based resin. Polylactic acid based resin is defined as a polymer containing, as a main component, a L-lactic acid and/or a D-lactic acid. Here, a "main component" accounts for the largest proportion by mass of the lactic acid units in the 100 mass% quantity of the polymer. The lactic acid units preferably account for a mass proportion of 70 mass% to 100 mass% per 100 mass% of the polymer.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A poly-L-lactic acid as referred to for the present invention is a the polylactic acid polymer in which the poly-L-lactic acid accounts for more than 50 mol% and 100 mol% or less of the total lactic acid units, which account for 100 mol%, in the polymer. A poly-D-lactic acid as referred to for the present invention, on the other hand, is a polylactic acid polymer in which the poly-D-lactic acid accounts for more than 50 mol% and 100 mol% or less of the total lactic acid units, which account for 100 mol%, in the polymer.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A poly-L-lactic acid changes in resin crystallinity depending on the content of D-lactic acid units. Specifically, a poly-L-lactic acid decreases in crystallinity and increases in amorphousness with an increasing content of D-lactic acid units in the poly-L-lactic acid while a poly-L-lactic acid increases in crystallinity with a decreasing content of D-lactic acid units in the poly-L-lactic acid. Similarly, a poly-D-lactic acid changes in resin crystallinity depending on the content of L-lactic acid units.
