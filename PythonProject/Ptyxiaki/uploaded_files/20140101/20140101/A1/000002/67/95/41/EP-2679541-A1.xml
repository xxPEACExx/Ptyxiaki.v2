This polycrystalline silicon rod includes at least four regions having different fine structures on the radial cross section of the rod. Moreover, this polycrystalline silicon rod is configured so that a polycrystalline thin rod exists within a region A of the innermost polycrystalline rod center, and no needle-shaped crystal exists or only a bit of needle-shaped crystals exists or exist within a region B of polycrystalline silicon deposited around the thin rod. More<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> specifically, the thin rod of the region A is formed so as to have a regular square in cross section having a size of sides of 5 to 10 mm, and the diameter of the region B is formed so that it is more than 30 mm. Moreover, the area percentage of the needle-shaped crystals within the region B is less than 1%, the length of the needle-shaped crystals is 5 mm or less, and the width thereof is 1 mm or less. Moreover, the polycrystalline silicon rod is configured within the outside region D thereof so that the area percentage of the needle-shaped crystals is less than 7 %, the length of the needle-shaped crystals is less than 15 mm, the width of the needle-shaped crystals is less than 2 mm, and the length of the micro-crystals of the matrix is not above 0.2 mm. Further, the polycrystalline silicon rod is configured between the regions B and D so that there exists a mixed region C such that the crystal structure smoothly shifts from the structure within the region B to the structure within the region D.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the polycrystalline silicon rod constituted in this way, since a bit of needle-shaped crystals of a small size within the region B are completely molten by heating in the subsequent FZ method, it is possible to eliminate a deficiency such that any defect may take place within the single crystal silicon after unmolten needle-shaped crystals or the remaining parts thereof are passed through the molten zone. Moreover, within the outside region D, the highest thermal stress may take place in the polycrystalline silicon rod during deposition process. It is to be noted that the strength is enhanced by microcrystalline matrix to a degree such<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> that any breakage or crack does not take place within the rod region and the bridge region except for the rod bottom part in contact with electrodes. Further, the mixed region C taking place between the inside region B and the outside region D has a crystal structure smoothly shifting from the structure within the region B to the structure of the region D, and this mixed region C exists within the diameter region of 30 mm to 120 mm.</p><heading id="h0003">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT LITERATURES</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2008285403A"><text>2008-285403</text></patcit> (Claim 1, paragraphs [0019] to [0023], <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>)</p><heading id="h0005">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, in the polycrystalline silicon rod disclosed in the conventional Patent reference 1, in the case where there exist relatively longer coarse grains such that lengths of the needle-shaped crystals in this polycrystalline silicon rod are above 1 mm, since needle-shaped crystals of coarse grains are difficult to be molten when heated in the process for manufacturing single crystal silicon by the FZ method, there are instances where the polycrystalline silicon rod may not be completely molten.

each having a diameter of 77 mm or less are formed so that each length thereof is not above 288 µm. In addition, the occupied area percentage of the needle-shaped crystals is 78 % or more. Thus, in heating and melting polycrystalline silicon rod for the purpose of single-crystallization by the FZ method, such unmolten crystals to cause defects in the single crystal silicon are difficult to be left, resulting in extremely low possibility such that dislocation may take place. Moreover, micro-crystals are formed so that each length of the needle-shaped crystals in the polycrystalline silicon deposit is not above 288 µm, thereby making it possible to suppress formation of voids taking place in the process of the crystal deposition.

In addition, as the occupied area percentage of the needle-shaped crystals falls within the range from 15% to 35%, when the polycrystalline silicon rod is heated and molten for single-crystallization based on the FZ method, few unmolten needle-shaped crystals causing defect within the single crystal silicon are left. As a result, no dislocation is produced. Moreover, micro-crystals are formed so that each length of needle-shaped crystals in the polycrystalline silicon deposit is not above 291 µm, thereby making it possible to suppress formation of voids produced in the crystal depositing process. For this reason, it is possible to provide a uniform crystal structure.</p><heading id="h0009">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a longitudinal cross sectional view of a polycrystalline silicon depositing device for depositing<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> polycrystalline silicon deposit onto an outer circumferential surface of a seed rod made of polycrystalline silicon according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2(a)</figref> is a photographic view when the cross section perpendicular to the axis of seed rod made of the polycrystalline silicon rod of an example 1 is observed by optical microscope, and <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>(b-1) to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>(b-4) are photographic views respectively showing, in an enlarged fashion, the part A, the part B, the part C and the part D in the photographic view of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2(a)</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3(a)</figref> is a photographic view when the cross section perpendicular to the axis of seed rod of the polycrystalline silicon rod of a comparative example 1 is observed by the optical microscope, and <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>(b-1) to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> (b-4) are photographic views respectively showing, in an enlarged fashion, the part A, the part B, the part C and the part D in the photographic view of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3(a)</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a photographic view showing <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>(b-1) in a further enlarged fashion;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a photographic view showing <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> (b-2) in a further enlarged fashion;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a photographic view showing <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> (b-3) in a further enlarged fashion;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> is a photographic view showing <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> (b-4) in a further enlarged fashion;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> is a photographic view showing <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>(b-1) in a further enlarged fashion;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> is a photographic view showing <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> (b-2) in a further enlarged fashion;<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref> is a photographic view showing <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> (b-3) in a further enlarged fashion;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11</figref> is a photographic view showing <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> (b-4) in a further enlarged fashion;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12(a)</figref> is a photographic view when a polycrystalline silicon rod of the example 2 is observed by means of optical microscope with respect to a cross section perpendicular to the axis of seed rod, and <figref idrefs="f0012">FIGS. 12</figref>(b-1) to 12(b-5) are photographic views showing, in an enlarged fashion, the part A, the part B, the part C, the part D and the part E in the photographic views of <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12(a)</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 13</figref> is a photographic view showing <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>(b-1) in a further enlarged fashion;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 14</figref> is a photographic view showing <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>(b-1) in a further enlarged fashion;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 15</figref> is a photographic view showing <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>(b-3) in a further enlarged fashion;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0016">FIG. 16</figref> is a photographic view showing <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>(b-4) in a further enlarged fashion;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 17</figref> is a photographic view showing <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>(b-5) in a further enlarged fashion; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0018">FIG. 18</figref> is a model view of representative needle-shaped crystals shown in the photographic view of the example 2.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010">EMBODIMENT(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">Embodiments for carrying out the present invention will now<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> be described with reference to the attached drawings. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, in a polycrystalline silicon deposition device 10, a polycrystalline silicon rod 11 used as material for manufacturing single crystal silicon by the FZ method includes a seed rod 11a made of polycrystalline silicon, and a polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b deposited on the outer circumferential surface of the seed rod 11a by the CVD process. The polycrystalline silicon rod 11 is configured so that when observed with respect to a cross section perpendicular to an axis of the seed rod 11a, needle-shaped crystals are uniformly distributed radially with the seed rod 11a being as the center in the polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b. These needle-shaped crystals are formed so that when the diameter of the polycrystalline silicon rod 11 is 77 mm or less, each length thereof is 288 µm or less, and an occupied area percentage on the cross section of the needle-shaped crystal is 78 % or more. In this embodiment, the reason why limitation is made such that each length of the needle-shaped crystals is 288 µm or less is that there is high possibility that these needle-shaped crystals may cause occurrence of dislocation resulting from the fact that when coarse needle-shaped crystals beyond 288 µm (excessive needle-shaped crystals) exist in the polycrystalline silicon rod 11, they are difficult to be molten at the time of single-crystallizing the polycrystalline silicon rod 11 by the FZ method. Moreover, the reason why the occupied area percentage of the needle-shaped crystals is limited to 78 % or more is that since a considerable number of excessive needle-shaped crystals potentially existing in the polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b is left at the time of<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> single-crystallizing the polycrystalline silicon rod 11 by the FZ method in the case of less than 78 %, there is high possibility that these crystals may be developed into dislocation. On the other hand, when the diameter of the polycrystalline silicon rod 11 falls within a range from about above 3 inches (77 mm) to about 6 inches (153 mm), preferably within a range from about above 3 inches (77 mm) to about more than about 5 inches (130 mm) or less, the needle-shaped crystals are formed so that each length thereof is 291 µm or less within a region at least having a diameter of 130 mm, and the occupied area percentage on the cross section of the needle-shaped crystals is formed so that it falls within 15% to 35%. In this case, the reason why the length of the needle-shaped crystals is limited to 291 µm or less is that when coarse needle-shaped crystals (excessive needle-shaped crystals) above 291 µm exist within the polycrystalline silicon rod 11, those balky crystals are difficult to be molten in performing single-crystallization of the polycrystalline silicon rod 11 by the FZ method so that the possibility that these needle-shaped crystals may result in occurrence of cause of dislocation becomes high. Moreover, the reason why the occupied area percentage of the needle-shaped crystals is limited to the range from 15% to 35% is that when it is less than 15%, the productivity of the polycrystalline silicon rod is lowered, whereas when it is above 35%, the polycrystalline silicon rod is difficult to be molten so that in the case where single-crystallization of the polycrystalline silicon rod is performed by the FZ method under the same condition (melting time, etc.), dislocation becomes easy<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> to take place. It is to be noted that crystals of less than 5 µm of observation limit are micro-crystals, and are formed as matrix.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">(1) In the case where a polycrystalline silicon rod 11 having a diameter of about 3 inches (77 mm) or less is fabricated,<br/>
when the polycrystalline silicon rod 11 is observed with respect to a cross section perpendicular to an axis of the seed rod 11a, lengths and widths of needle-shaped crystals at positions away by 5 mm, 10 mm and 25 mm from the outer circumferential surface of the seed rod 11a toward the outside in the radial direction on the same circumference with the axis of the seed rod 11a being as the center are respectively formed as follows. The lengths of the needle-shaped crystals at the position away by 5 mm are distributed so that they are preferably 115 µm or less, and the widths of the needle-shaped crystals at the position away by 5 mm are distributed so that they are preferably 23 µm or less. In this case, needle-shaped crystals each having sizes such that the lengths and the widths of the needle-shaped crystals at the position away by 5 mm are respectively above 115 µm and 23 µm, there is a tendency such that the needle-shaped crystals are difficult to be completely molten according as attention is drawn to parts close to the central part of the polycrystalline silicon rod 11 resulting from the structure of the heating coil at the time of manufacturing single crystal silicon by the FZ method.

Thus, occurrence of dislocation can be reduced to a large degree.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b constituted in this way is deposited by the polycrystalline silicon depositing device 10. This polycrystalline silicon depositing device 10 comprises a reactor 12, and a supply pipe 14 and an exhaust pipe 16 which are attached in a manner penetrated through the reactor 12. The reactor 12 comprises a base plate 12a constituting the bottom part thereof, and a bell jar 12b including a cylindrical body of which<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> upper side is closed to be dorm-shaped. On the base plate 12a, there are provided a pair of these electrodes 12c for holding the lower end of a Π-shaped seed rod 11a in a manner penetrated therethrough. The seed rod 11a is held by electrodes 12c, 12c so that it is fixed within the reactor 12. An output terminal of a power supply 13 is electrically connected to the pair of electrodes 12c, 12c, and the seed rod 11a is configured so that it can be heated by power from the power supply 13. The supply pipe 14 and the exhaust pipe 16 are respectively, made of, e.g., stainless steel, and are attached in a manner penetrated through the base plate 12a. A configuration such that mixture gas of, e.g., trichlorosilane (TCS:SiHCl<sub>3</sub>) and hydrogen is introduced as raw material gas from the supply pipe 14 into the reactor 12 is adopted. Additionally, reference numeral 17 in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> denotes an insulator for electrically isolating the electrodes 12c, 12c from the base plate 12a.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">A method of depositing a polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b by using the depositing device 10 constituted in this way will be described as follows. The seed rod 11a made of polycrystalline silicon is fabricated in advance. The seed rod 11a may be fabricated by shaving or cutting a polycrystalline silicon rod so as to take a square rod shape to assemble the rod thus obtained so as to take Π-shaped, or may be fabricated by connecting a plurality of square polycrystalline silicon rods to assemble the rods thus obtained so as to take Π-shaped. It is to be noted that it is preferable to allow the seed rod 11a to undergo surface treatment by using chemical liquids of acid (e.g., mixed liquid of nitric acid and<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> hydrofluororic acid, etc.) before use. Thus, it is possible to remove impurities or oxide films, etc. attached or formed on the surface of the seed rod 11a. By this process, lesser pollutant high purity polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b can be obtained, and cases to produce defects and/or pores such as voids which are apt to take place in the deposition initial stage of the polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b can be reduced. Accordingly, it is possible to form, on the surface of the seed rod 11a, polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b of uniform crystal structure. First, the seed rod 11a is disposed within the reactor 12. The arrangement of the seed rod 11a is performed by allowing the electrodes 12c, 12c provided on the base plate 12a to hold the lower end of the seed rod 11a. Further, the seed rod 11a is pre-heated by means of heater in the reactor, etc. thereafter energization was performed through electrodes 12c, 12c by means of the power supply 13 to heat the seed rod 11a. The heating temperature is a predetermined temperature (e.g., about 1100°C) within the range from about 1000 to 1300°C. In correspondence with heating of the seed rod 11a, mixture gas of trichlorosilane (TCS: SiHCl<sub>3</sub>) and hydrogen is introduced as raw material gas from the supply pipe 14 into the reactor 12. The gas thus introduced rises within the reactor 12 which is heated by the heated high temperature seed rod 11a, During convection of gas, trichlorosilane (TCS:SiHCl<sub>3</sub>) is thermally decomposed or is reduced by hydrogen as indicated by the following formulas (1) and (2) so that polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b is deposited on the surface of the seed rod 11a.<br/>

</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In this embodiment, it is preferable that, in the initial stage of the deposition reaction, a current value caused to flow through the seed rod 11a is temporarily suppressed down to a lower value. For example, the current value is momentarily suppressed down to about 1/25 of the maximum setup current value in the reaction process in the case of the polycrystalline deposit 11b having a diameter of about 3 inches (77 mm) or less, and to about 1/30 of the maximum setup current value in the reaction process in the case of the polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b having a diameter within the range from about above 3 inches (77 mm) and about 6 inches (153 mm), thereafter to gradually elevate the current value in correspondence with an increase in the diameter of the polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b. Thus, in the initial deposition process of the polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b, formation of coarse needle-shaped crystals is suppressed so that needle-shaped crystals equal to those of the seed rod 11a or smaller than those of the seed rod 11a can be formed. Moreover, it is possible to suppress formation of pores called voids on the seed rod surface. Further, it is preferable that, in the deposition reaction, the molar ratio of hydrogen to trichlorosilane is gradually increased from about 4/1 (hydrogen/trichlorosilane) in correspondence with an increase of the diameter of the polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b, and is about 8/1 at the maximum. Thus, it is possible to stably suppress formation of coarse needle-shaped crystals in the polycrystalline silicon<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> deposit 11b Further, production of powdered silicon is suppressed, and generation of pimples (projections) on the polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b which is considered resulting from cause such as powdered silicon, etc. is also suppressed so that a polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b which is uniform and is smooth on the surface thereof can be obtained. Furthermore, it is preferable that, flow rate of raw material gas is maintained at a predetermined flow rate in the initial stage of the deposition reaction, thereafter the flow rate is gradually increased to allow the maximum to be three times to six times larger than the initial flow rate of the maximum flow rate. Thus, deposit amount of the polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b can be maintained and the diameter of the polycrystalline can be constant over the entire length of the polycrystalline silicon rod 11. It is to be noted that, sub-product by thermal decomposition or reduction reaction such as tetrachlorosilane or hydrogen chloride, etc. and/or unreacted trichlorosilane or hydrogen, etc. are exhausted as exhaust gas from the reactor in the series of reaction process steps, whereupon the exhaust gas thus obtained is processed within the processing system outside the system and recovery, etc. is then performed.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">After the deposition reaction is completed, a current caused to flow in the polycrystalline silicon rod 11 is lowered stepwise to gradually lower temperature of the seed rod 11a. This is because since when a current caused to flow in the polycrystalline silicon rod 11 is abruptly lowered, thermal strain in the polycrystalline<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> silicon rod 11 is increased, crack may take place at the time of recovery of the polycrystalline silicon rod 11 (at the time of taking-out from the reactor 12), and the polycrystalline silicon rod 11 may be apt to be broken at the time of single-crystallization by the FZ method. It is to be noted that the seed rod 11a may be fabricated by using the polycrystalline silicon rod 11 fabricated in this way. Thus, it is possible to provide a seed rod 11a which does not include coarse needle-shaped crystals in the seed rod 11a.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">(1) In the case a polycrystalline silicon rod 11 having a diameter of about 3 inches (77 mm) or less,<br/>

In addition, the occupied area percentage of the needle-shaped crystals is 78% or more, whereby very few unmolten needle-shaped crystals causing defect in the single crystal silicon during heating and molding the polycrystalline silicon rod 11 for single-crystallization by the FZ method are left, resulting in extremely low possibility that dislocation may take place. Moreover, micro crystals are formed so that lengths of needle-shaped crystals in the polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b are not above 288 µm, thereby making it possible to suppress formation of voids taking place in the process of crystal deposition. For this reason, there can be provided a uniform crystal structure. Further, since needle-shaped crystals in the<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> seed rod 11a are formed so that each length is not above 288 µm, unmolten crystals are difficult to generate at the time of melting the seed rod 11a in the single crystal silicon manufacturing process by the FZ method, thus to have ability to reduce occurrence of dislocation.

Here, in the case a polycrystalline silicon rod 11 having a diameter of about above 3 inches (77 mm), it is considered that since sizes of needle-shaped crystals vary widely, the control so as to suppress an incidence of needle-shaped crystals reduced in size up to an appropriate size within the range from 15% to 35%, results in that excessive needle-shaped crystals are concurrently suppressed.</p><heading id="h0011">EXAMPLE</heading><p id="p0034" num="0034">Examples according to the present invention will be described in detail along with a comparative example as follows.<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --></p><heading id="h0012">&lt;First example&gt;</heading><p id="p0035" num="0035">A polycrystalline silicon depositing device 10 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> was used to deposit polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b on the outer circumferential surface of the seed rod 11a. The seed rod assembly was fabricated in advance by assembling three sets of square polycrystalline silicon rods so as to take a Π-shape. Moreover, the lateral cross section of the seed rod 11a is a square having one side of about 8 mm, and the entire length of Π-shaped seed rod 11a was set to about 2000 mm. Further, as the seed rod 11a, a seed rod after subj ected to surface treatment by mixed liquid of nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid was used.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">First, the seed rod 11a was disposed within a reactor 12 to pre-heat the seed rod 11a by means of heater in the reactor, etc. thereafter to perform energization through electrodes 12c, 12c by means of a power supply 13 to heat the seed rod 11a, whereby when the temperature of the seed rod became equal to 1100°C, mixture gas of trichlorosilane (TCS:SiHCl<sub>3</sub>) and hydrogen was introduced from the supply pipe 14 into the reactor 12 to deposit the polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b on the surface of the seed rod 11a. In this example, in the initial stage of the deposition reaction, a current value caused to flow through the seed rod 11a was temporarily suppressed down to a lower value (e.g. 80A (1/17.5 of about 1000A of maximum current value)), thereafter to gradually elevate the current value in correspondence with an increase of the diameter of the polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b to allow current to flow up to 1000A at the maximum and maintain its current value for a<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> reaction time (about 70 hours). Moreover, in the deposition reaction, the molar ratio of hydrogen to trichlosilane was gradually increased from about 4/1 to about 7/1 at the maximum in correspondence with an increase of the diameter of the polycrystalline silicon deposit 11b. Further, the flow rate of raw material gas was maintained at a predetermined flow rate (10000 lit./min.) in the initial stage of deposition reaction thereafter and gradually the flow rate was elevated to the maximum flow rate (35000 lit./min. which is 3.5 times larger than the initial flow rate).

Furthermore, the occupied area percentage of needle-shaped crystals was determined by dividing the total area of needle-shaped crystals by the total area of the photographic view.
