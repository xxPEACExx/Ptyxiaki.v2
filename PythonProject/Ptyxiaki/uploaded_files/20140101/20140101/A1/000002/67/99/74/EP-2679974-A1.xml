The oil leak sensor 10 is configured in a tape form in such a way as to be attached to a floor, the surface of a wall, or the outside of a pipe. The oil leak sensor 10 includes an attachment layer 100, a base layer 200, and an upper protection layer 300 which are sequentially stacked from the bottom to the top.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The attachment layer 100 is attached to a place where oil leak is expected to occur and is formed of an adhesive tape, such a double-sided tape.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">A pair of conductive lines 210 and 240 made of a silver compound or pure conductive ink having 0 to 20 Ω are printed on a top surface of the base layer 200 formed of a film, such as PET, PE, PTFE, or PVC, in a length direction or the pair of conductive lines 210 and 240 made of pure copper, stainless, or iron line having a thin pole form are attached to the top surface of the base layer 200 using an adhesive. A pair of polymer lines 220 and 230 are attached to the top surface of the base layer 200 and are spaced apart from the conductive lines 210 and 240 at specific intervals in parallel to the conductive lines 210 and 240.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The polymer lines 220 and 230 preferably are formed in close proximity, and the conductive lines 210 and 240 are formed outside the polymer lines 220 and 230.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Furthermore, the other ends of the first conductive line 210 and the first polymer line 220 are electrically coupled by a connector, and the other ends of the second conductive line 240 and the second polymer line 230 are also electrically coupled likewise.

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the oil leak sensor 10 couples the conductive lines 210 and 240 and a signal line 500 through a connector 400 so that the conductive lines 210 and 240 and a signal line 500 are connected to a controller 600.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, the processor 610 of the controller 600 controls a power source unit 620 so that the power source unit 620 supplies the first conductive line 210 with voltage having several V and determines whether oil leaks or not based on a voltage value from the first polymer line 220. When oil leak is generated and oil enters the sensing holes 310, the volume or the amount of adsorption of the first polymer line 220 is increased, so a resistance value in the first polymer line 220 is increased.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As a result, voltage drops, and the processor 610 determines that oil leaks based on the voltage drop.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Here, a voltage drop value that may occur depending on the length of the oil leak sensor 10 is previously set in a setting value storage unit 630 because voltage inputted to the processor 610 indispensably drops depending on the length of the oil leak sensor 10. If a voltage drop value sensed by the first polymer line 220 is higher than the set voltage drop value, the processor 610 determines that oil leaks and outputs an alarm signal through a display unit 640 and an alarm generation unit 650 in order to inform a manager that oil has leaked.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Meanwhile, an error in sensing oil leak is frequently generated because the first polymer line 220 is made of polymer materials sensitive to temperature and thus sensitive to a change of external temperature. Accordingly, there is a need for a structure for compensating for the frequent error.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">A change of a resistance value attributable to a change of temperature is compensated for using the second polymer line 230 adjacent to the first polymer line 220 as a reference. When the power source unit 620 supplies voltage of several V to the second conductive line 240, resistance values of the first polymer line 220 and the second polymer line 230 are identically increased according to a rise of temperature due to the supply of voltage as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5(a)</figref>. However, although the resistance values exceed a limit, the processor 610 determines a change of a resistance value attributable to a change of temperature as a normal operating state not oil leak.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In contrast, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5(b)</figref>, when a resistance value of the second polymer line<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> 230 not sensing oil leak is within a limit, but a resistance value of the first polymer line 220 exceeds the limit, the processor 610 determines that oil leak has occurred and thus outputs an alarm through the display unit 640 and the alarm generation unit 650.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Furthermore, the first polymer line 220 and the second polymer line 230 are formed in close proximity to the highest degree so that the same change of temperature is applied to the first polymer line 220 and the second polymer line 230.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram showing another embodiment of the present invention.

Adsorption fabric 740 is placed within the pipe 730 in which the oil leak sensor 10 is received.<br/>
Furthermore, the pipe 730 is buried under an oil pipeline 750 buried in the ground and configured to sense oil leak generated from the oil pipeline 750. When oil is introduced through the inlet holes 731 of the pipe 730, the oil enters the oil leak sensor 10 through the adsorption fabric 740 and thus oil leak is sensed.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Both sides of the oil leak sensor 10 are introduced into the manhole 700 and are coupled by neighboring oil leak sensors and the connectors 720.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">A cover 710 is installed over the manhole 700 in order to open or close the manhole 700. Accordingly, the oil leak sensor 10 and the connector 720 can be easily coupled.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram showing yet another embodiment of the present invention.

The polymer lines 721 are coupled by embedded lines 722 having electrical conductivity.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Furthermore, the polymer line 721 at the lowest is connected to a conductive line 723 and configured to receive sensing power from the controller 600.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The polymer line 721 at the highest is also connected to the controller 600 and configured to supply the controller 600 with a voltage value attributable to a change of a resistance value.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">An attachment layer 710 is stacked on a bottom surface of the base layer 720. An upper protection layer 730 is stacked on a top surface of the base layer 720. Sensing holes 731 are formed in the top surface of the base layer 720 so that the polymer lines 721 are externally exposed as in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Accordingly, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>, when the oil leak detection device is attached to the body of a wall in order to sense oil leak levels, the controller 600 is informed of a change in the resistance value of the polymer lines 721 at respective locations due to a change of an oil level.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The polymer lines 721 have the same width and length, and the lower end of one polymer line and the upper end of the other polymer line are placed on the same line. Accordingly, a continuous change of oil levels can be sensed based on a consecutive change of resistance values depending on the height of the polymer lines.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0042" num="0042">That is, if an oil leak sensor is lengthily installed upright and used as a water-level sensor as in the prior art, it is difficult to sense a continuous change of oil levels because of an interval between the sensing holes. However, the present invention is advantageous in that a consecutive change of oil levels can be sensed.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56976612" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An oil leak detection device, comprising:
