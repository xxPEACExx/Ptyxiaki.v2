More particularly, the present invention relates to a machine for manufacturing a multi-layer price tag in a continuous and efficient manner utilizing a combination of thermals transfer printers and automated label applicators. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the machine is able to manufacture a multi-layer price tag roll. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the machine is able to manufacture a plurality of individual multi-layer price tags.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Price tags are commonly used by the retail industry to provide information relating to the merchandise the price tags are attached to. Such information may include the price and Universal Product Code of the merchandise, the manufacturer of the merchandise, merchandise care instructions, and merchandise rebate or registration information.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Typically, merchandise is priced differently depending on where the merchandise is sold. For example, stores in Northern Europe will typically have prices higher than that of those in Southern Europe, despite the fact that all countries in Europe have adopted the Euro.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">To combat this issue, stores have resorted to double price tags having a perforation separating two price tags, with each separate price tag having a different price. However<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> this approach presents a couple of issues. First, a worker separating the double price tag must take extra care not to damage the price tag as he or she separates the price tag along the perforation. Although the perforation in the double price tag assists the worker in making a relatively clean tear, there still exists a chance that the double price tag will tear outside the perforation, thus necessitating the worker to attach a new double price tag to the merchandise and again attempt to cleanly tear the new double price tag along the perforation. Second, the tearing of the double price tag along the perforation does not necessarily lend to the tidiest appearance. Even if a worker takes extra care to cleanly tear the double price tag along the perforation, the perforated edge still appears ragged, and thus unsightly.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Another problem similar to the one presented above in regards to the multiple pricing system found in Europe relates to seasonal merchandise and trend setting merchandise. Typically, this type of merchandise has a very limited sellable "shelf life". Once the season has changed, or the fashion world has moved on to another trend, the merchandise must be marked down to a lower price point in order for the merchandise to be cleared from the sales floor to make room for the new fashion trend and/or the new season of merchandise.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Retail stores typically utilize "pricing guns" to mark down the price of merchandise. However, this approach also presents several issues. First, there exists a risk that customers may peel of the marked down price and place that marked down price on a higher priced item. Second, the retail store must keep additional supplies on hand in the store specifically for the purpose of operating the pricing gun. Such supplies may include extra pricing gun parts to repair a broken pricing gun, rolls of price tags for the pricing gun to mark the lower price on, and ink cartridges to allow the pricing gun to mark the price tags. These additional supplies may clutter the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> retail store, or maybe become lost, thereby rendering the pricing gun nonfunctional. Third, the use of tagging guns leads to an unsightly appearance of the merchandise. The price tags created by the tagging guns rarely mimics the appearance of the price tag provided by the merchandise manufacturer. Accordingly, once a price tag created by a tagging gun is applied to the price tag provided the merchandise manufacturer, the manufacturer's price tag may become cluttered looking.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Therefore, what is needed is an improved price tag and a method of manufacturing the improved price tag.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Brief Summary of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">By providing a multi-layer price tag and a machine for manufacturing the multi-layer price tag, the present invention overcomes the above enumerated problems.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The embodiments of the present invention described below are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed in the following detailed description. Rather, the embodiments are chosen and described so that others skilled in the art may appreciate and understand the principles and practices of the present invention.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention relates to a machine for manufacturing multi-layer price tags. The machine has a proximal end and a distal end. The machine further has a base. A frame is attached to the base toward the distal end of the machine. A secondary frame is attached to the base toward the proximal end of the machine. An unwinder is mounted to the frame toward the distal end of the machine. At least two printers are mounted to the frame, and at least one automated label applicator is mounted between the at least two printers. A rewinder is mounted to<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the secondary frame. The at least two printers are preferably thermal transfer printheads. The automated label applicator preferably utilizes either a low-stick or a non-stick adhesive. In an alternative embodiment of the machine, the rewinder is replaced by an automated label applicator mounted to the secondary frame</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention also relates to a method of manufacturing a multi-layer price tag roll. The method begins with the step of providing a machine having a base, a frame, a secondary frame, an unwinder, at least two printers, at least one automated label applicator, and a rewinder. Next, the method includes the step of providing a plurality of base layer labels on a base label roll and mounting the base label roll to the unwinder. Then, unwinding the base label roll from the unwinder to create a base label web. Next, one of the at least two printers prints a first information layer on the base label web to create a printed one-layer price tag web. Then, the method includes the step of applying a second layer of labels to the printed one-layer price tag web using the at least one automated label applicator to create an unprinted two-layer price tag web. Next, another one of the at least two printers prints a second information layer on the unprinted two-layer price tag web to create a completed multi-layer price tag web. Finally, the method concludes with the step of rewinding the completed multi-layer price tag web on the rewinder to create a multi-layer price tag roll.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present invention also relates to a method of manufacturing a plurality of multi-layer price tags.

Unless otherwise specified, like numbers in the figures indicate references to the same, similar, or corresponding elements throughout the figures. It will be appreciated that modifications to disclosed and described examples, arrangements, configurations, components, elements, apparatuses, methods, materials, etc. can be made and may be desired for a specific application.

The two-layer price tag 800 has a base layer 810 and a secondary layer 820. The secondary layer 820 is held to the base layer 810 by a low-stick/non-stick adhesive layer 830. Examples of suitable low-stick/non-stick adhesives for the adhesive layer 830 include, but are not limited to, removable adhesives, repositionable adhesives, low tack adhesives, frangible adhesives, and static adhesives. Preferably, the adhesive layer 830 will lose it's adhesive qualities after the secondary layer 820 is removed from the base layer 810 so as to prevent unscrupulous customers from removing a secondary layer from a price tag of a lower priced item and placing that secondary layer on a higher priced item. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURES1 and 2</figref>, it is contemplated that the secondary layer 820 may have dimensions slightly smaller than that of the base layer 810 to improve the application accuracy of the secondary layer 820 to the base layer 810.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In use, the base layer 810 is printed with information relating to a higher price, while the secondary layer 820 is printed with information relating to a lower price. When the two-layer price tag 800 is attached to merchandise that is delivered to an area with a lower pricing scheme, the secondary layer 820 remains on the two-layer price tag 800. If the merchandise is delivered to an area with a higher pricing scheme, the secondary layer 820 is easily peeled off to reveal the base layer 810 containing the higher price information. Similarly, when seasonal or trend setting merchandise is initially displayed, the secondary layer 820 remains on the two-layer price tag 800 to display the normal price information. Once the merchandise is out of season or is no longer in style, the secondary layer 820 can easily be removed to reveal the base layer 810. The process of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> peeling away the secondary layer 820 from the base layer 810 is much easier, faster, and neater than separating a perforated double price tag or using a pricing gun to apply a marked down price tag.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Similarly with respect to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 2A</figref> which shows a non-stick version of the price tag of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref>, 820 is the face stock, 830 the static adhesive, 840 is the synthetic layer, 850 a permanent adhesive and 810 the base layer. The material is available from Avery Dennison Corporation of Pasadena, CA.
