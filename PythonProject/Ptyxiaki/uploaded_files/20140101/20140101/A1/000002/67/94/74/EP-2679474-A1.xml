Initially, the trend was to make cars simply with fully flat underbodies with the sole objective of reducing aerodynamic drag. Later on, underbodies were shaped to reduce aerodynamic drag and also to increase downforce, i.e. so that the action of air (at high speeds) can generate a downward thrust on the car which increases road hold.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In order to increase downforce, it has been suggested to use an aerodynamic diffuser (or aerodynamic extractor) arranged in rear position, and comprising a chute, which constitutes the underbody of the car, faces the road surface, and has a height from the road surface which progressively increases when longitudinally moving from the front to the rear. At high speed, the air flowing underneath the car (i.e. between the underbody of the car and the road surface) crosses the aerodynamic diffuser and progressively increases its volume (as mentioned above, the aerodynamic diffuser has a height<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> from the road surface which progressively increases when longitudinally moving from the front to the rear) and thus tends to gradually reduce its pressure, generating a vacuum under the vehicle as a consequence; such a vacuum creates downforce, i.e. an aerodynamic thrust which pushes the car downwards.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, the aerodynamic development of the underbody of a car is subject to numerous geometry constraints deriving from the presence of dimensions which cannot be eliminated, such as the passenger compartment, the engine (particularly in the case of a mid or rear engine arrangement), the fuel tank, the exhaust system and the frame structure. These constraints considerably limit the extension of the shaped surfaces of the underbody intended to create downforce, and consequently in the known cars the underbody is completely flat to the rear part of the car (beyond the rear wheel axle) where the development of an aerodynamic diffuser starts. Consequently, in the known cars, the performance of the aerodynamic diffuser arranged on the underbody in rear position is adequate but not excellent (in particular if compared to the aerodynamic diffusers used on racing cars).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE4102073A1"><text>DE4102073A1</text></patcit> describes a car provided with an underbody which delimits the lower side of the car, faces the road surface and comprises an aerodynamic diffuser which is developed in rear position and has a chute, having a height from the road itself<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> which progressively increases when longitudinally moving from the front to the back; the underbody also comprises a pair of aerodynamic channels, each of which extends longitudinally, leads to a radiator of a "V"-engine arranged in rear position, is open at the bottom towards the road surface, and has a transverse section with an area which progressively increases when longitudinally moving from the front to the rear.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is the object of present invention to provide a car with underbody provided with aerodynamic diffuser, which car is free from the drawbacks described above, is easy and cost-effective to make and in particular allows to obtain a high downforce without impairing aerodynamic resistance.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the present invention a car with underbody provided with aerodynamic diffuser is provided as disclosed in the appended claims.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate some non-limitative embodiments thereof, in which:

The hinges 9 of the doors 8 are arranged in advanced position (approximately at the front wheels 3) and the rotation axis 10 of each hinge 9 forms an angle of approximately 30° with the horizontal and on a vertical plane arranged transversally with respect to the car 1, and forms an angle of approximately 50° with the horizontal and a vertical plane arranged longitudinally with respect to the car 1; in this manner, each hinge 9 confers an opening/closing movement which develops along a prevalently vertical plane to the corresponding door 8.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Each door 8 comprises the front portion of the wing of the corresponding front door 3 and the corresponding door sill (i.e. the portion of the vehicle normally arranged under the doors); thus, by effect of the fact that each door 8 comprises the corresponding door sill, no fixed component is present under the door 8 itself (i.e. no component is restrained to the door 8) when the door 8 is closed. In other words, the frame 2 stops flushed with the doors 8 and does not comprise any component arranged underneath the doors 8 themselves.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">figures 3-5</figref>, the car 1 comprises an underbody 11, which delimits the car 1 on the front (i.e. the lower part of the car 1) and faces the road surface. The underbody 11 comprises an aerodynamic diffuser 12 (or aerodynamic extractor) which is arranged in rear position and comprises a chute 13 having a height with respect to the road surface itself which<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> progressively increases when longitudinally moving from the front to the rear. The aerodynamic diffuser 12 is as wide as possible (i.e. has the maximum possible transversal width) and normally extends for at least all the space comprised between the two rear wheels 5. Normally, the aerodynamic diffuser 12 starts near the rear axle, but could start a little before (i.e. more towards the front) or a little after (i.e. more towards the rear) compatibly with the geometric constraints imposed by other components of the car 1.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">figures 3-5</figref>, the underbody 11 comprises a pair of aerodynamic channels 14 which are arranged on opposite sides of the car 1 and lead into the aerodynamic diffuser 12. Each aerodynamic channel 14 extends longitudinally between an inlet end 15 (front) which is arranged at a front wheel 3 and an outlet end 16 (rear) which leads into the aerodynamic diffuser 12. Preferably, the inlet end 15 of each aerodynamic channel 14 is arranged immediately behind a corresponding front wheel 3 and by the side, i.e. more internally, with respect to the corresponding front wheel 3 itself. Each aerodynamic channel 14 extends longitudinally from the front of the car 1 (i.e. from the front axle) to the rear of the car 1 (i.e. to the rear axle) and at the passenger compartment is arranged under a corresponding door 8. Furthermore, each aerodynamic channel 14 is arranged by the side, i.e. more internally, with respect to a corresponding rear wheel 5.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Each aerodynamic channel 14 has the shape of an upside-down "U" in its transverse section and is open underneath towards the road surface, and has in transverse section an area which progressively increases when longitudinally moving from the front to the rear. The conformation of the aerodynamic channels 14 is clearly illustrated in the section views shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">figures 6-8</figref> in which the upside-down "U" shape and the gradual increase of the area of the transverse section is apparent.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005">figures 5-8</figref>, at the door 8, there is a central segment of each aerodynamic channel 14 is arranged by the side, i.e. more externally, with respect to the frame 2 (i.e. with respect to a longitudinal bar 17 of the frame 2 which is the outermost part of the frame 2 itself). Consequently, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">figures 6-8</figref>, the central segment of each aerodynamic channel 14 is integral with the corresponding door 8 and thus moves together with the door 8 when the door 8 is opened. In other words, the part of the underbody 12 arranged at the door 8 (and provided with the central segment of the aerodynamic channel) is not fixed to the frame 2, but is fixed to the door 8 and thus moves together to the door 8 itself.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0006 f0007">figures 9-12</figref>, at the door 8, a central segment of each aerodynamic channel 14 is arranged underneath the frame 2, i.e. is obtained in the longitudinal bar 17 of the frame 2 which is the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> outermost part of the frame 2 itself. Consequently, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">figures 10-12</figref>, a central segment of each aerodynamic channel 14 is integral to the frame 2, is arranged under the door 8, and is completely independent from the door 8 itself; each longitudinal bar 17 of the frame 2 is arranged under a door 8 and constitutes the door sill (which is fixed and part of the frame 2). In other words, the part of the underbody 12 arranged at the door 8 (and provided with the central segment of the aerodynamic channel) is fixed to the frame 2, and is independent from the door 8 and thus remains fixed and does not move together to the door 8 itself.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the embodiment shown in the accompanying figures, the hinge 9 of each door 8 confers an opening/closing movement to the door 8 itself which develops along a mainly vertical plane; in a different embodiment (not shown) the rotation axis 10 of the hinge 9 of each door 8 is vertical and thus the hinge 9 of each door 8 confers an opening/closing movement to the door 8 itself which develops along a horizontal plane (i.e. in entirely conventional manner).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The car 1 described above has many advantages.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Firstly, the car 1 described above has an excellent aerodynamic efficiency, because the ratio between generated downforce and aerodynamic drag is very favorable (i.e. very high). The high aerodynamic efficiency is reached by virtue of the presence of aerodynamic channels 14 which start in very advanced<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> position (i.e. near the front axle) and are thus capable of increasing the air flow which is conveyed to the aerodynamic diffuser 12 and of significantly reducing turbulences (i.e. interferences) of the air which is conveyed to the aerodynamic diffuser 12, thus allowing the aerodynamic diffuser 12 to work in very favorable conditions. Furthermore, the presence of aerodynamic channels 14 not only does not increase aerodynamic drag, but, on the contrary, contributes to reducing aerodynamic drag because aerodynamic channels 14 allow to reduce turbulences (i.e. interferences) of the air which is conveyed to the aerodynamic diffuser 12 significantly.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">This by virtue of the fact that the central part of the aerodynamic channels 14 run on the sides of the frame 2 (and thus on the sides of the passenger compartment 7), the presence of the aerodynamic channels 14 is compatible with all the geometric constraints of the car 1.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Finally, by virtue of the fact that the aerodynamic channels 14 are carried by the doors 8, when the doors 8 are open the aerodynamic channels 14 are raised together with the doors 8 allowing passengers to get in and out of passenger compartment 7 of the car 1 easily; indeed, the passengers can rest their feet on the ground very close to the passenger compartment because they do not need to "climb over" the dimension of the aerodynamic channels 14.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977103" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A car (1) comprising:
