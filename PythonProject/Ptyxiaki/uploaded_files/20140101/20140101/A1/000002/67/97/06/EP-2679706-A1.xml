First, a raw material crystal ingot 1 is held by an upper holding jig 4 of an upper shaft 3 placed in a chamber 20. On the other hand, a seed (seed crystal) 8<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> of a single crystal with a small diameter is held by a lower holding jig 6 of a lower shaft 5 located below the raw material crystal ingot 1.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Next, the raw material crystal ingot 1 is melted by an induction heating coil 7 and is fusion-bonded to the seed crystal 8. Thereafter, a neck portion 9 is formed by necking to eliminate dislocation. Then, by moving the raw material crystal ingot 1 and a grown single crystal ingot 2 downward while rotating the upper shaft 3 and the lower shaft 5, a floating zone (also called a melt zone or molten melt) 10 is formed between the raw material crystal ingot 1 and the grown single crystal ingot 2, the floating zone 10 is moved to an upper end of the raw material crystal ingot 1, and zoning is performed, whereby the grown single crystal ingot 2 is grown.<br/>
Incidentally, this single crystal growth is performed in an atmosphere obtained by mixing a very small amount of nitrogen gas into Ar gas, and, in order to produce an N-type FZ single crystal, Ar-based PH<sub>3</sub> gas whose amount is determined based on resistivity to be produced is fed by a nozzle for spraying doping gas (doping nozzle) 11.<br/>

num="0021">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described more specifically.<br/>
As mentioned earlier, as larger-diameter single crystals have been required in recent years, more and more larger-diameter single crystals are being produced by the FZ method. However, if a large-diameter single crystal, in particular, a silicon single crystal with a diameter of 8 inches (200 mm) or more is produced by an existing manufacturing method, OSFs are generated frequently, which poses a problem.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The inventors of the present invention intensively studied the causes of OSFs that are generated when a large-diameter N-type silicon single crystal with a diameter of 6 inches (150 mm) or more, in particular, a diameter of 8 inches (200 mm) or more is produced by the FZ method. As a result, the inventors of the present invention have found out that, when a large-diameter single crystal is produced by the FZ method, a region in which interstitial silicon is predominant is generated on the periphery of the crystal and the interstitial silicon agglomerates together and becomes a nucleus, resulting in the generation of OSFs.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Thus, as a result of the inventors of the present invention focusing attention on the fact that B suppresses the generation of an interstitial silicon type dislocation cluster in the CZ method ("Silicon<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> Technology, No. 59, The Effect of Impurities on the Grown-in Defects in CZ-Si Crystals (B, C, N, O, Sb, As, P) Kozo Nakamura, Junsuke Tomioka") and further having kept conducting experiments and the like, the inventors of the present invention have found out that, in a method for producing an FZ silicon single crystal containing no oxygen, by performing B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> gas doping along with PH<sub>3</sub> gas doping during zoning to produce an N-type FZ single crystal and adding a very small amount of B to the single crystal, it is possible to suppress the generation of an interstitial silicon type dislocation cluster which can be an OSF nucleus and prevent the generation of OSFs, and have completed the present invention.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings, but the present invention is not limited thereto.<br/>
<figref idrefs="f0001">FIGs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref> are schematic diagrams of examples of a single crystal production apparatus used in a method for producing an N type FZ silicon single crystal of the present invention.<br/>
An FZ single crystal production apparatus 40 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> includes a chamber 20 that houses a raw material crystal ingot 1 and a grown single crystal ingot 2 and an induction heating coil 7 serving as a heat source for forming a floating zone (molten melt) 10 between the raw material crystal ingot 1 and the grown single crystal ingot 2. In addition, from a nozzle for spraying doping gas (doping nozzle) 11, Ar-based PH<sub>3</sub> gas for producing an N-type silicon single crystal and Ar-based B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> gas for preventing the generation of OSFs are mixed and fed.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In an FZ single crystal production apparatus 41 of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, from the doping nozzle 11, Ar-based PH<sub>3</sub> gas for producing an N-type silicon single crystal is fed, and, from a doping gas jetting port 12 located below the molten melt 10, Ar-based B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> gas for preventing the generation of OSFs is fed. The other configurations are almost the same as those of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the present invention, for example, by using such a single crystal production apparatus 40, an N-type silicon single crystal is produced in the following manner.<br/>
First, a portion of the silicon raw material ingot 1, the portion from which melting is started, is manufactured into the shape of a cone, and etching is performed on the surface to remove mechanical damage. Then, the silicon raw material ingot 1 is housed in the chamber 20 of the FZ single crystal production apparatus 40 depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> and is fixed to an upper holding jig 4 of an upper shaft 3 placed in the chamber 20 with a screw or the like. On the other hand, a seed crystal 8 is attached to a lower holding jig 6 of a lower shaft 5.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Next, a lower end of the cone portion of the silicon raw material ingot 1 is preliminarily heated by a carbon ring (not shown). Then, Ar gas containing nitrogen gas is fed from a lower part of the chamber 20 and the gas is exhausted from an upper part of the chamber to set the pressure at 0.15 MPa, the rate of flow of the Ar gas at 20 to 50 1/min, and the concentration of nitrogen in the chamber at 0.1 to 0.5%, for example. In addition, after heating and melting the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> silicon raw material ingot 1 by the induction heating coil 7, the tip of the cone portion is fusion-bonded to the seed crystal 8, dislocation is eliminated by a neck portion 9, and by moving the silicon raw material ingot 1 and the grown single crystal ingot 2 downward at a rate of 1 to 5 mm/min, for example, while rotating the upper shaft 3 and the lower shaft 5, the molten melt 10 is moved to an upper end of the silicon raw material ingot 1 and zoning is performed, whereby the silicon single crystal ingot 2 is grown.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">At this time, it is preferable that the growth of a single crystal is performed by displacing the upper shaft 3 which becomes a rotation center at the time of the growth of the silicon raw material ingot 1 from the lower shaft 5 which becomes a rotation center of the single crystal at the time of single crystallization (making the upper shaft 3 and the lower shaft 5 eccentric).
