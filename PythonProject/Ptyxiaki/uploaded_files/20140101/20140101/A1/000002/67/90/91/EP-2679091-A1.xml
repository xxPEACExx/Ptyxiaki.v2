When a Nylon<sup>™</sup> line or a fluorocarbon line without markings of line length such as color-coding of a polyethylene (PE) line is wound around a spool, the amount of line (the line length) released from the spool by a long cast can be roughly presumed based on the position where the fishing tackle enters water or the position where the line appears from water; however, it requires a skill to cast the fishing tackle to the same point again. Meanwhile, in boat fishing and floating fishing, the length of a fishing line released from the spool with a bail raised can be known only by sense; and it is difficult to reach a desired fishing depth by a method other than winding up from the bottom. Further, it is not easy to place fishing tackle into these positions or the fishing depth again.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Therefore, users are trying to repeatedly reach a same fishable point or depth by using the above mentioned stopper member, that is, by locking the fishing line on the stopper member at the timing of catching a fish in winding up the reel and then resuming winding up the fishing line in such a state. However, a conventional stopper member works only as a line stopper that simply nips a fishing line in a slit; when used for stopping a fishing line being released, such a stopper member may subject the fishing line to a sudden load upon stopping the fishing line at the portion locked by the stopper member, causing the fishing line to stretch or twist and to degrade, although the fishing line may not be broken due to bending of the rod.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">To overcome this problem, for example, Japanese Patent Application Publication No.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2010166852A"><text>2010-166852</text></patcit> (the "'852 Publication") discloses a technique wherein a stopper mechanism is positioned on an outer circumferential surface of a rear flange (skirt portion) of a spool on the drag knob side such that, when a load is imparted on the locked fishing line, a locking part of the stopper mechanism elastically moves along with the fishing line to absorb the load. In this stopper mechanism, the locking part has, for example, a boss shape (the shape of a spinning top) wherein a cylindrical shaft is provided on the middle of a disk; and the shaft is fitted into the spool and is biased by a spring in the spool in a direction opposite to the drag knob (i.e., in the direction opposite to the direction of releasing the fishing line).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In many cases, a spool of a fishing spinning reel is formed of a metal such as aluminum. The locking part of the stopper mechanism of the '852 Publication, which is formed of a hard resin or metal for strength, has a resin collar at a portion located inside the disk and contacting the fishing line such that the resin collar supports the fishing line. When a fishing line is locked by the stopper mechanism, the fishing line runs from the spool to turn round the locking part and returns to the spool.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Accordingly, the fishing line contacts the locking part and the spool at a portion where it is nipped between an edge of the disk of the locking part and an edge of a step formed in the spool, the step being formed to position the locking part on the spool so as to be movable. When the fishing line is released to the locking part, the load caused by the force of releasing the fishing line is imparted on the fishing line at the above portion, and the fishing line is moved forward (in the direction of releasing the fishing line) along with the locking part while being nipped between the edge of the disk and the edge of the spool. As a result of this movement, a same portion of the fishing line is repeatedly pressurized and rubbed for the number of times that the user stops releasing the fishing line by using the locking part. Therefore, the fishing line may be twisted, scratched, or altered in sectional shape (deformation). Further, finishing conditions of the edge of the portion in the spool that locks the fishing line may also be related to scratches in the fishing line. Therefore, proper rounding of the edge and careful removal of burr are required, in addition to simple shaving.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fishing reel having a spool for winding a fishing line, comprising: a hook positioned on a portion of an outer circumferential surface of the spool where no fishing line is wound, the hook<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> being configured to be movable in a direction of releasing the fishing line; a collar provided between the hook and the outer circumferential surface of the spool, the collar being configured to lock the fishing line in cooperation with the hook; and a biasing part configured to bias the hook and the collar in a direction opposite to a direction of releasing the fishing line, wherein, when the fishing line is released to a locked point where the fishing line is locked between the hook and the collar, the hook and the collar are moved integrally with the fishing line in the direction of releasing the fishing line under a biasing force produced by the biasing part.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A fishing reel is provided including a stopper mechanism that prevents damage on a fishing line and permits releasing a desired length of fishing line.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Preferably, the collar faces the lower surface of the hook and comprises: a cylindrical tube fitting around a shaft provided on the hook; a planar part for receiving the fishing line being locked; and an engagement part provided in periphery and having a semicircular curved shape with a hollow section, the engagement part being configured to retain the fishing line by bending, and the engagement part is positioned high enough such that, when the engagement part bends while retaining the fishing line, the fishing line does not contact the outer circumferential surface of the spool.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Preferably, the collar is positioned on a mounting surface, the mounting surface being formed in the outer circumferential surface of the spool so as to make a lower step, and the engagement part of the collar has, at a peripheral edge thereof, a guide surface for admitting the fishing line smoothly to inside the engagement part.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of operating a fishing line on a fishing reel having a spool comprising a hook positioned on a portion of an outer circumferential surface of the spool where no fishing line is wound, the hook being configured to be movable in a direction of releasing the fishing line, and a collar provided between the hook and the outer circumferential surface of the spool, the collar being configured to lock the fishing line in cooperation with the hook, the method comprising: biasing the hook and the collar in a direction opposite to a direction of releasing the fishing line; and, when the fishing line is released to a locked point where the fishing line is locked between the hook and the collar, moving the hook and the collar integrally with the fishing line in the direction of releasing the fishing line under<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> a biasing force.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">To achieve the above object, a fishing reel according to the embodiments of the prevent invention has a spool for winding a fishing line and comprises: a hook positioned on a portion of an outer circumferential surface of the spool where no fishing line is wound, the hook being configured to be movable in a direction of releasing the fishing line; a collar provided between the hook and the outer circumferential surface of the spool, the collar being configured to lock the fishing line in cooperation with the hook; and a biasing part configured to bias the hook and the collar in a direction opposite to a direction of releasing the fishing line, wherein, when the fishing line is released to a locked point where the fishing line is locked between the hook and the collar, the hook and the collar are moved integrally with the fishing line in the direction of releasing the fishing line under a biasing force produced by the biasing part.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The present invention provides a fishing reel including a stopper mechanism that prevents damage on a fishing line and permits releasing a desired length of fishing line.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:

The inner surface of this hollow part may be smoothly continuous with the cylindrical shaft 22b via a curved surface. The lower part of the cylindrical shaft 22b may include a smaller diameter portion deepened from the outer circumferential surface and forming a washer groove 22e in the circumference of the shaft. The locking part 22 may be formed of a light metal such as aluminum, a hard resin, or ceramics, but are not limited thereto.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The collar 23 may include a cylindrical tube 23a fitting around the cylindrical shaft 22b of the locking part 22, a planar part 23b for receiving the fishing line 15 to be locked, and an engagement part 23c provided at the outer circumferential edge and having a semicircular curved shape with a hollow section, the engagement part 23c being configured to retain the fishing line 15 by bending. The collar 23 may be formed annularly of a soft resin or a rubber having an elastic force.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The collar 23 may be integrally mounted on the hook 22a by fitting the cylindrical tube 23a around the cylindrical shaft 22b; and the lower surface of the hook 22a may face the upper surface of the planar part 23b and the engagement part 23c of the collar 23. The<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> engagement part 23c may be positioned high enough relative to the surface 27 such that, when the engagement part 23c bends while retaining the fishing line 15, the fishing line 15 does not contact the surface 27.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The mounting surface 27a of the spool 7 may have an elongated hole 28 for movement of the locking part 22 fitted into the collar 23. This elongated hole 28 may extend, for example, in the same axial direction as the spool shaft 13; and its length may be designated in design based on the distance traveled by the locking part 22.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Fitted into the elongated hole 28 so as to be capable of moving may be the cylindrical shaft 22b fitted into the cylindrical tube 23a. Also, the cylindrical tube 23a, which penetrates the elongated hole 28, may be provided with a coil spring 24 fitted therearound that serves as a biasing member. The coil spring 24 may abut at its end against a fixed surface provided in the spool 7 and bias the locking part 22 in the direction along the spool shaft opposite to the release of the fishing line, while biasing the hook 22a in the direction toward the surface 27 of the spool 7 via the washer 25, the retaining ring 26, and the cylindrical shaft 22b. The biasing force of the coil spring 24 may be designated based on the load presumed from the weight of fishing tackle or the like used with the reel. The biasing member may also be, for example, a plate spring or a rubber member.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Additionally, at the portion of the outer curved surface of the engagement part 23c of the collar 23 abutting against the surface 27 of the spool 7, a guide surface 23d chamfered to readily admit the fishing line 15 to the planar part 23b inside the engagement part 23c may be formed in the outer circumferential edge of the engagement part 23. If the surface 27 of the spool 7 is also provided with a chamfered guide surface, the fishing line 15 can be more smoothly admitted to the planar part 23b.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The functions of the stopper mechanism 21 as configured above will now be described.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In fishing, a user may hook the fishing line 15 on the hook 22a at the point where a fish was caught or at a fishing depth and draw the fishing line inwardly from the engagement part 23c of the collar 23 via the guide surface 23d to lock it on the planar part 23b. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the fishing line 15 at this moment may run from the spool 7 into the stopper mechanism 21 obliquely with respect to the spool shaft, hook on the hook 22a,<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> and return obliquely. The user may rotate the handle 10 with the fishing line 15 locked, such that the bail 5 is rotated and the fishing line 15 is wound around the spool 7.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Next, to cast fishing tackle or adjust the fishing depth, the user may turn the bail 5 back such that the fishing line 15 is freely released from the spool 7. When the fishing line 15 is released to the locked point, the fishing line 15 may be subjected to a load caused by the cast fishing tackle; and the locking part 22 may be moved integrally with the collar 23 in the direction of releasing the fishing line (the spool shaft direction, or X axis direction) while locking the fishing line 15. At this moment, the fishing line 15 may be moved in the direction of release along with the hook 22a of the locking part 22 and the planar part 23b of the collar 23 while being held therebetween, without contacting the surface 27 of the spool 7. In this movement, the coil spring 24 serving as a biasing member may exercise a biasing force in the direction opposite to the release of the fishing line and lower the moving speed (momentum) of the locking part 22, such that the load is gently imparted on the fishing line 15.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">According to the embodiments described above, the fishing line 15 may be held between the hook 22a of the locking part and the collar 23 moving integrally, and may not contact the surface or edge of the spool 7. Therefore, the fishing line 15 may not be scratched. Therefore, there is no necessity of a careful surface treatment on the spool 7 (removal of burr and rounding of corners) that used to be necessary because the fishing line contacts the spool 7.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Additionally, the guide surface 23d may be provided across the engagement part 23c of the collar 23 and the surface of the spool 7 contacting therewith, in particular, in the peripheral edge of the collar 23, such that the fishing line can be readily inserted from the engagement part 23c and locked by the bending of the engagement part 23c of the collar 23.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Locking the fishing line 15 on the spool 7 may enable repeatedly reaching a same preferable point in casting fishing tackle or adjusting the fishing depth; and movement of the locking part relieves the load on the fishing line and prevents damages on the fishing line 15 such as stretching and twisting. Further, the fishing line does not contact the spool 7 even when the locking part 22 is moved; therefore the fishing line can be prevented from being damaged by rubbing, which used to be a problem.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Embodiments of the present invention have been described with particular reference to the examples illustrated.
