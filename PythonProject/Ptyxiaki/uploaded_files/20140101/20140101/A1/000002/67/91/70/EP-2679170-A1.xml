In order to prevent such an adhesion, an anti-adhesive material is used. A sheet-like anti-adhesive material is attached below an incisional wound. However, since the tissue below an incisional wound moves, the incisional wound and the tissue cannot be surely isolated. Also, it is difficult to attach the anti-adhesive material over the incisional wound after a laparotomy.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">On the other hand, there is a method of applying a liquid anti-adhesive material using a sprayer in which an incised portion is sutured in a state of leaving a part of the incised portion as an opening and a nozzle of the sprayer is inserted from the opening (for example, see <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2008289617A"><text>JP 2008-289617 A</text></patcit>). However, in the case of a laparotomy, the direction of a nozzle and the distance from the nozzle to a target site cannot be directly viewed, and whether or not the anti-adhesive material is sprayed toward the incisional wound is not known. In the case of a laparoscopic surgery, the direction of a nozzle and the distance from the nozzle to a target site is difficult to be known using a monitor. Therefore, uneven spraying and increased use of a drug are caused.</p><heading id="h0003">Summary of Invention</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">The present invention has been made in view of such a problem. An object of the present invention is to provide a sprayer capable of applying a drug to an exact site.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> In order to achieve the above object, the present invention is a sprayer that discharges a drug and applies the discharged drug to a target site, including: a sprayer body; a nozzle that extends from the sprayer body; and an irradiation unit disposed to an leading end of the nozzle and emitting light that is oriented and diffuses in a leading end direction of the nozzle.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to the above configuration, diffused light is irradiated in a direction oriented by the nozzle by the irradiation unit disposed to the leading end of the nozzle. Therefore, a direction of the leading end of the nozzle and an approximate distance to an irradiated site can be predicted based on a position irradiated by the light and a size of the irradiated site. Thus, the drug can be applied to an exact site.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the above-described sprayer, the nozzle includes: an elongated nozzle body extending from the sprayer body and having a curved portion on a leading end side thereof; and a nozzle head disposed on the leading end of the nozzle body. The irradiation unit may be placed inside a curve shape of the curved portion.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Thus, when a drug is discharged while the nozzle is directed upward, the irradiation unit is placed on the opposite side to a side where the drug is likely to drop from the leading end of the nozzle. Accordingly, the drug is unlikely to attach to the irradiation unit. Therefore, the irradiation unit can surely irradiate light in a direction oriented by the leading end of the nozzle. Also, the position oriented by the leading end of the nozzle can be easily aligned with an incisional wound or a wound.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the above-described sprayer, the nozzle may be configured to spray a drug, so that a diffusion diameter of the drug discharged from the nozzle and a diffusion diameter of the light emitted from the irradiation unit are substantially the same.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Accordingly, a diffusion range (a size) of the irradiated light and a spray range by discharge of a drug become approximately the same. Thus, the spray range of a drug can be predicted based on a size of the diffusion diameter of the light. Therefore, a drug can be easily applied to a desired range.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the above-described sprayer, the irradiation unit may include a light source. Furthermore, a conductive member that conducts an electric current from a power source unit to the light source may be arranged along the nozzle. Also, in this case, in the above-described sprayer, the nozzle may include: an elongated nozzle body extending from the sprayer body and having an elastic curved portion on a leading end side thereof; and a nozzle head disposed on the leading end of the nozzle body. The sprayer may further include a shape regulating member being movably disposed along a longitudinal direction of the nozzle body and changing a shape of the curved portion depending on the longitudinal position. The conductive member may be arranged through an inside of the shape regulating member.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Thus, by providing a light source on a leading end of a nozzle and conducting an electric current to the light source via a conductive member, a structure of irradiating light in a leading end direction of the nozzle can be structured at low cost. Also, since the conductive member is covered by a shape regulating member, the conductive member can be easily and compactly wired along the nozzle.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the above-described sprayer, the irradiation unit may be structured by a lens that diffuses light. A light-guiding member that guides light from the light source to the lens may be arranged along the nozzle. Also, in this case, the nozzle may include: an elongated nozzle body extending from the sprayer body and having an elastic curved portion on a leading end side thereof; and a nozzle head disposed on the leading end of the nozzle body. The sprayer may further include a shape regulating member being movably disposed along a longitudinal direction of the nozzle body and changing a shape of the curved portion depending on the longitudinal position. The conductive member may be arranged through an inside of the shape regulating member.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Thus, by configuring so as to provide the lens on the leading end of the nozzle and guide light to the lens via the light-guiding member, the leading end of the nozzle can be structured in a compact manner. Also, since the light-guiding member is covered by the shape regulating member, the light-guiding member can be easily wired along the nozzle.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to the sprayer of the present invention, a drug can be applied to an exact site.</p><heading id="h0004">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a partially omitted perspective view of a sprayer according to an embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a partially omitted perspective view of a nozzle of the sprayer depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a partially omitted perspective view of the leading end portion of the nozzle of the sprayer depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</li><li>In <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4, Fig. 4A</figref> is a schematic view of the sprayer with the curved portion of the nozzle being curved, and <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4B</figref> is a schematic view of the sprayer with the curved portion of the nozzle being regulated linearly.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> is a schematic illustrative view of a maneuver using the sprayer depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> is a partially omitted perspective view of a sprayer including a wiring structure according to a modification.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> is a partially omitted perspective view of a sprayer according to another embodiment of the present invention.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Description of Embodiments</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">Preferred embodiments of a sprayer according to the present invention will be mentioned below, and explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a partially omitted perspective view of a sprayer 10 according to an embodiment. The sprayer 10 is configured to apply two types of liquids each having a different composition (hereinafter, the two types of liquids will be referred to as a "first liquid" and a "second liquid" for the convenience of explanation) while mixing the two liquids. The sprayer 10 is a spray device including a syringe (a sprayer body) 12 having a first syringe (a supply unit) 12a and a second syringe (a supply unit) 12b arranged in parallel and integrally linked together, and a nozzle 14 being connected to each leading end of the syringe 12 thereby to spray the first liquid and the second liquid filled in the syringe 12 toward an application target.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The sprayer 10 is used, for example, as a medical device configured to spray a solution of a drug as a mixture of the first and second liquids to an organ, an abdominal wall and the like while mixing in the nozzle 14 the first and second liquids each having a different liquid composition and being supplied from the syringe 12, in a state of inserting the nozzle 14 in an abdominal cavity, during a laparoscopic surgery.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The syringe 12 includes the first syringe 12a and the second syringe 12b corresponding to the two types of liquids to be mixed in the nozzle 14 and sprayed. The syringe 12 is used by filling liquid in the first syringe 12a and filling liquid in the second syringe 12b. In the present embodiment, the first syringe 12a and the second syringe 12b have a substantially similar structure except that the first and second syringes 12a and 12b have different outer diameters and air volumes. Therefore, the first syringe 12a will be exemplarily explained by affixing "a" to a reference sign (number), and a detailed explanation on the second syringe 12b will be omitted by affixing "b" to the reference sign (number) of the corresponding component of the first syringe 12a. It is needless to add that the first syringe 12a and the second syringe 12b may be configured to have the same diameter.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The first syringe 12a includes an outer cylinder (cylinder) 20a having a reduced-diameter communication port (discharge port) 18a disposed at the leading end thereof, a gasket 22a capable of liquid-tightly sliding in the outer cylinder 20a, and a plunger (plunger rod) 24a for moving the gasket 22a in an axial direction of the outer cylinder 20a. The communication port 18a is an opening for communicating liquid inside and outside the outer cylinder 20a, and a tapered convex portion projecting from a leading end surface of the outer cylinder 20a.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">An elliptical sheet-like flange 26, on which an index finger, a middle finger or the like is placed when an operator manipulates the plunger 24a, is formed around the base end outer periphery of the outer cylinder 20a. The flange 26 is formed integrally with the base end outer periphery of an outer cylinder 20b of the second syringe 12b. A guide member 28 is inserted and fitted in the base end-side openings of the outer cylinders 20a and 20b. The<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> guide member 28 is configured to guide forward and backward movements of the plungers 24a and 24b.

Therefore, the irradiation unit 100 (in particular, the lens 104) is not blocked by the anti-adhesive material M, and the irradiation unit 100 can surely irradiate light in a direction oriented by the leading end of the nozzle 14.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Furthermore, in a case of placing the irradiation unit 100 inside a curve shape of the curved portion 84 as in the present embodiment, when the nozzle 14 is placed so that the nozzle head 78 is tilted upward, the irradiation unit 100 is positioned on an axis of the nozzle 14 when viewed from the upper side. Therefore, the position oriented by the leading end of the nozzle 14 is easily aligned with the position of the suture portion 122, so that the anti-adhesive material M can be more precisely applied to a desired target position.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">When the anti-adhesive material M has been applied on the suture portion 122 to the terminal (i.e., a site close to the opening 124) as described above, the nozzle 14 is retrieved from the abdominal cavity 119, and the peritoneum 120 is lowered. The remained portion (the opening 124) is sutured, and the surgery is completed.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">As understood from the above description, by using the sprayer 10 according to the present invention, a first application method as described below can be implemented. That is, the first application method is a method of discharging a drug (an anti-adhesive material M) and applying the discharged drug to a target site, including: a step of inserting a leading end of a nozzle 14 of a sprayer 10 into a space (an abdominal cavity 119) between an organ 121 and a membranous tissue (a peritoneum 120) through a hole (an opening 124) formed in the membranous tissue covering the organ 121 of a living body; a step of irradiating, to the membranous tissue, diffused light L that is oriented and diffuses in a leading end direction of the nozzle 14, from a back side of the<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> membranous tissue; a step of adjusting a position and a direction of the nozzle 14 so that an irradiated site of the diffused light L to the membranous tissue is aligned with an application target site; and a step of discharging the drug from the leading end of the nozzle 14.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Next, as a second example of the application method, a case of application of an anti-adhesive material to a wound in a laparoscopic surgery will be described.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">After a predetermined surgical treatment (for example, incision, ablation, cauterization and suture) has been performed to an affected area (a living body tissue) under a laparoscope, and cleaning and hemostasis of the wound has been finished, the power source unit 101 is manipulated to cause the light source 102 of the irradiation unit 100 to emit light, and the nozzle 14 is inserted into an abdominal cavity.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Next, the position and the direction of the nozzle 14 are adjusted while checking the application target position (the affected area) through the laparoscope (the camera), so that the size (the diameter) of the irradiated site becomes a desired spray diameter (for example, 2.5 to 3.5cm).</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">After such an adjustment, the manipulation unit 24d is pressed toward the leading end side to discharge (spray) the anti-adhesive material M from the leading end of the nozzle 14. This enables the anti-adhesive material to be applied to an exact site. Also, since the spray range of the anti-adhesive material can be precisely predicted based on the size of the diffusion diameter of the light, the anti-adhesive material can be easily applied to the desired range.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">When the target site has been confirmed to turn to the color of the anti-adhesive material (for example, white when the anti-adhesive material is white), the discharging of the anti-adhesive material is terminated. Then, a pneumoperitoneum is completed in the usual manner to finish the surgery.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">As understood from the above description, by using the sprayer 10 according to the present invention, a second application method as described below can be implemented. That is, the second application method is a method<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> of discharging a drug(an anti-adhesive material M) and applying the discharged drug to a target site, including: a step of inserting a leading end of a nozzle 14 of a sprayer 10 into an abdominal cavity 119 of a living body through a hole formed on an abdominal wall of the living body; a step of irradiating, to a living body tissue in the abdominal cavity 119, diffused light L that is oriented and diffuses in a leading end direction of the nozzle 14; a step of adjusting a position and a direction of the nozzle 14 while checking an inside of the abdominal cavity 119 through a laparoscope so that an irradiated site of the diffused light L to the living body tissue is aligned with the application target site; and a step of discharging the drug from the leading end of the nozzle 14.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">As described above, according to the sprayer 10 of the present embodiment, since the irradiation unit 100 emitting light that widens toward the end is provided to the leading end of the nozzle 14, the direction of the leading end of the nozzle 14 and the distance to the object can be known based on the position and the size (the diameter) of the light in the irradiated site. This allows the anti-adhesive material to be applied to an exact site.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Also, in the present embodiment, the light source 102 is provided to the leading end of the nozzle 14, and an electric current is conducted to the light source 102 via the lead wires 103a and 103b arranged along the nozzle body 74. Therefore, a structure of irradiating light in the leading end direction of the nozzle 14 can be structured at low cost.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">Furthermore, since the irradiation unit 100 is placed inside a curve shape of the curved portion 84, the anti-adhesive material M is inhibited from attaching to the irradiation unit 100, and the position oriented by the leading end of the nozzle 14 can be easily aligned with the suture portion 122 (an incisional wound) or a wound.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">Still furthermore, in the present embodiment, the lead wires 103a and 103b are arranged inside the sheath 21 that is a member for regulating the shape of the curved portion 84 of the nozzle 14, so that the lead wires 103a and 103b are covered by the sheath 21. Accordingly, the lead wires 103a and 103b can be easily and compactly wired along the nozzle 14.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089"><!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> When the sprayer 10 is used in a laparotomy, the color of the light emitted by the light source 102 may have a wavelength that is easily absorbed by the anti-adhesive material. In this case, since brightness of the irradiated site when viewed from the outside changes depending on an amount of application, an amount of the anti-adhesive material applied to the target site can be easily known by using the brightness as an indication. This enables the anti-adhesive material to be uniformly applied along the suture portion 122 (can reduce uneven application), and can reduce a use amount of the anti-adhesive material.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">Instead of the above-described wiring structure in which the lead wires 103a and 103b are arranged so as to pass inside the sheath 21, there may be employed a wiring structure in which, like the sprayer 10 depicted in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>, the lead wires 103a and 103b are fixed to an outer periphery of the sheath 21 with a plurality of fixing devices 130 thereby to arrange the lead wires 103a and 103b along the nozzle 14.

In a natural state (a state without any external force applied), the spacing between both ends is smaller than an outer diameter of the sheath 21. Such a fixing device 130 can be made of various metals, alloys, resins and the like each having elasticity. The plurality of fixing devices 130 configured as describe above are mounted to the sheath 21 in a state of inserting the lead wires 103a and 103b into the concave 132 of each of the fixing devices 130, thereby integrally fixing the lead wires 103a and 103b to the outer periphery of the sheath 21.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">Next, a sprayer 140 according to the second embodiment will be described below with reference to <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>.
