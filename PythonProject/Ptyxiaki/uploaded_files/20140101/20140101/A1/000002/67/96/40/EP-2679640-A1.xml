Inkjet systems that use these ultraviolet-curable inks have fast-drying properties, so that recording can be achieved on recording materials which lack ink absorbing properties, and therefore, attention has been paid to these inkjet systems in recent years.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, in an image forming method using these ultraviolet-curable inkjet systems, there is a problem that adjoining dots coalesce at the time of high speed recording (for example, in the case of a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> line recording system, conveyance speed of the recording material: 30 m/s or higher, and in the case of a serial (shuttle) recording system, printing speed: 50 m<sup>2</sup>/hr or higher), and the image quality deteriorates.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As a technology which is capable of inkjet recording regardless of the kind of the recording material and prevents "coalescence of adjoining dots" that becomes a problem at the time of inkjet recording, it is known to use a UV-curable ink containing a gelling agent (see Patent Literatures (hereinafter, abbreviated as PTL) 1 to 3).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For example, PTL 1 discloses an inkjet ink containing an oil gelling agent and a photopolymerizable compound, and cationic polymerizable compounds or radical polymerizable compounds are disclosed as the photopolymerizable compounds.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Furthermore, PTL 2 discloses a phase change ink containing a curable monomer, a gelling agent, a branched polymer having a photoinitiator moiety in the molecule, and a coloring material, and radical polymerizable compounds are disclosed as the curable monomer.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">PTL 3 discloses a phase change ink containing a white pigment, a curable monomer, a gelling agent and a photoinitiator, and radical polymerizable compounds are disclosed as the curable monomer.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">However, in these ink compositions disclosed in PTL 1 to 3, control of dot coalescence at the time of high speed recording such as described above is still insufficient. Furthermore, there is a problem that ejection stability is not sufficient, and high quality images cannot be formed with satisfactory reproducibility.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Furthermore, in general UV-curable inks, the problem that printed matters curl up as a result of curing shrinkage at the time of UV irradiation,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> or that when a printed matter is bent, the image film is damaged, is prevented by using the relative low molecular weight, monofunctional and bifunctional radical polymerizable compounds disclosed in PTL 1 to 3 as the polymerizable compounds. However, in inks containing a gelling agent and a photopolymerizable compound, when a relatively low molecular weight radical polymerizable compound having a molecular weight of less than 300 is used, there is a problem that the stability of the ink composition at a temperature capable of ink ejection becomes insufficient, or there is a problem in terms of environmental hygiene that the foul odor of the ink itself or the foul odor of the printed matter after curing, is strong.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As a technology of suppressing curing shrinkage without impairing curability, it is well known to use the trifunctional or higher-functional polymerizable compound having an ethylene oxide (EO) unit in the molecule as disclosed in PTL 1. However, when a polyfunctional polymerizable compound of trifunctionality or higher functionality having many ethylene oxide (EO) units in the molecule is used in a large amount, hydrophilicity of the ink as a whole becomes very high. Therefore, it is difficult to allow a gelling agent to exist stably in a highly hydrophilic ink, and an ultraviolet-curable inkjet ink composition which satisfies all of high image quality, curability, curing shrinkage has not been known.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><ul><li>PTL 1<br/>

Regarding the dispersing medium, dispersion is carried out using a solvent or a polymerizable compound, but the irradiated radiation-curable ink used in the present invention is preferably solvent-free, in order to induce reaction and curing immediately after the impact of the ink. If the solvent remains on a cured image, there may be problems of deterioration of solvent resistance, and the VOC of remaining solvent. Therefore, for the dispersing medium, it is preferable to select not a solvent, but a polymerizable compound, among others, a monomer having the lowest viscosity, in view of adaptability to dispersion.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">In regard to the dispersion of the pigment, it is preferable to adjust the average particle size of the pigment particles to 0.08 µm to 0.2 µm, and<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> the maximum particle size is 0.3 µm to 10 µm, and preferably 0.3 µm to 3 µm. In order to carry out adjustment of the average particle size of the pigment, the selection, dispersing conditions and filtering conditions for the pigment, dispersant and dispersing medium are appropriately set up. Through this management of the particle size, clogging of the head nozzle is suppressed, and storage stability of the ink, ink transparency, and curing sensitivity can be maintained.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">Furthermore, the active ray-curable inkjet ink of the present invention can use conventionally known dyes, and preferably oil-soluble dyes, as necessary.

The reason is that surface asperities occur at the surface of image films, and image gloss is decreased. The inventors of the present invention found that such image gloss can be adjusted irrespective of the kind of the gelling agent, by adjusting the temperature of the recording material at the time when the ink impacts on the recording material, to the range of (sol-gel phase transition temperature + -20°C) to (sol-gel phase transition temperature + -10°C) of the ink.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">In order to carry out this image gloss adjustment by temperature<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> regulation, it is necessary that the gelling agent exist stably in the polymerizable compounds that are solvents, and the constitution of the present invention is particularly preferred in this point of view.</p><heading id="h0021">(Conditions for ejection of ink)</heading><p id="p0084" num="0084">In regard to the conditions for ejection of the ink of the present invention, it is preferable to heat the inkjet recording head, the ink flow channel, and the ink to 80°C to 120°C and eject the ink, from the viewpoint of ejection stability.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">In order to eject the ink stably from the inkjet recording head, the ink viscosity at the ejection temperature is necessarily adjusted to 7 mPa·s to 14 mPa·s.</p><heading id="h0022">(Image forming method)</heading><p id="p0086" num="0086">The image forming method of the present invention is such that regarding the conditions for irradiation of an active ray, the active ray is preferably irradiated within 0.001 seconds to 1.0 second, and more preferably 0.001 seconds to 0.5 seconds, after the impact of the ink.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">An image forming method of line recording mode, in which the constitution of the present invention is more effective, will be described.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example of the configuration of the essential part of an inkjet recording apparatus. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref> is a lateral view, and <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1B</figref> is a top view.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">The inkjet recording apparatus illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is referred to as line recording mode, in which inkjet recording heads 3 for each color ink are disposed on a head carriage 2 such that the inkjet recording heads cover the entire width of the recording material, and plural head carriages are disposed and fixed. An image is formed when a recording material is<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> conveyed beneath these fixed head carriages 2.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">The conveyance speed of the recording material is preferably 30 m/s to 120 m/s. As the conveyance speed is faster, the rate of image formation becomes faster, which is preferable. However, if the conveyance speed is too fast, the image quality is deteriorated, or photocuring (will be described below) of the ink becomes insufficient.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">The number of the inkjet recording heads 3 that are used for each color in the conveyance direction of the recording material, varies depending on the nozzle density of the head used and the resolution at the time of printing. For example, in the case where it is wished to form an image at a resolution of 1440 dpi using a head with a droplet amount of 2 pl and a nozzle density of 360 dpi, an image of 1440×1440 dpi can be formed by disposing four inkjet recording heads 3 in a shifted manner in the conveyance direction of the recording material. In the case where it is wished to form an image at a resolution of 720x720 dpi using a head with a droplet amount of 6 pl and a nozzle density of 360 dpi, an image of 720 dpi can be formed by disposing two inkjet recording heads 3 in a shifted manner. The term dpi as used in the present invention means the number of dots per 2.54 cm.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">On the downstream side of the head carriages 2, a metal halide lamp or LED 1 is disposed so as to cover the entire width of the recording material. After the ink impacts on the recording material, ultraviolet radiation is rapidly irradiated by the lamp, and thus an image is completely fixed.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">The light source used for the irradiation after image formation is preferably a light source capable of emitting UV light at a high illuminance<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> such as an illuminance of 100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> or higher, such as a high pressure mercury lamp, a metal halide lamp or an LED. Among them, an LED that consumes less electric power is preferred, but there are no limitations thereon.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">Meanwhile, regarding LED 1 in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, a water cooled LED at 395 nm manufactured by Phoseon Technology, Inc. is used.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">According to the present invention, it is preferable to form an image by ejecting small liquid droplets at a droplet amount of 0.5 pl to 2.5 pl. When the droplet amount is adjusted to the range described above, high precision images can be formed, and the problem of the surface asperities of the image film as described above is also alleviated. However, in the case of ejecting small droplets in a droplet amount in the range described above, stable image formation is not achieved if the ink stability is not satisfactory. From that point of view, the constitution of the present invention provides excellent ink stability, does not cause a problem even if the ink is ejected as small liquid droplets in a droplet amount of 0.5 pl to 2.5 pl, and can form high precision images in a stable manner.</p><heading id="h0023">Examples</heading><p id="p0096" num="0096">Hereinafter, the present invention will be specifically described by way of Examples, but the embodiments of the present invention are not intended to be limited to these examples.</p><heading id="h0024">«Preparation of pigment dispersion liquid»</heading><p id="p0097" num="0097">Pigments were dispersed by the following procedure.
