<ul><li>Patent document : <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2007211387A"><text>JP-A-2007-211387</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, the padding sometimes leans to one side or migrate under its own weight in the condition that it is sandwiched between the outer layers. For preventing this, the padding is quilted, and the cloth of the skin-side outer layer and the cloth of superficial-side outer layer are sewed together to prevent the padding from leaning to one side or migrating. When plenty of cotton is used from the view point of heat retention, the weight increases, and the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> whole clothing becomes bulky. Also, use of cotton limits the size in the folded state for storage. Also cotton requires a long drying time when it is once wet, and has difficulty in using in the rainy weather. While feather may be used in place of cotton, the problems of leaning to one side, migration under its own weight and leakage have not been dissolved, and there is still the problem of high cost. In this case, whole washing by a washing machine is not allowed, so that special care should be taken in handling.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The present invention has been devised in consideration of the above problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a laminate of cloths, and clothing and bedding using this laminate realizing light weight, compactness in the folded state, quick-drying property, heat retention, low cost, and freeness from maintenance.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For solving the above problem, the present invention provides a laminate of cloths, having a first outer layer, a second outer layer, and an inner layer disposed between the first outer layer and the second outer layer, and a layer thickness of the inner layer disposed between the first outer layer and the second outer layer is formed to be larger than a cloth thickness of the inner layer, and a space part is formed between the first outer layer and the second outer layer.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to this configuration, since it is possible to desirable form the space part between the first outer layer and the second outer layer because the layer thickness of the inner layer is formed to be larger than the cloth thickness of the inner layer, it is possible to provide a laminate of cloths, realizing light weight, compactness in the folded state, quick-drying property, low cost, and freeness from maintenance.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As one embodiment of the present invention, clothing or bedding is configured to have a laminate of cloths. Clothing is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include a vest type, a short-sleeved type, a long-sleeved type, a breeches type, a trousers type, a head-wear, gloves, socks, a balaclava, a shawl, a loincloth, a muffler and the like. In addition, the bedding is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include a sleeping bag, a comforter, a futon mattress, a pillow, a blanket and the like.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the aforementioned invention, the cloth of the inner layer may be made of any thread material by any weaving or knitting without any particular limitation, and may undergo various<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> finish treatments (for example, moisture permeable and waterproofing finish, water repellent finish, repelling finish, antimicrobial deodorant finish and so on) as appropriate. The cloth of the inner layer is, for example, a knitted tissue, a woven tissue, or a nonwoven fabric. The inner layer cloth may have a monolayer structure or a multilayer structure, however, a monolayer is more preferred from the view point of weight reduction. The inner layer cloth may be of synthetic fibers such as polyester, nylon or the like, or may be natural fibers. The inner layer cloth may be formed of one kind of fibers, or may be formed of combination of plural kinds of fibers. Also, original yarns (fibers) of the inner layer cloth may undergo the various finish treatments as described above.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the present invention, the cloths of the first and the second outer layers may be made of any thread material in any sewing method without any particular limitation, and may undergo various finish treatments (for example, moisture permeable and waterproofing finish, water repellent finish, repelling finish, antimicrobial deodorant finish and so on) as appropriate. The cloths of the first and the second outer layers may be the same or different. The cloths of the first and the second outer layers are, for example, a knitted tissue, a woven tissue, or a nonwoven fabric. The cloths of the first and the second outer layers may have a monolayer structure or a multilayer structure, however, a monolayer is more preferred from the view point of weight reduction. The cloths of the first and the second outer layers may be of synthetic fibers such as polyester, nylon or the like, or may be natural fibers. The cloths of the first and the second outer layers may be formed of one kind of fibers, or may be formed of combination of plural kinds of fibers. Also, original yarns (fibers) of the cloths of the first and the second outer layers may undergo the various finish treatments as described above.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the present invention, it is preferred that the cloth surface is rugged for providing a space part by making the layer thickness of the inner layer larger than the thickness of the inner layer cloth itself. Also, the inner layer cloth may be made of permanent-press resin fibers, or may partially contain the same to keep the rugged shape of the cloth surface.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">While the cloth of the inner layer is disposed between the first outer layer and the second outer layer, it is not necessarily disposed between the first outer layer and the second outer layer, and depending on the clothing (shape of the clothing, shape of the part of the clothing, need and purpose of the part) or the bedding (shape of the bedding, shape of the part of the bedding, need and purpose of the part), the inner layer may be omitted, and there may be<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> only the cloths of the first outer layer and the second outer layer, or there may be another cloth (or member) between the first outer layer and the second outer layer. For example, a rubber material for fitting property and for fastening, or an openable and closable fastener may be provided. As the fastener, for example, an ordinary button, a point fastener (for example, snap button), a linear fastener (for example, zipper, chuck) or a surface fastener (for example, Magictape (registered trade name)) can be recited, and these may be used singly or in appropriate combination of two or more kinds. The clothing may be provided with a pocket.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the present invention, the cloth of the inner layer is preferably formed with heat-generated or shape-memorized crinkles. It is preferred to use the cloth formed with continuous or discontinuous crinkles or overlapping portions (crumpled texture) so that it is bulky in its thickness direction, as the inner layer. The cloth having such crinkles or crumpled texture can be obtained by a crinkling finish such as a washer finish or an embossing finish. As a new finishing method for sustaining the crinkles, it is preferred to obtain cloth by subjecting a knitted tissue, a woven tissue or a nonwoven fabric of nylon, polyester or the like to a continuous or discontinuous crinkling finish, followed by heating to memorize shapes of both the crinkles and shrinks to realize a three-dimensional shape. The cloth realizing the three-dimensional shape with crinkles may be used by a monolayer as the inner layer, or by a laminate of two or more layers as the inner layer. Cloths of different kinds, such as a combination of cloth having small bulkiness and cloth having large bulkiness may be laminated and used as the inner layer while a space part is formed.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Further, in the present invention, the inner layer has one sheet of cloth having one kind or plural kinds of three-dimensional-shaped surfaces. The inner layer is preferably formed from one sheet of cloth having one kind or plural kinds of three-dimensional-shaped surfaces. By having different three-dimensional-shaped surfaces depending on the part of the clothing, it is possible to form the inner layer suited for the shape or the like of the clothing. As the three-dimensional shape, for example, a wave shape, a bumpy shape and the like are recited. Also a three-dimensional shape may be formed by raising a nap on the cloth surface or sewing other cloth together, however, it is more preferred to make the cloth itself have a three-dimensional shape in the aspects of light weight, compactness, low cost and so on. For making one sheet of cloth to have a three-dimensional shape, cloth containing a wave form or a bumpy shape may be knitted (for example, locally bumpy shapes are formed in<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> plural sites by circular knitting) or woven. Also, the planar cloth may undergo bumps, a wave form, an accordion form made up of repetition of a mountain fold and a valley fold, a cylindrical shape, a semi-cylindrical shape and the like three-dimensional finish. One sheet of cloth may be formed from one kind of knitting or weaving, and one sheet of cloth may be formed by combination of plural kinds of knitting or weaving, and plural cloths may be sewed together to form one sheet of cloth. Thickness of one sheet of cloth is, for example, in the range of 0.01 mm to 1.5 mm, preferably in the range of 0.01 mm to 1.0 mm, and more preferably, in the range of 0.01 mm to 0.5 mm. Smaller thickness is preferred because the weight is reduced.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As one embodiment of the present invention, the inner layer is formed from plural cloths that are arranged in layers bulkily. Two or more sheets, rather than one sheet of cloths are laminated to form the inner layer, and each cloth has a three-dimensional-shaped surface, and is able to form a bulky and huge space layer. All of the laminated cloths may have the identical three-dimensional-shaped surfaces or may have different three-dimensional-shaped surfaces. The laminated cloths may not be stitched in the part other than an end part, or may be partially stitched. Moreover, the cloths may be intervened by planar cloth entirely or partially, and the planar cloth may be partially sewed up to the cloth.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the above invention, in an end part of the clothing, it is preferred to sew an end part of the cloth of the inner layer together with the first outer layer and/or the second outer layer. It makes it possible to improve the compactness in the folded state while ensuring heat retention by forming the space part over a wide range. By eliminating kilting or partial sewing (sewing between the inner layer cloth and the outer layer cloth) as much as possible, coarse texture in wearing of the clothing is prevented, and the feeling of the wearing can be made comfortable. An end part of the clothing is, for example, the area around collar, the part around shoulder (upper arm), the part around waist, a fastener part and so on, in the case of a vest.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In the present invention, the cloth of the inner layer preferably has a shrinking part that is partially shrunk, and a part that is not shrunk (non-shrinking part or a part that is not substantially shrunk) to form a three-dimensional shape. The non-shrinking part may be in a condition that it is not relatively shrunk compared with the shrinking part, and for example, the shrinking part may be a strong shrinking part that is strongly shrunk, and the non-shrinking<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> part may be a weak shrinking part that is little shrunk. When heat-shrinkable resin is applied, for example, in a grid pattern on a cloth surface, and heated, the cloth part on which the heat-shrinkable resin is applied strongly shrinks, and other part of the cloth little shrinks, so that a three-dimensional shape can be desirably formed in one sheet of cloth. Without limited to the heat-shrinkable resin, the one, when applied on a cloth surface, strongly making the surface shrink, but little making other cloth surface shrink, may be used, for example, ultraviolet shrinkable resin may be used. The shrinking part may be formed by shrinking shape-memory resin fibers contained therein by heating, while the other part is little shrunk. The shrinking part is not limited to the grid pattern.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Instead of shrinking, the cloth surface may be formed three-dimensionally by a strong expanding part that is formed by strongly expanding a part of cloth surface, and a weak expanding part that is little expanded.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the present invention, it is preferred that the cloth of the inner layer has a plurality of openings and is formed with a three-dimensional-shaped surface by raising the cloth end surface of the opening. The opening may be formed by making a plurality of slits in the cloth, and by drawing both ends of the cloth, the slit part is opened to form an opening, and the cloth end surface of the opening is raised. The height of this raising direction corresponds to an interval of slits, and is able to define the thickness of the space part.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Also, in the present invention, the cloth of the inner layer has a plurality of cylindrical parts disposed in the cylinder radial direction to form a three-dimensional-shaped surface. By this cylindrical parts, the cloth is made bulky and an air layer and a heat-retaining layer (material) are created. The size of the cylinder (outer diametrical dimension, cylinder axial length) is not necessarily the same for all cylinders, and the size may be varied depending on the shape of the clothing, and the disposing position.

A first outer layer 101 on the skin side and a second outer layer 102 on the superficial side are of the identical nylon cloths. An inner layer which is polyester cloth (first cloth 1031, second cloth 1032) is disposed between the first outer layer 101 and the second outer layer 102 to form a space part 105 (formed between neighboring cloths). In this manner, by formation of the space part 15 between each cloth, excellent heat retention is realized. Although the inner layer is formed from two cloths of the first cloth 1031 and the second cloth 1032, the compactness in the folded state is excellent because the cloth itself is small in thickness and light in weight. Further, the first and the second outer layers, and the inner layer (first cloth 1031 and second cloth 1032) are light as a whole, and excellent in drying characteristics, and desirably keep the heat retention even when they are wet.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The first cloth 1031 and the second cloth 1032 of the inner layer shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> are formed with heat-generated or shape-memorized crinkles. The first cloth 1031 and the second cloth 1032 are formed by subjecting polyester cloth to continuous or discontinuous crinkling finish, followed by heating to shape-memorize both of the crinkles and shrink to form a three-dimensional shape. Therefore, the shape retention is very excellent, and the crinkle shape can be retained for a long time. The first cloth 1031 and the second cloth 1032 are identical crinkled cloths. As another example, the crinkles are formed so that the first cloth 1031 is bulkier than the second cloth 1032. The space part 105 may be formed largely by combining cloth having large bulkiness and cloth having small bulkiness.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the first embodiment, the inner layer is formed from two sheets of cloth, however, the inner layer may be formed from one sheet of cloth, or three or more sheets of cloth without limited to this. Further, the inner layer may be basically formed from one sheet of cloth, and only a specific part (for example, sleeve part, shoulder part, collar part) may be formed from two or three or more sheets of cloth.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The vest in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> realizes excellent heat retention and wearing comfort by sewing the cloths of the first and the second outer layers 101, 102 and the cloths of the inner layer (first cloth 1031, second cloth 1032) together around shoulder (upper arm), around waist, and in a front fastener part, to reduce the sewed parts as much as possible and continuously form the space part 105 over a wide range.</p><heading id="h0009">&lt;Second embodiment&gt;</heading><p id="p0028" num="0028">A vest in the second embodiment is as same as that of the first embodiment (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>), but is different in configuration of each layer. <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> schematically shows a cross section of each layer. A first outer layer 11 on the skin side and a second outer layer 12 on the superficial side are of the identical nylon cloths. An inner layer (cloth) 13 which is polyester cloth is disposed between the first outer layer 11 and the second outer layer 12 to form a space part 15. By forming this space part 15, the heat retention is excellent, and by implementing the inner layer 13 by one sheet of cloth, compactness in the folded state is excellent. Further, since each of the three layers, namely, the first and the second outer layers and the inner layer of the third layer is formed from one sheet of cloth, light weight, and excellent drying characteristics are realized, and the heat retention can be kept even when they are wet.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The inner layer 13 shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> forms a three-dimensional-shaped cloth surface by having a strong shrinking part and a weak shrinking part in one sheet of cloth. As a method of forming the same, first, heat-shrinkable resin is applied (for example, printed) on the cloth surface in a grid pattern. Then the applied heat-shrinkable resin is heated by a drier, heater or the like. By this heating, the cloth part on which the heat-shrinkable resin is applied strongly shrinks and the other cloth part little shrinks, so that a three-dimensional shape can be formed in one sheet of cloth as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>. In this case, it is necessary to devise the finish so that air permeability and moisture permeability will not be impaired, by means of the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> resin finish and the cloth density. As one example, when there is no aeration, the cloth may be continuously pierced with slits or holes to ensure the air permeability.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In the vest in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, in the part around shoulder (upper arm), the part around waist and the front fastener, the cloths of the first and the second outer layers and the cloth of the inner layer 13 are sewed together to reduce the sewed parts of the inner layer 13 as much as possible, and the space part 15 is continuously formed over a wide range to realize excellent heat retention and wearing comfort.</p><heading id="h0010">(Other embodiments)</heading><p id="p0031" num="0031">Next, an inner layer (cloth) 14 of another embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>. The inner layer 14 shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref> has a plurality of openings 141, and by raising a cloth end surface 142 of the opening 141, a three-dimensional-shaped cloth surface is formed. <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7</figref> shows a method of forming the openings. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7(a)</figref>, in the cloth 14 formed with a mountain fold (broken line) 145 and a valley fold (dashed line) 146, plural lines of slits 143 are formed alternately in different levels. The slit 143 is formed to be perpendicular to the line of the mountain fold (broken line) 145 or the valley fold (dashed line) 146. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7(b)</figref>, both end parts of the cloth (upper and lower ends in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7</figref>) are drawn in the direction perpendicular to the slit 143 (line) to make each slit open to form the opening 141 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>. By alternate repetition of the mountain fold and the valley fold, the opening 141 is formed and the cloth end surface 142 is raised at the position of the slit 143. The interval of lines of the slits 143 (interval between the lines in the vertical direction in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7</figref>) defines the thickness of the space part 15.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Next, an inner layer (cloth) 23 of still another embodiment will be described by using <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 8</figref>. The cloth 23 of the inner layer shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 8</figref> forms a three-dimensional shape by having a plurality of cylindrical parts 231 arranged parallel in the cylinder radial direction. <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 9</figref> shows a method of forming a cylindrical part. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 9</figref>, cylindrical parts 231 are continuously formed from one sheet of cloth, and a cylinder abutting part 232 is joined by sewing, welding (high frequency welder), laser process, or with an adhesive. According to this method, it is possible to form the cylindrical part 232 in each of the vertical direction and horizontal direction for the original whole cloth. The size of the cylinder (outer diametrical dimension, cylindrical axial length) may not be necessarily the same for all cylinders, and the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> size may be varied depending on the shape of the clothing and the disposing part. The cylinder may be formed at intervals rather than being formed continuously. Also, when it is disposed in both outer layers, an air layer is desirably formed even when there is a recess in the cylinder.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Next, an inner layer (cloth) 24 of a further embodiment will be described by using <figref idrefs="f0009">Figs. 10</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0010">11</figref>.

As the base cloth 242, cloths of light weight (woven fabric, knitted fabric, tricot, nonwoven fabric and so on) are exemplified. <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 11</figref> shows a method of forming the semi-cylindrical parts 241 a. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 11</figref>, the semi-cylindrical parts 241 a are continuously formed from one sheet of cloth, and the semi-circular opening (fold part) 241 b and the base cloth 242 are joined by sewing, welding (high frequency welder), laser process, or with an adhesive. According to this method, it is possible to form the semi-cylindrical part 241 a in each of the vertical direction and horizontal direction for the original whole cloth. The size of the semi-cylinder (outer diametrical dimension, cylindrical axial length) may not be necessarily the same for all semi-cylinders, and the size may be varied depending on the shape of the clothing and the disposing part. The semi-cylinders may be formed at intervals rather than being formed continuously. When it is arranged in both outer layers, an air layer is desirably formed even when there is a recess in the semi-cylinder. The base cloth 242 may be one or more sheet of cloth, and may be a burred knitted tissue or woven tissue. The base cloth may be a tape-like cloth in the form of a grid. The base cloth may be a plastic film, and the plastic film may have a plurality of openings such as in the form of a grid from the view point of air permeability.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The various three-dimensional shapes of inner layer cloth are not limited to such a shape that one kind of three-dimensional shape is arranged continuously in parallel, and, for example, it may be arranged continuously in an inverted-V shape. When the inner layer is formed from one sheet of cloth, cloths having three-dimensional-shaped surface may be combined (for example, sewed) in the end parts to form one large sheet of cloth. When the inner layer is formed from plural sheets of cloths arranged bulkily in layers, a double layer may be formed by folding large cloth, or separate cloths may be stacked, for example.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The clothing is not limited to a vest, and may be clothing for upper body, clothing for head, neck, clothing for lower body, clothing for foot, clothing for part of body, seat, glove, socks, muffler and so on.
