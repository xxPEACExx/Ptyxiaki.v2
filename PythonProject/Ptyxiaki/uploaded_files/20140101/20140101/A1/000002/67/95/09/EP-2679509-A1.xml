The invention further relates to a confectionery product contained in the packaging container.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">PLT 1 proposes a packaging box, as a packaging container, which contains sheet-shaped content pieces such as of chewing gum, chocolate or candy.<br/>
In the packaging box described in PLT 1, a plurality of content pieces are contained upright in overlapping relation in two rows, i.e., in a front row and a rear row. The packaging box has a bottom partly raised such that a rear bottom portion is higher than a front bottom portion. In the packaging box, content pieces contained in the rear row are located at a higher height level than content pieces contained in the front<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> row. Therefore, when a lid of the packaging box is opened to uncover an upper portion of the container box, the content pieces in the front and rear rows can be easily picked out.</p><heading id="h0003">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT LITERATURE</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003"><ul><li>PLT 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPHEI1119991220A"><text>JP-HEI11(1999)-1220A1</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">TECHNICAL PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">The bottom of the packaging box of PLT 1 is partly raised and, therefore, the packaging box has a correspondingly greater height.<br/>
Where all the content pieces in the front row are eaten up, for example, a relatively great dead space is present in front of the content pieces contained in the rear row. Therefore, it is inconvenient to carry a packaging box having a needless dead space with a reduced number of content pieces.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In view of the foregoing, it is a principal object of the present invention to provide a packaging container which is configured such that a plurality of food pieces are contained in anteroposteriorly overlapping relation in a plurality of rows, and<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> satisfies requirements for the compactness of the container and the pick-out easiness for picking out each of the food pieces.<br/>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a convenient packaging container which can be reused with its size (thickness) reduced after some of food pieces contained in the container are eaten.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is further another object of the present invention to provide a confectionery product contained in the packaging container described above.</p><heading id="h0007">SOLUTION TO PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to an inventive aspect of claim 1, there is provided a packaging container of paper having a slidable configuration for containing elongated food strips, the packaging container including a front chamber adapted to contain elongated food strips upright in side-by-side relation, and a rear chamber provided behind the front chamber and adapted to contain elongated food strips upright in side-by-side relation, wherein the rear chamber is combined with the front chamber so as to be slidable upward with respect to the front chamber.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to an inventive aspect of claim 2, the rear chamber is decombined from the front chamber to<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> provide an independently usable package in the packaging container of claim 1.<br/>
According to an inventive aspect of claim 3, the rear chamber has a rear chamber front wall, rear chamber left and right side walls, a rear chamber bottom wall and a rear chamber rear wall in the packaging container of claim 2, and has a take-out window provided in the rear chamber front wall as a cut-out portion extending downward from an upper edge of the rear chamber front wall for exposing upper portions of the strips contained in the rear chamber forward, and an extension portion which defines a flap extending upward from an upper edge of the rear chamber rear wall and folded forward and downward to cover an upper wall and a front upper portion of the packaging container.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to an inventive aspect of claim 4, a portion of the extension portion defining the upper wall of the packaging container includes a second folding guide provided in an anteroposteriorly middle portion of the upper wall as extending horizontally in the packaging container of claim 3 and, when the rear chamber is independently used, the extension portion is folded along the second folding guide, whereby a rear portion of the upper wall serves as an upper wall of the rear chamber, and a front portion of the upper wall and the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> flap cooperatively function as a flap covering a front portion of the rear chamber with a crease therebetween removed.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to an inventive aspect of claim 5, the front chamber includes a packaging container front wall, packaging container left and right side walls, a packaging container rear wall, a front chamber bottom wall and a partition wall disposed within the packaging container to serve as a front chamber rear wall in the packaging container of claim 3 or 4, and has a take-out window provided in an upper portion of the packaging container front wall as a cut-out portion extending from an upper edge of the packaging container front wall for exposing upper portions of the strips contained in the front chamber forward.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to an inventive aspect of claim 6, the partition wall has a smaller height than the packaging container rear wall, and has an engagement piece provided at least in a middle portion of an upper edge thereof and folded rearward in the packaging container of claim 5.<br/>
According to an inventive aspect of claim 7, the rear chamber is combined with the front chamber so as to be accommodated in a space located behind the front chamber between the partition wall of the front chamber<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> and the packaging container rear wall and having upper and lower open ends in the packaging container of claim 6.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to an inventive aspect of claim 8, the extension portion has stoppers provided on laterally opposite sides thereof, and the stoppers are engaged with upper edges of the packaging container left and right side walls to prevent the rear chamber from being withdrawn from the space in the packaging container of claim 7.<br/>
According to an inventive aspect of claim 9, the engagement piece is engaged with an upper edge of the rear chamber front wall to prevent the rear chamber from moving further upward with respect to the front chamber in the packaging container of claim 7 or 8.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to an inventive aspect of claim 10, the packaging container rear wall has a band portion extending vertically for dividing the packaging container rear wall into left and right portions in the packaging container of claim 9.<br/>
According to an inventive aspect of claim 11, there is provided a multi-chamber packaging container of paper having a slidable N-chamber configuration (wherein N is a positive integer not less than 2) for containing elongated food strips, the packaging<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> container including a first chamber adapted to contain elongated food strips upright in side-by-side relation, and second to N-th chambers provided behind the first chamber and each adapted to contain elongated food strips upright in side-by-side relation, wherein the N-th chamber is combined with the (N-1)-th chamber so as to be slidable upward with respect to the (N-1)-th chamber.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to an inventive aspect of claim 12, there is provided a packaged confectionery product comprising a packaging container according to any one of claims 1 to 11, and a plurality of elongated confectionery strips such as of chewing gum, chocolate or candy individually wrapped with wrapping sheets and accommodated in a food containing chamber of the packaging container, wherein parts of outer surfaces of the individual wrapping sheets are bonded to an interior surface of the food containing chamber by bonding means for maintaining the individually wrapped confectionery strips in an accommodated state.</p><heading id="h0008">ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to the inventive aspect of claim 1, the front chamber and the rear chamber provided behind the front chamber are each capable of containing the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> elongated food strips upright in side-by-side relation in the paper packaging container of the slidable configuration.<br/>
The rear chamber is combined with the front chamber so as to be slidable upward with respect to the front chamber. Therefore, there is no need to preliminarily provide a raised bottom portion in a rear portion of the packaging container for locating the strips contained in the rear row (rear chamber) at a higher height level than the strips contained in the front row (front chamber), but the rear chamber can be slid upward with respect to the front chamber as required to locate the rear row strips at a higher height level than the front row strips. Thus, the size reduction of the packaging container can be achieved without the need for providing the raised bottom portion.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">If a food strip in the rear row is to be eaten, the strip can be easily picked out from the rear row strips located at a higher height level than the front row strips by sliding the rear chamber upward with respect to the front chamber.<br/>
That is, the packaging container can satisfy the requirements for the compactness and the pick-out easiness for picking out the food pieces (strips) contained in anteroposteriorly overlapping relation in<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the plurality of rows.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to the inventive aspect of claim 2, the rear chamber is decombined from the front chamber to provide an independently usable package. Therefore, when the front chamber becomes a dead space after the strips contained in the front chamber are eaten up, the rear chamber is separated from the front chamber. Thus, the remaining strips can be compactly carried in the rear chamber. That is, after some of the strips are eaten, the packaging container can be conveniently reused with its size (thickness) reduced.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the inventive aspect of claim 3, the upper portions of the strips contained in the rear chamber are exposed forward from the take-out window provided in the rear chamber front wall of the rear chamber. Therefore, the strips contained in the rear chamber can be accessed through the take-out window to be thereby easily picked out.<br/>
The extension portion extending upward from the upper edge of the rear chamber rear wall of the rear chamber is folded forward and downward along the predetermined folding guide to serve as the flap to cover the upper wall and the front upper portion of the packaging container. This obviates the need for providing the flap for each of the front chamber and<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> the rear chamber to cover the upper wall and the front upper portion of the packaging container, thereby reducing the number of components.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to the inventive aspect of claim 4, the portion of the extension portion defining the upper wall of the packaging container has the second folding guide provided in the anteroposteriorly middle portion of the upper wall as extending horizontally. With the extension portion folded along the second folding guide, the portion of the extension portion defining the rear portion of the upper wall of the packaging container serves as the upper wall of the rear chamber when the rear chamber is independently used. The portion of the extension portion defining the front portion of the upper wall of the packaging container and the flap cooperatively function as the flap covering the front portion of the rear chamber with the crease therebetween removed.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Therefore, where the rear chamber is combined with the front chamber, the extension portion of the rear chamber serves as the flap for the entire packaging container. Where the rear chamber is separated from the front chamber for independent use, the extension portion of the rear chamber serves as the flap of the rear chamber. This obviates the need for separately<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> providing a component serving as the flap for the entire packaging container and a component serving as the flap for the rear chamber, thereby reducing the number of components.<br/>
When the rear chamber is independently used, the extension portion covers the front portion of the rear chamber, whereby the strips contained in the rear chamber can be prevented from dropping out forward.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to the inventive aspect of claim 5, the front chamber includes the packaging container front wall, the packaging container left and right side walls, the packaging container rear wall, the front chamber bottom wall, and the partition wall disposed within the packaging container to serve as the front chamber rear wall.<br/>
The upper portions of the strips are exposed forward from the take-out window provided in the upper portion of the packaging container front wall. Therefore, the strips contained in the front chamber can be accessed from the take-out window to be thereby easily picked out.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to the inventive aspect of claim 6, the height of the partition wall is smaller than the height of the packaging container rear wall. This prevents the increase in the height of the entire<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> packaging container due to the provision of the partition wall.<br/>
The engagement piece folded rearward is provided on at least the middle portion of the upper edge of the partition wall.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to the inventive aspect of claim 7, the rear chamber is combined with the front chamber so as to be accommodated in the space located behind the front chamber between the partition wall of the front chamber and the packaging container rear wall and having the upper and lower open ends. Thus, the rear chamber is vertically slidable with respect to the front chamber in the space.<br/>
In this case, according to the inventive aspect of claim 8, the stoppers provided on the laterally opposite sides of the extension portion are respectively engaged with the upper edges of the packaging container left and right side walls, thereby preventing the rear chamber from being withdrawn from the space.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to the inventive aspect of claim 9, the engagement piece is engaged with the upper edge of the rear chamber front wall to prevent the rear chamber from moving further upward with respect to the front chamber. Therefore, the rear chamber can be combined<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> with the front chamber so as to be slidable upward by a predetermined distance with respect to the front chamber.<br/>
According to the inventive aspect of claim 10, the packaging container rear wall can be divided into the left and right portions by tearing off the band portion of the packaging container rear wall. Thus, the rear chamber can be taken out from the space between the partition wall of the front chamber and the packaging container rear wall for use as the independent package.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to the inventive aspect of claim 11, the packaging container has the N-chamber configuration including the first chamber serving as the front chamber and the second to N-th chambers serving as the rear chamber, and the second to N-th chambers are each slidable upward.<br/>
According to the inventive aspect of claim 12, the confectionery product is provided which can be carried in a hygienic way and can be easily eaten.</p><heading id="h0009">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF

The front chamber rear wall 27 is a partition wall which partitions the accommodation space H (the inside of the main portion<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> C or the packaging container A).

Thus, the front space I and the rear space J communicate with each other above the front chamber rear wall 27. Since the height of the front chamber rear wall 27 is smaller than the height of the packaging container rear wall 32, it is possible to prevent the height increase of the entire main portion C (in other words, the entire packaging container A) due to the provision of the front chamber rear wall 27.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The engagement piece 30 of the front chamber rear wall 27 is folded back to the rear space J.<br/>
An upper end of the accommodation space H is open upward to serve as a take-out port K defined from lateral sides by upper edges of the packaging container left side wall 22 and the packaging container right side wall 23 and having a horizontally elongated rectangular shape. The take-out port K is continuous to the take-out window G of the packaging container front wall<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> 20.<br/>
The front space I, which is a generally front half portion of the accommodation space H, has a lower end closed with the front chamber bottom wall 24 (see <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5(b)</figref>) and an upper end which is open upward to define a generally front half portion of the take-out port K.

The front chamber L may further include generally rear half portions of the packaging container left side wall 22 and the packaging container right side wall 23, and the packaging container rear wall 32.

With the six food units 42 accommodated in each of the rear chamber B and the main portion C (front chamber L), the rear chamber B is combined with the main portion C to complete the packaging container A.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061"><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> is an exploded perspective view for explaining a state in which the rear chamber B is combined with the main portion C. <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10(a)</figref> is a perspective view of the packaging container A in the complete state with the lid 4 open, and <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10(b)</figref> is a sectional view of the packaging container A of <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10 (a)</figref> as seen from a right side. <figref idrefs="f0011">FIGS. 11</figref> are six side views of the packaging container A in the complete state.<br/>
As shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>, the lid 4 of the rear chamber B is opened. At this time, the lid 4 extends upward from the upper edge (upper edge 1U) of the rear chamber rear wall 1, and is generally flush with the rear chamber rear wall 1. In turn, with the take-out window D of the rear chamber B and the take-out window G of the main portion C directing in the same direction (forward in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>), the rear chamber B is opposed to the rear half portion of the take-out port K of the main portion C from above, and then the rear chamber B and the main portion C are relatively moved so that the rear chamber<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> bottom wall 5 of the rear chamber B is inserted into the rear half portion of the take-out port K. Therefore, the rear chamber B may be moved to the main portion C with the main portion C kept stationary or, conversely, the main portion C may be moved to the rear chamber B.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Thus, the rear chamber B is inserted into the rear half portion of the take-out port K to be thereby accommodated in the rear space J of the main portion C.

Since the upper portions of the food units 42 (the separation portions 41A of the packaging sheets 41) are exposed forward from the take-out window D provided in the upper portion of the rear chamber B, the food units 42 (chewing gum pieces 40) contained in the rear chamber B can be accessed from the take-out window D to be easily picked by the finger tips 100.

Alternatively, the chewing gum pieces 40 of the food units 42 contained in the rear chamber B may be first eaten with the rear chamber B slid upward before the food units 42 contained in the front chamber L are taken out as shown in <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 15</figref>.<br/>
If not all the chewing gum pieces 40 are eaten, the lid 4 is closed with some of the chewing gum pieces 40 of the food units 42 left in the front chamber L and the rear chamber B (see <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>).</p><p id="p0079" num="0079"><figref idrefs="f0016">FIG. 16</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a state in which the band portion 29 of the main portion C is torn off. <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 17</figref> is a perspective view of the rear chamber B in the complete state with the lid 4 closed.<br/>
Where all the chewing gum pieces 40 contained in the front chamber L are eaten up with the food units 42 remaining in the rear chamber B, the band portion 29 of the packaging container rear wall 32 of the main<!-- EPO <DP n="52"> --> portion C is torn off as shown in <figref idrefs="f0016">FIG. 16</figref>. Then, the packaging container rear wall 32 is divided into the left portion and the right portion, so that only the rear chamber B can be taken out of the rear space J through a space between the left portion and the right portion of the packaging container rear wall 32.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">The rear chamber B is thus decombined from the main portion C (front chamber L) to thereby provide an independently usable package. Therefore, where the front chamber L becomes a dead space after all the chewing gum pieces 40 contained in the front chamber L are eaten up (see <figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 14</figref>), the rear chamber B is separated from the front chamber L. Thus, the rear chamber B which has a thickness approximately half the thickness of the original packaging container A can be compactly carried with the remaining chewing gum pieces 40 contained therein. That is, after some of the chewing gum pieces 40 are eaten, a part of the packaging container A having a reduced size (reduced thickness) can be conveniently used.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">If the chewing gum pieces 40 of the food units 42 contained in the rear chamber B are not to be eaten, a crease formed along the first folding guide 12 of the lid 4 (see <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>) is removed. That is, a crease present between the second piece 15 defining the front<!-- EPO <DP n="53"> --> portion of the first lid portion 10 (the upper wall of the packaging container A) and the second lid portion 11 defining the flap of the packaging container A is removed. Thus, the first lid portion 10 and the second lid portion 11 become flush with each other.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">In turn, the second piece 15 and the second lid portion 11 are folded forward and downward perpendicularly to the first piece 14 (along the second folding guide 13) to form a crease along the second folding guide 13. Thus, the lid 4 is closed as shown in <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 17</figref>. In this state, the first piece 14 defining the rear portion of the first lid portion 10 of the lid 4 serves as an upper wall of the rear chamber B, while the second piece 15 and the second lid portion 11 function as a flap covering a front portion of the rear chamber B.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">Where the rear chamber B is combined with the front chamber L, the lid 4 of the rear chamber B serves as the flap of the entire packaging container A (see <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>). Where the rear chamber B is independently separated from the front chamber L, the lid 4 of the rear chamber B serves as the flap of the rear chamber B (see <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 17</figref>). Without the need for separately providing the flap for the entire packaging container A and the flap for the rear chamber B, the number of<!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --> the components can be reduced.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">Where the separate rear chamber B is closed with the lid 4, the first piece 14 of the first lid portion 10 of the lid 4 covers the upper wall of the rear chamber B, while the second piece 15 and the second lid portion 11 of the lid 4 cover the front upper portion of the rear chamber B (the upper portion of the rear chamber front wall 16). Therefore, the take-out port F provided in the upper wall of the rear chamber B is closed with the first piece 14, while the take-out window D provided in the upper portion of the rear chamber front wall 16 is closed with the second piece 15 and the second lid portion 11. Where the rear chamber B is independently used, the lid 4 covers the front portion and the upper portion of the rear chamber B, thereby preventing the chewing gum pieces 40 from being withdrawn forward out of the rear chamber B.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">The distal edge 11A of the second lid portion 11 is inserted in the incision 9 of the rear chamber front wall 16, whereby the lid 4 is engaged with the rear chamber front wall 16 to be maintained in a closed state so as not to be withdrawn from the rear chamber front wall 16. The rear chamber B with the lid 4 closed is like a mailing envelope.<br/>
When the eater is to eat the chewing gum pieces<!-- EPO <DP n="55"> --> 40 contained in the rear chamber B, the eater disengages the distal edge 11A of the second lid portion 11 from the incision 9 of the rear chamber front wall 16 to open the lid 4 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>. Then, the eater picks one of the food units 42 in the aforementioned manner to pull up the food unit 42 from the take-out port F, and eats the chewing gum piece 40 of this food unit 42.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">In the embodiment described above, the strip-shaped chewing gum pieces 40 are each individually wrapped with a wrapping sheet 41 to provide the food unit 42. The food unit 42 is not limited to that prepared by wrapping (individually wrapping) the chewing gum piece with the wrapping sheet 41. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0018">FIGS. 18(a) and 18(b)</figref>, the food unit 42 may be prepared by covering a strip-shaped chewing gum piece 40 with transparent films 51 and then heat-sealing upper, lower, left and right peripheral portions of the transparent films 51 to provide heat-seal portions 51h to seal the chewing gum piece 40 between the transparent films 51. In this case, a slight gap may be left between the transparent films 51 and the chewing gum piece 40 when the chewing gum piece 40 is sealed. Alternatively, the chewing gum piece 40 may be sealed after the inside space is evacuated to remove the gap. In these cases, the<!-- EPO <DP n="56"> --> transparent films 51 intimately contact the chewing gum piece 40, so that the chewing gum piece 40 is not exposed to the outer atmosphere. This improves the quality protection of the chewing gum piece 40.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">As in the case of the wrapping with the wrapping sheet 41, the transparent films 51 may each have a perforation line or a fragile line to be divided into upper and lower portions along the line, so that the chewing gum piece 40 can be taken out with its lower portion exposed.<br/>
As shown in <figref idrefs="f0018">FIG. 18 (c)</figref>, the strip-shaped chewing gum piece 40 may be sealed in a plastic case 52 to provide the food unit 42.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">Where the food units 42 are each prepared by sealing the chewing gum piece 40 between the transparent films 51 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0018">FIGS. 18(a) and 18(b)</figref>, the strip-shaped chewing gum pieces 40 can be compactly contained upright in side-by-side relation with their laterally opposite edge portions overlapped at a predetermined pitch.

Alternatively, the food units 42 may be contained in three or more rows arranged anteroposteriorly with provision of a plurality of rear chambers B. In this case, the rear chambers B are pull up stepwise, so that the food units 42 can be easily picked out from the respective rear chambers B.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">The front chamber L and the rear chamber B are each adapted to contain six food units 42 in side-by-side relation, but the number of the food units 42 to be contained in each of the front chamber L and the rear chamber B may be properly changed.<br/>
Referring to <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>, the food units 42 are each arranged so that the wrapping sheet 41 is divided into the separation portion 41A and the fixing portion 41B when the food unit 42 is taken out of the packaging container A (see <figref idrefs="f0013">FIGS. 13</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0014">14</figref>), but the wrapping sheet 41 is not necessarily required to be divided. In this case, there is no need to provide the perforation line 43 in the wrapping sheet 41, and the food unit 42 is taken out of the packaging container A without the division of the wrapping sheet 41. The food units 42<!-- EPO <DP n="58"> --> are preferably temporarily (weakly) bonded to the packaging container A (the rear chamber B and the main portion C, see <figref idrefs="f0013">FIGS. 13</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0014">14</figref>) by the adhesive agent 45, 46, so that the food units 42 can be easily taken out of the packaging container A without breaking the wrapping sheets 41.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">Further, a necessary number of food units 42 may be first bundled with bundling sheets (not shown), and then the resulting bundles of food units 42 may be respectively set in the front chamber L and the rear chamber B.
