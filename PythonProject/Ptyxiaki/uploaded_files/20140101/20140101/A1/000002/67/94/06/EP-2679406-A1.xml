Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an airless tire, and more particularly, to an airless tire which supports a load of a vehicle and of which a contact surface coming into contact with the ground is uniform and the durability of spokes are improved by the dispersion of stress for the improvement of ride quality.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In general, a tire is one of components of a vehicle, and comes into direct contact with the road surface. Air present in the tire further improves ride quality by absorbing shock, which is caused by the unevenness of the road surface, through a buffer action like a spring.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Tires, which can achieve the controllability of a vehicle, can be classified into a radial tire, an airless tire, a solid tire, and the like according to the structure thereof. Among them, a radial tire (air tire type) is generally used in a car and a vehicle not having a special purpose. The radial tire has a complicated structure, and is manufactured by eight processes.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Further, in the radial tire, there is an inconvenience that air pressure absolutely important for the exhibition of<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> performance and safety should be checked. Furthermore, the radial tire has a safety problem that a tire is damaged by an external object and shock while a vehicle is traveling.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Unlike this air tire, an airless tire is a tire of which production costs can be significantly reduced by a material and the simplification of processes and which is produced by a new process and a structure capable of reducing the amount of consumed energy and the amount of a generated harmful material. Moreover, the airless tire does not cause a problem that can occur due to the lack of air pressure or the like. In addition, the airless tire has an advantage of preventing a standing wave shape that is formed in the case of a radial tire and an advantage of significantly improving rotational resistance.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The airless tire has a structure that is completely different from the structure of the radial tire. Further, unlike the radial tire, the airless tire does not use compressed air in design at all. Accordingly, the airless tire is free from the risk of an accident that may occur during the travel of a vehicle due to the loss or lack of air pressure. Furthermore, unlike the case of the radial tire, the production costs of the airless tire can be significantly reduced by a material and the simplification of processes.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the structure of this airless tire, the airless tire includes a body that is made of an elastic material,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> a crown that functions as a tread and extends in a circumferential direction, and a side wall that is joined to the crown and extends.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Moreover, a non-pneumatic tire, which includes a reinforced annular band supporting a load and a plurality of web spokes transmitting load forces between the annular band and a wheel or a hub while being tensioned, has been known as Korean Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="KR20040027984"><text>2004-0027984</text></patcit>. In recent years, an airless tire, which is adapted to perform a buffer action by a honeycomb-shaped buffer portion and to support pressure applied to the tire, also has been introduced in Korean Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="KR1043001"><text>1043001</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the case of the airless tire including the plurality of web spokes, it has been introduced that a load is supported by only a tensile force of the web spokes.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">However, when a load is supported by a tensile force and a compressive force, a more stable and appropriate tread area can be obtained as compared to a case where a load is supported by only a tensile force. Further, since it is possible to maximize vehicle performance, such as controllability, a braking force, and ride quality, further improved vehicle performance can be expected.</p><heading id="h0004">[Related art Document]</heading><heading id="h0005">[Patent Document]</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011"><ul><li>[Patent Document 1] Korean Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="KR0810935"><text>0810935 (February<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> 29, 2008</text></patcit>)</li><li>[Patent Document 2] Korean Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="KR1043001"><text>1043001 (June 14, 2011</text></patcit>)</li></ul></p><heading id="h0006">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present invention provides an airless tire which supports a load of a vehicle and of which a contact surface coming into contact with the ground is uniform and the durability of the spoke and the absorption of shock, which is generated from a road surface and transmitted to a driver, are improved.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">An airless tire according to an embodiment of the present invention includes first and second bands that face each other with a distance interposed therebetween, a plurality of spokes that connect the first band to the second band and are provided at intervals, and first and second connecting members that connect the adjacent spokes.

Each of the first and second bands 40 and 50 may be made of one selected from a group consisting of basalt fiber, filaments based on basalt fiber, and the combination thereof.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Basalt fiber is natural fiber extracted from basalt that is fine-grained rock made of lava flowed to the surface of the earth due to volcanism. Since basalt fiber has excellent mechanical property, basalt fiber is also used as reinforcing fiber for a polymer composite, reinforcing fiber for mending a concrete structure, or the like.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Meanwhile, the rim 20, which is connected to a hub drum (not shown) of a vehicle, is joined to the inner surface of the first band 40.

The spokes 61 function as a support so that the first band 40 is spaced apart from the second band 50. The spokes 61 are arranged at intervals along the first and second bands 40 and 50.

Since the first and second connecting members 62 and 70 are connected in a zigzag pattern, the spokes 61 can be freely deformed.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The second connecting member 70 is positioned between adjacent spoke cells 60. The second connecting member 70 connects the second members 61b. The length of the second connecting member 70 is longer than the length of the first connecting member 62.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The first connecting member 62 connects adjacent spokes 61 to form one spoke cell 60 and the second connecting member 70 connects adjacent spoke cells 60, so that a plurality of spaces are formed between the first and second bands 40 and 50.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>, a vertical load is applied to the tread 10 when the tread 10 is perpendicular to the drum while coming into contact with the ground. In this case, a distance between the first and second bands 40 and 50 is reduced. Adjacent spokes 61, which are positioned between the first and second bands 40 and 50 between which the distance is reduced, are deformed so as to face each other while the radii of curvature thereof are reduced. Accordingly, a distance L1 is reduced. The reason for this is that a distance between portions of adjacent spokes 61 where the first and second members 61a and 61b are connected to each other is reduced due to the curved structures of the first and second members 61a and 61b. The first connecting member 62 is compressed while the distance L1 is reduced. Further, the first connecting member 62 may approach the second band 50. The deformed<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> adjacent spokes 61 do not interfere with each other by the compressed first connecting member 62. Furthermore, while the distance between the adjacent spokes 61 is reduced, the distance between the portions of the adjacent spoke cells 60 corresponding to the second member 61b is increased.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">That is, when the adjacent spokes 61, which are formed of the connected first and second members 61a and 61b, are deformed in a direction where the adjacent spokes 61 approach each other, the spokes 61 are deformed in the form of the bending and stretching of an air tire. Accordingly, the control and the ride quality of a vehicle are improved.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In other words, the airless tire 1 having this structure is deformed so that the distances between the tread 10 coming into contact with the ground and the adjacent spokes 61 are reduced. In this case, the adjacent spokes 61 do not interfere with each other by the first connecting member 62. Moreover, the adjacent spoke cells 60 do not interfere with each other by the second connecting member 70. Since the adjacent spokes 61 and the spoke cells 60 do not interfere with each other, it is possible to obtain an effect of preventing the generation of noise and an effect of improving fatigue resistance.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">When the tread 10 deviates from a portion perpendicular to the drum and is separated from the ground, the deformed spoke 61 can be restored to the original state due to the elastic force thereof. The tire is not excessively compressed by a<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> load generated when the drum and the tread 10 are perpendicular to each other, so that the tire can perfectly perform an original function.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The spoke cells 60, which are formed by the connection of the curved spokes 61, are positioned between the first and second bands 40 and 50, so that the structural stiffness of the airless tire 1 according to the present invention is harmonized. Further, the spokes 61 and the spoke cells 60 are connected to each other by the first and second connecting members 62 and 70 and support the load of the vehicle, so that the contact surface of the airless tire 1 coming into contact with the ground is formed uniformly. Furthermore, since the curved spokes 61 are deformed, the durability of the spoke and the absorption of shock, which is generated from the road surface and transmitted to a driver, can be improved.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">In the airless tire 1, the spoke cells 60 supporting the first and second bands 40 and 50 are positioned between the first and second bands 40 and 50 and the spokes 61 and the spoke cells 60 are connected to each other by the first and second connecting members 62 and 70. Accordingly, both a compressive force and a tensile force can be achieved by the harmonization of structural stiffness. Further, the dispersion of stress is improved by the deformation of the spokes 61. As a result, the fatigue resistance of the structure of the spokes 61 is improved.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Referring to the result of the static characteristic performance evaluation of the airless tire 1 (see <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>), it is found that the static characteristic performance of the airless tire (denoted by B) having the structure of the curved spokes 61 and the curved spoke cells 60 of the present invention, which are connected to each other by the first and second connecting members 62 and 70, is improved as compared to a case where the spokes in the related art are made of an auxetic material (denoted by A).</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">As a result, it is found that the airless tire (denoted by B) has a high shock absorption rate and has high resistance against a static load.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>, the other ends 61a2 of the first members 61a become closer to each other as the protruding first members 61a become distant from the first band 40, and the other ends 61b2 of the second members 61b become closer to each other as the protruding second members 61b become distant from the second band 50. Accordingly, the strain of the spoke 61 is improved. The function as a tire can be improved without air pressure that is most important for the exhibition of the performance of an air tire. That is, since the adjacent spokes 61 do not interfere with each other, a footprint similar to the footprint of an air tire can be formed.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In other words, the airless tire 1 according to the present invention can sufficiently support the load of the<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> vehicle by the harmonized structural stiffness of the spokes 61. Further, since both a compressive force and a tensile force are achieved, the fatigue resistance of the structure of the spokes is improved by the improvement of the dispersion of stress. Further, the absorption performance against vibration, which is applied to a driver from the ground through a hub of the vehicle, is improved by the dispersion of vibration, so that it is possible to provide a comfortable ride quality.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Accordingly, the durability of the airless tire is improved, the control performance of a vehicle is improved, and shock applied from the road surface is dispersed well, so that it is possible to expect not only the improvement of durability and but also the improvement of control performance and ride quality performance of a vehicle.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">For reference, the spoke 61 of the present invention has been formed in a curved shape in the above-mentioned description and drawings, and the shape of the spoke 61 of the present invention is not limited to this shape.
