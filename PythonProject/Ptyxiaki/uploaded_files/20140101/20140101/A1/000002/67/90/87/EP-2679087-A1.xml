These carts work with a high pressure on the augers, preventing the products from being correctly mixed<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> and consuming a large amount of energy. They also generate expensive wear on their internal parts.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The weight of the product mixture itself means that the pressure on the augers prevents them from mixing correctly and from obtaining the required uniformity with moderate energy consumption.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">One alternative for reducing wear on the augers and decreasing the power consumed during the mincing and mixing process consists of reducing the size of the augers, which leads to an increase in the time required to mince and mix the materials and offers minimal improvement.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Another alternative to consider is the preparation of lower capacity mixtures, with the disadvantages of excess movements (in the case of distribution carts) and high labour costs due to the fact that a larger quantity of mixtures must be prepared (in the case of plants for feeding biogas digesters).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The applicant of this invention is unaware of the existence of prior issues that satisfactorily solve the problems explained.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Invention description</b></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The device of this invention includes features aimed at performing the fine mincing and cutting and mixing functions at the same time to give mincing or cutting sizes of less than 1 centimetre, where cutting discs can turn at a higher speed and be subject to minimal damage.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Another objective of the invention is to solve the problems of excess time and energy to obtain the chopped and mixed product, as well as the costs produced.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Another objective of the invention is to produce a mixing - mincing device for large product volumes, preserving the advantages of the fast mix preparation with lower energy consumption.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to the invention, the device for mincing and mixing vegetable products includes:
<ul><li>A mixing cavity or hopper with an auger that rotates at low revs, the purpose of which is to mix the products and to ensure they circulate to enter a mincing and cutting cavity.</li><li>A mincing and cutting cavity with a shaft that rotates at high speeds and on which a series of cutting discs are mounted.</li><li>A separating part in the area where both cavities - the mixing cavity or hopper and the cutting or mixing cavity - touch.</li></ul></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A separating part may be formed by slots, combs, counter-blades or any similar item that allows for the penetration of the cutting discs on the mincing shaft and ensures only thin product is allowed to enter.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The machine operates as described below. Once the product to be chopped has been placed in the mixing hopper or cavity, the mixture is made to circulate around the mincing or cutting area, which is where the cutting blades come into action and cut the material, allowing for the chopped material to enter and be sliced down to sizes of less than 1 cm.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Due to the fact that the cutting discs do not come into direct contact with the mixture as a whole but only with its ends, this means that the mincing or cutting discs can rotate at a higher speed. Furthermore, the speed of rotation of the mincing or cutting discs is greater than that of the mixing auger, the former rotating at a proportion of 20 to 40 times faster than the latter.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Also due to the way in which the cutting takes place, any stones or other undesired objects are easily expelled, as the mincing or cutting discs have enough space to expel them when they are hit by them.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Once the material has been chopped and has crossed the separating part, it falls into the chopped or sliced material cavity by gravity and is returned to the mixing cavity or hopper through the lower mincing shaft disc, which is a turbine-type puling disc, or any other form of extraction.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">For this lower disc to return the chopped material to the mixing cavity or hopper, it has a turbine-type configuration that expels the material into the hopper through a slot or other impelling element.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The maximum saving of energy is obtained once the mixture is chopped, with the tractor at low revs and moving the mixture while the innovated thin cutting device reduces it it to the required size.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The device described leads to a saving of energy because the cutting or mincing blades are able to rotate with less effort, products chopped to a size of less than 1 cm, higher rotation speed of the mincing or cutting shaft and less exposure to damage to the mincing or cutting discs, as any stones or objects are easily expelled. All of these are achieved with the features essentially included in the first claim.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Another advantage of this device is that it is applied to mixing carts with lodging turbine, which reduces the size of the straw, which means that it is possible to increase its quantity in the hopper.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The cutting and mincing device can be incorporated into feeding circuits in biogas plants with co-digestion systems. It can also be incorporated into carts for the feeding of biogas plants. Alternatively, one or several pulled, static or self-propelled system augers can be incorporated into the carts.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">On producing the mincing-mixing device, which is especially recommended for large product volumes, this device has certain technical singularities to perform three different functions: on one hand, the graduated passing of products from one cavity to another and, on the other, the mixing and mincing function of the products in a shorter time than if using conventional large-volume mixing and mincing devices and lastly, the increased capacity of the device. All of this with a significant saving of energy and a reduction in pressure and faults on the augers and other parts.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In this device for large product volumes, the hopper includes:
<ul><li>an upper storage cavity for product to be chopped and mixed,</li><li>a lower mincing and mixing cavity in which the low-speed augers are housed that are responsible for mincing and mixing the product.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></li><li>a separating surface between the upper and lower cavity, which is fitted with at least one product port to the lower cavity and one or several regulating gates for the product to pass to the lower cavity,</li><li>rotating entraining arms that move the product contained in the upper cavity towards the ports fitted with regulating gates,</li><li>and at least one gate to empty out the mixture prepared in the lower cavity.</li></ul></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Hence, the product to be mixed and chopped does not hit the rotating augers directly but instead they perform their work on a certain quantity of product that has passed from the upper cavity to the lower cavity. A lower power is therefore required to turn the augers, with the consequent saving of energy and the reduction in pressures on these augers and other parts of the hopper.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In one version, the entraining arms are fixed to the upper part of the augers - more specifically on the end of their shaft, for simultaneous rotation. In an alternative version, these entraining arms are connected to an independent drive motor.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In a preferred version, the device includes a thin cutting unit and a resend tube in the lower cavity that, depending on its orientation, returns the thinly chopped product to the upper cavity to repeat the process or sends it outside the device.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">This thin mincing unit means that the product can be chopped in very small portions, which is ideal for use in a biogas plant.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The tube resending the thinly chopped product from the lower cavity to the upper cavity means that the product being processed can recirculate. This resending is possible in different ways, e.g. using the interior elevator auger, a cyclone or other mechanism.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Hence, the device on the version specified for use with large product volumes operates as described below: Once the device has been started, it is loaded at the top while the products are incorporated into the lower cavity through the separating sheet gate. Once the lower part is full, the gate is<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> closed and the upper part is filled with product. In the lower cavity, the augers thinly cut, mince and feed a thin mincing device, where the chopper-mixer is fitted with this thin mincing device, until the mixture is even. At the same time, the gate passing the product from the upper to the lower cavity can be used in two different ways:
<ul><li>gradually, so that the product is introduced gradually from the upper cavity to the lower cavity while the mixture is moved out or resent to the upper cavity as it is homogenised.</li><li>instantly, once the mixture has been homogenised in the lower cavity it is moved out through the emptying hole. The gates are then opened until the lower cavity is filled once again.</li></ul></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Hence, the device can prepare a certain mixture (same products and proportions) of products in both cavities. As the lower cavity chops and homogenises all of the products, these are extracted through the resend tube in the same volume as that of the products passed from the upper to the lower cavity, the latter always remaining at the same capacity.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In one version, the device includes certain measurements that means it can be used as a distributing cart for use either as a feeder in a biogas plant or to feed livestock.
