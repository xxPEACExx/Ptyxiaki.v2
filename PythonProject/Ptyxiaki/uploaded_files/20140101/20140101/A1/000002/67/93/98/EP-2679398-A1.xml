Description of Related Art</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A loose leaf binder is a document binder specializing in binding punched paper or fillings. A conventional loose leaf binder has a binder located at the central region inside. The binder has a plurality of rings or studs. When the rings are pushed apart to an open state, each ring resembles "C" which allows the punched paper for going through from the end. When the rings are pulled back together to a closed state, each ring resembles "O" and the paper is retained thereby.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The aforementioned loose leaf binder can only retain loose leaf paper. For a spiral (coil) bound notebook, wires go through all apertures on the paper so the paper has no more room for the ring binder. That is to say, the spiral bound notebook cannot fit into the conventional loose leaf binder. When the cover of the spiral bound notebook is stained, a new cover cannot replace the damaged cover. Furthermore, when the cover falls off the spiral bound notebook, the fillings do not have cover protection anymore and are prone to potential damage.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">The instant disclosure is to provide a document binder bonding with at least one book for protection.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The book includes a spine portion and the document binder includes a cover, a holding base, a first holding member, a second holding member and at least one rod. The cover has a front cover, a back cover and a back board connecting the front and back covers. The back board has a base plate which pivotally connects the front and back covers to allow the front and back covers for pivoting toward the base plate. The holding base is secured on the base plate and immobile as the back board moves. The holding base has an upper face and an opposed lower face. The lower face is disposed between the upper face and the base plate. The first and second holding members are fixed on the opposite sides of the holding base and projecting from the upper face.

Other objectives and advantages related to the instant disclosure will be illustrated in the subsequent descriptions and appended drawings.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref> shows a perspective view of a document binder 100 in accordance with an embodiment of the instant disclosure. Please refer to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> 1A</figref>. The document binder 100 includes a cover 110, a holding base 120, a first holding member 150, a second holding member 160 and a rod 130. The cover 110 has a front cover 112a, a back cover 112b and a back board 114. The back board 114 has a base plate 114a which has a pair of opposing linear edges 114b, 114c. The linear edge 114b connects the front cover 112a while the linear edge 114c connects the back cover 112b. However, in another embodiment, the cover 110 can be made of soft materials which may not distinctively show the linear edges 114b, 114c to naked eyes.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In addition, back board 114 pivotally connects the front cover 112a and back cover 112b. Specifically, the front cover 112a can rotate along the back board 114 using linear edge 114b as a shaft. Similarly, the back cover 112b can rotate along the back board 114 using linear edge 114c as a shaft. Therefore the front cover 112a and back cover 112b can rotate toward the base plate 114a by using linear edges 114b, 114c respectively.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The holding base 120 has a lower face 120b and an upper face 120a opposing the lower face 120b. The lower face 120b is disposed between the upper face 120a and the base plate 114a. The holding base 120 is firmly secured on the base plate 114a of the back board 114. For example, the holding base 120 is secured by adhesive, bolts or nails (not shown) and permanently bonded to the back board 114. Hence, unless intentionally breaking the bond, the holding base 120 does not shift as the back board 114 moves and not detach there-from either.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The first holding member 150 and the second holding member 160 are fixed on the opposite side of the holding base 120 and stretch out from<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the upper face 120a. The rod 130 is arranged between the holding members 150, 160. More specifically, the two ends of the rod 130 are engaged with the first holding member 150 and the second holding member 160 respectively. The rod 130 extends along one of the linear edges 114b or 114c and locates within the linear edges.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 1B</figref> is an exploded view of the document binder 100 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref>. Please refer to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">1B</figref>. The first holding member 150 has at least one first rod hole 150a and the second holding member 160 has at least one second rod hole 160a. The rod holes 150a, 160a can be elongated shaped to allow insertion for the plurality of rods 130.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The document binder 100 further includes at least one cap 170. One end of the rod 130 has an arresting portion 132 and the other end can engage with the cap 170. For example, screws or other fastening methods are used to engage the rod 130 and cap 170. The rod 130 goes through the first and second rod holes 150a, 160a. The cap 170 secures the rod 130 from one end and abuts the first holding member 150 while the arresting portion 132 abuts the second holding member 160. The second holding member 160 is located between the arresting portion 132 and first holding member 150. The first and second holding members 150, 160 are located between the cap 170 and arresting portion 132. Thus the rod 130 will not slide off from the first or second holding members 150, 160.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The document binder 100 is used to bond with a book 20. The book 20 can be such as a spiral bond notebook including a loose leaf book 22 and a spine portion 24. The loose leaf book 22 has a plurality of fillings 22a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> each of which has a plurality of apertures 22b. The spine portion 24 may have wires going through the apertures 22b to form a plurality of coils. For example, the spine portion 24 can form spiral bound binding. However, the book can be bound by pegs as well and the binding method is not limited to the instant embodiment.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The rod 130 goes through the spine portion 24. When the rod 130 goes through the spine portion 24 and inserts into the rod holes 150a, 160a, the rod 130 will be fixed between the first holding member 150 and the second holding member 160 of the holding base 120. The document binder 100 is then bonded with the book 20. Hence the document binder 100 can be the cover which protects the book 20 and prevents from fillings 22a being stained or damaged.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2A</figref> is a perspective view of a document binder 200 in accordance with another embodiment of the instant disclosure. <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 2B</figref> is an enlarged view of a first holding member in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2A</figref>. Please refer to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 2A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">2B</figref>. The instant embodiment is formed in a similar manner to that of the aforementioned embodiment, document binder 100. For example, the document 200 includes a cover 110, a holding base 220, a first holding member 250 and a second holding member 260. The first and second holding member 250, 260 are disposed on the opposite side of the holding base 220 respectively. The holding base 220 is firmly secured on the base plate 114a of the back board 114.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">However, the instant embodiment and the aforementioned embodiment have difference there-between. Specifically, in the instant embodiment, the document binder 200 further includes two rods 230, and each<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> end of the rods 230 are disposed on the holding members 250, 260 respectively. Hence, the rods 230 can go through the wires 24 of two books 20 respectively allowing bonding among the document binder 200 and the two books 20 (referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref>). In addition, the rods 230 are arranged in parallel and the distance between each of the rods 230 and the upper face 220a is substantially identical.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Furthermore, in another embodiment, one end of the rod 230 can be firmly secured on the second holding member 260 and being atop on the holding base 220. The rod 230 may be a resilient plastic stick or a solid stick.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Moreover, the first holding member 250 has a seat 252, a pivoting arm 254 and a screw 270. The seat 252 has a bottom 252a, a first column 252b and a second column 252c. The first and second columns 252b, 252c projects from the bottom 252a and the bottom 252a connects to the holding base 220. The first column 252b has a top end 252d formed with a screw hole 252e for receiving a screw 270. Additionally, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 2B</figref>, between the first column 252b and the second column 252c, another column is present. In another embodiment, the additional column is optional.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The pivoting arm 254 is disposed on top of the pair of columns 252b, 252c and the pivoting arm 254 pivotally connects the second column 252c. For example, the pivoting arm 254 can rotate along a rotation centre 254c and close toward the second column 252c. The axis of the rotation centre 254c may align with the rods 230. In other words, the axis of the rotation centre 254c can be parallel to the rods 230. Moreover, the pivoting arm 254 is formed with a screw hole 254a corresponding to the through hole 254a. The rotation of the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> pivoting arm 254 toward the second column 252c allows the through hole 254a for alignment with the screw hole 252e. The screw 270 can then go through the pivoting arm 254 and match the screw hole 252e. Therefore, one end of the rod 230 can be retained between the pivoting arm 254 and holding base 220.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In addition, the rods 230 may be L-shaped rods having a bent portion 230c and an extension 230b that connects to the bent portion 230c (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 2B</figref>). The combined length of the bent portion 230c and extension 230b of the rod 230 has to be shorter than the ring diameter. For example, the spine portion 24 may be spiral bound ring and the combined length of the bent portion 230c and extension 230b cannot exceed the inner diameter created by the coil. Alternatively, the book 20 may have a plurality of pegs and the length of the bent portion 230c and extension 230b has to be shorter than the peg diameter.
