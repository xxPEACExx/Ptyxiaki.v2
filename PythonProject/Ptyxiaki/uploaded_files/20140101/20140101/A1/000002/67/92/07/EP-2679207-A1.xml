Here, a disposable diaper, sanitary napkin, incontinence pad, etc., are absorbent products.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the absorbent production apparatus 1 is provided with a stacking unit 10, wrapping unit 20, conveying unit 30, pressing unit 40, and cutting<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> unit 50.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the stacking unit 10 is provided with a rotary drum 11, a plurality of pattern plates 12 which are held at the outer circumferential surface of the rotary drum 11 in a removable manner, and a material feeder 13 which feeds stacking materials to the pattern plates 12.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">At the inside space of the rotary drum 11, a negative pressure chamber 11N to which a negative pressure is applied and a positive pressure chamber 11P to which a positive pressure is applied are formed. Further, at the outer circumferential surface of the rotary drum 11, a plurality of through holes 11H which communicate with the negative pressure chamber 11N and the positive pressure chamber 11P are formed.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Each pattern plate 12, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>, includes an air-passing part 12B which receives the stacking material and a non-air-passing part 12NB which surrounds and holds the air-passing part 12B. The air-passing part 12B is for example comprised of a metal mesh, while the non-air-passing part 12NB is for example comprised of a metal plate. The pattern plate 12 is positioned on the rotary drum 11 so that the air-passing part 12B communicates with the through holes 11H of the rotary drum 11, and is for example fastened to the rotary drum 11 by bolts.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The air-passing part 12B and non-air-passing part 12NB define a recess 12R. The recess 12R includes a shallow recess 12RS and a deep recess 12RD. Here, the shape of the recess 12R corresponds to the shape of the stack which is to be produced.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The material feeder 13 feeds stacking material such as pulp fiber, synthetic fiber and an absorbent polymer, in a flying state.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">When the rotary drum 11 is made to rotate by a drive mechanism (not shown) in the arrow direction while stacking material is fed from the material feeder 13, the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> stacking material stacks in the recesses 12R of the pattern plates 12 which are communicated with the negative pressure chamber 11N whereby stacks S are formed in the recesses 12R. Next, when the pattern plates 12 reach the positive pressure chamber 11P together with the stacks S, the stacks S are made to separate from the pattern plates 12.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Again referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the wrapping web WM is unrolled from the roll WR. This wrapping web WM is conveyed by the conveyor 14 in the machine direction MD. The stacks S which are separated from the pattern plates 12 are discharged on the wrapping web WM to be conveyed.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In this case, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref>, the stacks S are conveyed in the machine direction MD separated by gaps G. This is because the non-air-passing parts 12NB of the pattern plates 12 are arranged with the recesses 12R separated by gaps from each other on the rotary drum 11 in the circumferential direction of the rotary drum 11.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In this way, in the stacking unit 10, a plurality of stacks S are sequentially formed and are discharged in the machine direction MD separated by gaps. Note that, in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, reference numeral 15 indicates a negative pressure applying apparatus which assists the stacks S in separating from the pattern plates 12.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref>, the stacks S include thick parts ST which are formed around the back ends in the machine direction MD and thin parts St other than the thick parts ST. The thick parts ST correspond to the deep recesses 12RD of the pattern plates 12. In other words, the pattern plates 12 have deep recesses 12RD so that thick parts ST are formed around the back ends of the stacks S in the machine direction MD. Note that, it can be seen from the shape of the recess 12R of the pattern plate 12 which is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, a thick part ST generally extends in a crossing direction which crosses the machine direction MD.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The stacks S are conveyed to the wrapping unit<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> 20 together with the wrapping web WM. In the wrapping unit 20, the stacks S which are sequentially discharged from the stacking unit 10 are wrapped by the wrapping web WM whereby continuous wrapped stacks WB are formed. That is, the two side edges of the wrapping web WM in the machine direction MD are guided by the guide rolls 21 and superposed with each other. As a result, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6 and FIG. 7</figref>, the continuous wrapped stacks WB are formed. In this case, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6</figref>, gaps G remain between the stacks S.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The continuous wrapped stacks WB are next conveyed by the conveyor 31 of the conveying unit 30 in the machine direction MD and conveyed to the pressing unit 40.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Again referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the pressing unit 40 is provided with a pair of pressing rolls 41 which are arranged facing each other. When the continuous wrapped stacks WB are supplied between these pressing rolls 41, the pressing rolls 41 press the continuous wrapped stacks WB and therefore the stacks S. As a result, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 8</figref>, the thick parts ST of the stacks S are stretched in the machine direction MD and are spread in the gaps G between the stacks S. Therefore, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 10</figref>, connected parts C which connect the adjoining stacks S with each other are formed.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In this embodiment according to the present invention, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 10</figref>, the connected parts C are formed at the centers of the stacks S in the crossing direction, however, are not formed at the two sides in the crossing direction CD. In other words, non-connected parts NC are formed at the two ends of the stacks S in the crossing direction CD. The non-connected parts NC have almost no stacking materials.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The continuous wrapped stacks WB are next conveyed by the conveyor 32 to the cutting unit 50. The cutting unit 50 is provided with a cutter roll 51 and an anvil roll 52 which are arranged facing each other. When<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the continuous wrapped stacks WB are supplied between the cutter roll 51 and the anvil roll 52, the cutting edge of the cutter roll 51 cuts the continuous wrapped stacks WB whereby predetermined shapes of absorbents A are formed. The absorbents A include single stacks S and wrapping material which wraps the stacks S.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The absorbents A are next conveyed by a conveyor 53 to the sealer 60. At the sealer 60, the two ends of the absorbents A in the machine direction MD are sealed. The sealed absorbents A are next conveyed by the conveyor 61 to the next step. At the next step, the absorbents A are for example assembled with outer packages of the absorbent products.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Note that, the sealer 60 may be used to seal the continuous wrapped stacks WB, then the continuous wrapped stacks WB cut. Therefore, the sealer 60 seals the absorbents A or the continuous wrapped stacks WB so that the two ends of the absorbents A in the machine direction are sealed.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Now, in the cutting unit 50, the continuous wrapped stacks WB are cut at the connected parts C. That is, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 11</figref>, the cutting line CL passes through the connected parts C. As a result, the cutting edge of the cutter roll 51 cuts both the wrapping web WM and the stacks S or stacking material. Therefore, the continuous wrapped stacks WB can be reliably cut and the absorbents A can be accurately formed into predetermined shapes. Further, the cutting pressure does not have to be made excessively high. Therefore, lifetime of the cutting edge can be extended. Note that, in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 8, FIG. 9</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 10, and FIG. 11</figref>, illustration of the wrapping web WM is omitted.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">When the continuous wrapped stacks WB are cut, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 12</figref>, for example, two trims T are formed. These trims T are discarded. In the embodiment according to the present invention, the continuous wrapped stacks WB are cut so that the two ends of the absorbents A in<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the machine direction MD project outward, so the trims become triangular shapes. Here, the trims T include the above-mentioned non-connected parts NC. The non-connected parts NC have almost no stacking materials. As a result, the amount of stacking materials which are discharged can be reduced.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Furthermore, the pattern plates 12 are held at the rotary drum 11 in a removable manner, so the pattern plates 12 can be easily exchanged. Further, the pattern plates 12 respectively have single recesses 12R, so when there is some trouble with the single recesses 12R, the single pattern plates 12 need only be exchanged. Therefore, maintenance of the pattern plates 12 becomes easy.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In the embodiment which has been explained up to here, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, the two ends of the recesses 12R of the pattern plates 12 in the machine direction are curved so as to project outward. The deep recesses 12RD are also curved. However, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 13</figref>, the recesses 12R may also be formed so that the two ends 12E of the recesses 12R in the longitudinal directions and the deep recesses 12RD extend on straight lines.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">This application claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2011040330A"><text>2011-040330</text></patcit>, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated here by reference.</p><heading id="h0011">Reference Signs List</heading><p id="p0035" num="0035"><dl id="dl0001"><dt>1</dt><dd>absorbent production apparatus</dd><dt>10</dt><dd>stacking unit</dd><dt>11</dt><dd>rotary drum</dd><dt>12</dt><dd>pattern plate</dd><dt>12RD</dt><dd>RD deep recess</dd><dt>13</dt><dd>material feeder</dd><dt>20</dt><dd>wrapping unit</dd><dt>30</dt><dd>conveying unit</dd><dt>40</dt><dd>pressing unit</dd><dt>50</dt><dd>cutting unit<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></dd><dt>A</dt><dd>absorbent</dd><dt>C</dt><dd>connected part</dd><dt>G</dt><dd>gap</dd><dt>S</dt><dd>stack</dd><dt>WB</dt><dd>continuous wrapped stacks</dd><dt>WM</dt><dd>wrapping web</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977539" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An apparatus for producing an absorbent which is used for producing an absorbent product,<br/>
