The underbone type motorcycle is equipped with a head pipe for pivotably supporting a handlebar, and a body frame having a main frame extending rearward and obliquely downward from the head pipe, and an engine is disposed below the body frame. In the underbone type motorcycle, the height of the portion between the handlebar and the seat is set low, so that space is formed in front of the seat. As a result, when riding on the motorcycle, the rider can easily straddle over the main frame, so the rider can easily mount on and dismount from the motorcycle.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPH021990120296U"><text>JP H02(1990)-120296 U</text></patcit> discloses a scooter type vehicle in which the periphery of a lower portion of the seat is covered by a vehicle body cover and a storage box disposed in the seat lower portion is interlocked to the vehicle body cover. By interlocking the storage box to the vehicle body cover, the storage box is ensured to have sufficient rigidity. This eliminates the need of, for example, providing the storage box with a reinforcement rib to ensure sufficient rigidity. As a result, the storage box is ensured to have a sufficient volumetric capacity.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, according to the technology disclosed in the just-mentioned in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JPH021990120296U"><text>JP H02(1990)-120296 U</text></patcit> , the storage box and the vehicle body cover are interlocked with each other at the front face and both side faces of the storage box, so the seat end portions are located more outward than the portions where the storage box and the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> vehicle body cover are interlocked. Consequently, the size of the seat becomes larger in terms of vehicle width. As a consequence, the rider ground reach is worsened. In particular, in the underbone type motorcycle, the seat position tends to be at a relatively higher position than that in the scooter type motorcycle because the underbone type motorcycle has such a structure that the storage box, the main frame, and the engine are disposed below the seat. As a consequence, in the underbone type motorcycle, the problem of worsening of the ground reach, which results from the increase of the vehicle-widthwise size of the seat, tends to be more serious.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention has been accomplished in view of the foregoing and other problems, and it is an object of the invention to provide an underbone type motorcycle that can ensure the storage box to have a sufficient volumetric capacity in terms of vehicle width and can improve the rider ground reach while at the same time ensuring the storage box to have sufficient rigidity.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to the present invention said object is solved by a motorcycle having the features of independent claim 1. Preferred embodiments are laid down in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the present teaching it is provided an underbone type motorcycle that can ensure the storage box to have a sufficient volumetric capacity in terms of vehicle width and can improve the rider ground reach while at the same time ensuring the storage box to have sufficient rigidity. In particular, it is provided a motorcycle comprising: a head pipe; a body frame having a main frame extending rearward and obliquely downward from the head pipe; an engine supported non-swingably on the main<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> frame and disposed below the main frame; a storage box supported by the body frame and disposed above the main frame and the engine; a seat disposed behind the head pipe and above the storage box; and a vehicle body cover disposed vehicle-widthwise outward of the storage box, wherein: the seat has a protruding portion at least a portion of which is disposed outward of the storage box and the vehicle body cover; the storage box has an opening at its top portion, a wall unit defining the opening, and an interlocking portion connected to the wall unit, the interlocking portion extending outward of the vehicle body cover over an upper edge of the vehicle body cover and interlocking with the upper edge of the vehicle body cover; and the interlocking portion includes one or more first interlocking portions and one or more second interlocking portions, the one or more first interlocking portions formed in a front-half portion of the storage box, and the one or more second interlocking portions formed behind the one or more first interlocking portions and each being a separate portion from the one or more first interlocking portions.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the motorcycle according to the present teaching, the storage box is ensured to have sufficient rigidity because the storage box can be interlocked to the vehicle body cover using the first and second interlocking portions. In addition, since the interlocking portions are provided only at limited portions of the storage box, the portion of the seat that is located outward of the storage box and the vehicle body cover is prevented from increasing in vehicle-widthwise size. As a result, the ground reach is improved, and the portion of the storage box that is not provided with the interlocking portions can be enlarged outward corresponding to the space for the interlocking portions. As a result, the volumetric capacity of the storage box can be increased.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> In one embodiment of the present teaching, the one or more first interlocking portions are formed in the front-half portion of the storage box, and the one or more second interlocking portions are formed in a rear-half portion of the storage box.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">This allows the storage box to interlock with the vehicle body cover evenly and ensures the storage box to have sufficient rigidity. In addition, the portion of the storage box that is not provided with the interlocking portions can be enlarged outward corresponding to the space for the interlocking portions. As a result, the volumetric capacity of the storage box can be increased.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In one embodiment of the present teaching, the wall unit comprises a front wall, a right wall extending rearward from a rightmost end of the front wall, a left wall extending rearward from a leftmost end of the front wall, and a rear wall connecting the right wall and the left wall to each other; and the one or more first interlocking portions and the one or more second interlocking portions are formed on each of the right wall and the left wall.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Since the storage box is interlocked to the vehicle body cover by the first and second interlocking portions formed on each of the right wall and the left wall, the storage box can be ensured to have sufficient rigidity. In addition, the portion of the storage box that is not provided with the interlocking portions can be enlarged outward corresponding to the space for the interlocking portions. As a result, the volumetric capacity of the storage box can be increased.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In one embodiment of the present teaching, the left wall has a left wall main<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> portion and a left wall bulging portion, the left wall main portion formed to have a horizontal cross section in a linear shape or in a leftward convex curved shape, and the left wall bulging portion provided more rearward than a frontmost end of the left wall main portion and more frontward than a rearmost end thereof and formed to have a horizontal cross section in a leftward convex curved shape having a greater curvature than that of the left wall main portion; and the right wall has a right wall main portion and a right wall bulging portion, the right wall main portion formed to have a horizontal cross section in a linear shape or in a rightward convex curved shape, and the right wall bulging portion provided more rearward than a frontmost end of the right wall main portion and more frontward than a rearmost end thereof and formed to have a horizontal cross section in a rightward convex curved shape having a greater curvature than that of the right wall main portion.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The volumetric capacity of the storage box can be made larger because the left wall bulging portion and the right wall bulging portion, which are respective portions of the left wall and the right wall, bulge vehicle-widthwise outward in this way.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In one embodiment of the present teaching, the one or more first interlocking portions and the one or more second interlocking portions are formed at respective locations on the left wall main portion that are in front of and behind the left wall bulging portion, and also formed at respective locations on the right wall main portion that are in front of and behind the right wall bulging portion.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Thus, the first and second interlocking portions are formed on the left wall main portion and the right wall main portion, not on the left wall bulging portion and the right<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> wall bulging portion, which have a large curvature. As a result, the portion of the seat that is located outward of the storage box and the vehicle body cover is prevented from increasing in vehicle-widthwise size.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In one embodiment of the present teaching, at least one of the one or more the first interlocking portions and the one or more second interlocking portions is inclined with respect to the vertical so as to slope downward toward vehicle-widthwise outside.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">This makes it easy to mount and interlock the storage box to the vehicle body cover.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In one embodiment of the present teaching, a lowermost end of the protruding portion is disposed lower than the upper edges of the left wall and the right wall of the storage box.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">This prevents water from entering the storage box from the sides of the seat more effectively.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In one embodiment of the present teaching, the seat is formed in such a shape that its width becomes narrower toward its front from a portion of the seat at which its width is widest; and a middle position between a frontmost end of the seat and the portion of the seat at which its width is greatest is located behind the one or more first interlocking portions and in front of the one or more second interlocking portions.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">When the rider sits on the seat, the rider's legs (thighs) tend to be disposed at<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> portions at which the line containing the middle position and perpendicular to the vehicle center line intersects with the opposite widthwise ends of the seat.
