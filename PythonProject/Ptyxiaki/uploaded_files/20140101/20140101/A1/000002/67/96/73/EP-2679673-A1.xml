Age-related macular degeneration is caused by age-related changes in the macula, and largely divided into an exudative form and an atrophic form. Exudative age-related macular degeneration is a disease associated with the development of neovascular vessels from the choroid, in the macula of elderly citizens, then bleeding and exudative lesion under the retinal pigment epithelium or retina, and finally, formation of a scar tissue. Atrophic age-related macular degeneration is a disease accompanied by atrophy of the macular area and accumulation of drusen. A precursor lesion leading to exudative and atrophic age-related macular degeneration is sometimes referred to particularly as early age-related macular degeneration, and this lesion is also considered to be one pathology of age-related macular degeneration.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For the treatment of age-related macular degeneration when it is a mild exudative form, a surgical therapy such as photodynamic therapy, laser photocoagulation, stripping of neovascular vessel and the like, or a treatment method aiming at regression and removal of neovascular vessel by a drug<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> therapy such as administration of an inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) involved in the angiogenesis and the like can be selected. However, the aforementioned means cannot provide therapeutic effectiveness for the exudative or atrophic form that has progressed to the advanced atrophy or lack of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In such case, an effective treatment method is transplantation of retinal pigment epithelial cells or retinal pigment epithelium to the deficient site under the retina.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Various treatment methods by the transplantation of retinal pigment epithelial cells have been tried. It has been reported that transplantation of retinal pigment epithelial cells obtained from human fetus in the form of a cell suspension shows poor engraftment of the transplanted cells. In cases where a retinal pigment epithelial cell sheet also containing Bruch's membrane and choroid detached like a sheet from a cadaveric eye was transplanted, post-operative rejection occurred and a sufficient treatment effect was not obtained (non-patent document 1). In addition, the method utilizing a cadaveric eye has been pointed out to include an ethical problem. On the other hand, a case of improved eyesight of a patient with age-related macular degeneration has been reported, wherein used was a method including collecting the patient's own normal retinal pigment epithelial cells and choroid and transplanting them to the deficient site under the macula. However, this method places an extremely high burden on patients and an extremely high risk of surgery. While an attempt has been made to utilize the patient's own iris pigment epithelial cells collected from the patient with age-related macular degeneration for the transplantation instead of retinal pigment epithelial cells, the upper limit of the final eyesight is low and a sufficient effect has not been obtained, and moreover, the burden and risk of utilizing the patient's own cell are high (non-patent document 2). Thus, conventional<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> treatment methods using cells collected from a cadaveric eye or the patient's own cells are not practical in terms of ethics, safety, effect and the like, and a retinal pigment epithelial cell truly usable for a transplantation treatment has been desired.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As one of the production methods of a retinal pigment epithelial cell sheet, a method including coating a cell culture substrate with an extracellular matrix and the like, and culturing retinal pigment epithelial cells thereon to form a sheet can be mentioned. For example, a cell sheet can be formed by culturing retinal pigment epithelial cells on a fibronectin-coated material, but formation of a basement membrane is not reported, and a method of taking out a sheet from a container in which the sheet was formed is not described at all (non-patent document 3). In consideration of such problems, a method of forming, in advance, a retinal pigment epithelial cell sheet by using an artificial membrane in place of a basement membrane has been developed by plural laboratories. However, an artificial membrane is feared to be a disorder for engraftment in transplantation and functional maintenance of the body. While an artificial membrane with a less biological response has also been developed, it is not suitable for transplantation since it problematically induces inflammation and rejection associated therewith, which are caused by the differences from the basement membrane produced by the cell itself in the composition, properties, rigidity and the like. Conventionally, moreover, a method of culturing a retinal pigment epithelial cell sheet having polarity has been known. However, it is only for experimental model use wherein retinal pigment epithelial cells and immortalized line derived from a living organism are/is made into a sheet in a container and directly utilized, and it has not yet enabled actual recovery of a retinal pigment epithelial cell sheet provided with a basement membrane as in living organisms from a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> container (non-patent document 4). There is a method of obtaining a retinal pigment epithelial cell sheet by exfoliating retinal pigment epithelial cells directly cultured on a culture dish, without using an extracellular matrix and the like. Such method of detaching cells by exfoliation cannot stabilize the shape and size of the sheet, basement membrane and the like, causes much damage on the retinal pigment epithelial cells by exfoliation, and causes, in most cases, disintegration of the shape of the sheet and scattered cells due to the exfoliation, thus failing to provide a cell sheet usable for transplantation and the like (non-patent document 5). In addition, while coating a cell culture substrate with collagen and culturing cells on the collagen has been reported, human retinal pigment epithelial cells are not used. Moreover, to increase the gel strength, a crosslinking agent needs to be added separately, which makes the method far from convenient and rapid (patent document 1). As the situation now stands, production of a retinal pigment epithelial cell sheet, which is therapeutically effective for retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and the like, and convenient and stable to prepare, has still been a problem.</p><heading id="h0003">[Document List]</heading><heading id="h0004">[patent document]</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006"><ul><li>patent document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2005261292A"><text>JP-A-2005-261292</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">[non-patent documents]</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007"><ul><li>non-patent document 1: <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Ophthalmic Surg. 1991 Feb; 22(2): 102-8</text></nplcit>.</li><li>non-patent document 2: <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Tohoku J Exp Med. 1999 Dec; 189(4): 295-305</text></nplcit>.</li><li>non-patent document 3: <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Nat.

The conditions and medium used for differentiation of the aforementioned stem cell into the object differentiated cell may follow conventionally-known conditions and medium, or may be appropriately determined by those of ordinary skill in the art. In the present invention, a cell obtained by inducing differentiation of stem cell or progenitor cell, preferably pluripotent stem cell, is preferably used as the retinal pigment epithelial cell to be used for cell sheet, since a<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> retinal pigment epithelial cell at an appropriate maturation stage can be prepared, and particularly, comparatively immature retinal pigment epithelial cells can be prepared and a cell sheet can be advantageously formed. In addition, when the cell sheet to be produced by the present invention is for transplantation, use of an iPS cell is preferable since a cell sheet obtained using a somatic cell of the subject, who receives transplantation, as a source of iPS cell does not have antigenicity against the subject. When a stem cell is induced to differentiate, for example, human ES cell or pluripotent stem cell such as iPS cell and the like is cultured in an ES differentiation medium added with Wnt antagonist such as Dkk-1, CKI-7 and the like and Nodal antagonist such as Lefty A, SB-431542 and the like. When cultured for a given period, Rx, Pax6 and Mitf, which are retinal progenitor cell markers, are expressed, and human retinal pigment epithelial cells can be obtained by morphological observation with an optical microscope, by confirming cells having a polygonal form and pigment [<nplcit id="ncit0008" npl-type="s"><text>Neuroscience Letters 2009 Jul 24 458(3) 126-31</text></nplcit>, <nplcit id="ncit0009" npl-type="s"><text>Journal of Cell Science 2009 Sep 1 122(Pt 17) 3169-79</text></nplcit>].</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The retinal pigment epithelial cells of the present invention are cultured by seeding on a collagen gel. The collagen used for the collagen gel may be any as long as it is derived from a mammal (e.g., human, monkey, mouse, rat, dog, bovine, horse, swine, sheep, goat, cat, rabbit, hamster, guinea pig etc.) and, for example, human- or swine-derived collagen is used. Examples of the tissue derived from collagen include tendon, skin and the like. While the kind of the collagen may be any, one other than the collagen constituting the human basement membrane is preferable, one other than type-IV collagen is specifically preferable. Of these, type I collagen is preferably used. While a collagen gel can be produced by, for example, a conventionally-known production method, in the present invention, a gel composed of a collagen fiber network<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> is produced by inducing fibrogenesis of collagen, as described in the below-mentioned Example. Since the fibrotic collagen has strength and flexibility in combination, it is easy to handle, shows good maintenance of cell proliferation and cell differentiation, and is preferable as the collagen gel to be used in the present invention. In addition, the collagen to be used in the present invention is required to maintain cells, which are seeded on the collagen gel, on the gel surface without allowing them to sink into the gel layer. As the collagen, therefore, preferred is one wherein the gel has the strength necessary for cell proliferation and, for example, collagen having a large amount of intermolecular crosslinking is preferable. As such collagen, tendon-derived collagen can be mentioned.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">While the collagen concentration of the aforementioned collagen gel may be in any range as long as it can afford a gel having strength permitting engraftment and growth of retinal pigment epithelial cells, and satisfying solubility facilitating degradation by collagenase, viscosity enabling easy handling and the like, it is preferably 0.1% (W/V) - 0.5% (W/V), more preferably 0.2% (W/V) - 0.3% (W/V). When the collagen concentration of the collagen gel is less than 0.1% (W/V), the strength of the collagen gel becomes insufficient, and therefore, the colonization rate and cell proliferation rate of retinal pigment epithelial cells decrease. When the collagen concentration of the collagen gel exceeds 0.5% (W/V), the time of a collagenase treatment to degrade the collagen gel becomes long, which is feared to exert an adverse influence on the cells.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">While the volume of a collagen gel mixed solution used for the production of the aforementioned collagen gel varies depending on the culture area and shape of a culture substrate to be used for the cell culture, it is preferably about 100 µl<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> - about 250 µl, more preferably about 150 µl - about 200 µl, per unit area (cm<sup>2</sup>). When the amount of the collagen gel mixed solution is too small, a collagen gel layer having a thin center part due to the influence of a surface tension applied to the gel surface is formed, and the sheet tends to be damaged during cutting out of the cell sheet, since the cells directly contact with a culture substrate for when the retinal pigment epithelial cells are cultured. When the amount of the collagen gel mixed solution is in excess, a thick collagen gel layer is formed on a culture substrate, which relatively reduces the amount of the culture medium, and therefore, maintenance culture is not easy to perform, collagenase treatment takes time, and damages on the cell sheet are feared.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In step (1), a cell sheet can be produced by seeding and culturing the aforementioned retinal pigment epithelial cells on the collagen gel of a cell culture substrate. The cell culture substrate in the present invention is not particularly limited as long as it is for cell culture. Examples thereof include culture containers having a porous membrane such as transwell and the like, flask, tissue culture flask, dish, petri dish, tissue culture dish, multi dish, microplate, microwell plate, multiplate, multiwell plate, chamber slide, petri dish, tube, tray, culture bag and roller bottle. Culture containers having a porous membrane are preferable, since a collagenase treatment and a cutting operation of the cell sheet are conveniently performed. For example, a commercially available transwell is preferably used. Examples of the material of the cell culture substrate in the present specification include, but are not limited to, inorganic materials such as metal, glass, ceramic, silicon and the like, organic materials represented by elastomer, plastic (e.g., polyester resin, polyethylene resin, polypropylene resin, ABS resin, nylon, acrylic resin, fluororesin, polycarbonate resin, polyurethane resin, methylpentene resin, phenol resin, melamine<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> resin, epoxy resin, vinyl chloride resin).</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The number of the retinal pigment epithelial cells to be seeded may be in any range as long as it is a cell density capable of forming a cell sheet. However, when the cell density is too low, the cell shape is bad, the culture time before reaching confluence is long, and further, the time necessary for cell maturation and coloring is long. When the cell density is too high, similarly, cell proliferation is suppressed, the culture time before reaching confluence tends to be long, and the cells may die from being overcrowded. Therefore, the density of the cells to be seeded is preferably about 4.5×10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> - about 8.5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, more preferably about 8.5×10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> - about 8.5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, most preferably about 4.5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A single layer cell population (cell sheet) composed of retinal pigment epithelial cells can be formed by culturing the retinal pigment epithelial cells seeded on collagen gel in a culture medium.

Furthermore, serum (fetal bovine serum etc.), various growth factors (EGF, FGF, HGF, PDGF etc.), antibiotic, amino acid and the like may be added to the basal medium. The pH of the medium is preferably about 6 - about 8. As for culture, for example, a primary culture is performed generally at about 30 - about 40°C for about 15 - about 60 hr until the retinal pigment epithelial cells become confluent. Thereafter, a secondary culture is performed for about 1 week - about 2<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> months while changing the medium, after which the culture is performed while aerating and stirring where necessary until formation of a cell sheet. Cells constituting the cell sheet obtained by such culture are maintained as retinal pigment epithelial cells. Maintenance of the cells as retinal pigment epithelial cells can be confirmed by detecting BEST1, RPE65, MERTK, CRALBP or the like as a specific differentiation marker.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Since the cell sheet formed in step (1) is adhered to collagen gel, for example, when it is directly used for transplantation and the like, the collagen gel is feared to prevent engraftment in a transplant recipient. If the collagen gel can be removed in advance, it is conducible to the solution of such problem. In step (2) of the present invention, the collagen gel adhering to the cell sheet formed in step (1) is degraded by collagenase. Those of ordinary skill in the art can select appropriate collagenase according to the kind of the collagen used for preparing the collagen gel. While the collagenase to be used for the degradation of the collagen gel is not particularly limited as long as it has an activity to digest collagen gel, one that does not easily degrade collagen constituting the human basement membrane (e.g., Type-IV collagen etc.) is preferable. For example, collagenase derived from a microorganism induced from Clostridium (Clostridium histolyticum) or Streptomyces (Streptomyces parvulus), which are available at a commercial level, safe and have a high enzyme activity, can be used.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As the activity of the above-mentioned collagenase, the specific activity relative to the collagen weight in the collagen gel is important rather than the activity per unit weight of collagenase and the activity per unit volume of an aqueous collagenase solution.

In the cell sheet obtained by the method of the present invention, cytokine specific to a retinal pigment epithelial cell is secreted with the polarity similar to that in living organisms, and transepithelial electric resistance (TER) to be an index of close adhesion bond between cells elevated as in living organisms. Therefore, it has a cell layer barrier<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> function similar to that in living organisms.

In the present specification, the "basement membrane" is a membrane formed from the components produced from retinal pigment epithelial cells, and means a membrane containing at least a part of the basement membrane component (hereinafter to be referred to as a "basement membrane of retinal pigment epithelial cells"). The basement membrane of the retinal pigment epithelial cell in living organisms is present as a thin film between a retinal pigment epithelial cell layer and an inner collagen layer constituting the Bruch's membrane, and is an extracellular matrix having Type-IV collagen, laminin, heparan sulfate proteoglycan (perlecan), nidogen and the like as representative components. The Bruch's membrane is a thin film between the retinal pigment epithelial cell layer and choroid, and has a 5-layer structure of a basement membrane of retinal pigment epithelial cells, an inner collagen layer, an elastin layer, an outer collagen layer, and a basement membrane of capillary lamina of choroid. The cell sheet of the present invention contains a part (basement membrane of retinal pigment epithelial cell) of the structure of the Bruch's membrane. The formation of tight junction can be confirmed by observing hexagonally-shaped closely-adhered cell form, and expression of occludin, ZO-1 and the like between cells by immunostaining. The formation of basement membrane can be confirmed by observing expression of basement membrane markers such as laminin, heparan sulfate proteoglycan (perlecan), nidogen, or Type-IV collagen and the like on a cell surface by immunostaining, or observation with a scanning electron<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> microscope.<br/>
Generally, retinal pigment epithelial cells cultured on a culture dish produce basement membrane components, but it is extremely difficult to detach the cells in the form of a usable retinal pigment epithelial cell sheet detached from a culture dish (<nplcit id="ncit0011" npl-type="s"><text>Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci., 36(2), 1995, 381-390</text></nplcit>). According to the method of the present invention, retinal pigment epithelial cells together with a basement membrane produced from retinal pigment epithelial cells can be recovered as a sheet without utilizing an artificial membrane. Since retinal pigment epithelial cells form a single layer structure, when they are handled singly, the sheet structure is disintegrated and the cells are scattered into cell units. Thus, transplantation thereof as a sheet is extremely difficult. On the other hand, since the cell sheet of the present invention accompanies a basement membrane and has sufficient rigidity, it is not easily wrinkled during recovery, which makes the handling thereof extremely easy. Consequently, since mounting on a cell transplantation device and a transplantation operation can be performed smoothly, cell transplantation can be performed with minimum invasion, and both the effect and the prognosis are expected to be improved. In addition, since the cell sheet accompanies a basement membrane, it is extremely advantageous for transplantation in a disease wherein the basement membrane is simultaneously disordered. For example, age-related macular degeneration sometimes accompanies disorder of Bruch's membrane. The basement membrane in the cell sheet of the present invention compensates for the disordered part, whereby the engrafting rate of the cell sheet can be improved, and a treatment effect thereof can also be expected. Hence, the cell sheet of the present invention is preferable as a sheet for transplantation targeting a disease with a disordered basement membrane, and can be preferably utilized as a sheet for transplantation particularly targeting age-related macular degeneration.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The production method of the cell sheet of the present invention may further contain the following step (3):

Quantitative PCR methods such as competitive PCR, real-time PCR and the like are preferable since expression variation of a basement membrane marker gene can be detected rapidly and conveniently from a trace amount of a sample, and DNA chip analysis is preferable since expression variation of plural marker genes can be collectively detected and quantification performance can also be also improved by selecting a detection method and the like.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">When Northernblot or dot blot hybridization is employed, the basement membrane marker gene can be detected using a nucleic acid (probe) capable of hybridizing with a transcription product of the gene.
