A latch 4 is movable between a first position protruding from the frontal end of the housing (<figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1 b)</figref> and a second position retracted in the housing (<figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1 a)</figref>. Inside the housing, electrical drive means 5 are provided for moving the latch between said first and second positions.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to the present invention a deactivation mechanism 6 is provided in the housing, allowing movement of the drive means 5 or at least part thereof from an active position (<figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1</figref> a &amp; b) wherein the drive means are enabled to move the latch 4 between the first and second position and a inactive position (<figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1c</figref>) wherein the latch 4 is retracted in the housing irrespective of its movement by the electrical drive means.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The housing 1 is preferably made in a rigid material such as steel or aluminum and preferably has a length of no more than 20cm, preferably no more than 15 cm and a diameter of maximally 4 cm, preferably maximally 3 cm, most preferably a diameter of maximally 2,5 cm.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A rim 7 is provided inside the housing dividing the inner space in the housing in a frontal compartment 8 accommodating the latch 4 and a distal compartment 9 accommodating the deactivation mechanism 6. Preferably a longitudinally extending groove is provided in the inner surface of the housing in said frontal compartment 8.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">At the distal end 3, in particular a distal end plate 10 of the housing several connectors 11 are provided allowing external supply of power to the drive means 5 and deactivation mechanism 6. Control of the drive means 5 is preferably achieved by a control unit comprising a printed circuit board and a memory provided in the housing (not depicted).</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The drive means 5 in this case comprise an electromotor 12, the outgoing ax of which is coupled to a spindle 13 extending axially in the housing, through a hole defined by the inner edge of rim 7.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The latch 4 is provided with an threaded hole 14 cooperating with the free end of the spindle 13. The latch further preferably comprises an externally directed protrusion 15 cooperating with the above mentioned groove in the frontal compartment of the housing, thereby preventing rotation of the latch 4 in view of the housing 1.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The deactivation mechanism in this case comprises a spring 16 and a blocking pal 17. The spring is fixed with one end to the electromotor 12 and with the other end to the distal end plate 10 of the housing, thereby biasing the drive means 5 towards the distal end 2 of the housing 1.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The blocking pal 17 is positioned to maintain the drive means 5 in an active position against the force exerted by the spring 16 and is mounted pivoting around an axes 18 fixed in the housing. A second axes 19 provided in said pal is fixed to the free end of a rod 20 extending longitudinally in said housing and movable in the axial direction by a solenoid 21 electrically powered through a connector 11.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The functioning of the locking device is rather simple and straight-forward. <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1a</figref> represents the locking device in an active open position, whereby the latch is retracted in the housing and the drive means are maintained in an active position by pal 17. In this position, the solenoid 21 is electrically powered.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">By activation of the drive means, the spindle 13 is rotated and the latch is forced out of the housing to a closed position of the locking device. By driving the electromotor in an opposite sense, the spindle is winds itself inside the latch, thereby retracting the latch inside the housing.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">When the locking device is in a closed position and a power interruption occurs, the rod 19 is forced to move towards the frontal end of the housing by the solenoid, thereby pivoting the pal 17 and releasing the drive means 5 which is retracted in a distal (second) position under the force of spring 16. The movement of the drive means in a distal position will automatically retract the latch in an open position of the locking device as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1c</figref>.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">To reactivate the lock, the drive means 5 need to be actuated such that the electromotor winds itself on the spindle against the force of spring 16 into its active position. Meanwhile<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> power supply to the the deactivation mechanism is restored and the pall 17 will maintain the drive means 5 in the active position. The locking device is now open with the latch retreated in the housing as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> a.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">It is noted that the deactivation mechanism can also be actuated by means of a mechanical movement of rod 20 (in this case pushing it towards the frontal end of the housing). Therefore rod 20 preferably protrudes from the distal end of the housing.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 2a-c</figref> represent an alternative embodiment of the locking device according to the present invention, wherein the solenoid of the deactivation mechanism in the above embodiment is replaced by an electromagnet 22 fixed on the distal surface of rim 7 and a permanent magnet 23 on the distal surface of which the electromotor 12 is fixed. When power is supplied to the electromagnet, the permanent magnet 23 and the electromotor are maintained frontally in the distal compartment 8, whereas in case of interruption of the power supply, the electromotor 12 and permanent magnet 23 are retracted by spring 16 in an inactive position of the drive means towards the distal end of the distal compartment 8.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Clearly the permanent magnet and electromagnet can be switched mutually without changing the functioning of the locking device.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 3a-c</figref> represent a third embodiment of a locking device according to the present invention wherein the electromotor 12 of the drive means is incorporated in the latch 4 and where the deactivation mechanism comprises an electromagnet 22 and a permanent magnet 23 that is movable in the housing and comprises a threaded hole cooperating with the spindle 13 of the drive means. In this case the permanent magnet is fixed to the spring 16 to retract the permanent magnet and hence the spindle, the electromotor and latch distally in case of a power interruption.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">It is further preferred that the locking device comprises a lock position sensor 24 provided at the frontal end of the housing and having a counterpart 24' provided in a strike plate 25 of the locking device. Such lock position sensor can for example comprise a magnet provided in the strike plate and a RFID tag in the housing, whereby in case the RFID is positioned in front of the magnet, an electric current is generated in the tag.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The RFID tag is in this case electrically coupled to a control unit for activation of the electromotor. Preferably the lock position sensor is comprises a unique key coupling between the part provided in the strike plate and the part comprised in the housing such that accidental or unauthorized activation of the lock position sensor can be prevented.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">When in this case the lock position sensor detects the presence of the magnet, a signal is generated and received by the control unit that in turn will activate the electromotor to turn and move the latch out of the housing in a closed position of the locking device (<figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">figures 1 b, 2b and 3b</figref>).</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">To open the locking device, two options are available. In normal operation, unlocking can be achieved by an external signal (for example from a badge reader) to the control unit, thereby actuating the electromotor to turn and retract the latch (<figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1a, 2a</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">3a</figref>).</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">It is clear that due to its tubular housing, due to the axial alignment of the electromotor and the latch in the housing and the distal positioning of the connectors for both the solenoid and the electromotor and/or control unit, installing the locking device is very simple. Indeed, inserting the locking device in a side wall of a door only requires providing a circular hole (in a side edge of a door or frame - Figure 4) wherein the locking device can be positioned and subsequently fastened. Moreover the movement enabled by the drive means and by the deactivation mechanism are both oriented in a same direction allowing a very compact housing design.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In order to adjust the position of the lock in view of the distance between the door and the frame a simple sliding of the locking device in the circular hole suffices. Moreover, the lock can be easily mounted in the frame of a door with the strike plate provided in the door itself. Such set up has the additional benefit that the locking device may create an additional anchoring of the frame in a wall thereby strengthening the frame.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977349" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A locking device comprising:
