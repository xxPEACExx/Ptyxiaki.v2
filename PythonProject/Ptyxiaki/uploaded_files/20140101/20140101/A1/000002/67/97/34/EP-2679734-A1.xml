The battery is made, for instance, of lead, lithium ions, or nickel hydride and divisible into a minimal unit called a cell. A final commercially-available product of the battery is a module that includes one pack of a plurality of cells. An electrically-operated hydraulic excavator described, for instance, in Patent Document 1 has a battery device that includes a plurality of modules (namely, a plurality of batteries).</p><heading id="h0003">Prior Art Literature</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Document</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2008044408A"><text>JP-2008-44408-A</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of the Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, the above prior art has the following problem. The above-mentioned battery device is formed by series-connecting all the batteries although it is not explicitly described in Patent Document 1. Hence, the electric motor is driven by the electrical power supplied from all the batteries. It means that all the batteries are simultaneously used. Therefore, if the battery device is to be charged because only a small amount of electrical power is stored in the battery device while the electrically-operated hydraulic excavator is operated, for instance, at a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> construction site, the electrically-operated hydraulic excavator needs to travel to a charging site by using its battery power or travel to the load-carrying platform of a vehicle by using its battery power for the purpose of being carried to the charging site. If all the batteries are exhausted without the knowledge of an operator of the electrically-operated hydraulic excavator, it is difficult to achieve charging because the electrically-operated hydraulic excavator is stopped and unable to travel by using its battery power.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">An object of the present invention is to provide an electric construction machine that is capable of avoiding a situation where charging is difficult to achieve due to the exhaustion of all of its batteries.</p><heading id="h0007">Means for Solving the Problem</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">(1) In accomplishing the above object, according to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an electric construction machine including an electric motor, a hydraulic pump, a plurality of hydraulic actuators, and a battery device. The hydraulic pump is driven by the electric motor. The hydraulic actuators are driven by hydraulic fluid discharged from the hydraulic pump. The battery device serves as an electrical power source for the electric motor. The battery device includes a plurality of battery systems which each have a plurality of series-connected<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> batteries. The battery systems are mutually parallel-connected. The electric construction machine also includes connection change control means that can change the connections of the battery systems to select one of the battery systems and let the selected battery system supply electrical power to the electric motor.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the present invention, which is described above, the battery device includes the battery systems and drives the electric motor by allowing one of the battery systems to supply electrical power. In other words, only one battery system is used at a time. Therefore, even if the electric construction machine stops because the battery system supplying electrical power to the electric motor is exhausted without the knowledge of an operator of the electric construction machine, the connection change control means can switch to another battery system to let it supply electrical power to the electric motor and operate the electric construction machine. As the electric construction machine can travel by using its battery power, it is possible to avoid a situation where charging is difficult to achieve.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">(2) According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided the electric construction machine as described in (1) above, further including manual selection means that is manually operated to select one of the battery systems. The connection change control means<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> changes the connections of the battery systems so that the battery system selected by the manual selection means supplies electrical power to the electric motor.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Consequently, if a battery system supplying electrical power to the electric motor is exhausted, the electric construction machine is stopped until the operator manually operates the manual selection means. This ensures that the operator certainly becomes aware of the exhausted battery system.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">(3) According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided the electric construction machine as described in (1) above, further including a plurality of remaining battery power amount acquisition means, motor stop control means, and automatic selection means. The remaining battery power amount acquisition means acquires information about the amount of electrical power remaining in each of the battery systems. The motor stop control means stops the electric motor when a battery system supplying electrical power to the electric motor is exhausted. The automatic selection means automatically selects a battery system other than the exhausted battery system when a preselected period of time elapses after the electric motor is stopped by the motor stop control means. The connection change control means changes the connections of the battery systems so that the battery system selected by the automatic selection means supplies electrical power<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> to the electric motor.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Consequently, when a battery system supplying electrical power to the electric motor is exhausted, the electric construction machine remains stopped for the predetermined period of time. This ensures that the operator certainly becomes aware of the exhausted battery system.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">(4) According to still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided the electric construction machine as described in (1), (2), or (3) above, further including display means for indicating a battery system that supplies electrical power to the electric motor.</p><heading id="h0008">Advantages of the Invention</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention makes it possible to avoid a situation where charging is difficult to achieve due to the exhaustion of all batteries.</p><heading id="h0009">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a side view illustrating the overall structure of an electrically-operated hydraulic excavator according to an embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> is a top view illustrating the overall structure of the electrically-operated hydraulic excavator<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> according to the embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> is a hydraulic circuit diagram illustrating the configuration of a hydraulic drive device according to the embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of an inverter device and related equipment according to the embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of a battery device and related equipment according to the embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a battery charge control process according to the embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a motor drive control process according to the embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 8</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a motor drive control process according to a modified embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 9</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of an inverter device and related equipment according to the modified embodiment of the present invention.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010">Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">An embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings on the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> assumption that the present invention is applied, for instance, to an electrically-operated hydraulic excavator.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a side view illustrating the overall structure of the electrically-operated hydraulic excavator according to the present embodiment. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> is a top view.
