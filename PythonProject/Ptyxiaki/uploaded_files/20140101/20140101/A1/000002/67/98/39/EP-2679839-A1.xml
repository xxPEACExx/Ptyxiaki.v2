This tilting pad journal bearing generally includes a plurality of pads disposed on the outer circumferential side of a rotating shaft and subjected to radial load on the rotating shaft, a plurality of pivots each supporting a corresponding one of the pads in such a manner that the pads are tiltable, and a casing housing the pads and the pivots. When the rotating shaft is rotated, lubricating oil is introduced between the rotating shaft and the pads to form wedged oil films therebetween. In this case, since the pad can be tilted, the rotating shaft is eccentric and a load is applied to the rotating shaft in a direction corresponding to the eccentricity, which attains<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> good vibration stability. Thus, the tilting pad journal bearings are widely employed for high-speed rotating machines such as steam turbines, gas turbines and centrifugal compressors.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In recent years, rotating machines such as steam turbines and the like have been enlarged in order to increase efficiency. A tilting pad journal bearing supporting a rotating shaft of the rotating machine needs to catch up with high circumferential velocity and high surface pressure attributable to the enlargement. Specifically, the inner circumferential surface of a pad, which is a sliding surface with the rotating shaft, generates friction heat and seizure is more likely to occur with higher circumferential velocity and higher surface pressure. It is, therefore, necessary to provide some contrivance to reduce the temperature of the inner circumferential surface of the pad.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In view of the above, the conventional technology described in e.g. patent document 1 has a lubricating oil supply passage formed inside each of pads so as to cool the pad. The lubricating oil supply passage extends from one end side to the other end side of the pad in the circumferential direction. A flexible pipe is coupled to the inlet of the lubricating oil supply passage formed on one end side (in other words, on the downstream side in the rotational direction of the rotating shaft), in the circumferential direction, of the pad. A blowoff block is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> integrally secured to the other end side (in other words, on the upstream side in the rotational direction of the rotating shaft), in the circumferential direction, of the pad. An oil-lead passage of the blowoff block is connected to the outlet of the lubricating oil supply passage formed on the other end side, in the circumferential direction, of the pad. In this way, lubricating oil is led to the lubricating oil supply passage of the pad via the flexible pipe, is caused to flow in the lubricating oil supply passage of the pad in the direction opposite to the rotational direction of the rotating shaft and is led to the oil-leading passage of the blowoff block. The lubricating oil is then sprayed toward the outer circumferential surface of the rotating shaft via nozzles of the blowoff block. Thus, the pad can effectively be cooled and lubricated at a small oiling quantity without a stirring loss.</p><heading id="h0003">Prior-art Documents</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005"><ul><li>Patent document: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2003113834A"><text>JP-2003-113834-A</text></patcit> (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1 and 2</figref>) Non-patent document</li></ul></p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><ul><li>Non-patent document: <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>Tribology Handbook Edited by Japan Society of Tribologists, Yokendo, 2001, pp53-57</text></nplcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of the Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, the conventional technology described above has room for improvement as below.

Incidentally, the rotating shaft 1 is designed to rotate in the direction (clockwise) indicated by a dotted line arrow R in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The pad 2 has an inner circumferential surface made of a low-melting-point alloy such as white metal or the like. The inner circumferential surface acts as a sliding surface with the rotating shaft 1. To cool the pad 2, the pad 2 is formed therein with oil passages 6. The oil passages 6 extend, e.g. linearly, from a front end on one side (in other words, on the upstream side in the rotational direction of the rotating shaft 1) to a rear end on the other side (in other words, on the downstream side in the rotating direction of the rotating shaft 1) in the circumferential direction. Incidentally, three oil passages 6 are arranged in the width direction of each pad 2 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> in the present embodiment. In addition, <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> illustrates the case where the oil passage 6 has a square cross-section. However, the oil passage 6 may have a circular cross-section (the same holds true for <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 5</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0007">14</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">15</figref> described later).</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A substantially cylindrical bearing housing 7 is installed on the outer circumferential side of the tilting pad bearing (i.e., on the outer circumferential side of the casing 5). The bearing housing 7 is formed on its inner circumferential surface with a circumferential oil-leading groove 8 extending over the whole circumference thereof. The bearing housing 7 is formed with a radial oil-leading hole 9 which allows the circumferential oil-leading groove 8 on the inner circumferential side to communicate with the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> outer circumferential side. The casing 5 of the tilting pad bearing is formed with a plurality of (five in the present embodiment) oil-supply holes 10 at respective circumferential positions corresponding to the plurality of respective guides 4.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The guides 4, which are a substantial part of the present embodiment, are each secured to the inner circumferential surface of the casing 5.

The first guide passage 11 is adapted to introduce lubricating oil therein from the oil-supply hole 10 of the casing 5 and exhaust it to the oil passage 6 of the pad 2 that is adjacent to the guide 4 and on the other side (in other words, on the downstream side in the rotational direction of the rotating shaft 1) in the circumferential direction. In addition, the guides 4 each have a second guide passage 12 formed on the inside thereof. The second guide passage 12 is adapted to introduce lubricating oil therein from the oil passage 6 of the pad 2 that is adjacent to the guide 4 and on one side (i.e., on the upstream side in the rotational direction of the rotating shaft 1) in the circumferential direction and exhausts it to between the inner circumferential surface of the pad 2 on the other side in the circumferential direction and the outer circumferential surface of the rotating shaft 1. Incidentally, a gap between the guide 4 and the pad 4 is set<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> at such minute spacing (e.g. approximately 1 mm) as not to interfere with each other even if the pad 4 tilts.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A description is next given of the operation, function and effect of the present embodiment.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Lubricating oil supplied from the radial oil-leading hole 9 of the bearing housing 7 is led to the first guide passage 11 of each guide 4 via the circumferential oil-leading groove 8 of the bearing housing 7 and the oil-supply hole 10 of the casing 5. Then, the lubricating oil is led to the oil passage 6 of the pad 2 that is adjacent to the corresponding guide 4 and on the other side in the circumferential direction (in other words, on the downstream side in the rotational direction of the rotating shaft 1). The lubricating oil flows in the oil passages 6 of each pad 2 in the rotational direction of the rotating shaft 1, is led to the second guide passage 12 of each guide 4 and led to between the outer circumferential surface of the rotating shaft 1 and the inner circumferential surface of the pad 2 that is adjacent to the corresponding guide 4 and on the other side in the circumferential direction. In this way, the pads can effectively be cooled and lubricated at a small oiling quantity without a stirring loss.
