corresponds to the second reinforcing plate of the present invention.</p><heading id="h0006">EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">In accordance with the first aspect of the present invention, since the vertical member, which is joined to the front portion of the front side frame extending in the fore-and-aft direction and extends in the vertical direction, and the side frame gusset, which provides a connection between the front portion of the front side frame and the front portion of the wheel house upper member, are joined by means of the linking panel within the plane T perpendicular to the axis in the fore-and-aft direction, when a load is applied so as to relatively move the front portion of the front side frame, the side frame gusset, and the front portion of the wheel house upper member in the vertical direction or the left-and-right direction, supporting the load by means of the shear force of the linking panel disposed within the plane T enables the rigidity of the front portion of the vehicle body to be enhanced while minimizing any increase in the weight.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Furthermore, in accordance with the second aspect of the present invention, since the linking panel is a member having a right-angled triangle shape when viewed from the front and having the horizontal edge portion, the vertical edge portion, and the inclined edge portion, and the horizontal edge portion of the linking panel is joined to the side frame gusset within the plane T, it is possible to prevent the linking panel from bending, thus further enhancing the rigidity of the front portion of the vehicle body.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Moreover, in accordance with the third aspect of the present invention, since the linking panel is joined to the front portion of the wheel house upper member within the plane T via the apex at which the horizontal edge portion and the inclined edge portion are merged together, it becomes more difficult for the front portion of the wheel house upper member to be displaced relative to the front side frame and the vertical member, thus further enhancing the rigidity of the front portion of the vehicle body.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Furthermore, in accordance with the fourth aspect of the present invention, since the horizontal edge portion of the linking panel is formed integrally with the front face of the side frame gusset, it becomes possible to reduce the number of components and the number of welding steps and reduce the weight.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Furthermore, in accordance with the fifth aspect of the present invention, since the vertical edge portion of the linking panel is formed integrally with the front face or the rear face of the vertical member, it becomes possible to reduce the number of components and the number of welding steps and reduce the weight.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Moreover, in accordance with the sixth aspect of the present invention, the front bulkhead supported between the front portions of the pair of left and right front side frames is formed into a rectangular shape while having the bulkhead upper extending in the vehicle width direction, the bulkhead lower extending in the vehicle width direction, and the pair of left and right vertical members extending in the vertical direction.
