The piston causes the most violent shuddering (i.e. the maximum intensity of the reciprocating inertial forces) when the direction of motion is reversed (i.e. when its acceleration/deceleration is maximum), but reciprocating inertial forces displaying variable intensity over time with a sinusoidal law are present in all instants of motion.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Reciprocating inertial forces generate vibrations which are detrimental for the engine (because they can<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> cause failure by fatigue over time) and are also annoying for vehicle occupants. In order to reduce such vibrations, the internal combustion engine must be balanced, i.e. by using balancing countershafts (also known as balancing shafts), which allow to reduce (compensate) the reciprocating inertial forces. However, the use of balancing countershafts gives rise to various drawbacks due to the weight and dimensions of the balancing countershafts, the weight and dimensions of the drive needed to turn the balancing countershafts and the greater weight of the engine crankcase which must also support the stress induced by the balancing countershafts (the balancing countershafts generate further reciprocating inertial forces which are transmitted to the engine crankcase and cancel out the reciprocating inertial forces of the pistons in the engine crankcase itself).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Patent <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4517933A1"><text>US4517933A1</text></patcit> describes an internal combustion engine with a "V" configuration of the cylinders, wherein the crankshaft is provided with balancing masses 31a, 31b and 31c to reduce the vibrations generated by the reciprocating motion of the pistons.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">It is the object of the present invention to provide an internal combustion engine with "V" configuration of the cylinders, which is easy and cost-effective to make and free from the aforesaid drawbacks.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to the present invention, an internal combustion engine with "V" configuration of the cylinders is provided as claimed in the accompanying claims.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, which show a non-limitative embodiment thereof, in which:

A piston 4 which runs along the axis of the cylinder 2 is mounted so as to slide inside cylinder 2, while a piston 5 which runs along the axis of the cylinder 3 is mounted so as to slide in cylinder 3. The internal combustion engine 1 comprises a crankshaft 6, which is mounted so as to rotate around a rotation axis 7 and is provided with a crank shape, so as to have a corresponding crank 8, 9 for each piston 4, 5. The piston 4 is mechanically connected to the crank 8 of the crankshaft 6 by means of a connecting rod 10 which has one end hinged to the piston 4 and an opposite end hinged to the crank 8; similarly, the piston 5 is mechanically connected to the crank 9 of the crankshaft 6 by means of a connecting rod 11 which has one end hinged to the piston 5 and an opposite end hinged to the crank 9.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A balancing body 12 (shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>) is fixed to the crankshaft 6 at the piston 4, and in particular at the crank 8 of the piston 4. The balancing body 12 (as explained in greater detail below) is such that the first order reciprocating inertial forces generated by the reciprocating motion of the piston 4 lie along a straight line L1 (shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>) which forms an inclination angle β1 which is not equal to zero with the cylinder 2 (i.e. with the axis of the cylinder 2 along<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> which the piston 4 moves with reciprocating motion). In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, the inclination angle β1 is equal to +26° (i.e. 26° clockwise).</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Similarly, a balancing body 13 (shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>) is fixed to the crankshaft 6 at the piston 5, and in particular at the crank 9 of the piston 5. The balancing body 13 (as explained in greater detail below) is such that the first order reciprocating inertial forces generated by the reciprocating motion of the piston 5 lie along a straight line L2 (shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>) which forms an inclination angle β2 which is not equal to zero with the cylinder 3 (i.e. with the axis of the cylinder 3 along which the piston 5 moves with reciprocating motion). In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, the inclination angle β2 is equal to -26° (i.e. 26° counterclockwise).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The combination of the angle α between the cylinders and the two inclination angles β1 and β2 is such that the first straight line L1, on which the first order reciprocating inertial forces generated by the reciprocating motion of the first piston 4 lie, is parallel to a second straight line L2, on which the first order reciprocating inertial forces generated by the reciprocating motion of a second piston 5 lie. Indeed, the two cylinders 2 and 3 are distanced 52° apart (i.e. the angle α between the cylinders is equal to 52°), the straight line L1 is shifted clockwise (i.e.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> towards the cylinder 3) by 26° (i.e. the inclination angle β1 is equal to +26°) and the straight line L1 is moved counterclockwise (i.e. towards the cylinder 2) by 26° (i.e. the inclination angle β2 is equal to -26°); consequently, the two straight lines L1 and L2 are parallel to each other.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The crank angles of the two cylinders 2 and 3 are such that the first order reciprocating inertial forces generated by the reciprocating motion of the piston 4 and the first order reciprocating inertial forces generated by the reciprocating motion of the piston 5 are in phase opposition; in this respect, it is worth noting that after having defined the angle α between the cylinders it is simple (i.e. by applying a simple geometric calculation) to establish the crank angles so that the first order reciprocating inertial forces generated by the reciprocating motion of the piston 4 and the first order reciprocating inertial forces generated by the reciprocating motion of the piston 5 are in phase opposition.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In this manner, the first order reciprocating inertial forces generated by the reciprocating motion of the two pistons 4 and 5 are parallel to each other (i.e. lie on two mutually parallel straight lines L1 and L2) and are also in phase opposition; consequently, the first order reciprocating inertial forces generating the reciprocating motion of the two pistons 4 and 5 always<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> cancel each other out.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In order to make that the first order reciprocating inertial forces generated by the reciprocating motion of a piston 4 or 5 lie on a straight line L1 or L2 forming an inclination angle β1 or β2 which is not zero with the cylinder 2 or 3, it is possible to shift the balancing body 12 or 13 out of phase with respect to the corresponding crank 8 or 9 (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 4</figref>), i.e. it is possible to arrange the balancing body 12 or 13 so that the radius R1 (shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 4</figref>) connecting the barycentre B of the balancing body 12 or 13 to the rotation axis 7 of the crankshaft 6 forms a phase angle γ1 or γ2 which is not zero with the prolongation of the radius R2 connecting the crank 8 or 9 of the piston 4 or 5 to the rotation axis 7. In other words, in a conventional internal combustion engine, the balancing body and the corresponding crank (i.e. the barycentre of the balancing body are in perfect phase opposition along the prolongation of the radius connecting the crank of the piston to the rotation axis of the crankshaft); instead, in the internal combustion engine 1 according to the present invention, the barycentre B of the balancing body 12 or 13 is not along the prolongation of the radius R2 connecting the crank 8 or 9 of the piston 4 or 5 to the rotation axis 7, but is "shifted out of phase" by a phase angle γ1 or γ2 which is not zero with respect to the prolongation of the radius R2 connecting<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the crank 8 or 9 of the piston 4 or 5 to the rotation axis 7.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is worth noting that, as clearly shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 4</figref>, the two radii R1 and R2 mutually form an angle α identical to the angle α between cylinders 2 and 3 (i.e. an angle α equal to 52° in the embodiment shown in the accompanying figures).</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Furthermore, in order to make the first order reciprocating inertial forces generated by the reciprocating motion of a piston 4 or 5 lie along a straight line L1 or L2 forming an inclination angle β1 or β2 which is not zero with the cylinder 2 or 3, it is necessary to combine the phase angle γ1 or γ2 which is not zero with a particular mass value of the balancing body 12 or 13.
