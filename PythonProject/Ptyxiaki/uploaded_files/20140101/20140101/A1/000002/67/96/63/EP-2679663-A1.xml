need to be cleaned periodically of accumulated dirt, oil, grease, and other contaminants. The appearance of such hard surfaces after cleaning is very important to consumers. More particularly, not only must hard surface cleaning formulations provide a clean surface, but the cleaned surface should also be visually appealing, which typically means having a glossy or shiny appearance. Most importantly, the shiny appearance must be free of streaking or surface anomalies that detract from the glossy appearance. Industry has worked to develop hard surface cleaning formulations which provide good shine performance with no streaking.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, it is known that the use of polymer surfactants which comprise ethylene oxide and propylene oxide in hard surface cleaning formulations provide good cleaning results. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004107586A"><text>Tokkai 2004-107586</text></patcit> (<patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2002275634A"><text>Tokugan 2002-275634</text></patcit>) describes floor polish formulations containing polymer surfactants which include units derived from ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) units and which were developed to replace tributoxy ethyl phosphate compounds as leveling agents for floor polish formulations.

More particularly, the formulation of the present invention comprises: one or more liquid solvents; one or more film-forming polymers; and one or more polymer surfactants each comprising polymerized units derived from ethylene oxide and butylene oxide.

The range and ratio limits, recited herein, are combinable.

Such methods include, without limitation, emulsion polymerization, bulk polymerization, solution polymerization, free radical polymerization, and catalyzed polymerization. The polymer surfactants useful in the present invention, sometimes generally referred to as alkoxylates, are preferably prepared in a sequential manner that involves butoxylation (adding BO or poly(oxybutylene) moieties of an alcohol mixture of alcohols to form a BO block, followed by ethoxylation (adding EO or poly(oxyethylene) moieties) to form an EO block, which is attached to the BO block, but spaced apart from R<sub>a</sub> which represents alkyl moieties from the alcohol or mixture of alcohols.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The inclusion of the surfactants which comprise polymerized units derived from both ethylene oxide and butylene oxide in the formulations of the present invention provide formulations which leave hard surfaces with a shiny, glossy, streak-free appearance after application and drying on the hard surfaces.
