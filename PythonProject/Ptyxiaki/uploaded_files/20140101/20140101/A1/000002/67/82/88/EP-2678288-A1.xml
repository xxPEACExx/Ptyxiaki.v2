load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="2"/>--><p id="p0001" num="0001"> Improved Binder Blends </p><p id="p0002" num="0002">The present invention relates to blends comprising an organic binder and crushed glass, both for use as homogenous surfaces and as bedding or jointing materials for modular paving. </p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Homogenous surfaces comprise blends of randomly shaped aggregate of various sizes which are randomly disposed throughout the construction layer of the pavement being referred to. This might be a base course or a surface course. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Modular paving comprises relatively larger paving elements which form a surface or wearing course, commonly referred to as slabs or setts. These are laid upon a bedding layer of unbound or bound aggregate and the joints between the paving elements filled with an unbound or bound aggregate. The plan area made up of joints in such a pavement typically comprises less than 15% of the overall surface area. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the modular paving industry, it is important to select the type of construction technique appropriate to the situation. Generally there are two categories of construction, bound or unbound. Bound construction means paving elements bedded and jointed using rigid mortar or plastic and/or ductile bound aggregates. The term "plastic" in this context refers to the mode of behaviour under stress. Unbound aggregate means paving elements bedded and jointed using only aggregate. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the modern era, with vehicles becoming ever more prevalent and larger, the use of bound bedding and jointing systems is becoming ever more necessary. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 In particular, the present invention relates to blends comprising a water absorbent organic binder in combination with an aggregate material. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Mortar and concrete based on cement and Pozzolanic binders, whether or not they contain polymeric admixtures, are flexible but rigid in nature. They can deform in response to applied forces but only within the constraints of an elastic limit. Deformation beyond the elastic limit results in permanent failure. Rigid mortar and concrete returns to its original form when an applied force is removed. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Concrete based upon a bituminous binder is not rigid but elastic and plastic and/or ductile in nature. This is commonly referred to as asphalt concrete. Deformation resulting from applied load is permanent. In an homogenous surface such as a conventional bitumen bound carriageway, the ongoing deformation in response to fatigue loading is considered acceptable until it reaches what is termed intervention level. Deformation within prescribed limits is not deemed to be failure. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Modular paving may be constructed using rigid but flexible mortars for both bedding and jointing. Just as with an homogenous rigid concrete pavement, failure occurs when the elastic limit is exceeded. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Modular paving may be constructed using unbound aggregates for both bedding and jointing. Within limits the unbound aggregate bedding and jointing media may deform in response to applied forces and subsequently reform in a slightly different position, from the action of gravity, vibration and water movement through the matrix of unbound aggregate particles. The inventors note that this traditional system of construction is highly desirable but has limits beyond which its use is practical in heavily trafficked and urban situations. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 Systems of binding the aggregate particles which comprise bedding and jointing for modular paving such that the bound medium is thus flexible and plastic and/or ductile have previously been developed by others. These products typically employ polymeric resins and similar man-made chemicals. The present inventors have identified that these materials deform relatively easily in compression, due to thermal stress or applied forces, but are unable to return to their original form after a period of fatigue loading. This process leads to failure relatively early in the service life of a pavement. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The growing use of polymeric resin binders in various bound aggregate blends is not ideal, since the manufacture of these polymers is often not without adverse environmental and cost implications. Thus, the present inventors advantageously use organic binders in the manufacture of the present inventive bound aggregate products. Moreover, the present inventors have noted that the commercial recycling of glass is an industry in its infancy, and whilst stockpiles are large, good uses to date are limited. The present inventors have surprisingly found that the inclusion of crushed glass into bound aggregate blends comprising an organic binder component results in a product that has advantageous properties over the current commonly used bound aggregate products, which employ only aggregates such as sand or grit. In particular, the present inventors have found that recycled glass performs particularly well under test conditions, when combined with a plant-based binder. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a binder blend comprising an organic binder component and a glass

 component. Preferably each of the binder component and glass </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">component is present as a particulate material, such as a powder. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Preferably, the organic binder component comprises a plant-based binder. The binder component is preferably 'activated' when it comes into contact with a liquid, and is preferably water-activated. By "water-activated" it is meant that the binder component changes properties when it comes into contact with water such that, in the present case, a glue-like substance is formed from the binder component as it interacts with water. Such a substance is sometimes referred to as mucilage. Such an adhesive property is advantageous as it aids in binding the glass component and optional other ingredients together. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Such an activation of the binder component is mediated at least in part by the amount the binder component swells on activation with water. The binder component preferably has a swell volume of at least about 10 ml/g, preferably at least about 20 ml/g. Preferably, the binder component has a swell volume of less than about 100 ml/g. More preferably, the binder component has a swell volume in the range of between about 15 ml/g and about 80 ml/g. Yet more preferably, the binder component has a swell volume in the range of between about 20 ml/g and about 70, 60 or 50 ml/g, preferably in the range of between about 30 ml/g to about 50 ml/g. Yet more preferably, the binder component has a swell volume in the range of about 20 ml/g to about 30 ml/g, preferably about 25 ml/g to about 45 ml/g, preferably between about 27 ml/g and 42 ml/g. In some </p><p id="p0016" num="0016">embodiments the swell volume is between about 30 ml/g and 40 ml/g. In some embodiments, the swell volume of the binder component is around 35 ml/g. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the binder component is derived from the plant genus Plantago. Preferably, the binder </p><p id="p0017" num="0017">component is derived from Plantago ovata, or psyllium, and preferably derived from its seeds or husk. More preferably, the plant binder is a psyllium-derived powder, such as psyllium husk powder or kha kha powder, which is a byproduct of psyllium husk production. Such psyllium powder is commercially available from a variety of suppliers (such as from JYOT OVERSEAS PVT LTD, Gujarat, India). Alternatively, or in addition, the binder component may be derived from other plant families, such as the cereals or pines, as long as the derived products are able to swell when in contact with water to produce an adhesive (e.g. mucilage). Such a plant product may be derived from e.g. oats, barley, rice, wheat, millet, maize, etc. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The binding property of psyllium and other similar organic binders is believed to be due to the content of special proteins and polysaccharides on the one hand and on the other hand an apparent high content of natural silicic acids. Proteins and polysaccharides are able to absorb water, subsequently to swell to a high degree and to form a kind of natural glue. Silicic acids can work as a chemical bridge (forming -O-Si-O - bonds) between the organic components of psyllium (proteins and polysaccharides) and the inorganic components of the aggregate (silica or quartz sand, crushed granite or similar stones), since the chemical structure of silicic acid is similar to that of the stone. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Psyllium is interesting for pavement jointing and pathway surfaces because it is reactivated whenever moisture is introduced, whereupon it can swell into adjacent spaces, close gaps and help to hold the matrix of aggregate particles in a cohesive mass using its adhesive qualities. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
 The organic binder component of the present invention may comprise impurities as well as the active ingredient of interest. Such impurities may comprise such things as light and/or heavy extraneous material (such as dust, agro farm fibres, wastes, mud, gravel and iron particles including organic fibres such as Psyllium Industrial Dust) ash, acid insoluble ash, etc. Generally these impurities will have come from the various processing steps used to create the final organic binder powder, or may be a result of the growing and harvesting conditions of the organic binder. Generally, the purity of the organic binder component will be greater than about 70 %, preferably greater than about 80 %, preferably greater than about 85 %, with the remaining % being made up of one or more impurities. In some embodiments, the purity of the organic binder component may be at least 90 %, 95 %, 96 %, 97 %, 98 %, 99 % or about 100 %. </p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A problem with previous applications has been combining the need to supply moisture to the mortar matrix with the need to create a more or less compact matrix. In previous applications this required a stone with a higher than usual proportion of very fine particles, the fine particles acting rather like a sponge to hold moisture. This runs counter to the fundamental requirements of unbound pavement jointing technology and such a material used for jointing would be easily displaced or squeezed out when paving elements move under traffic loads. The rock types which produce such a high proportion of fine particles are often referred to as "rotten rock" and not only produce a very high fines content when crushed but have a relatively high water absorption. </p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Thus, in the present invention, in combination with the organic binder component of the present inventive blend, there is also the presence of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
 crushed glass fornning a particulate component. In preferred embodiments, the glass is recycled glass. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In particular embodiments, the particles of recycled glass have been processed such that the majority of the particles exhibit substantially rounded edges. Such a shape is believed to be advantageous as it allows optimal voidage for water percolation when used in combination with other materials such as aggregate or sand and provides both optimum shape and surface texture for the organic binder to function effectively. </p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Thus, in further preferred embodiments, the crushed glass has been produced using a high velocity impact, preferably autogenous crushing process. An autogenous crushing process is one where the glass particles are used to crush themselves. Preferably such a process occurs during the use of a so-called "Vertical Shaft Impact" (VSI) crusher, such as employed in certain Barmac crushers. </p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Thus, the recycled glass used may be initially processed into a glass cullet by an impact crusher, such as a hammer mill. The type of crusher used at this stage is not important. Typically, the next stage in the process is that the glass cullet is washed and dried, in order to remove the majority or substantially all organic and inorganic contaminants, such as sugar, paper, metal and plastics. The washed and dried glass cullet is then further processed to produce particles in sizes varying from 2mm down to </p><p id="p0025" num="0025">1 micron depending on the requirements of the end user in a high speed attrition rotary crusher with the primary objective of 'rounding' the sharp edges of the each individual particle to produce recycled glass particles that are defined as sub-angular cuboid in shape. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
 In some embodiments of the present invention, the crushed glass is present in the basic binder blend with the majority of the particles being greater than about 50 μιτι in approximate diameter. In some embodiments, the majority of the glass particle size in the binder blend is preferably less than about 1 mm in approximate diameter. Preferably, the majority or substantially all of the particle size distribution is between about 50 μιτι to about 1000 μιτι. More preferably, the majority or substantially all of the particle size distribution is between about 50 μιτι to about 800 μιτι. More preferably, the majority or substantially all of the particle size distribution is between about 80 μιτι to about 600 μιτι. Yet more preferably, the majority or substantially all of the particle size distribution is between about 200 μιτι to about 800 μιτι, or about 200 μιτι to about 600 μιτι. </p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Such particle size distributions are achievable using standard techniques, for example by crushing and sieving through appropriately sized sieves or meshes. Crushed glass obtained from commercial suppliers (such as Green Future Recycling Ltd, Lancashire) can be reasonably accurately graded and purchased according to need.

In situations where a modular pavement having joints filled with this product might encounter very high volumes of surface water and/or high pressure water cleaning methods are employed, it can be advantageous to include "rubber crumb" granules, e.g. from recycled vehicle tyres, within the product recipe. By rubber crumb, it is to be understood that any rubber-like material may be suitable, such as synthetic rubber and synthetic rubber blends. The size of the rubber crumb used is typically 0 - 1 mm (e.g. 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, etc.) although in some situations larger sizes may be usefully employed (e.g. approx. 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5 mm). Rubber crumb typically may be added in proportions not more than about 10% by weight of the overall product dry mass by weight (i.e. binder blend + aggregates). More typically rubber

In some embodiments of the present invention, and as discussed above, there may be nominal amounts of impurities present in the binder blend. Such impurities might comprise, e.g. light and/or heavy extraneous matter (as discussed above), ash, acid insoluble ash, ultra-fine crushed glass particles etc. The total amount of impurities and/or other components in the blend may equate to approximately 0.1 % - 20 % of the weight of binder + glass components, optionally about 5 % to about 15 %, optionally about 1 % to about 10 %, optionally about 0.1 to about 1 %. </p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In some embodiments of the present invention, the blend does not include non-plant based binders, such as artificial polymers.

The same amount of polymer added without any organic binder (e.g. psyllium) produces a relatively weak and soft matrix using the same proportions of aggregate and glass or aggregate alone.

Typically, the water will activate the binder component on contact, with the binder component swelling as it absorbs the water. As the blend is mixed with the water, an aggregate paste is formed between the swollen binder particles and the glass particles, which, after drying, forms a resistant structure useful for a variety of construction needs.
