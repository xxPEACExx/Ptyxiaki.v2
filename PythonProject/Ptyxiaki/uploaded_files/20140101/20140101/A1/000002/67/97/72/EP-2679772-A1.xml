Each turbine generally includes alternating stages of circumferentially mounted stator vanes and rotating blades. Each stator vane and rotating blade may include high alloy steel and/or ceramic material shaped into an airfoil. A compressed working fluid, such as steam, combustion gases, or air, flows across the stator vanes and rotating blades along a gas path in the turbine. The stator vanes accelerate and direct the compressed working fluid onto the subsequent stage of rotating blades to impart motion to the rotating blades and perform work.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">High temperatures associated with the compressed working fluid may lead to increased wear and/or damage to the stator vanes and/or rotating blades. As a result, a cooling media may be supplied inside the airfoils and released through the airfoils to provide film cooling to the outside of the airfoils. Trenches in the airfoils evenly distribute the cooling media across the external surface of the airfoils. However, an improved airfoil that varies the distribution of the cooling media across the external surface of the airfoils would be useful.</p><heading id="h0003">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">Aspects and advantages of the invention are set forth below in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">One aspect of the present invention is an airfoil that includes an interior surface, an exterior surface opposed to the interior surface, a pressure side, a suction side opposed to the pressure side, a stagnation line between the pressure and suction sides, and a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> trailing edge between the pressure and suction sides and downstream from the stagnation line.

The detailed description uses numerical and letter designations to refer to features in the drawings. Like or similar designations in the drawings and description have been used to refer to like or similar parts of the invention. As used herein, the terms "first", "second", and "third" may be used interchangeably to distinguish one component from another and are not intended to signify location or importance of the individual components. In addition, the terms "upstream" and "downstream" refer to the relative location of components in a fluid pathway. For example, component A is upstream from component B if a fluid flows from component A to component B. Conversely, component B is downstream from component A if component B receives a fluid flow from component A.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit thereof. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment may be used on another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> provides a perspective view of an airfoil 10 according to one embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> provides a perspective view of the suction side of the airfoil shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. The airfoil 10 may be used, for example, as a rotating blade or stationary vane in a turbine to convert kinetic energy associated with a compressed working fluid into mechanical energy. The compressed working fluid may be steam, combustion gases, air, or any other fluid having kinetic energy. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, the airfoil 10 is generally connected to a platform or sidewall 12. The platform or sidewall 12 generally serves as the radial boundary for a gas path inside the turbine<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> and provides an attachment point for the airfoil 10. The airfoil 10 may include an interior surface 16 and an exterior surface 18 opposed to the interior surface 16 and connected to the platform 12. The exterior surface generally includes a pressure side 20 and a suction side 22 opposed to the pressure side 20. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, the pressure side 20 is generally concave, and the suction side 22 is generally convex to provide an aerodynamic surface over which the compressed working fluid flows. A stagnation line 24 at a leading edge of the airfoil 10 between the pressure and suction sides 20, 22 represents the dividing line between fluid flow across the pressure side 20 and fluid flow across the suction side 22 of the airfoil 10. The stagnation line 24 often has the highest temperature over the exterior surface 18 of the airfoil 10. A trailing edge 26 is between the pressure and suction sides 20, 22 and downstream from the stagnation line 24. In this manner, the exterior surface 18 creates an aerodynamic surface suitable for converting the kinetic energy associated with the compressed working fluid into mechanical energy.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The exterior surface 18 generally includes a radial length 30 that extends from the platform 12 radially outward and an axial length 32 that extends from the stagnation line 24 to the trailing edge 26. One or more columns of trench segments may extend radially and/or axially in the exterior surface 18, and each trench segment may include at least one cooling passage that provides fluid communication from the interior surface 16 to the exterior surface 18. In this manner, cooling media may be supplied inside the airfoil 10, and the cooling passages allow the cooling media to flow through the airfoil 10 to provide film cooling to the exterior surface 18. The trench segments may be located anywhere on the airfoil 10 and/or platform or sidewall 12, may be straight or arcuate, and may be aligned or staggered with respect to one another. In addition, the trench segments may have varying lengths, widths, and/or depths. The varying lengths, widths, and/or depths of the trench segments alter the distribution of the cooling media across the exterior surface 18. For example, widening the trench segments and making them shallower as they move away from the cooling passages may assist in diffusing the cooling media across the exterior surface 18.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the particular embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, for example, overlapping stagnation trench segments 40 may be arranged in a first column 42 on the exterior surface 18 so<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> that the stagnation line 24 passes through at least a portion of each of the stagnation trench segments 40. Each stagnation trench segment 40 may be substantially straight and canted at an angle with respect to the immediately adjacent stagnation trench segment 40 so that the stagnation trench segments 40 overlap one another radially along the exterior surface 18. As used herein, the term "overlap" means that moving radially outward from the platform 12, the end of one trench segment 40 is radially outward of the beginning of the next trench segment 40 in the same column. At least one cooling passage 44 in each stagnation trench segment 40 may provide fluid communication from the interior surface 16 to the exterior surface 18. In this manner, the cooling passages 44 may provide substantially continuous film cooling through the stagnation trench segments 40 along the stagnation line 24.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Additional overlapping trench segments may be arranged on the pressure and/or suction sides 20, 22 of the exterior surface 18. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, overlapping pressure side trench segments 46 may be arranged in a second column 48 on the pressure side 20 of the exterior surface 18. Alternately or in addition, overlapping suction side trench segments 50 may be arranged in a third column 52 on the suction side 22 of the exterior surface 18, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. Each pressure side trench segment 46 and each suction side trench segment 50 may be canted or angled in the opposite direction. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, each pressure side trench segment 46 and/or each suction side trench segment 50 may have a first end 54 and a second end 56 downstream and radially outward from the first end 54. In addition, each pressure side trench segment 46 and/or each suction side trench segment 50 may include one or more side cooling passages 58 that provide fluid communication from the interior surface 16 to the exterior surface 18 to provide film cooling over the pressure and suction sides 20, 22, respectively. In the particular embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the side cooling passages 58 in the pressure side trench segments 46 are radially offset from the cooling passages 44 in the stagnation trench segments 40 to further enhance radial distribution of the cooling media over the exterior surface 18.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> provides a perspective view of the airfoil 10 according to a second embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the airfoil 10 again includes the platform or<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> sidewall 12, interior surface 16, exterior surface 18, pressure side 20, suction side 22, overlapping pressure side trench segments 46, and side cooling passages 58 as previously described and illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. In this particular embodiment, the overlapping stagnation trench segments 40 lie along at least a portion of the stagnation line 24 and then curve in alternating directions toward the pressure and suctions sides 20, 22. Alternately or in addition, the stagnation trench segments 40 may include a branch at a discreet angle and then continue as a straight trench. The cooling passages 44 in each stagnation trench segment 40 again provide fluid communication from the interior surface 16 to the exterior surface 18 to enhance film cooling through the stagnation trench segments 40 along the stagnation line 24.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref> provide axial and radial cross-section views of the airfoil 10 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> taken along lines A-A and B-B, respectively. As shown most clearly in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>, each trench segment 40, 46, 50 generally includes opposing walls 62 that define a depression or groove in the exterior surface 18. The opposing walls 62 may be straight or curved and may define a constant or varying width for the trench segments 40, 46, 50. The cooling passages 44, 58 in adjacent trench segments 40, 46, 50 may be radially aligned with or offset from one another. Each cooling passage 44, 58 may include a first section 64 that terminates at the interior surface 16 and a second section 66 that terminates at the exterior surface 18. The first section 64 may have a cylindrical shape, and the second section 66 may have a conical or spherical shape. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, the first section 64 may be angled with respect to the second section 66 and/or the trench segment 40, 46, 50 to provide directional flow for the cooling media flowing through the cooling passage 44, 58 and into the trench segment 40, 46, 50.

In addition, the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> depth of the stagnation trench segments 40 may gradually decrease and/or the width may gradually increase as the stagnation trench segments 40 extend radially outward.

As shown, the gas turbine 80 may generally include a compressor section 82 at the front, a combustion section 84 radially disposed around the middle, and a turbine section 86 at the rear. The compressor section 82 and the turbine section 86 may share a common rotor 88 connected to a generator 90 to produce electricity.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The compressor section 82 may include an axial flow compressor in which a working fluid 92, such as ambient air, enters the compressor and passes through alternating stages of stationary vanes 94 and rotating blades 96. A compressor casing 98 may contain the working fluid 92 as the stationary vanes 94 and rotating blades 96 accelerate and redirect the working fluid 92 to produce a continuous flow of compressed working fluid 92. The majority of the compressed working fluid 92 flows through a compressor discharge plenum 100 to the combustion section 84.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The combustion section 84 may include any type of combustor known in the art. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10</figref>, a combustor casing 102 may circumferentially surround some or all of the combustion section 84 to contain the compressed working fluid 92 flowing from the compressor section 82. One or more fuel nozzles 104 may be radially arranged in an end cover 106 to supply fuel to a combustion chamber 108 downstream from the fuel nozzles 104. Possible fuels include, for example, one or more of blast furnace gas, coke oven gas, natural gas, vaporized liquefied natural gas (LNG), hydrogen, and propane. The compressed working fluid 92 may flow from the compressor discharge passage 100 along the outside of the combustion chamber 108 before reaching the end cover 106 and reversing direction to flow through the fuel nozzles 104 to mix with the fuel. The mixture of fuel and compressed working fluid<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> 92 flows into the combustion chamber 108 where it ignites to generate combustion gases having a high temperature and pressure. A transition duct 110 circumferentially surrounds at least a portion of the combustion chamber 108, and the combustion gases flow through the transition duct 110 to the turbine section 86.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The turbine section 86 may include alternating stages of rotating buckets 112 and stationary nozzles 114. As will be described in more detail, the transition duct 110 redirects and focuses the combustion gases onto the first stage of rotating buckets 112. As the combustion gases pass over the first stage of rotating buckets 112, the combustion gases expand, causing the rotating buckets 112 and rotor 88 to rotate. The combustion gases then flow to the next stage of stationary nozzles 114 which redirect the combustion gases to the next stage of rotating buckets 112, and the process repeats for the following stages.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">This written description uses examples to disclose the invention, including the best mode, and also to enable any person skilled in the art to practice the invention, including making and using any devices or systems and performing any incorporated methods.
