The load on the rotor may be controlled by pitching the blades, i.e. by rotating each blade around its longitudinal axis (from root to tip) and cause the wind to engage a larger or smaller surface of the blade.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For the purpose of pitching the blades, each blade is mounted on the hub by means of a pitch system, which in known turbines comprises a pitch bearing arranged between the hub and the blade, and a pitch drive which may include a motor, a drive pinion, and an annular gear meshing with the pinion and causing the blade to rotate and change its pitch angle, upon rotation of the drive pinion.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A known pitch bearing has one of the bearing races, e.g. the outer race, connected to the hub, and the other bearing race, e.g. the inner race, connected to a blade root portion (or sometimes to an extender); the annular gear of the pitch drive may then be fixed to the inner race of the pitch bearing, such that its rotation causes rotation of the inner race of the bearing and of the blade attached thereto.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For attachment of the pitch bearing to the blade root portion and to the hub, it is known to provide a plurality of studs, screws, or similar elements, each extending through a bore in one of the bearing races and screwed or fixed in any other way to the hub or to the blade root portion. It is known that such studs need to withstand fatigue loads and that long studs are better suited to withstand fatigue than short studs, and it is therefore desirable to provide a pitch bearing construction that allows a sufficient stud length.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">On the other hand, pitch bearings must stand several forces and moments, and in particular the bending moment caused by the force of the wind on the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> blades, that tends to strain especially the region of the bearing remote from the hub. One known construction employs a pitch bearing having two or three rows of rolling elements, usually balls, in order to transfer the torque from the blades to the hub and at the same time withstand bending loads.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, the axial length of such pitch bearings is relatively large, and at the same time they need to have a suitable stiffness to withstand the loads; their construction is therefore relatively complex, and their cost rather high.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It would be desirable to provide a pitch system for a wind turbine rotor that is cost effective and of relatively simple construction.</p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to an aspect, the present invention provides a pitch system for a wind turbine rotor as claimed in claim 1.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The two bearings and the intermediate body provide a pitch system that has a good stiffness and is simple and cost effective, since each bearing may be fairly simple and of relatively small axial length, and therefore a relatively standard part, while the intermediate body may be manufactured with materials and qualities that can be more economic and easier to manufacture than bearings, and especially than known large multi-row pitch bearings.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The intermediate body may provide two different effects. In the first place, it may reinforce and stiffen the second bearing, and particularly the inner race thereof, which is subject to a larger bending moment due to the wind loads than the first bearing, and therefore reduces the strain of said second bearing and the risk e.g. of contact ellipse truncation that may arise in bearings of large diameter such as pitch bearings, due to their relatively small stiffness.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the second place, the intermediate body can be made of a dimension that provides a suitable length for the studs that attach the pitch system to the blade and to the hub, and therefore makes it easier to employ studs with good fatigue behaviour.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The overall dimension of the pitch bearing, and the distance between the two bearings, can be adjusted and adapted to each particular case by simply changing the length and particular features of the intermediate body, which is much more cost effective than manufacturing in each case a large, multi-row pitch bearing.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The intermediate body may also be employed for the pitch drive, since it is simpler and cheaper to provide a toothing for the drive on the intermediate body than on a bearing race.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The presence of two separate bearings also makes it easier to provide each of them with features best suited to its position in the assembly; for example, in embodiments of the invention the first bearing may be of greater stiffness than the second bearing, for example it may have a larger axial length.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In embodiments of the invention the intermediate body further comprises an hub-side part arranged coaxially to the blade-side part and extending between the race of the first bearing that is associated with the hub and the race of the second bearing that is associated with the hub.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to a further aspect, the invention provides a wind turbine as claimed in claim 16.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the present application reference is made generally to connections to a blade root portion and to a hub in the wind turbine rotor. Both expressions should be interpreted broadly: for example, within the meaning of the present invention, blade root portion may be any portion of the blade playing a role in the attachment of the blade to the rest of the rotor, such as a flange, or elements associated with the blade, such as a blade extender. The same is valid for the hub.</p><heading id="h0003">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">Particular embodiments of the present invention will be described in the following by way of non-limiting examples, with reference to the appended drawings, in which:<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> -->

The pitch system comprises a first bearing 10 and a second bearing 20, the first bearing being arranged nearer to the hub 2. In this example, the inner race 11 and 21 of each bearing 10 and 20 is associated with the blade root portion 3, while the outer race 12 and 22 of each bearing 10 and 20 is associated with the hub 2, although in other embodiments the hub may be attached to the inner races and the blade may be attached to the outer races.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The pitch system 4 further comprises an intermediate body 30, which is arranged between the first bearing 10 and the second bearing 20 in the axial direction.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>, the intermediate body 30 may comprise a blade-side part 31, (in this example an inner part) and a hub-side part 32 (in this example an outer part); the blade-side part 31 and the hub-side part 32 may be arranged coaxial to each other and to the bearings 10 and 20.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Both the blade-side part 31 and the hub-side part 32 may be substantially cylindrical, i.e. they may have a tubular or ring shape.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Each of the blade-side part 31 and the hub-side part 32 of the intermediate body 30, as well as the races 11, 12, 21 and 22 of the bearings 10 and 20, may be provided with a plurality of bores in the axial direction; suitable studs 40 and 50 may extend through the bores for attaching the bearing races 11, 12, 21, 22 and the intermediate body parts 31 and 32 to the blade root portion 3 and to the hub 2, respectively.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The intermediate body 30 may act as a stiffener or reinforcing element for the bearings; it may also be dimensioned to give a desired length to the pitch system assembly, to increase the distance between hub and blade, such that the studs 40 and 50 can have a sufficient length to guarantee a good fatigue behaviour.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The intermediate body 30 can be designed and built to perform one or both of these two functions in a very cost-effective way, since it doesn't need to be made of the same material of the bearing races, or with the same radial dimensions, shapes, tolerances, etc. Consequently, it may be provided at a relatively low cost and by a large variety of manufacturers.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Suitable materials for both the blade-side part 31 and the hub-side part 32 of the body 30 may be for example cast iron or any structural steel such as S355.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In a pitch system 4 according to embodiments of the invention, any of the bearing races 11, 12, 21, 22, or any of the parts 31, 32 of the intermediate body 30, may be employed for forming an annular gear, or at least a portion of an annular gear, of a pitch drive. The pitch drive is arranged to rotate the blade with respect to the hub, and thus change the pitch angle of the blade.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Details of three exemplary embodiments of a pitch system with such an annular gear are shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">figures 3, 4 and 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>, the inner race 11 of the first bearing 10 forms at least a portion of an annular gear 60, suitable to mesh with a driving pinion 70 of the pitch drive<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> (not further shown). Similarly, in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 5</figref> such an annular gear 60 is formed on the inner race 21 of the second bearing 20.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In an alternative embodiment, shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>, the annular gear 60, or a portion thereof, is formed on the blade-side part 31 (here the inner part) of the intermediate body 30. In this embodiment the provision of the annular gear 60 is quite straightforward, because the materials and manufacturing process of the intermediate body make it relatively simple and cost effective to form such a gear together with the body parts 31 or 32.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Although <figref idrefs="f0003">figures 3, 4 and 5</figref> show the annular gear associated with the inner side of the pitch system, it is understood that it could be also associated with the outer race 12 or 22 of one of the bearings 10, 20, or to the outer part (in this case hub-side part 32) of the intermediate body.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The length of the intermediate body 30 in the axial direction (L<sub>3</sub> in <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 6</figref>) will depend on the particular requirements of each case; in some embodiments it may be at least equal to the total axial length (L<sub>1</sub> + L<sub>2</sub> in <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 6</figref>) of the first and second bearings, and in some cases it may be preferable that it is about twice said total length (L<sub>1</sub> + L<sub>2</sub>) of the first and second bearings.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref> shows an embodiment in which the blade-side part 31 and the hub-side part 32 of the intermediate body 30 are larger in the radial direction than their associated bearing races, and thus extend beyond the races, inwardly and outwardly, respectively. Providing such an enlarged blade-side part 31 and/or hub-side part 32 may be helpful for example to provide more stiffness in some regions, if needed.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref> shows a further embodiment of a pitch system, wherein the intermediate body 30 has a blade-side part 31 (in this example an inner part) but no hub-side part (outer part:): in this case, the outer race 22' of the second bearing 20 is longer in axial direction and acts as a spacer on the outer side of the pitch system.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Although the intermediate body has been described as having two substantially cylindrical blade-side and hub-side parts, in other embodiments<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> each of these parts may have different configurations: for example, instead of comprising a continuous cylinder at least one of them may alternatively comprise several independent cylindrical portions, that may be spaced apart from each other, and attached to the races of the bearings.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The parts 31 and 32 of the intermediate body may 30 also present further features, such as reinforcements, openings for inspecting the bearings, for example for controlling grease leaks from the bearings or for other operations related to lubrication; they may also be provided with elements, such as flanges, that in other turbines are associated with the blade or to the hub.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In the embodiments shown in the figures the bearings 10 and 20 are single-row ball bearings; however, it will be understood that many alternatives are possible, such as multiple-row bearings, bearings with rolling elements different from balls, tapered bearings, etc. Furthermore, the first and second bearings 10 and 20 may each have different features, so as to adapt to the different stresses each of them has to withstand.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">For example, at least one of the bearings may be a preloaded slewing bearing, which are suitable to accommodate axial, radial and moment loads acting either singly or in combination and in any direction, and which may reduce the risk of false brinelling failure.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The first bearing may be stiffer than the second bearing, to provide enhanced stability also to the rest of the elements mounted over it (intermediate body, second bearing,..).</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In some embodiments, for example as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 8</figref>, the axial length (L<sub>1</sub>) of the first bearing 10 may be larger than the axial length (L<sub>2</sub>) of the second bearing (20).</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The bearings 10 and 20 may be four-pint contact ball bearings. In some embodiments, the first bearing 10 may have a nominal contact angle smaller than 45°, while the second bearing 20 may have a nominal contact angle slightly above 45°.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Other potential embodiments of the bearings 10, 20 may involve using a larger amount of smaller rolling elements, such as balls, in the first bearing 10, and a smaller amount of larger rolling elements in the second bearing 20, to counteract the load increase.<br/>
