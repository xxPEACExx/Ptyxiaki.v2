The case 10 has a space and a cam 20 is engaged with the space. Two cores 30 are connected to two ends of the cam 20 respectively and located in the case 10. A gap 102 is defined between the case 10 and the cam 20 and a positioning plate 103 is located in the gap 102 so as to position the cam 20 and the cores 30. The lock is connected to an object via the hole 101.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, the unauthorized persons usually pick the top beads and the bottom beads in the cores 30 and to rotate the cam 20 to unlock the lock. If the arrangement of the top beads and the bottom beads is too complicated, the unauthorized persons break the case 10 at the position where the hole 101 is located as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> and the cores 30 are taken out or exposed, the cam 20 is then rotated to unlock the lock. This is to say, the lock can be unlocked if the case 10 is broken and the cores 30 are taken out. Furthermore, because each lock has a specific key which is shaped to match with the movement of the top and bottom beads, so that when the cores 30 are to be replaced, the whole case 10 has to be replaced too. This makes the maintenance cost high and the manufacturers have to prepare sufficient parts for maintenance.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The regulations for locks require the locks to have certain unlock times, levels of durability, fire-proof, the number of parts, material and specification. However, for combination locks, the small sized locks are difficult to obtain the required sets of combination numbers which need at least five sets of top and bottom beads. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, when assembling the cores 30 and the cam 20 to the case 10, the positioning plate 103 is used in the gap 102 to position the cam 20 and the cores 30. The gap 102 restricts the length of the lock so that only four sets of top and bottom beads can be installed. The less number of the top and bottom beads cannot meet the requirements and the locks are easily unlocked.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention intends to provide an anti-break lock which prevents the core from being unlocked even if the core is taken out.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention relates to an anti-break lock and comprises a case having a body and a fixing hole defined through the body. Two rods respectively extend from two ends of the body and two rings extend radially from the body. The axis of the rings and the axis of the rods are parallel to each other. A space is defined between the two rings.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Preferably, the body has at least one passage which communicates with one of the rings. The ring is engaged with an engaging block. The engaging block has a recess which is located corresponding to the at least one passage and smaller than the at least one passage. A pad is engaged with the recess. The at least one passage is located at one end of the body and a resilient member and a stop pin are received in the at least one<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> passage. The resilient member biases the stop pin which has a first shoulder defined in the first end thereof and facing the resilient member. A second shoulder is defined in the second end of the stop pin and located corresponding to the at least one passage and the recess. A contact portion extends from the second shoulder and is located corresponding to the recess. The body has a room which communicates with the at least one passage. A resilient piece and an engaging member are received in the room. The engaging member is located corresponding to the first shoulder and biased by the resilient piece to contact the stop pin. The contact portion contacts the pad which is removed from the recess. The stop pin is then pushed by the resilient member to insert the contact portion into the recess. The stop pin is then removed from the room. The engaging member is biased by the resilient piece and passes through the conjunction portion between the at least one passage and the room. The first shoulder of the stop pin is stopped by the engaging member and cannot move to its initial position.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Preferably, a cam is located in the space and connected to the engaging block. The engaging block has a core installed thereto which is located corresponding to the cam. The pad is pushed by the contact portion and in contact with the core. The engaging block has a stepped surface in axial direction and a slot. A driving member is located in the engaging block and has a protrusion located corresponding to the slot. The cam has an engaging portion located corresponding to the stepped surface. The engaging block and the cam are connected to each other.

The rings are respectively mounted to the cores. The sleeve has at least one slit and the core has a groove which is located corresponding to the at least one slit. The groove has a positioning plate extending therefrom and the positioning plate reaches the sleeve. The positioning plate has two notches. The groove has two locking pieces on two ends thereof and the locking pieces are fixed to the notches.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Alternatively, the present invention provides an anti-break lock and comprises a case having a body and two rings extend radially from the body. A space is defined between the two rings. The body has at least one passage which communicates with one of the rings. The ring is engaged with an engaging block. The engaging block has a recess which is located corresponding to the at least one passage and smaller than the at least one passage. A pad is engaged with the recess. The at least one passage is located at one end of the body and a resilient member and a stop pin are received in the at least one passage. The resilient member biases the stop pin which has a first shoulder defined in the first end thereof which faces the resilient member, and a second shoulder is defined in the second end of the stop pin and located corresponding to the at least one passage and the recess. A contact portion extends from the second shoulder and is located corresponding to the recess. The body has a room which communicates with the at least one passage. A resilient piece and an engaging member are received in the room. The engaging member is located corresponding to the first shoulder and biased by the resilient piece to contact the stop pin. The contact portion contacts the pad which is removed from the recess. The stop pin is then pushed by the resilient member to insert the contact portion into the recess. The stop pin is then removed from the room. The engaging member is biased by the resilient piece and passes through the conjunction portion between the at least one passage and the room. The first shoulder of the stop pin is stopped by the engaging member and cannot move to its initial position.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Preferably, a cam is located in the space and connected to the engaging block. The engaging block has a core installed thereto which is located corresponding to the cam. The pad is pushed by the contact portion and in contact with the core. The engaging block has a stepped surface in axial direction and a slot. A driving member is located in the engaging block and has a protrusion located corresponding to the slot. The cam has an engaging portion located corresponding to the stepped surface. The engaging block and the cam are connected to each other. The cam has an insertion path defined in the inner periphery thereof and the insertion path is located corresponding to the protrusion. The core has a slide slot which is located at an end of the core that is connected to the engaging block.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Preferably, the body has two passages which are located symmetrically to each other and the engaging blocks are engaged with the rings. The engaging blocks are located symmetrically to each other. Each of the cores has a push member which contacts the driving member and the two driving members are located symmetrically to each other. Each of the driving members has a central hole and a link extends through the central holes so as to move the driving members. When one of the push members is pushed, the driving member pushes the protrusion of the other driving member to be removed from the insertion path.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Preferably, a sleeve is connected to the case and has a core received therein. The rings are mounted to the core. The sleeve has at least one slit and the core has a groove which is located corresponding to the at least one slit.

Therefore, even if the core is taken out from the lock, the cam is not rotatable so that the lock is not unlocked. Furthermore, when the stop pin is removed from the room, the engaging member is biased by the resilient piece and passes through the conjunction portion between the passage and the room. The first shoulder of the stop pin is stopped by the engaging member and cannot move to its initial position. Accordingly, the unauthorized persons cannot move the stop pin by using a tool. The lock cannot be unlocked from the damaged side, while the owner can unlock the lock from the other side.
