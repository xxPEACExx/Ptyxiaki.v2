Conventionally, these operations have been performed with a highly invasive approach such as an exploratory laparotomy or an exploratory thoracotomy. However, with the recent widened use of endoscopic surgery, these operations are performed using a laparoscope or a thoracoscope with which the size of incisional wounds is smaller than that in conventional cases.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, Patent Documents 1 and 2 disclose trocar systems that, after being inserted from an opening having a small diameter through the skin into a body cavity, can easily expand the through cavity, thereby providing a passage for passing a surgical instrument having a larger diameter. According to these systems, the size of the external wound of a patient is smaller and the time necessary for recovery becomes extremely shorter than those in conventional examples in which a large incision corresponding to the diameter of a surgical instrument is made.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Meanwhile, in order to minimize the size of the external wound of a patient, a new minimally-invasive technique has been developed. This technique is known as Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES: endoscopic surgery with no incision on the body surface), and is a completely new technique that inserts an endoscope from a natural orifice (mouth, anus, vagina, etc.) of a hollow organ into the lumen, makes an incision through the wall of the hollow organ to access a body cavity,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> and makes a diagnosis or performs procedures or treatment. In theory, this technique needs no incisional wound on the body surface (incisionless), and, thus, this technique is expected to be less invasive than endoscopic surgery. Successful clinical cases of laparoscope-assisted transvaginal or transgastric "hybrid NOTES" are reported in foreign countries, and have been attracting great attention. In near future, "pure NOTES" only with an endoscope, not requiring laparoscope-assist, is expected to be introduced into clinical practice.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Unlike conventional laparotomy surgery in which organs obstructing the surgery can be pushed aside by hand, the above-described endoscopic surgery is problematic in that pushing aside of organs is not easy, and, thus, securing the view optimal for the surgery is difficult. This problem is one factor that makes endoscopic surgery difficult. In order to secure the view and the manipulation space, there is a method that injects gas into a body cavity. However, this method requires general anesthesia, and cannot be said to be minimally-invasive.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to alleviate problems regarding the view and the like and to make endoscopic therapy easy, an instrument called retractor has been developed that excludes or draws organs or the like obstructing an organ that is to be treated or the view during treatment. A retractor is required to have a basic function in which, at the time of insertion into the body, an instrument can be inserted through a small opening passage such as a trocar (outer sheath) forming an insertion passage or a small incisional wound. Accordingly, at least at the time of insertion, it is necessary that a retractor has a small diameter (e.g., desirably 10 mm or less in the case of a trocar, and 20 mm or less in the case of a small incisional wound), and is in a rod-like shape. Meanwhile, after insertion into a body cavity, it is required that the shape of the retractor can be changed to have an excluding portion with a certain degree of area size in order to exclude a target safely over a wide area.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In view of these mutually conflicting demands, retractors variously devised have been proposed or been commercially available. For example, there is a retractor in which an excluding portion can spread out like a fan (Patent Document 3, for example). This retractor is such that the fan-like excluding portion is folded and accommodated inside a rod-like tube at the time of insertion of the trocar into the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> peritoneal cavity, and spreads out like a fan when being pushed out from the rod-like tube in the body cavity. The fan-like excluding portion may spread out to any size with manual operation, or the angle between the excluding portion and the base portion may be changed. These retractors are preferable to exclude the liver and the intestines due to advantages of being capable of excluding an organ over a relatively wide area. Note that the shape is not limited to a fan-like shape, and a large number of various shapes such as a lozenge shape have been proposed.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">As a different type, there are snake-like retractors in which a rod-like member of an excluding portion can be bent in a body cavity (Patent Documents 4 and 5, for example). These retractors may be such that the bendable excluding portion is accommodated in a straight shape inside a rod-like tube at the time of insertion of a trocar, and returns to a bent shape when being pushed out from the rod-like tube in the body cavity, or such that the excluding portion in the shape of a rod at the time of insertion can be bended into various shapes in a body cavity and can be kept at the bended shape. These are particularly effective in drawing a target to hold the target in the bent portion, and are widely used in laparoscopic surgery.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Alternatively, there is a retractor having a loop-shaped front end portion (Patent Document 6, for example). This is a type of retractor in which a loop having a small diameter is projected from the front end of the tube, and is used to catch, grasp and draw tissue. This retractor can be inserted through a trocar having a small diameter, and is extremely low invasive, but it cannot be used for exclusion. Meanwhile, as a retractor that excludes and draws an organ or the like inside the body, there is an instrument, including an excluding portion configured by a flat sheet that is made of elastic rubber thin film and a frame that is fixed to the peripheral edge of the flat sheet and substantially surrounds the flat sheet, and a grip portion extending from the excluding portion, wherein the frame is made of superelastic alloy or shape memory alloy, and, thus, the excluding portion can be shaped in a smaller diameter so that this portion can be inserted through a trocar or a small incisional wound at the time of insertion into a body cavity, and can return to an original shape having a large exclusing area in the body cavity (Patent Documents 7 and 8).</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Furthermore, as a tool arm that is inserted through the lumen included in a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> tube for endoscope insertion, a snake-like retractor that is flexible and capable of handling organs and tissue structures is disclosed (Patent Document 9).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">All of the above-described retractors have an excluding portion that to develop in a one-dimensional shape (line) or a two-dimensional shape (plane).</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Meanwhile, a vital manipulating instrument is disclosed, including a shaft member, a hollow tube rotatably fitted around the shaft member, and elastic filamentary members each having one end fixed to the shaft member and another end fixed to the hollow tube, wherein, when the shaft member and the hollow tube are rotated relative to each other, the elastic filamentary members form an excluding portion (Patent Document 10). This is a three-dimensional retractor that forms a pod-like (cocoon-like) three-dimensional excluding portion, wherein the shape of the excluding portion is controlled by the rotation of the shaft member. Accordingly, the shaft member is required to have a certain degree of diameter size, and, furthermore, since there is a limitation in the force that can be applied to rotate the shaft member, this retractor is not suitable to exclude a large organ such as the liver.</p><heading id="h0003">[Citation List]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Patent Literature]</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5320611A"><text>US Patent No. 5,320,611</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: Japanese National Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP8507238A"><text>8-507238</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 3: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP6154152A"><text>6-154152</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 4: Japanese National Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP7502914A"><text>7-502914</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 5: <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US2002011536A"><text>US Patent Application Publication No. 2002/011536</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 6: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP2000023989A"><text>2000-23989</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 7: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="JP2003164459A"><text>2003-164459</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 8: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="JP2005237398A"><text>2005-237398</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 9: Japanese National Publication No <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="JP2007511247A"><text>2007-511247</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 10: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="JP8336538A"><text>8-336538</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">[Summary of Invention]</heading><heading id="h0006">[Technical Problem]</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">It is an object of the present invention to provide a three-dimensional retractor to be expected in minimally-invasive treatment such as NOTES, that is, a three-dimensional retractor that can freely exclude an organ, and can be inserted into a treatment instrument channel of an endoscope.

Note that the operations of excluding, pushing aside, drawing, and lifting may be collectively referred to as "retraction" or "retract". The term "exclude" may refer not only to the operation of excluding but also to the operations of pushing aside, drawing, and lifting (that is, it may refer to retraction). It is required that a retractor has an excluding portion which can be changed to have a certain degree of size after being inserted into the body.

At that time, a pulling force toward the excluding portion is generated in the movable wire 3 because of the fixed wires 4 being curved. Accordingly, when the force that pulls the proximal end of the movable wire 3 toward the handle portion is relaxed, the development of the cocoon shape can be canceled. In this case, the fixed wires 4 in a number of preferably 4 to 8 form the peripheral arcs of the cocoon shape.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In the case where the movable wire 3 forms one of the peripheral arcs of the cocoon shape (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3(b)</figref>), for example, the movable wire 3 may be a "micro snake retractor" in which the movable wire 3 is made of ultra-thin high-strength twisted filamentary member having an outer diameter of 0.8 mm or less, and, in the excluding portion 11, is accommodated in a metal sheath connecting the joint portion at the distal end and the distal end of the introduction portion, having an outer diameter of 1.5 mm and being provided with a slit. For example, when the proximal end of the movable wire 3 is pulled toward the handle portion, the micro snake retractor forms a circular arc shape, and subsequently the fixed wires 4 form similar circular arc shapes centered at the joint portion at the distal end, and, thus, can develops a cocoon shape as a whole. In order to cancel the development of the cocoon shape, the excluding portion 11 is accommodated in the treatment instrument channel 22. In this case, there is no wire that forms the central axis of the cocoon shape, and the fixed wires 4 in a number of preferably 3 to 7 also form the peripheral arcs of the cocoon shape.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0044" num="0044">There is no particular limitation on the material for forming the movable wire 3, as long as it is rigid and straight enough to allow the entire movable wire 3 to move following the movement of the end portion, but the material is preferably metal.
