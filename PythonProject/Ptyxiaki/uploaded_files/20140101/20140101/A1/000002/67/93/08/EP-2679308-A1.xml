Asphalt is basically a mixture of aggregate and a binder, and is used as a surface course, binder course and/or base course on for example roads, airports, parking sites, etc. Generally, when preparing an asphalt mixture a predetermined amount of aggregate is heated in a drier, such that the aggregate is dried. The heat is generated by a heat source in the drier. The heat source in the drier oftentimes is a burner, which usually is run on heavy oil, diesel, coal or propane gas. When using coal as fuel it is advantageous if the coal has been pulverized to a specific fraction before it is provided to the heat source. Pulverizing the coal, such that a sufficiently small fraction is obtained, is difficult, and may be time and energy consuming.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="FR2358966A"><text>FR 2358966 A</text></patcit> an example of a method for producing asphalt is disclosed.
