 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </p><p id="p0039" num="0039"> [0032] While the concepts of the present disclosure are susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific exemplary embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intent to limit the concepts of the present disclosure to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </p><p id="p0040" num="0040"> [0033] Referring to FIG. 1, a food processing device or food chopper 10 is shown. The food chopper 10 has a base 12 that houses a motor 14. As described in greater detail below, the motor 14 drives a cutting assembly 16 to cut food items such as cheeses, meats, fruits, and vegetables when the motor 14 is energized. The cutting assembly 16 is illustratively embodied as a multipurpose blade assembly including a pair of cutting blades. It will be appreciated that in other embodiments the cutting assembly 16 may be a shedding disk, adjustable slicing disk, or other cutting attachment configured to cut food items. </p><p id="p0041" num="0041"> [0034] The food chopper 10 also includes a removable receptacle or bowl 18 secured to the base 12, and a removable lid 20 secured to the bowl 18. It should be appreciated that one or more locking mechanisms may be used to lock the bowl 18 to the base 12 and the lid 20 to the bowl 18. The lid 20 has a feed tube 22 formed thereon through which food items such as fruits and vegetables are inserted into the bowl 18 to be processed by the food chopper 10. Collectively, the lid 20 and the bowl 18 define a processing chamber 24 where food items are processed by the cutting assembly 16. </p><p id="p0042" num="0042"> [0035] The lid 20 includes a pair of control buttons 26, 28 that are operable to control the operation of the motor 14. As will be described in greater detail below, the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
 user alternately operates the control buttons 26, 28 to energize the motor 14 at two different cutting speeds. It will be appreciated that in other embodiments the lid 20 may include only a single control button operable to energize the motor 14 at a single cutting speed or additional control buttons operable to energize the motor 14 at other cutting speeds. </p><p id="p0043" num="0043"> [0036] Referring now to FIG. 2, the base 12 of the food chopper 10 includes a housing 30 having a mounting surface 32 configured to support the bowl 18. The motor 14 has an output shaft 34 that extends upwardly through the mounting surface 32, and the output shaft 34 is coupled to the cutting assembly 16 when the food chopper 10 is assembled. The motor 14 and a pair of mechanically-operated relays or relay switches 36, 38 are positioned within the housing 30. The switches 36, 38 are electrically coupled to the motor 14 and are positioned between the motor 14 and an electrical power supply (not shown). The switches 36, 38 may be selectively opened and closed to regulate the electrical power supplied to the motor 14. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044">[0037] For example, when the switch 36 is closed, the motor 14 is energized with a first quantity of electrical power supplied from the electrical power supply. When energized with the first quantity of power, the motor 14 rotates the cutting assembly 16 via the output shaft 34 at a first cutting speed. Alternately, when the switch 38 is closed, the motor 14 is energized with a second quantity of electrical power supplied from the electrical power supply. When energized with the second quantity of power, the motor 14 rotates the cutting assembly 16 via the output shaft 34 at a second cutting speed. When the switches 36, 38 are both open, the motor 14 is disconnected from the electrical power supply. </p><p id="p0045" num="0045"> [0038] The housing 30 also includes an interface surface 40 extending outwardly from the mounting surface 32 on the back side of the base 12. The interface surface 40 has a pair of openings 42, 44 defined therein. The switch 36 has a lever 46
