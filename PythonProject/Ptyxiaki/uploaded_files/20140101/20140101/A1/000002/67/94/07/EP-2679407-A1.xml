pneumatic radial tire suitable for a passenger car. The present invention especially proposes a technique for effectively reducing rolling resistance of a pneumatic radial tire, while ensuring good stability and controllability thereof.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventional techniques for reducing rolling resistance of a tire include those disclosed in Patent Literature 1, Patent Literature 2 and the like.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The invention disclosed in Patent Literature 1, which aims at providing a pneumatic tire capable of reducing rolling resistance without sacrificing stability, controllability and riding comfort, is characterized in that: a fold-back end of a carcass is positioned at the height of ≤ 0.15 time the height of the tire section; and a short fiber reinforced layer of ≥ 0.3mm and ≤ 1.0mm in thickness is arranged on the outer surface of the carcass in a sidewall area between a belt end and the fold-back end of the carcass. The short fiber reinforced layer is constituted of: a rubber component obtained by blending 30-60 parts by weight of natural rubber and/or isoprene rubber with 40-70 parts by weight of butadiene rubber; short fiber; and carbon black. At least 90% of the short fiber is oriented at an angle in the range of ±20° relative to the circumferential direction of the tire and the ratio of the complex elasticity E*a in the direction of orientation of the short fiber, with respect to the complex elasticity E*b in the direction orthogonal to the direction of orientation, is ≥ 5.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Further, the invention disclosed in Patent Literature 2, which aims at providing a pneumatic tire capable of making weight reduction and good stability and controllability thereof compatible without reducing riding comfort, characterized in that: a carcass layer is made to be a single layer structure; ends of the carcass layer are each folded around a bead core from the inside toward the outside of the tire to interpose a bead filler therein, to a position which exceeds a tire maximum width and does not reach a belt layer; and the height of the bead filler measured from a bead heel is 15-30% of a tire cross section height, the rubber thickness of a sidewall portion is 3.5-5.0 mm, an<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> inner liner is formed of a thermoplastic elastomer composition having Young's modulus of 5-50 MPa and thickness of 0.05-0.25 mm, and the sidewall portion is made of a rubber composition containing at least 70 wt. % of natural rubber.</p><heading id="h0003">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005"><ul><li>PTL 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP8175119A"><text>JP-A 08-175119</text></patcit></li><li>PTL 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2009001228A"><text>JP-A 2009-001228</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problems</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, the invention disclosed in Patent Literature 1, which decreases rolling resistance of a tire by reducing tire weight by reducing a dimension in the tire radial direction of a bead filler to suppress eccentricity of the tire, tends to experience deterioration of stability and controllability due to decrease in rigidity of sidewall portions of the tire and there arises a problem that this deterioration of stability and controllability cannot be addressed even by providing an additional reinforcing layers at the sidewall portions.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Similarly, the invention disclosed in Patent Literature 2, although it can realize reduction of tire weight by reducing size of a bead filler, i.e. a shorter bead filler, experiences decrease in rigidity of side portions of the tire and therefore there arises a problem that stability and controllability inevitably deteriorate in spite of efforts of enhancing rigidity of the side portions by increasing rubber thickness of the sidewall portions and forming an inner liner by a thermoplastic resin or a thermoplastic elastomer composition having higher Young's modulus and lower specific gravity than rubber.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">More specifically, rolling resistance of a standard pneumatic radial tire for a passenger car, where height in the tire radial direction of a bead filler is at least 25 mm and thickness of sidewall rubber is at least 2.5 mm, can be effectively reduced by decreasing the height in the tire radial direction of the bead filer to 10 mm to 20 mm and the thickness of the sidewall rubber to 1 mm to &lt; 2.5 mm (such size reduction, in combination with resulting decrease in eccentricity of the tire, effectively reduces rolling resistance). However, rigidity of side portions of the tire inevitably deteriorates by this modification and it is very difficult to reliably obtain required stability and controllability<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> in such a case even by increasing thickness of sidewall rubber and the like.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention aims at solving such problems as described above of the prior art and an object thereof is to effectively reduce rolling resistance, while ensuring good stability and controllability of a pneumatic radial tire.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to the Problems</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">When a tire assembled with an application rim, inflated at a predetermined air pressure and mounted on a vehicle in a negative camber state is run straight under a predetermined load exerted thereon, a ground-contact length in the tire circumferential direction of a ground-contact surface portion situated on the vehicle inner side when the tire is mounted on the vehicle, of a tread of the tire, is relatively long, while a ground-contact length in the tire circumferential direction of a ground-contact surface portion situated on the vehicle outer side when the tire is mounted on the vehicle, of the tread, tends to be extremely short, such that an outline of a foot print takes on a substantially blunt triangle-like shape as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3A</figref>. The present invention, being aware of this phenomenon, attempts to increase a ground-contact length in the tire circumferential direction of a ground-contact surface portion situated on the vehicle outer side when the tire is mounted on the vehicle, of the tread of the tire, to be equal to a ground-contact length in the tire circumferential direction of a ground-contact surface portion situated on the vehicle inner side when the tire is mounted on the vehicle, of the tread, during rotation of the tire under a load exerted thereon, such that a relatively large ground-contact area is ensured and the tire exhibits good stability and controllability in both straight running and cornering even when the weight of the tire has been reduced. A pneumatic radial tire of the present invention is <b>characterized in that:</b>

As a result, when load is exerted on the tire, the tire side portion on the vehicle outer side having smaller radius of curvature right under the load is more deformed by larger expansion toward the outer side in the tire widthwise direction, whereby a ground-contact length in the tire circumferential direction of a ground-contact end on the vehicle outer side, of the tread, is elongated to a length substantially equal to a ground-contact length in the tire circumferential direction of a ground-contact end on the vehicle inner side of the tread during straight running of a vehicle and therefore an outline of a foot print takes on a substantially rectangular configuration. That is, it is possible to ensure a relatively large ground-contact area so that the tire exhibits good stability and controllability in both straight running and cornering.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Further, according to the pneumatic radial tire of the present invention, the aforementioned distance H<sub>out</sub> in the tire radial direction on the vehicle outer side is set to be smaller than the aforementioned distance H<sub>in</sub> in the tire radial direction on the vehicle inner side, thereby increasing asymmetry in a cross sectional configuration of the tire. As a result, difference in ground-contact length of a ground-contact surface of the tread between the vehicle-inner side half portion and the vehicle-outer side half portion of the tire can be further lessened.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Yet further, according to the pneumatic radial tire of the present invention, a negative ratio of a ground-contact surface of the tread of the vehicle-outer side half portion of the tire is set to be smaller than a negative ratio of a ground-contact surface of the tread of the vehicle-inner side half portion of the tire. As a result, the ground-contact surface of the tread of the vehicle-inner side half portion of the tire can exhibit good drainage performance, and the ground-contact surface of the tread of the vehicle-outer side half portion of the tire can have relatively high rigidity of land portions to ensure generation of relatively large lateral force in a cornering situation of a vehicle and thus<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> good cornering performance of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Yet further, according to the pneumatic radial tire of the present invention, an outer end in the tire radial direction of a turn-up portion of the carcass is disposed in each of the vehicle-outer side half portion and the vehicle-inner side half portion of the tire at a height in the tire radial direction of at least 40%, preferably at least 45%, of the tire cross sectional height. As a result, in a case where weight and rolling resistance of a tire are reduced by decreasing volume of bead fillers, deterioration of rigidities of the tire side portions can be effectively prevented from occurring by the sufficiently large turn-up portions of the carcass, thereby effectively eliminating concern about deterioration of stability and controllability of the tire.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Yet further, according to the pneumatic radial tire of the present invention, the tire may further include at least one belt layer formed by belt cords and provided on the outer peripheral side of a crown region of the carcass; and the external end in the tire radial direction of the turn-up portion of the carcass of at least one (preferably both) of the vehicle-outer side half portion and the vehicle-inner side half portion of the tire may be positioned, in the tire radial direction, between the maximum width position remotest from the tire equatorial plane and the outermost end in the tire widthwise direction of the belt layer in the tire side portions (inclusive of the maximum width position and exclusive of the position corresponding to the outermost end in the widthwise direction of the belt layer). In this case, it is possible to further improve stability and controllability, while effectively curbing rolling resistance.<br/>
More specifically, when the outer end of the turn-up portion of the carcass is disposed on the outer side in the tire radial direction of the outermost end in the tire widthwise direction of the belt layer, the tire weight increases to possibly increase rolling resistance of the tire, as well. When the outer end of the turn-up portion of the carcass is disposed on the inner side in the tire radial direction of the maximum width position remotest from the tire equatorial plane of the tire side portion, rigidity of the side portion in the vicinity of the tread decreases to possibly deteriorate stability and controllability of the tire.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the tire of the present invention, ground-contact properties of the tire mounted on a vehicle can be optimized by setting the aforementioned vehicle-inner side distance H<sub>in</sub> in the tire radial direction to be 1.1 to 1.3 times as large as the aforementioned vehicle-outer side distance H<sub>out</sub> in the tire radial direction.<br/>

When the ratio H<sub>in/</sub>H<sub>out</sub> exceeds 1.3, a ground-contact length on the vehicle outer side of a ground-contact surface of the tread is elongated too much, whereby an outline of a foot print then takes on a blunt triangle-like shape which is a mirror-image of the triangle shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3A</figref> to disturb the balance of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Further, in the tire of the present invention, it is possible to easily realize required negative ratios in ground-contact surfaces of the tread of the respective tire half portions to make the tire exhibit required drainage and cornering performances by providing a ground-contact surface of the tread of a half portion, on the vehicle inner side with respect to the tire equatorial plane, of the tire when the tire is mounted on the vehicle with two circumferential main grooves; and providing a ground-contact surface of the tread of a half portion, on the vehicle outer side with respect to the tire equatorial plane, of the tire when the tire is mounted on the vehicle with one circumferential main groove.<br/>
Yet further, it is possible to further increase lateral force generated in a cornering situation of a vehicle and thus make the vehicle exhibit good cornering performance by setting the average width of a land portion row demarcated between the one circumferential main groove of the vehicle-outer side half portion and one of the two circumferential main grooves (that adjacent to the one circumferential main groove) of the vehicle-inner side half portion of the tire to be at least 1.5 times as wide as the average width of a land portion row demarcated between the two circumferential main grooves of the vehicle-inner side half portion of the tire.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Yet further, in the tire of the present invention, it is possible to decrease volume of a bead filler, i.e. the tire weight as a whole, and thus effectively suppress rolling resistance by setting dimension in the tire radial direction of a bead filler, provided on the outer peripheral side of each bead core and between a carcass main body extending in a toroidal shape across the bead cores and the aforementioned turn-up portion of the carcass, to be in the range of 10 mm to 20 mm.<br/>
