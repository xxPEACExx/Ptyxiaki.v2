In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, P refers to a pulper wherein a papermaking material such as pulp and waste paper is inserted into a tank 1 to disintegrate the material in water, and the pulper P has a papermaking material insertion port 1a in an upper portion, a discharge port 1b in a lower portion, and the tank 1 for receiving the papermaking material and water.<br/>
The tank 1 has an inverted cone-like platform 1A located on a lower side and a cylindrical part 1B located on an upper side, and the cylindrical part 1B is connected to the inverted cone-like platform 1A.<br/>
The papermaking material (not shown) such as pulp and waste paper is continuously supplied into the tank 1 by a conveyor (not shown), water is supplied into the tank 1 by a first pipe (not shown), and the papermaking material disintegrated in the tank 1 is discharged to the outside of the tank 1 by a second pipe 2.<br/>
In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, numeral 3 refers to legs for supporting the tank 1.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, numeral 4 refers to a strainer provided to cover the discharge port 1b of the tank 1, and the strainer 4 is, for example, a disc having a large number of round holes. Here, numeral 5 refers to a rotor that is provided on the strainer 4, and disintegrates the papermaking material. The rotor 5 is rotated<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> via a belt 7, a pulley 8, and a rotational shaft 9 by power transmitted from a motor 6.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, each of numerals 5A, 5B is a protruding member that protrudes from a front edge AB of a vane of the rotor 5 (see <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>), extends toward the strainer 4, and has a substantially polygonal cross section across the direction perpendicular to the protruding members 5A, 5B.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Numeral 10 in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005">Fig. 4 to Fig. 6</figref> refers to a front cutter blade, and the front cutter blade 10 is attached to a back surface of the rotor 5 (more specifically, a back surface of the rotary vane of the rotor 5), and extends along the front edge AB of the rotary vane of the rotor 5 (see <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>) in the longitudinal direction. The front edge AB is formed linearly in a plan view, and the front cutter blade 10 is formed linearly in a plan view (see <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005">Figs. 3 to 6</figref>).<br/>
In <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005">Figs. 4 to 6</figref>, numeral 20 refers to an inclined cutter blade, and the inclined cutter 20 is attached to the back surface of the rotor 5 (more specifically, is attached to the back surface of the rotary vane of the rotor 5), and extends long in the longitudinal direction so as to be inclined away from the front cutter blade 10 toward the outside as represented by an arrow X in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5</figref>.<br/>
The inclined cutter blade 20 and the front cutter blade 10 are integrally formed via an inner portion 20A of the inclined cutter blade 20.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Accordingly, in the above-mentioned pulper P, the papermaking material is circulated in the tank 1 by rotation of the rotor 5, and is cut by the front cutter blade 10 and the inclined cutter blade 20, which are provided on the back surface of the vane of the rotor 5. The papermaking material is also cut by edges of the corners of the protruding members 5A, 5B each having the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> polygonal cross section, which promotes disintegration of the papermaking material.<br/>
The inclined cutter blade 20 and the front cutter blade 10 are provided adjacent to each other and thus, when the inclined cutter blade 20 is damaged, the front cutter blade 10 is also damaged. For this reason, the attachment and detachment of the cutter blade can be achieved in one replacement operation, improving the workability of replacement.<br/>
Moreover, the front edge of the rotor described in the conventional example is not formed linearly and thus, the cutter blades attached to the front edge of the rotor are the pair of first cutter blades. However, in the pulper P in this embodiment, since the front edge AB is formed linearly in a plan view, and the front cutter blade 10 is also formed linearly in a plan view, both of the front edge AB of the vane of the rotor 5 and the front cutter blade 10 can be easily worked.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">6</figref>, numeral 30 refers to a flat surface, and the inclined cutter blade 20 and the front cutter blade 10 are connected to each other via the flat surface 30. The flat surface 30 is higher than a lowermost surface of the inclined cutter blade 20 and a lowermost surface of the front cutter blade 10. The flat surface 30 contacts with the back surface of the rotor 5 (more specifically, the back surface of the rotary vane of the rotor 5).<br/>
The integrated inclined cutter blade 20 and front cutter blade 10 are attached by screwing bolts 40 into female screws 30a of the flat surface 30 through through holes 5a provided in the rotary vane of the rotor 5.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Accordingly, since a site (for example, Y in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5</figref>) of the back surface of the rotor 5 (more specifically, the back surface of the rotary vane of the rotor 5) is covered with the flat surface<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> 30 connecting the inclined cutter blade 20 to the front cutter blade 10, the side Y (see <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>) of the back surface of the rotor 5 is prevented from being damaged by the papermaking material. Moreover, when the inclined cutter blade 20 and the front cutter blade 10 are damaged during use, the flat surface 30 facing the papermaking material is also bored and damaged and therefore, attachment and detachment of the flat surface 30 and the cutter blades 10, 20 can be performed in one replacement operation, improving the workability of replacement.<br/>
When the flat surface 30 facing the papermaking material is bored and damaged, the papermaking material is accumulated in the damaged site, and the accumulated papermaking material is not disintegrated and suppresses movements of the papermaking material in the vicinity of the inclined cutter blade 20 and the front cutter blade 10, decreasing the dissolving efficiency. Further, accumulation of the papermaking material increases only loads on the rotor 5.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the above-mentioned embodiment, the inclined cutter blade 20 and the front cutter blade 10 are integrally formed via the inner portion 20A of the inclined cutter blade 20 (see <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">6</figref>), and the inclined cutter blade 20 and the front cutter blade 10 are connected to each other via the flat surface 30. However, the present invention is not limited to this, although not shown, the inner portion 20A of the inclined cutter blade 20 may be separated from the front cutter blade 10, and the inclined cutter blade 20 and the front cutter blade 10 may be integrally connected to each other via only the flat surface 30.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977382" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A pulper comprising:
