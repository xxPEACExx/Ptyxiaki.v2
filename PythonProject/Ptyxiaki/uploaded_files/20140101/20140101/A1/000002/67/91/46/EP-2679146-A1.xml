Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of vision correction and, more particularly, to methods and systems for providing customized vision correction, and business methods associated with providing such correction. The methods and systems employ a free form custom manufacturing process to form a custom contact lens.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A large portion of the population is ametropic; i.e., their vision is less than optimum due at least in part to refractive abnormalities of the eye. For over 100 years, practitioners ranging from lens fitters to surgeons have engaged in the business of providing vision correction to the ametropic population, as technology permitted, through spectacles, contact lenses, intra-ocular lenses (IOLs), inlays and onlays.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Many visual defects, also commonly known as aberrations, may arise from refractive abnormalities that have an adverse impact on imaging properties of an eye. Multiple orders of aberrations that may affect vision can be described using a variety of mathematical models, an example of which are Zernike coefficients. In the recommended Zernicke formulation, each Zernike coefficient gives the root-mean-square (RMS) wavefront error (in microns) contributed by the particular Zernike mode and the overall RMS error is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual coefficients. A set of Zernike coefficients thus gives detailed information on the relative and absolute importance of the different aberrational defects of any particular eye for the specified conditions of measurement. In the Zernike description, first-order polynomials describe wavefront tilt (i.e., prismatic effects) and have no effect on image quality.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Second-order polynomials describe the sphero-cylindrical errors of focus which can normally be negated by optical corrections, such as spectacles or contact lenses. The third-order modes include vertical and horizontal primary coma, and the fourth-order primary spherical aberration.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">While spectacles, contact lenses, and the like generally help people see better, they do not and cannot correct all refractive error. For example, although many lens products on the market today correct for some of the more commonly known low to mid order aberrations such as myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism, they do not address higher order aberration vision correction such as coma, trefoil, and higher order sphere due to current manufacturing process limitations.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Surgical treatment such as LASIK has been successful in addressing correction of some high order aberrations. However, such treatment may put the patient at risk and often can lead to other visual limitations such as glare, reduced nighttime vision, dry eye and myopia.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Technologies are being developed and refined in an attempt to address the aforementioned issues. For example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6499843B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,499,843</text></patcit> to Bausch &amp; Lomb Incorporated discloses a method for providing vision correction to a patient that includes engaging the patient in a practitioner's facility; obtaining a wavefront aberration measurement of an eye of the patient; providing the wavefront aberration measurement to a custom lens supply platform in a form suitable for input to the custom lens supply platform; producing a customized lens via the custom lens supply platform according to data associated with the wavefront aberration measurement; and providing the custom lens to the patient or the practitioner. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6499843B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,499,843</text></patcit> discloses that the custom lens supply platform provides for manufacturing the appropriate custom lens preferably, but not necessarily, at a location remote from the practitioner's facility by the then known manufacturing methods, including, for example, a lens laser ablation system, a lens lathing system, and a lens cast-molding system.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Laser ablation works by directing the output of a high-power laser, by computer, at the material to be cut. The material then either melts, bums, vaporizes away, or is blown away by a jet of gas.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> Lenses derived from laser ablation are limited in that an increase in the cuts that have to be made to obtain a desired shape results in a decrease in the optical quality of the lens.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In direct lathing, the back curve and the front surface of a lens button are machined. Lathing is time consuming and lenses derived from lathing are limited to the scope of the surface available.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Cast molding utilizes front and back curve molds that are either directly machined or injection molded. The front curve and back curve mold parts are brought together to shape the lens according to desired lens parameters. A liquid lens formulation contained within the mold is cured, for example by exposure to heat and light, to form a lens. Following cure, the mold parts are separated and the lens is removed from the mold parts. Lenses derived from cast-molding are limited to the design of the mold utilized.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US7905594B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 7,905,594</text></patcit> to Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision Care, Inc. discloses a method and an apparatus for forming ophthalmic lenses. The method includes positioning a substrate having an optical quality area in contact with a liquid lens formulation; transmitting actinic radiation through the substrate to polymerize a portion of the liquid lens formulation; and forming the lens, wherein the lens has a first surface portion along the optical quality area and a second surface portion that is free-formed.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">All patent publications and references cited in this disclosure are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Methods and systems that provide customized vision correction are desired. Preferably, such methods and systems allow patients to identify one or more contact lens products that provide more tailored vision correction than currently available contact lens products. Such methods and systems should be simple to understand and use, yet provide for patient preference and/or needs matching. The methods and systems of the present invention are particularly well suited to assist the selection of contact lens products particularly suited to provide a given patient optimum vision correction.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">Methods and systems that addresses the issues and concerns identified above are set forth by the present invention.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The term "vision correction" as used in the description of the invention refers both to a measured improvement in vision over that provided by conventional refractive correction and to the subjective evaluation of "seeing better" by the patient. The term "practitioner" or "eye care practitioner" as used herein refers appropriately to anyone qualified to fit, prescribe, or dispense vision correction devices such as spectacles, contact lenses and the like, or medically attend to a patient particularly with respect to the patient's eyes.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In accordance with an aspect of the invention, a method for providing vision correction to a patient is disclosed. The method comprises:
<ol><li>a) obtaining at least one bare eye data measurement of the patient;</li><li>b) providing the at least one bare eye data measurement to a free form custom lens manufacturing system;</li><li>c) producing a customized lens using the free form custom lens manufacturing system; and</li><li>d) providing the custom lens to the patient.</li></ol></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In accordance with another aspect, a method for providing vision correction to a patient is disclosed. The method comprises:
<ol><li>a) obtaining at least one habitual lens data measurement of the patient;</li><li>b) providing the at least one habitual lens data measurement to a free form custom lens manufacturing system;</li><li>c) producing a customized lens using the free form custom lens manufacturing system; and</li><li>d) providing the custom lens to the patient.</li></ol><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In accordance with yet another aspect, a method for providing vision correction to a patient is disclosed. The method comprises:
<ol><li>a) obtaining at least one fitting lens data measurement of the patient;</li><li>b) providing the at least one fitting lens data measurement to a free form custom lens manufacturing system;</li><li>c) producing a customized lens using the free form custom lens manufacturing system; and</li><li>d) providing the custom lens to the patient.</li></ol></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The custom lens may be a contact lens, an inlay, an onlay, or an IOL. The free form custom lens manufacturing system may provide for manufacture of the appropriate custom lens at a remote manufacturing facility, on-site at a retail store, at a kiosk, in a vehicle equipped with appropriate equipment, at an eye care practitioners' office, etc.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Moreover, the bare eye data measurement, the habitual lens data measurement and the fitting lens data measurement may each be obtained by suitable means known to those skilled in the art for obtaining bare eye data measurements, habitual lens data measurements and/or fitting lens data measurements. The bare eye data measurements, the habitual lens data measurements and/or the fitting lens data measurements may be obtained from the patient in the practitioner's facility; the bare eye data measurements, the habitual lens data measurements and/or the fitting lens data measurements may be transmitted to a free form custom lens manufacturing system; and a custom lens may be manufactured by the free form custom lens manufacturing system. Practice of the invention will provide the patient with vision correction and resulting visual performance from the custom lens that is better than that which would be provided to the patient using conventional means.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Another aspect of the invention provides a method for vision correction including engaging the patient in a practitioner's facility; obtaining a bare eye data measurement and/or a habitual lens data measurement and/or a fitting lens data measurement of the patient's eye; and providing a display of either a picture, a computer simulation or a graphic display. Preferably, the display is in a form that allows the patient to make a subjective evaluation of the product options which<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> will lead to the subjective evaluation of better vision. A related aspect involves transmitting the bare eye data measurement, the habitual lens data measurement and/or the fitting lens data measurement to a free form custom lens manufacturing system in a form readable by the free form custom lens manufacturing system for producing a custom lens.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Obtaining the bare eye data measurement, the habitual lens data measurement and/or the fitting lens data measurement and patient information and presenting the simulated display of custom lens options to the patient may be accomplished automatically outside of a practitioner's facility, in similar fashion, for example, to obtaining blood pressure readings from devices located in supermarkets, at the workplace, at home, etc. The desired information could then be transmitted automatically to a practitioner (e.g., for diagnostic purposes) or to a free form custom lens manufacturing system for making lenses for the patient if desired.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A method for providing vision correction to a patient may involve measuring an ocular characteristic of the patient's eye, either by a practitioner in the practitioner's facility or remotely without practitioner intervention. The measurement includes topography data and/or wavefront aberration data. This measured data is evaluated and the evaluation produces an option matrix that compares, among other things, prospective vision correction as a function of a prospective eye treatment, cost of treatment options, etc. Based upon the evaluation, the patient can select his/her treatment option, and lens manufacturing can occur automatically upon selection.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that any data transmission referred to above could be in the form of telecom or datacom, and could be sent via wire-based (optical fiber, cable, etc.) or wireless services. A preferable interface would be Internet based.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the detailed description of the invention and from the claims.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --><p id="p0026" num="0026">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate aspects of the present invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the objects, advantages and principles of the invention.

A series of exams can be performed to collect bare eye data, including, e.g., a physiology exam, a topographical exam, a wavefront exam, and a refraction exam.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As used herein, "custom product" means a product having one or more parameters that are not ordinarily available in products employing standard settings.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As used herein, "DMD" or "digital micromirror device" means a bistable spatial light modulator consisting of an array of movable micromirrors functionally mounted over a CMOS SRAM. Each mirror is independently controlled by loading data into the memory cell below the mirror to steer reflected light, spatially mapping a pixel of video data to a pixel on a display.

Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1A</figref>, a patient is provided an overview of available products and services 101. User interactive tools that demonstrate various potential use experiences can be employed. User interactive tools can be employed to collect and store data regarding the patient 102. This data can be used to generate information regarding products and services specific to the patient 103. Such data can include the patient's age, medical conditions that the patient<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> suffers, e.g., diabetes, hypertension, etc., eye or vision related medical conditions, e.g., glaucoma, dry-eye syndrome, etc., vision preferences, e.g., improved night vision, improved close-up vision, improved distance vision, etc.; data resulting from an eye exam, i.e., bare eye data. This data can be stored temporarily or permanently and can be employed when recommending product choices for the patient. The patient may choose to employ products and/or services currently available 120 or may choose to explore custom lens design 104 et seq. If the patient chooses to explore custom lens design 104 et seq., a simulation of optical choices 104, a simulation of mechanical choices 105 and a simulation of physiological choices 106 can be provided to the patient. Optical choices 104 can be shown using, e.g., graphical visual charts (e.g., Snellen Eye Chart), contrast sensitivity charts or by simulation of various levels of customization. For example, simulation software may be used to show a graphical version of a Snellen Eye Chart ("E" Chart) (see <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 5</figref>) to compare a patient's bare eye vision with their corrected vision using currently available products or using one or more custom lens products. These options may include one or more of the following: custom low order optical aberration correction (e.g., 2nd order, 3rd order), custom low to mid order optical aberration correction (e.g., 4th order, 5th order), and custom mid to high order optical aberration correction (e.g., 6th order, 7th order). Mechanical choices 105 can be shown using centration/rotation models to demonstrate how a selection of certain customized mechanical options may enhance or optimize a patient's vision. Physiological choices 106 can be shown using, e.g., simulated oxygen transmission, corneal staining, and conjunctival staining by way of pressure profile graphs, surface area coverage, and contact graphs, etc. Once the patient has made optical, mechanical and physiological choices, the patient's data is used to generate a wet lens design 107 to determine how a custom lens may perform when it is on the eye. For example, simulation software may be used to display an expected performance of a patient's custom lens. This may be done by one or more of the following: displaying centration and rotation performance, displaying movement performance by possibly using a "pushup" test, and redisplaying optical performance including, either one or both of: centration and rotation performance potentially using graphical visual acuity or contrast sensitivity charts, and potentially using software such as: Zemax, Oslo, or Code V. Based on the wet lens design, a lens on eye simulation 108 is performed and the patient chooses a custom lens design 109.
