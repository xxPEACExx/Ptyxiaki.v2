id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an endoscope apparatus that performs fluorescence imaging and a method for controlling light quantity of fluorescence imaging.</p><heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">An endoscope apparatus which uses an endoscope has been widely used in a medical field. A light source apparatus of a conventional endoscope has generally adopted a scheme to attain the irradiation with a desired light from a white color light source such as a xenon lamp and a halogen lamp through a band-pass filter.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In recent years, inexpensive and high-output solid light-emitting devices such as a light emitting diode (abbreviated as LED) and a semiconductor laser have been put into practical use, and a light source apparatus or an illuminating apparatus made of a combination of a plurality of light-emitting devices, for an endoscope, has been used.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Such a light source apparatus can advantageously control a quantity of light for each wavelength independently. However, disadvantageously, in the case where an image is obtained or generated by means of illumination by a plurality of light-emitting devices, or a plurality of images are displayed superimposed on one another, if a light quantity ratio of the plurality of light-emitting devices is not controlled to be constant, the balance and the like of an obtained image may be distorted.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In particular, in the case where an image of fluorescence (a fluorescence image) and an image of a reflected light of a reference light (a reflected image) are superimposed on one another or the like to display the images at the same time, if the intensities of both the images are substantially different, it is also desired that the light quantity ratio be controlled to be constant.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to address such a case, for example, in a conventional example disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2008259595A"><text>2008-259595</text></patcit>, an intensity control portion controls a relative intensity of illuminating light components with respect to excitation light components depending on the luminance value of observation image data from a fluorescence image and a reflected image of a subject, and adjusts the balance of the reflected image with respect to the fluorescence image.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, in the case of the conventional example, since the intensity level of fluorescence is very small compared to the case of reflected light, such a case occurs where it is difficult to control the light quantity ratio between the excitation light and the reference light for generating the reflected light to be constant, simply on the light source apparatus side or illuminating light side. Specifically, even if the light source for generating the excitation light is set to the maximum light emission quantity (the upper-limit value of the light emission quantity), such a case sometimes occurs where a required light quantity ratio cannot be ensured.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In a case like this, the method of the primary choice is to perform addition processing for a plurality of adjacent pixels from an image signal for one pixel in a fluorescence image as in pixel binning to generate an image signal for one pixel.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The conventional example however does not disclose the feature of thus performing addition processing for pixels to control the light quantity while maintaining constant the light quantity ratio between the excitation light suitable for fluorescence and reference light, thus keeping the balance between the image signal of fluorescence and the image signal of reflected light, to display the both image signals superimposed on each other.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention has been made in view of the above-mentioned points, and an objective of the present invention is to provide an endoscope apparatus and a method for controlling light quantity of fluorescence imaging that are applicable to the case of performing addition processing for pixels and are capable of displaying an image signal of fluorescence and an image signal of reflected light without<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> changing the balance between the image signals even when the signals are displayed being superimposed on each other.</p><heading id="h0003">Disclosure of Invention</heading><heading id="h0004">Means for Solving the Problem</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">An endoscope apparatus according to an aspect of the present invention includes: a light source portion including light sources that irradiate living tissue with an excitation light for generating fluorescence and a reference light for generating a reflected light alternately;

If the quantity of an excitation light is insufficient even in the set upper-limit value, the operator increases the number of addition images P in image addition processing. Thereby, the resolution of fluorescence image part can be prevented from being lowered and a required quantity of an excitation light can be ensured.</p><p id="p0146" num="0146">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 12</figref>, a movement detecting circuit 71 may be provided. The movement detecting circuit 71 detects a temporal movement amount from, for<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> example, image signals of a reflected light that form a superimposed composite image. On the basis of detection signals of the movement amount from the movement detecting circuit 71, the number of addition images P and/or a range of the number of binning pixels n may be restrained. <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 13</figref> shows how the movement detecting circuit 71 detects a movement amount from two images Ia and Ib.</p><p id="p0147" num="0147">In a configuration example of <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 12</figref>, for example, image signals of a reflected light outputted from the synchronization memory 38a and image signals delayed by one to several frames through a delay circuit 72 are inputted to the movement detecting circuit 71. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 13</figref>, the movement detecting circuit 7 detects a movement amount M' that indicates the movement of a characteristic part or a criterion part Ca from a characteristic part or a criterion part Cb. The part Ca is, for example, an outline extracted from any range Ra set in the former image Ia, and the part Cb is in a range Pb included in the latter image Ib. The movement detecting circuit 7 then calculates (or detects) an average movement amount M among frames from a detection result. Note that if the images Ia and Ib are temporally different from each other by Q frames, M = M' / Q.</p><p id="p0148" num="0148">The movement detecting circuit 71 also calculates an evaluated number of pixels E obtained by evaluating the number of pixels to which the calculated movement amount M corresponds among frames in the CCD 19b for picking up an image of fluorescence. The movement detecting circuit 71 then outputs the evaluated number of pixels E to the light-adjusting circuit 29, the binning setting portion 32, and the image addition processing circuit 39b. Thus, the movement detecting circuit 71 includes an evaluated number-of-pixels calculating portion 71a that calculates the evaluated number of pixels E obtained by evaluating the number of pixels to which the movement amount M corresponds for one frame. The movement detecting circuit 71 also includes a first control circuit 71b that uses the evaluated number of pixels E to control an upper-limit value of the number of addition images in the addition performed by the image addition processing circuit 39b and a second control circuit 71c that restrains an upper-limit value of the pixel number n of binning performed by the binning setting portion 32.<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --></p><p id="p0149" num="0149">For example, if a value of the evaluated number of pixels E is small, that is, the movement amount M is small, the movement detecting circuit 71 causes an upper-limit value of the number of addition images in the addition performed by the image addition processing circuit 39b to be set at a larger value and causes an upper-limit value of the number of binning pixels n to be restrained for the binning setting portion 32.</p><p id="p0150" num="0150">The light-adjusting circuit 29 performs light quantity control in such a control state.</p><p id="p0151" num="0151">On the other hand, if a value of the evaluated number of pixels E is large, that is, the movement amount M is large, the movement detecting circuit 71 causes an upper-limit value of the number of addition images in the addition performed by the image addition processing circuit 39b to be lowered and allows an upper-limit value of the number of binning pixels n to be set at a larger value for the binning setting portion 32. The light-adjusting circuit 29 performs light quantity control in such a control state.</p><p id="p0152" num="0152">Note that when an upper-limit value of the number of binning pixels n is restrained using the evaluated number of pixels E, because a pixel region size causing blur for every frame is E x E, letting Ub be an upper-limit value, the number of binning pixels n may be set to meet the condition Ub ≤ E x E. On the other hand, if it is assumed that an upper-limit value of the number of addition images is Ui, letting Tm be a threshold of the number of pixels with which an outline of moving part is recognized as obviously discontinuous within one frame, the number of addition images may be set to meet the condition Ui ≤ Tm / E.</p><p id="p0153" num="0153">Note that the light-adjusting circuit 29, to which the evaluated number of pixels E calculated by the movement detecting circuit 71 (or the evaluated number-of-pixels calculating portion 71a thereof) is inputted, may control the number of addition images from the image addition processing circuit 39b and control the number of binning pixels n for the binning setting portion 32.<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --></p><p id="p0154" num="0154">If part with less movement is observed, such control by the light-adjusting circuit 29 allows the number of binning pixels n to be restrained and image addition processing to cover the sensitivity insufficient at that number of binning pixels n.</p><p id="p0155" num="0155">In this way, a resolution of fluorescence image part can be prevented from lowering and observation can be accomplished with the color balance being unchanged. Meanwhile, if movement is significant, the sensitivity can be improved by pixel binning to generate an image being easy to use for the purpose of diagnosis by following the movement.</p><p id="p0156" num="0156">In the foregoing configuration, the case where image signals of a reflected light are used has been described, but image signals of fluorescence may also be used to detect movement.</p><p id="p0157" num="0157">Note that image signals of a composite image in which image signals of fluorescence and image signals of a reflected light are superimposed are not limited to image signals of a fluorescence image and red (R) components, and may be image signals of G components or B components (image signals in two pseudo colors).
