Such containers may be used amongst other purposes for storage of fresh produce and other food products.

In this application, the term "tray" is taken to mean any container produced from polymeric sheet materials by thermoforming. The tray may be transparent, either clear or lightly tinted, in order to allow the user or consumer to view the contents, or it may be rendered opaque by the inclusion of pigments by means of a masterbatch or otherwise.

<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 The introduction of "sell by", "display until", and "best before" dates which have been introduced in the interests of public health has led to a dramatic increase of fresh produce waste by growers, by supermarket chains, by individual supermarket stores and by consumers at home. Any development which can lead to a reduction in the quantity of fresh produce waste is increasingly likely to be well received. As examples of the size of fresh produce waste, it has been estimated that each British adult wastes £450 per annum on fresh produce, and that the largest category of waste for the UK as a whole is fresh fruit and vegetables at 1 ,360,000 tonnes per annum (2009 figures). As of the date of this application, fresh fruit and vegetables are estimated to make up 25% by weight of the total avoidable household waste and bakery products are estimated to account for a further 13%. For every tonne of food waste avoided, the world will save 4.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Food waste can have a dramatically varied impact, depending on the amount produced and how it is dealt with; in some countries, the amount of food waste is negligible and has little impact. However, in countries such as the US and the UK, food scrap is estimated to represent around 19 percent of the waste dumped in landfills, where it ends up rotting and producing methane, a greenhouse gas. The social, economic and environmental impact of food wastage is enormous. In the UK, 6.7 million tonnes per year of wasted food (purchased, edible food which is discarded) amounts to a cost of £10.2 billion each year. This translates into a cost of £250 to £400 a year for every British household. A study by the University of Arizona in 2004, indicated that 14- 15 per cent of US edible food is untouched or unopened, amounting to $43 billion worth of discarded, but edible, food. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention concerns improvements in or relating to containers for the storage of fresh produce. More particularly, but not exclusively, a desired aim of the invention is to improve the permeability and/or compostability or degradability of containers for the storage of fresh produce. These and other aims and benefits of the invention will be more fully understood from the following description. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In a first aspect, the present invention concerns a thermoformed container made substantially from polymeric material having embedded therein micro-porous particles 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 of a size such that at least part of an internal surface of the container is rough to the touch. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It may be that an external surface of the container is smooth to the touch. It may be that the container is formed from a thermoformable polymeric sheet material having the micro-porous particles embedded therein. The surfaces of the sheet material may be smooth to the touch prior to thermoforming. During thermoforming the sheet material reduces in thickness with the result that the embedded particles project from the internal surface of the formed container. Suitable sheet materials may have a thickness (prior to thermoforming) in the range 100 to 1000 microns and the embedded particles may range in size from 30 to 200 microns, more preferably from 30 to 100 microns. It may be that the micro-porous particles are micro-porous mineral particles. It will be evident that measurement of the thickness of any part of a thermoformed tray or extruded substrate which exhibits the presence of embedded particles projecting from one or more of its surface cannot be reliably determined in the usual way, for example, by means of a micrometer. In this description, any reference to the thickness of a thermoformed tray or extruded substrate exhibiting the presence of protruding particles should be taken to mean the thickness of a notional tray or substrate identical in all respects except that the protruding particles would no longer be present. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In a second aspect, the present invention concerns a thermoformed container made substantially from polymeric material having embedded therein micro-porous mineral particles of a size greater than the thickness of the thermoformed polymeric material at its thinnest part such that at least part of an internal surface of the container is rough to the touch. When thermoforming the polymeric sheet in which the micro-porous mineral particles are embedded, the sheet is drawn into a mould by vacuum from below or pressure from above, or both. The polymeric sheet may be heated to increase its plasticity prior to thermoforming. As the sheet is drawn into the mould, the walls and base of the tray are thinned as the polymeric material is stretched, in comparison with, for 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 example, the rim of the tray which may not be subjected to thermo forming. Typically, after thermofoming, the corners at the base of the tray become its thinnest part followed by the walls and base of the container. The consequence of the particle size is that the internal surface, in particular, of the thermoformed containers made substantially from polymeric material are rough to the touch and the presence of particles can clearly be seen and felt in the walls and/or base of the container due to the thinning of these parts during thermo forming. In the case of a thermoformed tray where the polymeric material sheet has been plasticised by heat and then drawn into the mould, the presence of particles can be particularly seen and felt on the internal surface of the tray. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Thus, as the plasticised sheet is being tightly drawn against the surface of the mould which may be smooth and highly polished, the micro-porous particles, whilst remaining embedded within the thinned sheet, are displaced from a random position within the sheet prior to thermoforming to an asymmetric position in which the surface area of the embedded particles projecting within the container is significantly greater than the surface area of the embedded particles projecting without the container. In some embodiments, the embedded particles may project within the container only. In this way the external surface of the container may be smooth to the touch. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">It will be noted that the particles, although now asymmetrically disposed within the thinned sheet, are still embedded within the polymeric material which provides a covering to each projecting particle. This asymmetry has important consequences for the performance of the tray as it provides an increased surface area of micro-porous mineral particles on the inner surface of the tray. The covering of polymeric material may only be thin, for example several microns thick, so that the particles are exposed to the contents of the tray through the covering, thus allowing enhanced breathability and accelerated absorption. In turn, this increases the performance of the tray for storing and presenting fresh produce due to enhanced breathability and accelerated absorption of, for example, ethylene and/or moisture.

 The tray may be closed by a variety of means. The closure may comprise a lid typically made from the same polymeric material as the tray which clips, or is otherwise secured, to the tray sufficiently tightly for the lid not to be inadvertently separated from the base. The closure may comprise an integrally thermoformed hinged lid which is formed simultaneously with the tray to produce what is often known as a clam-shell pack. The closure may comprise a polymeric filmic lid which is heat sealed or otherwise secured to the tray, preferably by a peelable seal such that the consumer may easily open the container by peeling back the filmic lid. Trays can be made from many different polymeric sheet materials including petroleum based polymers such as polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride, and bio-polymers containing a greater or lesser content of renewable raw materials derived from plant sources, sometimes known as biomass. The choice of polymeric sheet material for any particular application will depend upon the characteristics required, including, although the list is by no means limiting, transparency, barrier properties, thermoformability, transmission of odour or taste from the polymeric sheet material into the contents of the tray (to produce what is known as taint), ease of disposal, and cost. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The choice of micro-porous mineral particles for any particular application will depend on the characteristics required. For food packaging applications, the mineral particles may comprise zeolites such as clinoptilolite, bentonite, diatomite or other mineral particles. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Suitable sheet materials may have a thickness in the range 100 to 1000 microns and the embedded particles may range in size from 30 to 200 microns, more preferably from 30 to 100 microns. If the tray is to contain fresh produce, it may be necessary to perforate either the tray or the lid or both. Typically, the surface area of the perforation(s) represents between 0.0002 and 0.0012% of the combined surface area of the tray and lid. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The container can comprise a single compartment or multiple compartments. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
 The polymeric materials of the containers which are the subject of the present invention comprise particularly, but not exclusively, petroleum based substrates on the one hand and compostable substrates on the other hand. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The term "petroleum based polymers" within this application comprises all polymeric substrates derived from petroleum which may be used to produce containers as defined above. The term "polyester" in this application includes all forms of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) including therefore amorphous PET (APET), crystalline PET (CPET), recycled PET (RPET), and copolymer PET (PETG), although these forms of PET are by no means limiting. The term "compostable" within this specification comprises all polymeric materials which are capable of undergoing biological decomposition in a composting site as part of a controlled composting programme, such that the polymeric material is not thereafter visually distinguishable within the compost, having broken down to carbon dioxide, water, non-hazardous inorganic compounds, and biomass, at a rate consistent with known compostable materials and leaving no toxic residue. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Compostable materials are typically certified to conform to international norms such as: </p><p id="p0020" num="0020"> American Society for Testing and Materials ASTM-6400-99 </p><p id="p0021" num="0021">European Standardization Committee (CEN) EN13432 </p><p id="p0022" num="0022"> International Standards Organization (ISO) IS014855 (only for biodegradation) </p><p id="p0023" num="0023">German Institute for Standardization DIN) DIN V49000 </p><p id="p0024" num="0024"> ASTM, CEN and DIN standards specify the criteria for biodegradation, disintegration and eco-toxicity for a polymeric material to be certified as compostable. </p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Certification to comply with, for example, EN13432 is dependent, amongst other things, upon the thickness of the material being tested. Typically, polymeric substrates of thicknesses up to 60μιη obtain certification to comply with international norms such as EN13432. It will be evident that for production of thermoformed trays, 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
 sheets of greater thickness, typically between 350μηι and 800μηι, are required depending upon the draw depth of the tray during thermo forming. For the avoidance of doubt, if a material has been certified to comply with EN13432 at any thickness, then in this application it will be considered to fall within the term "compostable", even at greater thicknesses than that which obtained certification to comply with EN13432. </p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The term "degradable" within this specification comprises polymeric materials which undergo a significant change in their physical and chemical structure under specific environmental conditions resulting in a loss of some properties. Note that there is no requirement that the polymeric material has to be degraded by the action of naturally occurring micro-organisms or any of the other criteria required for compostable plastics, neither is it necessary for the "degraded" polymeric material to become visually indistinguishable. </p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In addition to enhancing the breathability of containers made substantially from polymeric materials, it has been found that the micro-porous mineral particles of this invention assist compostable polymeric materials to compost more quickly, and degradable polymeric materials to degrade more quickly, as a result of enhancing permeability of the polymeric materials via the pathways which are created within the polymeric materials by the presence of micro-porous mineral particles. </p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The accelerated rate of compostability may be practised in the form of thermoformed containers or in the form of flexible substrates according to any of the aspects of the invention described herein. </p><p id="p0029" num="0029">It will be appreciated that in the form of extruded flexible substrates, the particles will be dispersed randomly within the flexible substrate and that both surfaces of the flexible substrate will therefore be equally rough to the touch. However, as in the case of thermoformed containers, the particles, although disposed randomly within the substrate, will always have a covering of polymeric material which may be thin, for example several microns thick, so that the particles are exposed to the surroundings through the covering. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
 The incorporation of an anti-microbial coating within the container has been found to enhance the shelf life of fresh produce packed within the container still further. A preferred feature of the anti-microbial coating material is an absence of subsequent taint of the fresh produce packed within the container. </p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The coating may be applied to the polymeric substrate before or after conversion into containers as a wash coating, a strip coating or as printed matter. All the components within the coating should be food contact approved, including particularly the binder and the anti-microbial agent.

The coating may have a thickness in the range 2 to 10 microns and more preferably 2 to 5 microns, although particles may protrude from the surface of the coating. The inclusion of a synthetic zeolite in the coating can provide further life extension properties to certain types of fresh produce packed within the container.

Where advantageous, an absorbent material may be included in the second preparation in order to provide an adsorbent capacity to the coating, for example a synthetic zeolite of particle size up to 25 microns, measured according to EN21524, may be employed. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The particle size of the synthetic zeolite may be chosen so that the synthetic zeolite forms a stable suspension (after agitation) in the coating during the application of the coating to the container or to the substrate destined for insertion within the container. In order to achieve the best results, it is preferred to minimise the use of water as a component of the solvent mixture in both the first and the second preparations. Once the first and second preparations have been independently prepared, the two preparations can be mixed together in appropriate proportions to provide a coating which may be applied by conventional means.

The sheet 5 may comprise petroleum based polymers, compostable polymers or degradable polymers as described previously. Petroleum based polymers, include but are not limited to polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride, and bio- polymers containing a greater or lesser content of renewable raw materials derived from plant sources, sometimes known as biomass. The choice of polymer material for any particular application may depend upon the characteristics required, including, but not limited to, transparency, barrier properties, thermoformability, transmission of odour or taste from the polymer into the contents of the tray (to produce what is known as taint), ease of disposal, and cost. The micro-porous mineral particles 7 may comprise zeolites such as clinoptilolite, bentonite, diatomite or other mineral particles suitable for inclusion in food packaging applications. The choice of micro-porous 
<!-- EPO <DP n="14"/>-->
 mineral particles for any particular application may depend on the particular atmosphere within the container which offers optimum storage life to the contents of the container. As shown in Figure 1 , the thickness of the sheet 5 prior to thermoforming is such that the micro-porous particles 7 are embedded completely within the polymeric material of the sheet 5 such that the presence of the particles 7 may not be readily apparent and the surfaces of the sheet 5 may be substantially smooth to the touch. The particles 7 may be of uniform size or non-uniform size and may be of regular shape or irregular shape. The sheet 5 may contain particles 7 of the same or different materials, for example a mixture of particles 7 of different materials. The particles 7 may b e provided throughout the sheet 5. Alternatively, the particles 7 may be provided in one or more selected areas of the sheet 5. The or each selected area may be chosen so that the particles 7 are provided in a particular area of the tray 1 . The loading of particles 7 may provide a uniform or non-uniform distribution of the particles 7 throughout the sheet 5 or in the or each selected area. The thickness of the sheet 5 and size of particles 7 may vary according to requirements. By way of example, the sheet 5 may have a thickness in the range 100 to 1000 microns and the particles 7 may have a size in the range 30 to 200 microns. The particle size may vary as shown. </p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Figure 2 shows thermoforming the sheet 5 in a mould 9 to form the tray 1 . The mould 9 has a recess 1 1 corresponding to the finished shape of the tray 1 and the sheet 5 is drawn into the mould 9 by applying a vacuum from below via holes 13 in selected areas of the mould 9, typically in the bottom of the recess 1 1 . Alternatively or additionally, pressure may be applied to the sheet 5 from above.. The sheet 5 may be heated to increase its plasticity prior to thermoforming. The mould 9 may be heated to assist thermoforming of the sheet 5. As the sheet 5 is drawn into the mould, the sheet 5 is thinned as the polymeric material is stretched in areas forming side walls 15 and base 17 of the tray 1 in comparison with, for example, areas forming a rim 19 of the tray 1 which may not be subjected to thermoforming. Typically, after thermofoming, the side walls 15 and base 17 of the tray 1 are of reduced thickness in comparison with the thickness of the sheet 5 prior to thermoforming and the thinnest part of the tray 1 may be at the corners between the side walls 15 and base 17. As 
<!-- EPO <DP n="15"/>-->
 shown, the base 17 of the tray 1 may be of uniform thickness and side walls 15 of the tray may increase in thickness from the base 17 to the rim 19 of the tray 1. </p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Figure 3 shows the thermoformed tray 1. The tray 1 may be of rectangular shape in plan view or any other suitable shape. The tray may be rigid or semi-rigid. The tray may be self-supporting. The reduction in thickness of the sheet 5 during thermoforming is such that at least some of the particles 7 embedded in areas of the sheet 5 forming the base 17 and at least lower regions of the side walls 15 are no longer contained wholly within the thickness of the sheet 5 and project at least partially from the surface of the tray 1 such that the presence of particles 7 can clearly be seen and felt due to the thinning of these parts during thermoforming. More especially, during the thermoforming process the sheet 5 is tightly drawn against the surface of the mould 9 which may be smooth and highly polished. As a result, the micro-porous particles 7, whilst remaining embedded within the thinned sheet 5, are preferably displaced towards the interior of the tray 1 from a random position within the thickness of sheet 5 prior to thermoforming to an asymmetric position in which the surface area of the embedded particles 7 projecting from the side walls 15 and base 17 on the inside of the tray 1 is significantly greater than the surface area of the embedded particles 7 projecting from the side walls walls 15 and base 17 on the outside of the tray 1. In preferred embodiments, the particles 7 may project on the inner surface of the tray only. The outer surface of the tray 1 may thus be smooth to the touch. This asymmetry provides an increased surface area of micro-porous mineral particles 7 on the inner surface of the tray 1. The polymeric material of the tray 1 provides a covering for the particles 7 where they project from the surface of the tray 1. The covering may be thin, for example of the order of several microns only so that the particles 7 are exposed to the contents of the tray 1 through the covering allowing accelerated absorption. In turn, this increases the performance of the tray 1 for storing and presenting fresh produce due to accelerated absorption of, for example, ethylene and moisture. In addition to enhancing the breathability of the tray 1 , it has been found that the micro-porous mineral particles 7 may assist composting when the tray 1 is made of compostable polymeric materials, and degrading when the tray 1 is made of degradable polymeric materials, as a result of the pathways which are created within the polymeric materials by the presence of embedded micro-porous mineral particles 7.

 Figure 4 shows the tray 1 containing fresh produce 3 such as strawberries and closed by a lid 21 . The lid 21 may comprise a film of polymeric material which can be sealed to the rim 19 of the tray 1 for example by heat or by adhesive, preferably by a peelable seal such that the consumer may easily open the tray 1 by peeling back the lid 21 . Attaching the lid 21 to the rim 19 may be faciliated because the polymeric material of the sheet 5 forming the rim 19 was not thinned to any appreciable extent during the thermoforming process with the result that the particles 7 remain within the thickness of the sheet 5 and the surface of the rim 19 is smooth for attaching the lidding film. Other means (not shown) of closing the tray 1 may be employed. For example, a lid typically made from the same polymeric material as the tray 1 which may be formed separately and clips, or is otherwise secured, to the tray 1 sufficiently tightly for the lid not to be inadvertently separated from the tray 1 . Alternatively, a hinged lid may be integrally thermoformed simultaneously with the tray 1 to produce what is often known as a clam-shell pack. Where a separate or integral lid 21 is provided, it may not be necessary for the particles 7 to remain within the thickness of the sheet 5 in the area forming the rim 19. Whatever form of lid is employed, the lid 21 and/or tray 1 may be provided with perforations 23. Figures 5 and 6 show modifications in which the tray 1 and/or lid 21 is provided with an anti-microbial material. The incorporation of an anti-microbial material has been found to enhance the shelf life of fresh produce packed within the tray 1 still further. The anti-microbial material may be provided as a coating on an internal surface of the tray 1 and/or lid 21 . Alternatively or additionally, a separate substrate may b e provided that is coated with the anti-microbial material. Such substrate may b e provided loose within the tray 1 or may be attached to an interior surface of the tray 1 and/or lid 21 . Figure 5 shows a substrate 25 having a coating of anti-microbial material on its upper or lower surface provided within the tray 1 , typically in the form of a bubble pad or mat at the bottom of the tray 1 . Figure 6 shows a coating 27 of anti-microbial material provided on the underside of the lid 21 or on a substrate attached to the lid 21 such as self-adhesive label. The surface area of the antimicrobial coating may vary according to the nature of the fresh produce and the anticipated microbial incidence. The surface area of the anti-microbial coating can 
<!-- EPO <DP n="17"/>-->
 vary between 1 % and 100% of the internal surface area of the tray 1 and lid 21 , especially between 5% and 50%, and more especially between 2.5% and 25%. </p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Figure 7 shows an extruded compostable or degradable flexible polymeric substrate 31 of thickness between 10 and 100 microns more preferably between 15 and 50 microns containing embedded micro-porous particles 33 of size between 15 and 150 microns more preferably between 35 and 95 microns, all of which exhibit a covering of the polymeric material of several microns thickness. The particles 33 may be introduced into the extruded substrate 31 by means of a masterbatch. Due to the method of manufacture by extrusion, the particles 33 will be randomly dispersed throughout the substrate 31 and hence both surfaces of the substrate 31 will be rough to the touch. Such a substrate 31 can be converted into different forms of flexible container such as side-sealed or bottom sealed bags or whilst being filled on vertical or horizontal form fill seal machines including flow wrappers. </p><p id="p0071" num="0071">Figure 8 illustrates an example of how the flexible substrate 31 of Figure 7 may find application as a lidding film for a tray 35.

It may be preferable for the tray 35 to which the flexible film 31 is attached to be made from a compostable or degradable polymeric material in order that both components are similarly compostable or degradable. The lidding film 31 and tray 35 may be made from the same or different materials. Figure 9 illustrates a further example of how the flexible substrate 31 of Figure 7 may find application in flow wrapping. In this example, the flexible compostable or degradable substrate 31 is converted into a pouch 37 by first converting the substrate 31 into a tube by means of a longitudinal heat seal and then making a first transvers e seal 39, inserting a filled tray 41 into the open pouch 37 and then closing the pouch 37 with a second transverse heat seal 43. The tray 41 may be as shown in Figures 1 to 4. The flexible compostable or degradable pouch substrate 31 preferably has a thickness of between 15 and 30 microns. It may be preferable for the tray 41 to be made from a compostable or degradable polymeric material in order that both components are
