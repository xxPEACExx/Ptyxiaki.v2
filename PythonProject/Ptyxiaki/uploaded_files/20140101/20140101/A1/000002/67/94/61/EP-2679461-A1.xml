For example, this corresponds to hybrid vehicles described in Patent Documents 1 and 2. Such a hybrid vehicle generally has a charged capacity (state of charge; SOC) of an electric storage device controlled to be maintained within a predetermined range (e.g., a range of an SOC management width defined by an upper limit value and a lower limit value) so as to suppress deterioration in durability of the electric storage device due to repeated charging/discharging. Therefore, the electric motor is caused to perform power running operation or regenerative operation within the limited SOC. From another viewpoint, the availability of the motor running or the assist running can be determined based on SOC information of the electric storage device. Patent Document 1 discloses a technique of calculating a boundary of a travelable range in which a vehicle can run by the motor running based on a current position based on map information, an SOC value of a battery, and learning data based on running history (an energy amount required for the vehicle running on each link in which the vehicle ran in the past) to display and overlap the boundary on a map displayed on a display.</p><heading id="h0003">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><heading id="h0004">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2010169423A"><text>2010-169423</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2005160269A"><text>2005-160269</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">Problem to Be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, in the technique described in Patent Document 1, since no consideration is given to a recovered amount of electric energy (regenerative energy) from regenerative operation during running, the accuracy (credibility) of the travelable range may be reduced. A technique with a consideration given to a recovered amount of regenerative energy from an electric motor is proposed in Patent Document 2 as, if a down-slope section enabling recovery of large regenerative energy is present on a running route such as when a mountain is crossed, enlarging an SOC management width and driving the electric motor to assist an engine to lower the SOC before running the down slope section. However, in the technique described in Patent Document 2, since one running route must be specified from a current point and a running direction and no consideration is given to a plurality of running routes when a branched road etc., are present, electric failure may occur due to the driving of the electric motor in the case of going to a running route different from the specified running route. The problem as described above is not known and no proposal has been made on enabling the motor running and the assist running causing no electric failure without specifying one running route.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention was conceived in view of the situations and it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a control device of a hybrid vehicle capable of improving fuel efficiency by enabling the motor running and the assist running causing<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> no electric failure without specifying one running route.</p><heading id="h0007">Means for Solving the Problem</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">To achieve the object, the first aspect of the invention provides (a) a control device of a hybrid vehicle including a plurality of drive power sources for running including an electric motor driven by electric energy of an electric storage device, the hybrid vehicle configured to perform motor running or assist running using the electric motor for running, characterized in that (b) the control device divides a running road acquired from map data into a plurality of sections and stores a change amount of a charged capacity of the electric storage device for each of the divided sections.</p><heading id="h0008">Effects of the Invention</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">Consequently, since a running road acquired from the map data is divided into a plurality of sections and the change amount of the charged capacity of the electric storage device is stored for each of the divided sections, an electric energy amount of the electric storage device consumable before recovery of electric energy can be calculated during running in a certain running route based on the change amount of the charged capacity of the stored electric storage device. By consuming the electric energy amount in advance through the motor running and the assist running, a subsequently recovered electric energy amount (regenerative energy amount) can be increased. As a result, the motor running and the assist running causing no electric failure can be achieved without specifying one running route so as to improve fuel efficiency.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The second aspect of the invention provides the control device of the hybrid vehicle recited in the first aspect of the invention, wherein the control device acquires all possibly-traveled running routes within a predetermined distance from a current position of the vehicle based on the map data, wherein the control device calculates a variation<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> characteristic of the charged capacity in correlation with a distance from the current position for each of the running routes based on the change amount of the charged capacity, wherein if it is determined from the variation characteristic of the charged capacity that the possibly-traveled running routes include at least one running route in which electric energy can be recovered to the extent exceeding a predetermined charged capacity upper limit value for permitting charging of the electric storage device, and if the charged capacity does not fall below a predetermined charged capacity lower limit value for permitting discharging of the electric storage device in all the possibly-traveled running routes even when the electric energy exceeding the predetermined charged capacity upper limit value is consumed before recovery, permission is given for the motor running or the assist running using a consumable amount of the electric energy based on electric energy exceeding the predetermined charged capacity upper limit value. Consequently, a subsequently recovered regenerative energy amount can be increased by consuming the electric energy amount in advance through the motor running and the assist running. As a result, the motor running and the assist running causing no electric failure can be achieved without specifying one running route so as to improve fuel efficiency.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The third aspect of the invention provides the control device of the hybrid vehicle recited in the second aspect of the invention, wherein if the running is performed in a route other than the possibly-traveled running routes, the permission for the motor running or the assist running is withdrawn. Consequently, although the running is performed on other than the possibly-traveled running routes after the permission for the motor running or the assist running and the charged capacity of the electric storage device may fall below the predetermined charged capacity lower limit value because the electric energy amount is consumed in advance by the motor running or the assist running, the permission for the motor running or the assist running is withdrawn and, therefore,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> electric failure is avoided even if the expected regenerative energy amount becomes unable to be recovered.

The possibly-traveled running routes are acquired excluding a branch destination having running history equal to or less than a predetermined amount. The possibly-traveled running routes are acquired excluding a branch destination in a direction taken in the case of traveling to the branch destination causing a difference equal to or greater than a predetermined amount from a current vehicle traveling direction. As a result, all the possibly-traveled running routes can be included while excluding from candidates a route having a low probability of running due to a road type of a branched road ahead, a route having a low probability of running due to past running history, and/or a route in a direction that is not an approximate traveling direction, and a calculation load can be reduced when the possibly-traveled running routes are acquired, when a variation characteristic of a charged capacity is subsequently calculated, and when determinations are made in relation to the determination on whether the motor running or the assist running using the consumable amount is permitted.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Preferably, when the motor running or the assist running using a consumable amount is permitted and the motor running or the assist running is being performed, if an actual charged capacity of the electric storage device is close to and within a predetermined capacity difference from the predetermined charged capacity lower limit value, the predetermined charged capacity lower limit value is temporarily made smaller on the condition that the charged capacity subsequently increases in the currently traveling running route. As a result, in a location (running route) essentially having a sufficient probability of subsequent recovery of electric energy, a charged capacity may fall below an existing predetermined charged capacity lower limit value due to variations of running status etc., and control may be provided to forcibly charge the electric storage<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> device, resulting in deterioration of fuel efficiency; however, since the predetermined charged capacity lower limit value is temporarily lowered, the motor running or the assist running is continued and the fuel efficiency can be improved by the subsequent recovery of electric energy.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Preferably, the sections are divided based on a change amount of a road surface gradient and/or a change amount of altitude in addition to the branch points. As a result, a running road acquired from map data is more appropriately divided into a plurality of sections in accordance with a change trend of a charged capacity of the electric storage device.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Preferably, the hybrid vehicle includes an engine and the electric motor as drive power sources for running, and a transmission transmitting at least power from the engine toward drive wheels. The hybrid vehicle may also include a clutch connecting/disconnecting a power transmission path between the engine and the drive wheels. Such a hybrid vehicle can perform the engine running (hybrid running) using at least the engine as the drive power source for running with the clutch engaged if the clutch is included, and the motor running using only the electric motor as the drive power source for running with the clutch released if the clutch is included. During the engine running, the assist running using the electric motor can be performed by adding the power of the electric motor to the power of the engine for running.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Alternatively and preferably, the hybrid vehicle includes a so-called electric continuously variable transmission having a differential mechanism coupled to an engine in a power transmittable manner and a differential electric motor coupled to the differential mechanism in a power transmittable manner such that the differential state of the differential mechanism is controlled by controlling an operating state of the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> differential electric motor, and an electric motor for running coupled to an output rotating member of the electric continuously variable transmission in a power transmittable manner. Therefore, the hybrid vehicle includes an electric continuously variable transmission that includes a differential mechanism distributing the power from the engine to a first electric motor and an output rotating member, and a second electric motor disposed on the output rotating member of the differential mechanism and that mechanically transmits a main portion of the power from the engine toward drive wheels by using a differential action of the differential mechanism while electrically transmitting the remainder of the power from the engine by using an electric path from the first electric motor to the second electric motor, thereby electrically changing a gear ratio.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Preferably, the transmission is made up of a single transmission, a transmission having a hydraulic power transmission device such as a torque converter, or a transmission having a sub-transmission. The transmission is made up of a known planetary gear automatic transmission, a known synchromesh parallel two-shaft manual transmission, a known synchromesh parallel two-shaft automatic transmission, a so-called DCT (Dual Clutch Transmission), i.e., a transmission that is a synchromesh parallel two-shaft automatic transmission of a type having two systems of input shafts, a known belt type continuously variable transmission, a known traction type continuously variable transmission, etc.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Preferably, the clutch connecting/disconnecting the power transmission path between the engine and the drive wheels is implemented by using a wet or dry engagement device.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">An example of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><heading id="h0011">First Example</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a diagram for explaining a general configuration of a power transmission path from an engine 14 to drive wheels 34 making up a hybrid vehicle 10 (hereinafter referred to as a vehicle 10) to which the present invention is applied, and is a diagram for explaining a main portion of a control system disposed on the vehicle 10 for output control of the engine 14 acting as a drive power source for running, shift control of an automatic transmission 18, drive control of an electric motor MG acting as a drive power source for running, running-road sectionalizing control utilizing a navigation system 90, etc.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a vehicle power transmission device 12 (hereinafter referred to as a power transmission device 12) includes an engine connecting/disconnecting clutch K0, the electric motor MG, a torque converter 16, an oil pump 22, the automatic transmission 18, etc., in this order from the engine 14 side in a transmission case 20 (hereinafter referred to as a case 20) acting as a non-rotating member attached to a vehicle body by bolts etc. The power transmission device 12 also includes a propeller shaft 26 coupled to an output shaft 24 that is an output rotating member of the automatic transmission 18, a differential gear device (differential gear) 28 coupled to the propeller shaft 26, a pair of axles 30 coupled to the differential gear device 28, etc. The power transmission device 12 configured as described above is preferably used in the vehicle 10 of the FR (front-engine rear-drive) type, for example. In the power transmission device 12, if the engine connecting/disconnecting clutch K0 is engaged, the power of the engine 14 is transmitted from an engine coupling shaft 32 coupling the engine 14 and the engine connecting/disconnecting clutch K0, sequentially through the engine connecting/disconnecting clutch K0, the torque converter 16, the automatic transmission 18, the propeller shaft 26, the differential gear device 28, a pair of the axles 30, etc., to a<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> pair of the drive wheels 34.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The torque converter 16 is a hydraulic power transmission device transmitting a drive power input to a pump impeller 16a via fluid toward the automatic transmission 18. The pump impeller 16a is coupled sequentially through the engine connecting/disconnecting clutch K0 and the engine coupling shaft 32 to the engine 14 and is an input-side rotating element receiving the input of the drive power from the engine 14 and rotatable around an axial center. A turbine impeller 16b of the torque converter 16 is an output-side rotating element of the torque converter 16 and is relatively non-rotatably coupled to a transmission input shaft 36 that is an input rotating member of the automatic transmission 18 by the spline fitting, etc.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The electric motor MG is a so-called motor generator having a function as a motor generating a mechanical drive power from electric energy and a function of an electric generator generating electric energy from mechanical energy. In other words, the electric motor MG may act as a power source for running driven by electric energy supplied via an inverter 52 from an electric storage device 54 to generate a drive power for running instead of the engine 14 or along with the engine 14. The electric motor MG performs operations such as generating electric energy through regeneration from a drive power generated by the engine 14 or a driven power (mechanical energy) input from the side of the drive wheels 34 to accumulate the electric energy via the inverter 52 into the electric storage device 54. The electric motor MG is operatively coupled to the pump impeller 16a and power is mutually transmitted between the electric motor MG and the pump impeller 16a. Therefore, the electric motor MG is coupled to the transmission input shaft 36 in a power transmittable manner as is the case with the engine 14.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The oil pump 22 is a mechanical oil pump coupled to the pump impeller 16a and<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> rotationally driven by the engine 14 (or the electric motor MG) to generate an operating oil pressure for providing the shift control of the automatic transmission 18, controlling engagement/release of the engine connecting/disconnecting clutch K0, and supplying lubricant oil to the portions of the power transmission path of the vehicle 10.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The engine connecting/disconnecting clutch K0 is a wet multi-plate type hydraulic friction engagement device in which a plurality of friction plates overlapped with each other is pressed by a hydraulic actuator, for example, and is subjected to engagement/release control by a hydraulic control circuit 50 disposed in the power transmission device 12 by using an oil pressure generated by the oil pump 22 as an original pressure. In the engagement/release control, a power-transmittable torque capacity of the engine connecting/disconnecting clutch K0, i.e., an engagement force of the engine connecting/disconnecting clutch K0 is varied, for example, continuously, through pressure adjustment of a linear solenoid valve etc., in the hydraulic control circuit 50. The engine connecting/disconnecting clutch K0 includes a pair of clutch rotating members (a clutch hub and a clutch drum) relatively rotatable in the released state thereof and one of the clutch rotating members (the clutch hub) is relatively non-rotatably coupled to the engine coupling shaft 32 while the other clutch rotating member (the clutch drum) is relatively non-rotatably coupled to the pump impeller 16a of the torque converter 16. Because of such a configuration, the engine connecting/disconnecting clutch K0 rotates the pump impeller 16a integrally with the engine 14 via the engine coupling shaft 32 in the engaged state. Therefore, in the engaged state of the engine connecting/disconnecting clutch K0, the drive power from the engine 14 is input to the pump impeller 16a. On the other hand, in the released state of the engine connecting/disconnecting clutch K0, the power transmission between the pump impeller 16a and the engine 14 is interrupted. Since the electric motor MG is operatively coupled to the pump impeller 16a as described above, the engine connecting/disconnecting clutch<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> K0 acts as a clutch connecting/disconnecting the power transmission path between the engine 14 and the electric motor MG</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The automatic transmission 18 is coupled to the electric motor MG in a power transmittable manner without passing through the engine connecting/disconnecting clutch K0 to make up a portion of the power transmission path from the engine 14 to the drive wheels 34 and transmits the power from the drive power source for running (the engine 14 and the electric motor MG) toward the drive wheels 34. The automatic transmission 18 is a planetary-gear type multistage transmission acting as a stepped automatic transmission shifted to selectively establish a plurality of shift stages (gear stages) by switching any of a plurality of hydraulic friction engagement devices such as a clutch C and a brake B to be gripped (i.e., by engagement and release of the hydraulic friction engagement devices), for example. Therefore, the automatic transmission 18 is a stepped transmission performing a so-called clutch-to-clutch shift frequently used in known vehicles and changes the speed of the rotation of the transmission input shaft 36 to output the rotation from the output shaft 24. The transmission input shaft 36 is a turbine shaft rotationally driven by the turbine impeller 16b of the torque converter 16. The automatic transmission 18 has a predetermined gear stage (shift stage) established depending on accelerator operation of a driver, a vehicle speed V, etc., through the engagement/release control of each of the clutch C and the brake B.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The navigation system 90 includes a storage medium 92 such as a CD-ROM, a DVD-ROM, and an HDD (hard disk drive), for example, and has a function of providing known navigation control by using a road map database (hereinafter referred to as map data) stored in the storage medium 92. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a conceptual diagram of an example of the map data stored in the storage medium 92.

Although the map data such as nodes, link IDs, and running road information stored in the storage medium 92 is, for example, normally non-rewritable fixed information, the map data can be updated by replacing the medium such as a CD-ROM and a DVD-ROM or by rewriting contents of an HDD by using update software.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Returning to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the vehicle 10 includes an electronic control device 100 including a control device related to hybrid drive control, for example.

For example, the electronic control device 100 provides the output control of the engine 14, the drive control of the electric motor MG including regenerative control of the electric motor MG, the shift control of the automatic transmission 18, the torque capacity control of the engine connecting/disconnecting clutch K0, etc., and is configured separately for the engine control, the electric motor control, the hydraulic control (shift control), etc., as needed.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The electronic control device 100 is supplied with, for example, a signal indicative of an engine rotation speed N<sub>E</sub> that is the rotation speed of the engine 14<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> detected by an engine rotation speed sensor 56; a signal indicative of a turbine rotation speed N<sub>T</sub> of the torque converter 16 as an input rotation speed of the automatic transmission 18 detected by a turbine rotation speed sensor 58, i.e., a transmission input rotation speed N<sub>IN</sub> that is the rotation speed of the transmission input shaft 36; a signal indicative of a transmission output rotation speed N<sub>OUT</sub> that is the rotation speed of the output shaft 24 corresponding to the vehicle speed V or a rotation speed of the propeller shaft 26 as a vehicle speed related value detected by an output shaft rotation speed sensor 60; a signal indicative of an electric motor rotation speed N<sub>MG</sub> that is the rotation speed of the electric motor MG detected by an electric motor rotation speed sensor 62; a signal indicative of a throttle valve opening degree θ<sub>TH</sub> that is an opening degree of an electronic throttle valve not depicted detected by a throttle sensor 64; a signal indicative of an intake air amount Q<sub>AIR</sub> of the engine 14 detected by an intake air amount sensor 66; a signal indicative of longitudinal acceleration G (or longitudinal deceleration G) of the vehicle 10 detected by an acceleration sensor 68; a signal indicative of a cooling water temperature TH<sub>W</sub> of the engine 14 detected by a cooling water temperature sensor 70; a signal indicative of an oil temperature TH<sub>OIL</sub> of the operating oil in the hydraulic control circuit 50 detected by an oil temperature sensor 72; a signal indicative of an accelerator opening degree Acc that is an operation amount of an accelerator pedal 76 as a drive power request amount (driver request output) for the vehicle 10 from a driver detected by an accelerator opening degree sensor 74; a signal indicative of a brake operation amount Bra that is an operation amount of a brake pedal 80 as a braking power request amount (driver request deceleration) for the vehicle 10 from a driver detected by a foot brake sensor 78; a signal indicative of a lever position (a shift operation position, a shift position, an operation position) P<sub>SH</sub> of a shift lever 84, such as known "P", "N", "D", "R", and "S" positions, detected by a shift position sensor 82; signals indicative of a battery temperature TH<sub>BAT</sub>, a battery input/output current (battery charging/discharging current) I<sub>BAT</sub>, and a battery voltage V<sub>BAT</sub> of the electric storage device 54 detected by a battery<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> sensor 86; and a car navigation information signal Snavi indicative of map data from the navigation system 30 mounted on the vehicle 10.

However, the occurrence of the running state enabling the recovery of the regenerative energy cannot be known in advance unless one running route is specified.

As a result, the variation characteristic of the charged capacity SOC is appropriately calculated for each of the possibly-traveled running routes to appropriately determine from the variation characteristic of the charged capacity SOC whether the possibly-traveled running routes include at least one running route in which the electric energy can be recovered to the extent exceeding the management width upper limit value<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> of the charged capacity SOC and to appropriately determine from the variation characteristic of the charged capacity SOC whether the charged capacity SOC lower than the management width lower limit value is avoided in all the possibly-traveled running routes even if the electric energy exceeding the management width upper limit value is consumed before the recovery.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">From another viewpoint, when the possibly-traveled running routes may be made up of sections with the charged capacity change amount ΔSOC stored, if the running is consequently performed in a section other than the sections with the charged capacity change amount ΔSOC stored, the permission for the EV running or the assist running is withdrawn.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Although the charged capacity change amount ΔSOC in a certain section is acquired as an actual measurement value based on the charged capacity SOC in the examples, this is not a limitation. For example, an integrated value of running energy (=(potential energy mgh + running resistance Cd × projected area A × vehicle speed V<sup>2</sup> + rolling resistance)× charge efficiency η, where m is vehicle weight; g is gravitational acceleration; and h is difference in elevation) in a certain section may be calculated as the charged capacity change amount ΔSOC. Therefore, an estimated charged capacity change amount ΔSOC of a section without past running history and the charged capacity change amount ΔSOC stored may be calculated as an integrated value of the running energy. However, since the vehicle speed V is necessary for the calculation of the running energy, for example, the legal speed or other similar average vehicle speed of a road type in the section is used as the vehicle speed V.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">Although the three determination conditions for excluding the branch destinations (steps S120, S 140, and S160) are the OR conditions in the flowchart of <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref><!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> in the examples, the conditions may be the AND conditions.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Although the permission for the EV running or the assist running is withdrawn if the running is performed in a route other than the possibly-traveled running routes in the third embodiments, this is not a limitation and, for example, if electric energy cannot be recovered as expected for some reason, the permission for the EV running or the assist running may be withdrawn. Even in this case, electric failure is appropriately avoided.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">The above description is merely an embodiment and the present invention may be implemented in variously modified and improved forms based on the knowledge of those skilled in the art.</p><heading id="h0014">NOMENCLATURE OF ELEMENTS</heading><p id="p0083" num="0083">10: hybrid vehicle 14: engine (drive power source for running) 54: electric storage device 100: electronic control device (control device) MG: electric motor (drive power source for running)</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977116" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A control device of a hybrid vehicle including a plurality of drive power sources for running including an electric motor driven by electric energy of an electric storage device, the hybrid vehicle configured to perform motor running or assist running using the electric motor for running, <b>characterized in that</b><br/>
