The air spring apparatus includes a diaphragm that has an upper member, a lower member, and a cylindrical membrane member having both open end sections connected to both members and sealed therewith. Furthermore, a sliding surface is formed on a lower surface of the upper member. The lower member is equipped with a slide plate with which the sliding surface of the upper member comes into contact in an exhaust state in which the interior of the diaphragm is exhausted, and a support section that supports the slide plate from the lower side thereof. The slide plate is formed of a resin material so as to reduce a coefficient of friction between the slide plate and the sliding surface, and is fixed to the upper surface of the support section by bonding.<br/>

In addition, in order to suppress peeling of the slide plate from the support section, integrally forming the slide plate and the support section of the same resin material may be considered. However, in this case, compared to a case in which the support section is formed of a metallic material, strength becomes weak or creeping tends to occur, which may affect durability of the lower member.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An aspect of the present invention was made in view of the above-mentioned circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide an air spring apparatus which is capable of suppressing the contact section from being detached from the support section.</p><heading id="h0007">[Solution to Problem]</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to achieve the aforementioned objects, the present invention suggests the following means.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> -->An air spring apparatus according to a first aspect of the present invention includes a diaphragm that has an upper member, a lower member, and a cylindrical membrane member having both open end sections connected to both the upper and lower members and sealed therewith, the upper member and the lower member being provided with contact sections that slidably come into contact with each other in an exhaust state in which the interior of the diaphragm is exhausted, wherein at least one of the upper member and the lower member having the contact sections, which are formed of a resin material, includes a support section that supports the contact section from the exterior of the diaphragm disposed in an axial line direction, and an engaging section that is provided in the contact section and controls respective relative movements of the contact section with respect to the support section in each of the axial line direction and the radial direction by being engaged with an engagement section that is provided in the support section.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the present invention, the engaging section is provided in the contact section that is supported by the support section. For this reason, the engaging section is engaged with the engagement section, which makes it possible to control each relative movement of the contact sections with respect to the support section in the axial line direction and the radial direction. Furthermore, it is possible to suppress the contact sections formed of a resin material supported by the support section from being detached from the support section when the contact sections slide in the mutual contact state.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">By providing the engaging section in the contact section, it is possible to separately form the contact section and the support section while suppressing the contact section from being detached from the support section. Accordingly, for example, by<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> forming the support section of a metallic material, durability of the lower member can be easily secured.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Furthermore, at least one contact section of the upper member and the lower member is formed of a resin material. Thus, for example, by adopting a material having a smaller coefficient of friction than a material that forms the support section as a resin material that forms the contact section, the coefficient of friction between the contact sections can be effectively reduced.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Furthermore, the engaging section may be integrally provided in the contact section of the same resin material as the contact section provided with the engaging section.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In this case, the engaging section is integrally formed with the contact section of the same resin material as the contact section provided with the engaging section. Accordingly, a connected body of the engaging section and the contact section can be integrally molded, for example, by injection molding or the like, and can be easily formed.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Moreover, the connected body can be integrally formed by the injection molding. Accordingly, when the connected body is molded, for example, by adopting insert molding in which the resin material is injected into a metal mold to mold the connector in a state in which the support section is disposed inside a metal mold, the engaging section can be engaged with the engagement section while forming the connected body. As a result, manufacturing work of the air spring apparatus can be simplified.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Moreover, when the connected body is molded by the insert molding as mentioned above, it is possible to bring the connected body into close contact with the support section. As a result, it is possible to effectively suppress the contact section from being detached from the support section.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Furthermore, the engagement section may be formed on an outer circumferential surface of the support section in a groove shape. Furthermore, the engaging section may include a cylindrical section that extends toward the exterior of the diaphragm disposed in the axial line direction from an outer circumferential edge of the contact section and is externally fitted to the support section, and a protrusion section that protrudes on an inner circumferential surface of the cylindrical section and is disposed in the engagement section.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In this case, since the cylindrical section of the engaging section is externally fitted to the support section, the relative movement in the radial direction between the contact section and the support section can be controlled by the contact between the inner circumferential surface of the cylindrical section and the outer circumferential surface of the support section.<br/>
Furthermore, since the protrusion section of the engaging section is disposed in the engagement section, the relative movement in the axial line direction between the contact section and the support section can be controlled by the contact between the protrusion section and the inner surface of the engagement section.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The cylindrical section extends toward the exterior of the diaphragm in the axial<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> line direction from the outer circumferential edge of the contact section. For this reason, as described above, the relative movement in the axial line direction between the contact section and the support section is controlled by the contact between the protrusion section and the inner surface of the engagement section, which makes it possible to suppress an outer circumferential side portion including the outer circumferential edge in the contact section from bending backward toward the interior of the diaphragm in the axial line direction.<br/>
In addition, both contact sections repeatedly slide in the mutual contact state, and thus the outer circumferential side portion of the contact section formed of a resin material easily bends backward. For this reason, the above-mentioned working effects can be greatly increased.</p><heading id="h0008">[Advantageous Effects of Invention]</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to the air spring apparatus related to a first aspect of the present invention, it is possible to suppress the contact section from being detached from the support section.</p><heading id="h0009">[Brief Description of Drawings]</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of an air spring apparatus related to an embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a top view of a plate-like base section that forms the air spring apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of an exhaust state in which the interior of the diaphragm is exhausted in the air spring apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010">[Description of Embodiments]</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --><p id="p0019" num="0019">Hereinafter, an air spring apparatus related to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.<br/>
As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, an air spring apparatus 1 includes a diaphragm 5 that includes an upper surface plate (an upper member) 2, a lower surface plate (a lower member) 3, and a cylindrical membrane member 4 having open end sections 4a and 4b connected to the surface plates 2 and 3 and sealed therewith, and an intermediate portion 4c located between the open end sections 4a and 4b bulges toward the exterior in the radial direction, and an auxiliary elastic body 6 that is connected to the lower surface plate 3 of the diaphragm 5. The air spring apparatus 1 is provided, for example, between a body and a carriage (not shown) of a railroad vehicle or the like.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The auxiliary elastic body 6 is formed in a cylindrical shape, and respective central axial lines of the upper surface plate 2, the lower surface plate 3, the cylindrical membrane member 4, and the auxiliary elastic body 6 are located on a common axial line.<br/>
Hereinbelow, the common axis is assumed to be an axial line O, the upper surface plate 2 side along the axial line O is assumed to be an upper side, the lower surface plate 3 side is assumed to be a lower side, a direction perpendicular to the axial line O is assumed to be a radial direction, and a direction rotating around the axial line O is assumed to be a circumferential direction.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Spring constants of the auxiliary elastic body 6 in each of the axial line O direction and the radial direction are higher than those of the diaphragm 5 in which a gas such as air is filled. In the present embodiment, the auxiliary elastic body 6 is<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> constituted by laminated rubber that includes an annular lower board 7, an annular upper board 8, and an annular rubber plate 9 and an annular metallic plate 10 that are alternately disposed in the axial line O direction between the boards 7 and 8. The lower board 7, the upper board 8, the rubber plate 9, and the metallic plate 10 are disposed coaxially with the axial line O. The lower board 7, the upper board 8, the metallic plate 10 and the rubber plate 9 are affixed by vulcanization.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, among outer diameters of each member that constitutes the auxiliary elastic body 6, an outer diameter of the upper board 8 is the greatest, and the outer circumferential edge section of the upper board 8 protrudes outward in the radial direction.<br/>
Additionally, among inner diameters of each member that constitutes the auxiliary elastic body 6, the inner diameter of the lower board 7 is the smallest, and the inner circumferential edge section of the lower board 7 protrudes inward in the radial direction.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Moreover, a communication cylinder section 7a, the interior of which is opened toward both sides in the axial line O direction to communicate with the interior of the auxiliary elastic body 6, is fitted into the lower board 7. Air supplying member, an auxiliary tank or the like (not shown) for supplying and discharging the gas such as air into and from the diaphragm 5 is hermetically connected to a portion that protrudes downward from the lower board 7 in the communication cylinder section 7a.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The lower surface plate 3 of the diaphragm 5 includes a resin plate section (contact section) 11 formed of a resin material, and a support section 12 that supports the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> resin plate section 11 from the lower side (the exterior of the diaphragm disposed in the axial line direction). The resin plate section 11 and the support section 12 are disposed coaxially with the axial line O.<br/>
The support section 12 is formed of, for example, a metallic material or the like. In the present embodiment, the support section 12 is configured so that a large-diameter portion 12a and a small-diameter portion 12b disposed coaxially with the axial line O are connected to each other from the lower side (the exterior) in the axial line O direction in this sequence. An outer diameter of the large-diameter portion 12a of the support section 12 is smaller than an outer diameter of the upper board 8 of the auxiliary elastic body 6.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Furthermore, the support section 12 is fixed to the upper board 8 of the auxiliary elastic body 6 by a fixing bolt 13.
