In this case, it is desired to maintain an equal pump output as the conventional pump output despite the installation of the small-output engine. For the maintenance of such an equal pump output as the conventional pump output even when such a small-output engine is installed, it may hence be contemplated to set the pipe diameter larger to reduce the pressure loss in a piping system more than before and also to make larger the control valve unit to be connected to piping. Described specifically, with a view to providing compact excavators of different models in the same family with equal pump output, it may be contemplated to arrange the same control valve unit (hereinafter called "the first control valve unit") as before when an engine of equal power output as before is installed but to arrange a control valve unit (hereinafter called "the second control valve unit") larger than the first control valve unit when a small-output engine is installed.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Now assume that compact excavators of different models in the same family are to be provided with the small first control valve unit and the large second control valve unit, respectively. It is then necessary to provide the first control valve unit and second control valve unit with different brackets of different shapes and dimensions,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> respectively, when the above-mentioned contemplation of the conventional technology is adopted. Problems, therefore, arise in that the number of kinds of parts or components increases and the manufacturing cost becomes high, both compared with before, when the manufacture of compact excavators of different models in the same family is taken into consideration.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">When the above-mentioned contemplation of the conventional technology is adopted, the barycentric position of the bracket with the small first control valve unit mounted thereon and the barycentric position of the bracket with the large second control valve unit mounted thereon differ from each other, and as a result, a need arises for both of hanging members for hanging up and down the bracket with the first control valve unit mounted thereon and other hanging members for hanging up and down the bracket with the second control valve unit mounted thereon. As a consequence, when the manufacture of compact excavators of different models in the same family is taken into consideration, the workability of the mounting work of control valve units is lowered than before. Further, an increased number of kinds of hanging members have to be provided, thereby raising a problem that the manufacturing cost becomes higher than before.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">With the above-mentioned actual situation of the conventional technology in view, the present invention has as an object thereof the provision of a mount structure for a control valve unit on a construction machine, which<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> makes it possible to selectively mount a small first control valve unit or a large second control valve unit on the body of each of construction machines of different models in the same family without incurring an increase in the number of kinds of parts or components.</p><heading id="h0007"><b>Means for Solving the Problem</b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">To achievethis object, the present inventionprovides a mount structure for a control valve unit on a construction machine having working equipment, a body with the working equipment attached thereto,a hydraulic actuator for driving the working equipment and a hydraulic actuator for driving the body, and the control valve unit comprised of plural directional control valves arranged side by side for controlling the hydraulic actuators, respectively, said mount structure having a bracket for mounting the control valve unit thereon and being to be fixed on the body, wherein the control valve unit comprises a first control valve unit, and a second control valve unit having plural directional control valves set at a greater arrangement pitch than an arrangement pitch of plural directional control valves included in the first control valve unit and formed larger than the first control valve unit, the bracket has a pair of hanging-member fixing portions and is used to mount thereon only one of the first control valve unit and second control valve unit although the first control valve unit and the second control valve unit can each be mounted on the bracket, and upon mounting the one of the first control valve unit and second control valve unit on the bracket,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the one of the first control valve unit and second control valve unit is mounted on the bracket such that a barycentric position of the bracket with the first control valve unit mounted thereon and a barycentric position of the bracket with the second control valve unit mounted thereon are located on an imaginary line that connects the paired hanging-member fixing portions with each other.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the present invention constructed as described above, the small first control valve unit and the large second control valve unit can each be mounted on the bracket.
