Such shear webs are positioned on a first open shell of the blade with a first side of the web adhered to a central main laminate of the blade shell, with the second blade shell positioned above and adhered to a second side of the shear web. One of the challenges in wind turbine construction is ensuring a secure bond between the shear web and the blade shells. In addition, the continuous shear webs add considerably to the weight of the wind turbine blade.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US7891949B"><text>US 7,891,949</text></patcit> describes a wind turbine blade having an internal structure having an array of transverse rib bulkheads with supporting spar members. The rib bulkheads define the airfoil profile of the blade, and provide support to an external skin of the blade. However, such a construction is relatively complicated, requiring an array of interconnections between various rib bulkheads, spar members, and skin panels. In addition, the interior of the wind turbine blade is obstructed by the presence of the transverse bulkheads, preventing any effective internal inspection of the blade interior.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a wind turbine blade construction which has reduced weight, is relatively easier to manufacture, and has generally improved performance compared to prior art systems.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Accordingly, there is provided a wind turbine blade comprising an airfoil body formed from a blade shell element, the airfoil body having an upper suction-side surface and a lower pressure-side surface, a leading edge and a trailing edge, and a root end for<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> mounting to a wind turbine hub and a distal tip end, the wind turbine blade further comprising at least one inner truss element provided within the interior of said blade shell element, said at least one inner truss element extending between the pressure-side surface and the suction-side surface of said blade shell element,<br/>

In addition, the absence of any transverse rib bulkheads in the blade interior allows for lighter structure, as well as allowing for easier inspection of the blade interior from the root end. The open internal structure also allows for relatively easier drainage or removal of any undesired substances from the blade interior, e.g. water, dirt, waste materials from the manufacturing process, as such material can pass unimpeded to the base of the blade at the root end.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Preferably, said at least one inner truss element comprises an upper rail provided at said suction-side surface of said blade shell element and a lower rail provided at said pressure-side surface, and a plurality of rods extending diagonally between said upper rail and said lower rail.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Arranging the rods of the truss element in a diagonal direction provides an improved bracing effect of the truss, allowing the truss element to better resist forces experienced by the wind turbine blade.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Preferably, said rods extend between said upper rail and said lower rail at an angle to said upper and lower rails of between 30-60 degrees, preferably approximately 45 degrees.

The blade 10 comprises a leading edge 18 facing the direction of rotation of the blade 10, when the blade is mounted on the hub, and a trailing edge 20 facing the opposite direction of the leading edge 18.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The airfoil region 34 (also called the profiled region) has an ideal or almost ideal blade shape with respect to generating lift, whereas the root region 30 due to structural considerations has a substantially circular or elliptical cross-section, which for instance makes it easier and safer to mount the blade 10 to the hub. The diameter (or the chord) of the root region 30 is typically constant along the entire root area 30. The transition region 32 has a transitional profile 42 gradually changing from the circular or elliptical shape of the root region 30 to the airfoil profile 50, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, of the airfoil region 34.

The airfoil 50 has a chord 60 with a chord length c extending between a leading edge 56 and a trailing edge 58 of the blade. The airfoil 50 has a thickness t, which is defined as the distance between the pressure side 52 and the suction side 54. The thickness t of the airfoil varies along the chord 60. The deviation from a symmetrical profile is given by a camber line 62, which is a median line through the airfoil profile 50. The median line can be found by drawing inscribed circles from the leading edge 56 to the trailing edge 58. The median line follows the centres of these inscribed circles and the deviation or distance from the chord 60 is called the camber<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> f.

In preferred techniques, the wind turbine blade is assembled from at least one shell member substantially forming an upwind or pressure-side surface of a wind turbine blade profile, and at least one shell member substantially forming a downwind or suction-side surface of a wind turbine blade profile. The invention is described in terms of such wind turbine blade constructions having upwind and downwind shell members, but it will be understood that the invention may equally apply to other general blade manufacturing techniques, e.g. wherein a blade is constructed from assembly of at least one shell for a blade leading edge and at least one shell for a blade trailing edge.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> illustrates a shell 70 of a wind turbine blade 10 according to the invention, wherein a pair of inner truss elements 72 are arranged on an internal surface of the shell 70.

The truss elements 72 may be constructed separate to the moulding and curing of said blade shell 70, the constructed truss elements 72 then positioned in the shell 70 substantially along the length of the shell 70, wherein the lower rails 76a,76b are adhered or bonded to the internal surface of the shell 70, to secure the truss elements 72 to the blade shell 70. A second wind turbine blade shell<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> (not shown) is provided from a parallel moulding and curing process, which can then be positioned above the first shell 70 and the truss elements 72, to close the shells to form a wind turbine blade 10. In this regard, the upper rails 74a,74b of the truss elements 72 are adhered or bonded to the inner surface of the second shell, to ensure that the truss elements 72 extend between and are securely attached to the inner surfaces of the opposed shells.

Accordingly, the truss elements 72 including the attached spar cap may be bonded to the interior of the blade shell 70.
