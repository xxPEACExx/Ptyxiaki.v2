Much of interaction with market trading systems is carried out by market </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">participants, such as brokers, who are arranged to receive orders from clients wishing to trade on the market exchange, process the orders to ensure that they are in the correct<sup>'</sup> form, and transmit them onto the market exchange so that the orders can be transacted. In many jurisdictions, clients are not allowed to directly trade on the market exchange themselves, and must access the exchange via a licensed market participant such as a broker. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Nowadays, much market trading is done electronically. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Brokers receive, via their "market access systems", client orders electronically from client computers, and </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">electronically forward those orders (after processing) to the market exchange. The market exchange is usually an automated exchange, such as an electronic securities exchange, arranged to receive specific trade requests, such as buy or sell orders for securities, stocks and other listed instruments (bonds, derivatives, etc) . Each individual broker may have multiple clients who may wish to trade. The clients may wish to make many orders within 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
a short period of time. This can lead to large volumes of orders from multiple clients, requiring processing and transmission to the market exchange. In market trading, the speed of processing of orders by the broker (and also by the exchange) is extremely important . Two important factors in executing a trade are Price Priority and Time Priority. Price Priority means that the person who wishes to sell at the lowest price or wishes to buy at the highest price will be given priority in trade . Time Priority means that where there are two sellers or two buyers at the same price then the buyer or seller that reaches the market exchange first will </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">(usually) execute first. Speed of processing is therefore critical. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A broker's clients will therefore desire that their order be processed and transmitted to the exchange with the least amount of delay (latency) possible. Hence the combination of a large number of client orders arriving simultaneously and client desire for timely order </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">processing and retransmission require that the broker invest in information technology infrastructure in order to provide order processing latency and throughput acceptable to the clients. Latency refers to the delay a client's order is subjected to while it is being processed and retransmitted into the exchange by the broker. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Throughput refers to the rate at which orders can be received from clients and the rate at which processed orders can be submitted to the exchange. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">If -the latency of a broker's system is too large, client orders will be late, and the broker's client risks missing preferred trading opportunities. Similarly, if the throughput of the broker's market access · system is insufficient for the volume of orders being submitted by that broker's clients at any particular time, client 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
orders will be delayed or discarded as they are queued for processing within the broker's market access system, with potential negative consequences for each client's trades. In either case (unacceptably high latency or unacceptably low throughput) , the broker will be at a competitive disadvantage . </p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Currently, market access systems (for brokers and other market participants) are based on general purpose </p><p id="p0016" num="0016">computing systems (GPCs) , and typically executed on general purpose operating systems. The modular and layered nature of GPCs and the serial nature of order processing necessarily imposed by GPCs introduces </p><p id="p0017" num="0017">latencies into order processing in the hundreds of microseconds at least, and typically milliseconds. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with a first aspect, the present invention provides a market access system for transmitting market orders to a market exchange, comprising dedicated hardware arranged to receive and process client orders from clients, for forwarding to the market exchange. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019"> -</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In embodiments, the dedicated hardware may be a </p><p id="p0021" num="0021">programmable logic device, such as a field programmable logic device, programmed for processing client orders. In an embodiment, the dedicated hardware may be an integrated circuit, such as a bespoke integrated circuit designed for processing client orders. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022">An advantage of at least embodiments of the invention is that dedicated hardware can process client orders at much faster speeds than GPCs. Latencies may be achieved in the low orders of microseconds and even nanoseconds. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
In an embodiment, the dedicated hardware comprises an order processing engine arranged to process the client orders. The processing may comprise validation of client orders according to predetermined criteria. This may include determining if the incoming order message- is not corrupted, is not in error, and can be successfully decoded into a valid client order. It may include confirming that the order can be executed by the broker, for example by confirming that the order makes logical sense, and complies with risk limits, rules and </p><p id="p0023" num="0023">regulations laid down by the client, by the broker, by the exchange, or by any other regulatory authority. In an embodiment, the order processing engine is arranged to, wherever necessary, transform the client order so that it is in a format recognized by the exchange. </p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In an embodiment, a client order may comprise a plurality of portions, e.g. comprising a plurality of words. In an embodiment, the dedicated hardware is arranged to carry out processing on portions of an order as other portions of the order are still being received or are yet to be received. This has the advantage that processing speed is increased, as, unlike the case with GPC processing, it is not necessary to wait for the entire client order to be received before commencing processing. </p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In an embodiment, the dedicated hardware comprises a plurality of order processing engines, each arranged to process a corresponding plurality of orders in parallel. This has the advantage of further increasing the speed of processing. In an embodiment, each processing engine operates independently and concurrently with the other processing engines. In an embodiment, there are many order processing engines, resulting in massive parallel processing. This may be designed to result in very low latencies. In an embodiment there may be thousands of order processing engines. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
In an embodiment, the dedicated hardware further comprises a transmit management arrangement which is arranged to receive orders that have been processed, for transmission to the market exchange. In an embodiment, the transmit management arrangement is arranged to order the processed orders in accordance with predetermined rules, for example predetermined business rules. For example, the transmit management arrangement may order the processed orders to prioritise clients over broker internal orders. </p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In an embodiment, the transmit management arrangement is arranged to start transmission of client orders before processing of the client orders has been completed. </p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Portions of orders may be transmitted to the exchange while other portions of the same orders are still being processed. Advantageously, this further increases processing speed. In an embodiment, the transmit management arrangement is arranged to receive a plurality of processed orders in parallel, and to arrange them so that they may be </p><p id="p0028" num="0028">transmitted sequentially. At least embodiments of the present invention have the advantage that the market access system exhibits low latencies and high throughput. </p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In accordance with a second aspect, the present invention provides a method of dealing with orders for transactions in a market exchange, comprising the steps of receiving the orders and processing them at hardware or close to hardware speeds, and transmitting the processed orders onto the market exchange . </p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In accordance with a third aspect, the present invention provides a transmitter for a market access system for

An advantage of using a dedicated hardware device is that the overall processing architecture of the DMA can be optimized for efficient processing. Further, the parallel order engines facilitate rapid processing of multiple orders at once. These aspects facilitate greatly reduced latencies compared with GPC-based architectures. Another advantage includes ease of deployment in operational environments, such as a brokerage house, or implementation as a portable device. Another aspect of each order processing engine 8A to 8x in this embodiment is that they are arranged to process a portion or portions of client orders as another portion or portions are being received or are yet to be received. </p><p id="p0073" num="0073">The client order will generally comprise a plurality of instructions and data (usually in the form of digital words) arranged together in an order message. </p><p id="p0074" num="0074">Instructions/data located early in the message can be validated and processed by an order processing engine 8A to 8x in this embodiment, before subsequent words have been received. It will be appreciated that this operation differs from the traditional "store and forward" approach of network communications equipment whereby an entire message must be received before it is processed and/or validated. This improvement results in further reducing order processing time and hence further reducing order latency, and also increasing throughput. This provides the broker a competitive advantage with respect to other

brokers with prior art systems, and a consequent </p><p id="p0075" num="0075">competitive advantage to clients wishing to trade on the exchange 5. Referring to Figure 2, each order processing engine 8A to 8x is directly attached to an outgoing message queue 9A to 9x. Once an order message has been processed by an order processing engine 8A to 8x, the output of the processing engine will be temporarily stored in the attached outgoing message queues 9A to 9x. Each outgoing message queue might be implemented within a programmable logic device using a construct known as "Dual-Port RAM" (or "DP RAM") . </p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Referring to Figure 2, a transmit management arrangement 10 is used to temporarily store order messages received from the outgoing message queues 9A to 9x and also to process them into a particular order, depending upon predetermined criteria which may include business rules. The orders are stored until they are transmitted towards the exchange 5 via physical layer interface PHY 11 and dedicated telecommunications link 4. In this embodiment, the management functionality associated with the transmit buffer 10 is responsible for taking processed client orders from each outgoing message queue 9A to 9x and arranging them according to a defined priority scheme.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">They are then copied into the transmit buffer in order to be transmitted towards the exchange. The priority scheme may treat particular types of orders with higher priority than other types of orders. Any criteria may be applied.

are only stored in the transmit buffer 10 if the combined rate of client orders arriving from all clients exceeds the capacity of the buffer exchange link 4 to transmit them . </p><p id="p0079" num="0079">In other words, this allows portions of order messages to be processed and transmitted "on 'the fly" as other portions of the message are still being processed.

This may result in the early portion of a client order being transmitted towards the exchange while the latter portion of the order message is still being processed by an order processing engine. </p><p id="p0081" num="0081">The transmit PHY 11 is a component of the process of transmitting the order message along the broker exchange telecommunication link 11.

In this embodiment, the transmit buffer module 10 is also implemented in the programmable hardware device. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="15"/>-->
In one example, the function of aggregating the orders is arranged to combine certain order information into a suitable combination which will result in a more effective or profitable execution by the exchange 5. For example, where multiple orders from different clients relate to a specific security or stock, the order information received from the different clients may be combined to form a single order to minimize costs to execute the transaction or to increase the speed of the transaction. Other more complex rules can be implemented as part of this </p><p id="p0084" num="0084">aggregation function including, but not limited to, recognition of hedging, risk assessment, index or indices tracking or exploitation of arbitrage opportunities. Referring to Figure 3, a flow diagram of the operation of an embodiment of the DMA 3 is shown. Multiple clients are connecting via telecommunications link 2A to 2x (WAN, LAN or telephone) . The clients 1A to lx may submit their desired trade requests to the broker to arrange for their requests to be executed by the securities exchange 5 (step 301} . </p><p id="p0085" num="0085">At step 302, each physical layer interface 6A to 6x connects to each individual client and operates </p><p id="p0086" num="0086">concurrently to convert the physical signals of the client's order into a suitable format for input into the programmable hardware device 7. </p><p id="p0087" num="0087">Once the conversion step 302 is completed, the order is then processed by each processing engine 8A to 8x (304) to validate the order for correctness and compliance with regulations. If the processing engines 8A to 8x deem the received trade information as valid, the processing · engines 8A to 8x proceed to recode (306) the trade information into a suitable data format for the exchange 5.

After the recoding process.
