Indeed, since wood and cob have a low fire resistance, man has developed alternative building materials mainly made of mineral materials such as stones, clay bricks, concrete, and mineral wools that are less combustible. However, the carbon footprint of such structures is high, on the one hand due to the energy needed for the production of such materials (such as cements, bricks, blocks, rock wools), and on the other hand due to the energy cost of transporting such reputedly heavy and dense materials from their production sites to the building sites where they are used.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">By signing the Kyoto agreements, many countries are committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions by a factor of four between now and 2050. Thus, for example, European Directives henceforth impose energy consumption limits on new buildings. These energy consumption limits take into account the entire life cycle of the building: namely, the energy for producing the building materials, the energy for transporting them, the energy for assembling them, the energy consumption for heating (winter) and cooling (summer) the premises, the energy for the demolition of the building and the treatment and transport of the corresponding waste.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Thus, there are many architects and building designers who wish to use greater quantities of novel building materials comprising fibres of natural origin within the context of sustainable development. Indeed, these novel materials have an intrinsic carbon dioxide storage capacity since they are made up of a high percentage of organic matter. Moreover, these novel materials generally use little energy for their manufacture, they are light, they have a low heat capacity and they can have excellent thermal or sound insulation properties when they are used in a sufficient thickness. Their energy balance and their greenhouse gas footprint, per square meter built, are thus highly favourable over the life cycle of the building.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">However, their combustible property is a curb on their use for obvious reasons of occupational safety of the premises, and their biodegradable property, attractive for the sustainable development aspect, poses serious problems with respect to the sensitivity of these materials to attacks by parasites and moulds which often result in an accelerated degradation of the structure.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Moreover, the occupation of these building by people or animals also requires a neutrality of the materials used with respect to the allergy risks or health risks promoted for example by fungi, acarids and parasites such as fleas or ticks.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A large number of treatments are proposed in order to fireproof these novel materials comprising natural fibres. Mention may for example be made of: brominated compounds (such as polybrominated aromatic compounds, in particular decabromodiphenyl ether and tetrabromobisphenol), compounds based on boron salts (such as borates and in particular the hydrated salts of boric acid), phosphorus-containing compounds (such as, in particular, zinc phosphate, ammonium phosphate, and magnesium, zinc or zirconium polyphosphonates), nitrogen-containing compounds (such as ammonium sulphates and ammonium halides), salts of metal (aluminium, antimony, zinc) compounds.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4182681A"><text>US4182681</text></patcit> discloses a fire retardant composition in powder form consisting mainly of alkaline compounds such as borax (hydrated Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) 43 w. % base of boric acid, Ammonium sulphate ((NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) 31w.%, Aluminium sulphate (Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) 19 w.%, alkaline Sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) 4 w%, Silica gel 1.3 w.%.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US2009320717A"><text>US2009/320717</text></patcit> discloses an alkaline fire retardant composition comprising a carbonate salt which is alkaline and one additional salt such as Borax (Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O) which is also alkaline.

These substances have the drawback of being neurotoxic both to parasites and to humans. These compounds should therefore be used with precaution in order to minimize the risks to the health of the staff manufacturing the treated materials, or the building construction staff, or the people occupying buildings comprising materials treated with such compounds.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">These drawbacks are lessened or eliminated by the use of the fire-retardant powder according to the present invention. The invention is based on a new "3-in-1" fire-retardant, fungicidal, and parasiticidal protective fire-retardant powder that has a long-lasting fire-retardant, fungicidal and parasiticidal efficacy imparting also low smoke generation properties when applied to a combustible material and when said combustible material is exposed to fire.

All the tests, except with K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, were positive: with flame duration of 0.5 second, a duration of burning from 5 to 13 seconds, a 'superficially burned' material with weight loss of material after combustion of about 2.5 to 4.5%, and 'light' or 'very light' generated smoke. With K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> as fourth component, the test results were the following: flame duration 0.5 s, duration of burning 975 s, 'deeply burned' material with weight loss of material after combustion of 70%.
