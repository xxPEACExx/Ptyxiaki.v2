The diode is provided such that an anode thereof faces toward a high potential side. Such a diode and such a third capacitor have a function as a CD snubber. In an inductive load such as a compressor, a regenerative current flows to the power supply (first capacitor) side. The diode and the third capacitor can absorb such a regenerative current along with the first capacitor. In such a configuration, the smaller the electrostatic capacitance of the first capacitor is, the greater the importance of existence of the third capacitor is. This is because the smaller the electrostatic capacitance of the first capacitor is, the more the voltage of the first capacitor is likely to<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> rise by the regenerative current, and the third capacitor can suppress such voltage rise.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">However, in such a configuration, three capacitors, i.e., the first and third capacitors, and the second capacitor for the controller serving as a direct-current load are provided.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">An object of the present invention is to provide a power supply circuit that can interrupt the supply of an operating voltage to an inductive load regardless of the supply of the operating voltage to the direct-current load, and can be manufactured at a lower cost.</p><heading id="h0008">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">A first aspect of a power supply circuit according to the present invention includes first and second power supply lines (LH1, LL1) that are connected to an inductive load (21);

The capacitor absorbs a regenerative current from the inductive load. Moreover, the voltages of the both ends of the capacitor function as the operating voltage of the direct-current load. Accordingly, the capacitor exerts both a function of absorbing the regenerative current and a function of smoothing the second direct-current voltage. Therefore, manufacturing cost is reduced compared to a case of providing two capacitors that exert the respective these functions.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Moreover, the supply of the operating voltage to the inductive load is interrupted by the interruption of the switch section. This is because the switch section interrupts the supply of the operating voltage to the inductive load from the first conversion section, and the diode prevents the second direct-current voltage from being applied to the inductive load. On the other hand, regardless of the operation of the switch section, the second direct-current voltage is supplied to the direct-current load as the operating voltage. That is, regardless of the supply of the operating power to the direct-current load, the supply and the interruption of the operating voltage to the inductive load are controlled.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to the second aspect of the power supply circuit according to the present invention, the resistor consumes a regenerative current. Moreover, the resistor is arranged on a side opposite to the capacitor with respect to the connection end, and hence the second direct-current voltage given to the direct-current load is not lowered.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to the third aspect of the power supply circuit according to the present invention, the resistor consumes the regenerative current. Moreover, in a case where the capacitor is charged from the second conversion section, the register functions as a current-limiting resistor, and can suppress an inrush current to the capacitor.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to the fourth aspect of the power supply circuit according to the present invention, the capacitor has a function of smoothing the second direct-current voltage, and hence a half-wave rectifier circuit can be employed as the second conversion section, and manufacturing cost can be reduced.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to the fifth aspect of the power supply circuit according to the present invention, the second state is selected, so that an operating voltage can be supplied to the direct-current load through the second input line.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to the sixth aspect of the power supply circuit according to the present invention, when the third switch section is interrupted, the supply of the second direct-current voltage to the direct-current load can be interrupted. On the other hand, the supply of the first direct-current voltage to the inductive load can be interrupted by the interruption of the first switch section. Consequently, the power supply to both of the inductive load and the direct-current load is interrupted, so that a stand-by state can be implemented. Moreover, when a predetermined controller causes the third switch section to become conductive in this state, power can be supplied to the direct-current load through the second input line, thereby enabling return from the stand-by.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to the first aspect of the heat pump unit according to the present<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> invention, the power supply from one of the first device and the second device to the other of the devices is interrupted, thereby enabling stand-by, and the stand-by state of the other of the devices can be returned by the one of the devices.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h0010">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0028" num="0028"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>] A diagram showing an example of a conceptual configuration of a power supply circuit.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>] A diagram showing an example of a conceptual configuration of a power supply circuit.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>] A diagram showing an example of a conceptual configuration of a power supply circuit.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>] A diagram showing an example of a conceptual configuration of a power supply circuit.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>] A diagram showing an example of a conceptual configuration of a power supply circuit.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>] A diagram showing an example of a conceptual configuration of a power supply circuit.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>] A diagram showing an example of a conceptual configuration of a power supply circuit.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>] A diagram showing an example of a conceptual configuration of a heat pump unit.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0011">Embodiment for Carrying Out the Invention</heading><heading id="h0012">First Embodiment</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --><p id="p0029" num="0029">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, this power supply circuit includes a first conversion section 11 and a second conversion section 12.

Thereafter, when the switch S12 is caused to become non-conductive, and the switch S11 is caused to become conductive, an operating voltage can be supplied to the compressor driving section 21 while avoiding voltage drop or power consumption in the resistor R11.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">The second conversion section 12 converts the input alternating-current voltage into a direct-current voltage to apply the same to the capacitor C1, namely, to apply the<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> same between power supply lines LH2, LL1 in the illustration of <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>. The switch section S2 selects between a first state where the second conversion section 12 is connected to the wire L11 on the input side thereof, and a second state where the second conversion section 12 is connected to the wire L12 on the input side thereof. The switch section S3 is controlled by the controller 22, and selects the second state in a state where a control signal is not input from the controller 22.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">When the switch section S2 selects the first state, the alternating-current voltage is input to the second conversion section 12 through the wires L11, L13. When the switch section S2 selects the second state, and the switch section S3 is conductive, the alternating-current voltage is input to the second conversion section 12 through the wires L12, L13.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">The power supply circuit 44 generates a direct-current power given to the communication section 45. The power supply circuit 44 is provided, for example, between the power supply line LH2 and the wire L13. More specifically, the power supply circuit 44 includes, for example, resistors R41, R42, a capacitor C41, a zener diode D41, and a diode D42. The resistor R41, the diode D42, and the capacitor C41 are mutually connected in series between the power supply line LH2 and the wire L13. The diode D42 is arranged such that the anode thereof faces toward the power supply line LH2 side. A direct-current voltage rectified by the second conversion section 12 is lowered by the resistor R1 to be charged in the capacitor C41. Consequently, the capacitor C41 smoothes the direct-current voltage rectified by the second conversion section 12. The resistor R41 prevents, for example, an inrush current to the capacitor C41. The capacitor C41, the zener diode D41, and the resistor R42 are mutually connected in parallel. The zener diode D41 keeps the voltage of the capacitor C41 constant. The resistor R42 prevents overvoltage from occurring in the zener diode D41<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> and the capacitor C41.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">The communication section 45 is provided on the wire L12. The wire L12 is provided in the power supply circuit 44, for more detail, between the resistor R41 and the capacitor C41. With such a configuration, a closed circuit which employs the capacitor C41 as a direct-current power supply, and includes the communication section 45, the wire L12, the communication section 43, and the wire L13 is configured, thereby implementing communication of the communication sections 43, 45.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">In such an air conditioner, a method of causing the outdoor unit 200 to stand by, and a method of causing the outdoor unit 200 to return from the stand-by will be described.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">First, in a case where the indoor unit 100 and the outdoor unit 200 perform air conditioning operation, the switch section S1 is conductive, the switch section S2 selects the first state, and the switch section S3 is non-conductive. Consequently, power is supplied to the compressor driving section 21, the controller 22, and the power supply circuit 44 through the wires L11, L 13. The wire L12 is used for the communication of the communication sections 43, 45.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">Next, the process for stopping the air conditioning operation and causing the outdoor unit 200 to stand by will be described. The controller 22 causes the switch section S1 to become non-conductive. Consequently, power supply to the compressor driving section 21 is interrupted. Then, a control signal to the switch section S2 is stopped and the switch section S2 is caused to select the second state. At this time, the switch section S3 is non-conductive, and therefore power supply to the controller 22 is also interrupted. Consequently, power supply to the outdoor unit 200 is interrupted and the outdoor unit 200 can be brought into a stand-by state.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">The process for causing the outdoor unit 200 to return will be now described.<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> The controller 42 causes the switch section S3 to become conductive. The switch section S2 selects the second state, and therefore a voltage is applied to the capacitor C1 through the wire L11, the switch section S3, the wire L12, the switch section S2, and the second conversion section 12, and operating power is supplied to the controller 22. Next, the controller 22 outputs a control signal to the switch section S2 and causes the switch section S2 to select the first state. The switch section S1 is caused to become conductive, and power is supplied to the compressor driving section 21. On the other hand, the controller 42 interrupts the switch section S3. Consequently, the outdoor unit 200 can be caused to return from a stand-by state. In order that the controller 42 may know that an operating voltage is supplied to the controller 22, the controller 22 transmits a signal to the controller 42 through the communication sections 45, 43, for example.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">As described above, according to this air conditioner, it is possible to use the wire L12 as a communication line, when normal air conditioning operation is performed, and to use the wire L12 as a power supply line that supplies power to the outdoor unit 200 through the wire L12, when the outdoor unit 200 is caused to return from a stand-by state.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">While the invention has been shown and described in detail, the foregoing description is in all aspects illustrative and not restrictive.
