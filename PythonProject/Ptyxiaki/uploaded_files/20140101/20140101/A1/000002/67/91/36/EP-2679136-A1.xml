According to a first aspect, the present invention provides a fluorescence observation device including: an excitation light source that emits excitation light to be radiated onto a subject; a fluorescence-image acquiring section provided with an imaging element that acquires a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> fluorescence image by imaging fluorescence produced in the subject when the excitation light emitted from the excitation light source is radiated onto the subject; an image quality evaluating section that calculates a fluctuation from luminance information of the fluorescence image acquired by the imaging element of the fluorescence-image acquiring section and that calculates an SN ratio of the fluorescence image from the calculated fluctuation and the luminance information; and a sensitivity adjusting section that adjusts a number of pixels for binning summing and/or an exposure time in the imaging element such that the SN ratio calculated by the image quality evaluating section is equal to or larger than a predetermined threshold.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the first aspect of the present invention, when the excitation light emitted from the excitation light source is radiated onto the subject, a fluorescent substance is excited in the subject, and the imaging element of the fluorescence-image acquiring section acquires a fluorescence image by imaging produced fluorescence. Then, the image quality evaluating section calculates the fluctuation from the luminance information of the fluorescence image and calculates the SN ratio of the fluorescence image from the fluctuation and the luminance information. Then, the sensitivity adjusting section adjusts the number of pixels for binning<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> summing and/or the exposure time in the imaging element based on the calculated SN ratio, and thus the SN ratio of a fluorescence image that is subsequently acquired by the imaging element becomes equal to or larger than the predetermined threshold, thus allowing observation at a more appropriate sensitivity without reducing the quality of the fluorescence image.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the first aspect of the present invention, the image quality evaluating section may calculate, in predetermined regions of interest in a plurality of fluorescence images acquired at different time points by the fluorescence-image acquiring section, temporal average values and fluctuations of gradation values of each of pixels included in the regions of interest and may calculate, as the SN ratio, an average value of values obtained by dividing the calculated average values by the fluctuations, in the regions of interest.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">By doing so, in a case in which the viewing region in the fluorescence image acquired by the fluorescence-image acquiring section is not changed by a large amount, the SN ratio can be accurately calculated from the temporal average values and fluctuations of the gradation values of each of pixels in the predetermined regions of interest. Specifically, observation can be performed at an appropriate<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> sensitivity that does not reduce the quality of the fluorescence image, without being affected by individual differences between imaging elements.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the first aspect of the present invention, the image quality evaluating section may calculate, in a plurality of regions of interest in the fluorescence image acquired by the fluorescence-image acquiring section, spatial average values and fluctuations of gradation values of each of pixels included in the regions of interest and may calculate, as the SN ratio, an average value of values obtained by dividing the calculated average values by the fluctuations, in the regions of interest.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">By doing so, in a case in which the viewing region in the fluorescence image acquired by the fluorescence-image acquiring section is changed by a large amount, the SN ratio can be accurately calculated from the spatial average values and fluctuations of the gradation values of each of pixels, without having to track the temporal gradation values of each of pixels in the predetermined regions of interest, and observation can be performed at a more appropriate sensitivity without reducing the quality of the fluorescence image.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the first aspect of the present invention, a threshold<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> setting section that sets the threshold may be further included (second aspect).<br/>
By doing so, a threshold appropriate for the performance of a fluorescent medical agent to be used or the application thereof can be set by the threshold setting section, to perform appropriate fluorescence observation.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the second aspect of the present invention, a contrast calculating section that calculates, from the luminance information of the fluorescence image acquired by the fluorescence-image acquiring section, a contrast of the fluorescence image may be further included, and the threshold setting section may set the threshold based on the contrast calculated by the contrast calculating section.<br/>
By doing so, it is possible to automatically set an appropriate threshold by using the contrast calculated by the contrast calculating section from the acquired fluorescence image and to automatically perform observation at a more appropriate sensitivity without reducing the quality of the fluorescence image even when the observation conditions are changed.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the second aspect of the present invention, an illumination light source that emits illumination light to be radiated onto the subject; and a reference-image acquiring<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> section that acquires a reference image by imaging reflected light produced by reflection, at the subject, of the illumination light emitted from the illumination light source, may be further included, and the threshold setting section may set the threshold based on luminance information of the reference image acquired by the reference-image acquiring section.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">By doing so, it is possible to automatically set an appropriate threshold by using the luminance information of the acquired fluorescence image and to automatically perform observation at a more appropriate sensitivity without reducing the quality of the fluorescence image even when the observation conditions are changed.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In the first aspect of the present invention, an illumination light source that emits illumination light to be radiated onto the subject; a reference-image acquiring section that acquires a reference image by imaging reflected light produced by reflection, at the subject, of the illumination light emitted from the illumination light source; and an amount-of-blur calculating section that calculates an amount of blur from luminance information of the reference image acquired by the reference-image acquiring section may be further included, and the sensitivity adjusting section may<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> adjust the number of pixels for binning summing and/or the exposure time based on the amount of blur calculated by the amount-of-blur calculating section.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">By doing so, when the illumination light emitted from the illumination light source is radiated onto the subject, the reference-image acquiring section acquires a reference image by imaging the reflected light reflected at the subject. The amount-of-blur calculating section calculates the amount of blur from the acquired reference image, and the sensitivity adjusting section adjusts the number of pixels for binning summing and/or the exposure time based on the calculated amount of blur. The number of pixels for binning summing is adjusted by prioritizing a reduction in the exposure time when the amount of blur is high, and the number of pixels for binning summing is adjusted by prioritizing an increase in the exposure time when the amount of blur is low, thereby allowing fluorescence observation at a high resolution with a lower number of pixels for binning summing.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the first aspect of the present invention, an illumination light source that emits illumination light to be radiated onto the subject; and a reference-image acquiring section that acquires a reference image by imaging reflected light produced by reflection, at the subject, of the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> illumination light emitted from the illumination light source may be further included, and the sensitivity adjusting section may adjust the number of pixels for binning summing and/or the exposure time based on luminance information of the reference image acquired by the reference-image acquiring section.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">By doing so, when the illumination light emitted from the illumination light source is radiated onto the subject, the reference-image acquiring section acquires a reference image by imaging the reflected light reflected at the subject.

Therefore, because the observation object is clearly visible even if the resolution is slightly reduced, the image blur can be reduced by setting the number of pixels for binning summing larger and the exposure time shorter. In contrast, when the luminance of the reference image is low, the observation distance is long, and thus the observation object is displayed relatively small on the image. Therefore, it is possible to set a smaller number of pixels for binning summing to make the resolution<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> higher.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the first aspect of the present invention, an illumination light source that emits illumination light to be radiated onto the subject; a reference-image acquiring section that acquires a reference image by imaging reflected light produced by reflection, at the subject, of the illumination light emitted from the illumination light source; and an amount-of-motion calculating section that calculates an amount of motion from luminance information of a plurality of reference images acquired by the reference-image acquiring section may be further included, and the sensitivity adjusting section may adjust the number of pixels for binning summing and/or the exposure time based on the amount of motion calculated by the amount-of-motion calculating section.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">When the viewing region in the reference image is changed by a large amount, the SN ratio cannot be accurately calculated by a method of calculating the SN ratio by using a temporal change in the gradation values.

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0013">Fig. 13</figref>, in the fluorescence observation device 30 of this embodiment, the sensitivity adjusting section 22 includes a motion measuring section 31 that measures the moving speed of the inserted section 2 based on the reference images G<sub>1</sub> generated by the reference-image generating section 20, an SN ratio calculating section 32 that calculates the SN ratio SNR from the temporal average values and fluctuations based on the fluorescence images G<sub>2</sub> generated by the fluorescence-image generating section 21, and an SN ratio calculating section 33 that calculates the SN ratio SNR from the spatial average values and fluctuations.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Then, the sensitivity setting section 25 selects between the SN ratio SNR output from the SN ratio calculating section<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> 32 or the SN ratio SNR output from the SN ratio calculating section 33 according to a moving speed N measured by the motion measuring section 31. Specifically, if the moving speed N is larger than a predetermined threshold N1, the SN ratio SNR calculated from the spatial average values and fluctuations and output from the SN ratio calculating section 33 is used, and, if the moving speed N is equal to or smaller than the threshold N1, the SN ratio SNR calculated from the temporal average values and fluctuations and output from the SN ratio calculating section 32 is used.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">When the moving speed of the inserted section 2 is high, the SN ratio SNR calculated by using the spatial average values and fluctuations that can be calculated from a single fluorescence image G<sub>2</sub> is more preferable than the SN ratio SNR calculated by using the temporal fluctuations for which a plurality of fluorescence images G<sub>2</sub> are required, because the calculation of the former can be performed more accurately. When the moving speed is low, because almost the same site is observed, it is more preferable to use the SN ratio SNR calculated by using the temporal average values and fluctuations, which are hardly affected by variations caused by individual differences between imaging elements 18, because the calculation thereof can be performed more accurately.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081"><!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> Furthermore, in this embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0014">Fig. 14</figref>, it is possible to attach an IC chip 34 that stores identification information to the inserted section 2 to be detached and attached in order to change the observation conditions and to provide the light source 3 with an IC reader 35 that reads the identification information stored in the IC chip 34 of the attached inserted section 2.
