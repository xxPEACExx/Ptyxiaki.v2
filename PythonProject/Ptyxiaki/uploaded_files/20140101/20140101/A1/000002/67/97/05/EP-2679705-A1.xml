To withstand these conditions, turbine components have to be made from specifically-designed materials such as superalloys. To improve their resistance to corrosion and/or oxidation, these turbine components must also be coated, hence increasing their lifetime in service by forming a protective oxide scale on the surface. For turbine components, the coatings are generally based on diffusion coatings (mostly aluminium diffusion coatings, including pure and modified aluminides) or overlays coatings (MCrAlY) as oxidation resistant coatings or as bondcoat layers for full Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBC) systems. However, despite this with the passage of time these turbine components still become damaged. Thus, when the turbine is eventually overhauled, refurbishment of these components is more cost effective than replacement.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The repair process involves various steps, including stripping of the old coating and deposition of a new one in the affected area. To date the stripping of old coatings from these components prior to the subsequent repair step is generally carried out using chemical baths to remove (a) the corrosion products, usually an oxide scale, and (b) the damaged coating layers. For example, presently the components are immersed in baths, containing mineral acid solutions comprising Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), Nitric Acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>), Sulphamic Acid (H<sub>3</sub>NSO<sub>3</sub>), Phosphoric Acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) and alkaline solutions mainly based on Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH).<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, one limitation of this chemical stripping approach is that the solutions are not selective enough and are poorly reliable and therefore may damage the superalloy substrate by causing pitting and intergranular attack (IGA).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">There is also the risk that components may have to be scrapped because of extensive attack inducing base material loss, including changes in critical dimensions (wall thickness and/or cooling holes diameter).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Furthermore from an environmental, health and safety viewpoint the stripping solutions are toxic and harmful and waste from these processes must be properly treated and/or disposed of. Additionally, many of the solutions require high temperatures to operate, thus, entailing evaporation issues and requiring additional exhausting systems and safety as well as handling precautions while also raising energy costs.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Additionally, these processes can require extensive masking of the components to shield selected and/or sensitive portions of the components, e.g. airfoil roots or internal cooling channels, due to the non-selective nature of chemical stripping baths.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Finally, intermittent grit blasting stages are often required (including before, during and/or after treatment) thus extending the overall processing time (up to 5-8 hours) to a critical level. Grit blasting which is a line-of-sight process, also reduces reproducibility, when it is either automated or by hand. It may also damage the substrate (causing roughness, excessive and/or non-homogeneous material removal), thereby limiting part life.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">As an alternative to conventional chemical treatment processes, electrochemical approaches may also be adopted.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">For example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2840521A"><text>US 2,840,521 (1958</text></patcit>) is directed to the use of electrolytic stripping by applying current density (i.e. galvanostatic mode) to remove metal coatings from aluminium immersed in diluted sulphuric acid H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Water mixtures of fluoroboric acid (HBF<sub>4</sub>) and phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) also allowed to remove as-plated metal coatings from substrates of the group of titanium and of tungsten (<patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US3793172A"><text>US 3,793,172 (1972</text></patcit>)). However, the majority of these electrochemical stripping approaches only remove the coatings (aluminide and MCrAlY) on the base metal or superalloy and do not address the removal of the corrosion or oxidation products grown from such coatings in the same electrolyte (bath).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>J Appl Electrochem (2008) 38:817-825 "Controlled stripping of aluminide coatings on nickel superalloys through electrolytic techniques</text></nplcit>" discloses a generic process utilising either galvanostatic or potentiostatic polarisation and an electrolytic solution comprising a strong oxidising inorganic acid, a pitting inorganic acid and a number of complex inorganic molecules. No specific details are given on the electrolytic solution used.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As expanded above, conventional processes, whether chemical or electrochemical, for treating turbine components have many limitations and require many different steps which are both time-consuming and the processes themselves can damage the base metal itself.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Thus, the present invention is directed to an improved process for treating turbine components for use in the engine maintenance and repair industry.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>Statements of Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention is directed towards an electrochemical process for stripping corrosion and oxide products and oxidation resistant metallic coatings from a superalloy test sample comprising connecting the test sample to a lead of a power supply; submerging a portion of the test sample into a bath of electrolytic stripping solution with a pH less than 1, wherein the stripping solution comprises nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) at a concentration from 2% to 20% by weight;<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> hydrochloric acid (HCl) at a concentration from 1% to 10% by weight; and ammonium molybdate salt at a concentration from 0.2% to 3% by weight; and, water up to 100% by weight; subjecting the test sample to combined cycles of anodic and cathodic polarisation steps for a period of time effective to strip the corrosion and the oxide products and oxidation resistant metallic coatings from the test sample, wherein anodic polarisation involves making the test sample the anode at a potential lower than +2 volts for 1 min to 2 hours and cathodic polarisation involves making the test sample the cathode at a potential higher than -1.5 volts for 1 minutes to 20 minutes; measuring the open circuit potential (o.c.p.) before and after at least one step of the combined cycle of polarisation to monitor the progress of the coating removal; removing the test sample from the electrolytic stripping solution when the corrosion and oxide products and oxidation resistant metallic coatings are removed and the o.c.p. is close to that of the original superalloy test sample or the current value is getting closer to the passivation current value of the base material; subjecting the test sample to a final cleaning and final rinsing step wherein the final cleaning step comprises i) placing the test sample in a chemical etching solution comprising a mixture from 40/60 to 60/40 in volume ratio of Hydrochloric acid (HCl) and Isopropyl Alcohol (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O) with Copper Chloride salt (CuCl<sub>2</sub>) at a concentration from 2 g/l to 20 g/l, for 1 to 60 min; and the final rinsing step comprises ii) rinsing the test sample in water at room temperature for at least 1 min.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In a further embodiment, the test sample is a gas turbine hot section part made of Fe-, Ni-, Co- or Ti-based alloys.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In a further embodiment, the test sample is coated either with an aluminide or a modified aluminide coating.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In this manner, the base material is a gas turbine hot section part, having a distinct electrochemically composition feature from the coating, including any component made of Fe-, Ni-, Co- or Ti-based alloys.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In a further embodiment, cathodic polarisation is carried out at potentials ranging from -0.8 V/o.c.p. to -0.4 V/o.c.p. for steps between 2 to 10 minutes each and anodic polarisation is carried out at potentials ranging from +0.4 V/SCE to +0.75 V/SCE for steps between 5 to 10 minutes each.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In a further embodiment, the final cleaning step takes place for 5 to 15 minutes at a temperature below 75°C.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In a further embodiment, the final rinsing step additionally uses ultrasonic waves.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">It will be understood that the process of the invention can be carried out for localized coating removal, for example, the tip area of the turbine blade.

The test sample is polarized in such a manner that the test sample is alternatively the cathode and the anode. Therefore, the process allows to both dissolve the coating layers (stripping) as well as to remove the corrosion and oxide products through in situ gas bubbling that makes them brittle enough to detach from the surface. Simultaneously, the computerised system allows an in situ full feedback control of the electrical potential with respect to the reference electrode or of the electrical current at the surface of the part to be stripped.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the present invention, the electrolytic stripping solution is a water-based stripping solution comprises a strong oxidizing inorganic acid in the form of nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>); a reducing and pitting inorganic acid in the form of hydrochloric acid (HCl); and a composition comprising both a corrosion inhibitor and an oxidizing agent in the form of an ammonium molybdate salt.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The chemical composition of the water-based electrolytic solution includes

A potential is preferably imposed to the part to remove all the coating from the localized region after an efficient period of time. The process parameters are related to coating thickness and composition as well as to the oxide scale features (cracking, composition, thickness) and part electro-active area and must be adjusted accordingly for each configuration.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Due to the high electrochemical selectivity and to the fully in situ monitored process, the base material is not affected as it passivates itself when it comes in contact with the electrolyte, thus preserving its structural and dimensional integrity and extending part life,<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> while dissolution reactions still occurs on partially removed portions of the coating to complete the removal process.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Completion of the stripping process is achieved once the preset value of the current or of the potential is reached.

The dotted circles surround the degradation (i.e. general corrosion, pitting and/or intergranular attack) that can occur to the turbine blade using the chemical stripping method of this comparative example. These comparative methods reduce the wall section and induce crack formation, hence decreasing the mechanical properties for which the blade was designed for. For instance, the throat dimension between adjacent blades in an engine is defined by the distance between the trailing edge (TE) of one blade and the convex surface of the adjacent blade. Thus, the trailing edge (TE) of an airfoil is a very thin and critical section that must not be altered.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Using such a chemical stripping method, the risk is that the TE will get thinner or be dissolved (surrounded in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>). Such a loss of base material will result in a decrease of the engine efficiency due to the undesirable effect on the slowing down of gas flow through the throat or on the mechanical damage of parts.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In the case of chemical stripping methods, this is partly due to the non-selective nature of the chemical bath towards the substrate, if the latter is exposed, even if stripping is not completed on other portions of the part. This can lead to extensive pitting corrosion and/or inter-granular (IGA) attacks (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>). These corrosion degradation modes (general corrosion, pitting and IGA) will be exacerbated in the electrochemical stripping mode when using a power source (or current source) in the particular case of the TE (relatively sharp edge), due to the high concentration of the electrical field (or current lines) at edges and corners of complex geometry parts such as turbine blades or vanes.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0057" num="0057"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> shows the difficulties experienced using the stripping method of the comparative example. In a similar manner, the airfoil convex side (CV) mostly suffers from pitting and IGA due to the higher removal rate of the coating compared to the concave side (CC), which is less exposed to the solution, if not suspended or hung in the bath, due to the geometry and the difficulty to agitate and/or create a turbulent flow to regenerate the stripping solution close to this part. In this particular case, it will give rise to remnant portions of coatings on the CC most of the times.</p><heading id="h0017"><b><u>Example 1</u></b></heading><heading id="h0018"><u>Materials</u></heading><p id="p0058" num="0058"><ul><li><u>i) 3-electrode electrochemical cell:</u> The electrochemical cell is a beaker containing the solution and a platinum grid of large area shaped to the part geometry and surrounding it perfectly.

Moreover, the time required for efficient stripping often surpasses three (3) hours when considering the grit blasting, stripping per se and rinsing steps required.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">In contrast, as shown in Examples 1 to 6, the method of this present invention required less time and operates at ambient temperature. These improvements can be attributed to the combined effect of using a new electrolytic process and a new electrolyte.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">Additionally, we have also shown that the method of the invention using this improved electrolyte solution enables a highly selective coating removal while ensuring in every instance the structural and dimensional integrity of the base material/test sample is maintains. Another advantage of this method, is that the base material/test sample passivates itself when becoming in contact with the stripping solution.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">In the specification the terms "comprise, comprises, comprised and comprising" and the terms "include, includes, included and including" are all deemed totally interchangeable and should be afforded the widest possible interpretation.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">The invention is in no way limited to the embodiment hereinbefore described which may be varied in both construction and detail within the scope of the appended claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977398" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An electrochemical process for stripping corrosion and oxide products and oxidation resistant metallic coatings from a superalloy test sample comprising:
