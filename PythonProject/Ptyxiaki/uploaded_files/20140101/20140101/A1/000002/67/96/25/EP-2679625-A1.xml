More specifically, the present invention is concerned with an aqueous liquid composition and aqueous coating formulation, which can form functional coating films useful in various industrial fields, and also with a functional coating film formed with the aqueous coating formulation, and a composite material with the functional coating film and a base material integrated together.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background Art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In recent years, attempts have been made to use various functions of coating films formed by providing liquid compositions - such as solutions, slurries or pastes, which are equipped with various functions, respectively, and may hereinafter also be collectively referred to as "slurries" - as functional coating formulations and applying the functional coating formulations. Such attempts are under way in various fields such as paints, inks, coating agents, magnetic materials, ceramics, building materials, adhesives,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> liquid crystal color filters, pharmaceuticals, electronic materials, and electricity storage devices.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, a paste-form, conductive coating formulation composed of a conductive material, binder resin, curing agent, solvent and the like is used as a conductive adhesive, conductive paint, conductive ink or the like (Non-patent Document 1). A coated, magnetic recording medium such as an audio tape, video tape or flexible disk is manufactured by applying, onto a base film of a polyester or the like, a magnetic coating formulation with magnetic particles of submicron size evenly dispersed in a polymer solution. Further, electrodes for a lithium ion secondary cell are each prepared by mixing an active material, conductive material and binder to prepare a slurry, coating the slurry onto a collector foil, and then drying it (Non-patent Document 2).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">To allow each of such various functional coating formulations as described above to fully exhibit its functionality, the coating film to be formed is required to be equipped with durability and high adhesiveness to a base material. In other words, it is essential conditions that the coating formulation is in a state appropriate for the exhibition of the functionality and can form a coating film having high adhesiveness to the base material and durability. As solvents (dispersion<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> media) for such coating formulations, nonaqueous (organic solvent-based) solvents, which exhibit high compatibility with base materials and can be readily dried, are overwhelmingly advantageous, and as a matter of fact, have been used widely.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, organic solvents are generally high in volatility. Accordingly, they are not only high in environmental load but also required to take genotoxicity into consideration, and therefore, still involve problems in safety and workability. In recent years, there is an increasing concern about the protection of environment and the prevention of health hazards in many industrial fields. There is, hence, an increasing demand toward VOC reductions, solventless coating and the like in connection with the use of organic solvents involving such problems as described above, leading to an outstanding requirement to switch to products that are friendly to the environment and people.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As products friendly to the environment and people, water-based products or products made from raw materials of biological origin are drawing attention. These products are expected to become part of solventless or post-petroleum products. Various problems, however, arise if water is used as a solvent in place of an organic solvent. For example, a water-based coating formulation involves a problem in that it is inferior<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> in film-forming ability to an organic solvent-based coating formulation. Further, a slurry-form, water-based coating formulation with a filler contained therein is accompanied by a problem in that the filler tends to agglomerate in the slurry when it is in a charged state, and moreover, the filler is prone to settling due to a large difference in specific gravity between the solvent and the filler, thereby raising another problem in that its even dispersion is difficult. In addition, it is not easy to find raw materials of biological origin, which exhibit film-forming ability and dispersing ability and can replace conventional raw materials of petroleum origin.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Upon attempting the dispersion and stabilization of a filler in a water-based slurry, various methods may be contemplated including the use of a dispersant, the surface treatment, microencapsulation and ultrasonic treatment of the filler, and the introduction of polar groups into a polymer. Among these methods, the use of the dispersant is advantageous when the simplification of the production method and coating system and the cost matter are taken into account. As the dispersant for use in the water-based slurry, a polycarboxylate salt or phosphate amine salt used in the field of paints (Non-patent Document 3), a polyacrylamide as a high-molecular dispersant<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> (Non-patent Document 4), or the like is conceivable. When a reduction in environmental load is taken into consideration, however, the dispersant may preferably be a substance of natural origin, which is friendly to the environment. A proposal has been made about the use of carboxymethylcellulose as a water-based dispersant upon production of each electrode for a nonaqueous electrolyte secondary cell (Patent Document 1). Concerning carboxymethylcellulose, however, there is still a room for an improvement in its dispersing effect. On the other hand, the use of a petroleum-based binder resin is needed to form a strong coating film. There is, accordingly, an outstanding desire for a utilization technology of a natural polymer that, although it is a substance of biological origin, can exhibit adhesiveness which is by no means inferior to that available from the use of a petroleum-based binder resin.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">As an expected application of the water-based slurry, a coating formulation for electrode plates in electricity storage devices such as secondary cells or capacitors is considered. The demand for these electricity storage devices has been significantly growing in recent years. Each electrode plate is an electrode plate member, that includes unit members such as an electrode layer and collector integrated therein<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> and gives significant effects on the performance of an electricity storage device. Proposals have been made to permit the production of an electrode plate in the form of a thinner film with larger area such that an electricity storage device can be provided with an extended charge-discharge cycle life and an increased energy density. For example, Patent Documents 2 and 3 disclose positive electrode plates, each of which is obtained by dispersing or dissolving a powder of a positive-electrode active material such as a metal oxide, sulfide or halogenide, a conductive material and a binder in an appropriate solvent to prepare a paste-form coating formulation, and then applying the coating formulation onto a surface of a collector formed of a foil of a metal such as aluminum to form a coating film layer.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A negative electrode plate for a cell or a polarizable electrode plate for a capacitor is obtained by mixing an active material such as a carbonaceous material with a solution of a binder in a suitable solvent to obtain a paste-form coating formulation and then applying the coating formulation onto a collector to form a coating film layer. The binder employed to prepare the coating formulation is required <i>inter alia</i> to be electrochemically stable to a nonaqueous electrolyte and to be free from dissolution into the electrolyte for the cell or capacitor, to remain free<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> from substantial swelling by the electrolyte, and further to be soluble in a certain solvent.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">On the other hand, it is practiced to form a protective film on a surface of a metal material such as aluminum, as a base metal material of a collector, by coating a solution of one of various resins. The resulting protective film is excellent in the adhesiveness to the metal surface, but is accompanied by a problem in that its durability to an organic solvent is insufficient.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The coating film layer of the electrode plate for the cell or capacitor, said coating film layer having been obtained by applying the above-described paste-form coating formulation onto a collector, is accompanied by problems in that its adhesiveness to the collector and its flexibility are insufficient. In addition, the coating film layer has a high contact resistance to the collector, and may undergo peeling, flaking, cracking and/or the like upon assembly of the cell or capacitor or upon charging and discharging the same.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As described above, the conventional cell or capacitor is accompanied by the problems of the poor adhesion between the electrode layer and the collector (substrate) and the high internal resistance between the electrode layer and the collector. A variety of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> coating formulations have been proposed to solve these problems. By coating film layers formed with the various coating formulations so proposed, the problem of poor adhesiveness has been increasingly lessened. However, still higher resistance is produced between the electrode layer and the collector, so that none of these coating formulations have led to a solution to the problems yet. In recent years, there is also a demand for a manufacturing method, which has paid due consideration to the environment, for the above-mentioned electricity storage devices and their related products. There is hence a demand for a coating formulation making use of components, which are low in environmental load.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Prior Art Documents</b></heading><heading id="h0004"><b>Patent Documents</b></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2009238720A"><text>JP-A-2009-238720</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP63010456A"><text>JP-A-63-10456</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 3: <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP3285262A"><text>JP-A-3-285262</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b>Non-patent Documents</b></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014"><ul><li>Non-patent Document 1 : <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>FUJIYAMA, Mitsuyoshi: "Chapter I, Causes of Mixing and Dispersion Failures for Conductive Fillers", "New Mixing and Dispersion Technology for Conductive Fillers and Measures for Mixing and Dispersion Failures" in Japanese, Technical Information Institute Co., Ltd. p. 20 (2004</text></nplcit>)<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> Non-patent Document 2: <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="b"><text>TACHIBANA, Hirokazu: "Preparation, Coating and Drying of Positive Electrode Slurry for Lithium Ion Secondary Cells, and Understanding of Electrode Operations" in Japanese, Material Stage, Technical Information Institute Co., Ltd., 8(12), pp. 72-75 (2009</text></nplcit>)</li><li>Non-patent Document 3: <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>JOE, Kiyokazu: "Technological Development of Dispersing Agents for Water Borne Coating Materials" in Japanese, JETI, 44 (10), pp. 110-112 (1996</text></nplcit>) Non-patent Document 4: <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>KAMIYA, Hirohide: "Evaluation and Control of Agglomeration/Dispersion Behavior of Microparticles in Water System" in Japanese, Material Stage, 2(1), pp. 54-60 (2002</text></nplcit>)</li></ul></p><heading id="h0006"><b>Disclosure of the Invention</b></heading><heading id="h0007"><b>Problem to Be Solved by the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">Objects of the present invention are to provide an aqueous liquid composition, which contains low-cost materials having low environmental load, can retain adequate viscosity even when stored over a long term, and can form a functional coating film having excellent adhesiveness to a base material and superb durability, solvent resistance and waterproofness and capable of exhibiting various functions led by electrical conductivity and hydrophilicity, and also an aqueous coating formulation.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Further objects of the present invention are to<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> provide a functional coating film having excellent adhesiveness to a base material and superb durability, solvent resistance and waterproofness and capable of exhibiting various functions led by electrical conductivity and hydrophilicity, and also a method for forming the functional coating film.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">A still further object of the present invention is to provide a composite material with a functional coating film, which has superb durability, solvent resistance and waterproofness and is capable of exhibiting various functions led by electrical conductivity and hydrophilicity, adhered on a base material.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Even still further objects of the present invention are to provide an electrode plate member and electrode plate with a conductive coating film having excellent durability and sol vent resistance and good conductivity and adhered on a collector, and an electricity storage device provided with the electrode plate and having a characteristic such as large discharge capacity or low internal resistance.</p><heading id="h0008"><b>Means for Solving the Problem</b></heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">The above-described objects can be achieved by the present invention to be described hereinafter.

The aqueous liquid composition according to the present invention contains a water-based medium containing water, at least one of chitosan and a chitosan derivative, which may hereinafter be also referred to as "the chitosan", and a polymeric acid, and has a pH of not higher than 4.5. The inclusion of these components and the setting at the predetermined pH can inhibit the settling-out of a filler such as a conductive material, which may be contained further, and can also assure high hydrophilicity.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Owing to the inclusion of the chitosan and polymeric acid, both of which are equipped with binding ability and dispersing ability for a filler such as a conductive material, hydrophilicity and the like, the aqueous liquid composition according to the present<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> invention is also excellent in environmental performance while retaining binding properties and dispersion properties for the filler and functionality suchashydrophilicity. Further, owing to the inclusion of an appropriate amount of water, preferably a water-based medium containing water and an organic solvent such as a water-soluble alcohol as a solvent or dispersion medium, the chitosan and polymeric acid are prevented from precipitation, and an adequate viscosity is retained. Hence, the aqueous liquid composition according to the present invention assures a pot life upon coating, prevents the settling-out of the filler, and realizes coatability and dispersion stability.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The term "aqueous liquid composition" as used in the present invention means one containing fine solid particles such as a filler dispersed at a high concentration in a water-based medium and having a slurry form or paste form.</p><heading id="h0012">Water-based Medium</heading><p id="p0034" num="0034">A water-based medium is contained in the aqueous liquid composition according to the present invention. This water-based medium is a component that functions as a solvent or a dispersion medium. The water-based medium can be water alone or a mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent. Water may preferably be<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> distilled water, but depending on the application, may also be ordinary tap water.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The organic solvent may preferably be a solvent that is miscible with water. Specific examples of such an organic solvent include alcohols such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), n-butyl alcohol, s-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol and t-butyl alcohol; esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, n-propyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, methoxybutyl acetate, cellosolve acetate, amyl acetate, methyl lactate, ethyl lactate and butyl lactate; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, diisobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone; amides such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylacetamide and N,N-dimethylformamide; and sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide. Among these, the alcohols are preferred with IPA being more preferred.

When a mixed solvent of IPA and water is used, for example, the proportion of IPA contained<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> in the mixed solvent may be preferably 1 to 40 mass%, with 5 to 40 mass% being more preferred.</p><heading id="h0013">The Chitosan</heading><p id="p0037" num="0037">The chitosan is contained in the aqueous liquid composition according to the present invention. Chitosan products available from the market can be used as they are. Among these chitosan products, chitosan derivatives are preferred from the standpoint of solubility in water and an organic solvent which may be added as needed. The chitosan derivatives include hydroxyalkyl chitosans, carboxyalkyl chitosans, carboxyacyl chitosans, succinyl chitosan, cationized chitosans, and the like. Of these, preferred is at least one chitosan derivative selected from the group consisting of hydroxyalkyl chitosans, carboxyalkyl chitosans, and carboxyacyl chitosans.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">A description will hereinafter be made about the hydroxyalkyl chitosans. The hydroxyalkyl chitosans are natural polymers of biological origin, and do not add much load on the environment. Of these hydroxyalkyl chitosans, suited are hydroxyethyl chitosan, hydroxypropyl chitosan, hydroxybutyl chitosan, hydroxybutyl hydroxypropyl chitosan, glycerylated chitosan, and the like.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The hydroxyalkyl chitosans each have a structure that an alkylene oxide or oxiranemethanol<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> has been added to amino groups in chitosan. Among these hydroxyalkyl chitosans, preferred are those produced by reacting chitosan and alkylene oxides and one produced by reacting chitosan with oxiranemethanol. For example, hydroxybutyl chitosan can be obtained by adding sodium hydroxide and butylene oxide to water-containing isopropyl alcohol in which chitosan has been stirred and dispersed, and then conducting stirring under heat. Further, glycerylated chitosan can be obtained by adding oxiranemethanol to water-containing isopropyl alcohol in which chitosan has been stirred and dispersed, and then conducting stirring under heat.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">When a conductive material is contained as a filler in the aqueous liquid composition according to the present invention, a hydroxyalkyl chitosan having a hydroxyalkylation degree of 0.5 or greater but 4 or smaller can be suitably used from the standpoint of the dispersing ability for the conducive material. The term "hydroxyalkylation degree (no unit)" means the degree of addition of a corresponding alkylene oxide or oxiranemethanol to chitosan. Described specifically, preferred is one obtained by adding 0.5 mole or more but 4 moles or less of an alkylene oxide or oxiranemethanol per<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> mole of a pyranose ring that makes up chitosan. To obtain such a hydroxyalkylation degree, it is desired to add and react 0.6 mole or more but 10 moles or less of the alkylene oxide or oxiranemethanol per mole of a pyranose ring that makes up chitosan. If the hydroxyalkylation degree of a hydroxyalkyl chitosan is 0.5 or smaller, the hydroxyalkyl chitosan may be insufficient in the dispersing ability for the filler and the stability of a slurry after dispersion. Even when the hydroxyalkylation degree exceeds 4, on the other hand, the dispersing ability for the filler may not change so that the setting of the hydroxyalkylation degree beyond 4 may be uneconomical.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The weight average molecular weight of such a hydroxyalkyl chitosan may be preferably 2,000 or higher but 350,000 or lower, more preferably 5,000 or higher but 250, 000 or lower. If the weight average molecular weight of the hydroxyalkyl chitosan is lower than 2,000, the hydroxyalkyl chitosan may have insufficient dispersing ability for the conductive filler. If the weight average molecular weight of the hydroxyalkyl chitosan is higher than 350,000, on the other hand, the hydroxyalkyl chitosan tends to provide the resulting slurry with an increased viscosity, thereby possibly making it difficult to<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> raise the solids concentration of the conductive filler.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The content of the chitosan in the aqueous liquid composition according to the present invention may be preferably 0.1 to 40 parts by mass, more preferably 0.5 to 20 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the aqueous liquid composition.</p><heading id="h0014">Polymeric Acid</heading><p id="p0043" num="0043">In the aqueous liquid composition according to the present invention, a polymeric acid is contained. The inclusion of the polymeric acid provides the resulting coating film with improved adhesiveness to the base material and also with improved hydrophilic function.

The polymeric acid may be a homopolymer or a copolymer. Further, the acidic groups may be in a free acid form or in a salt form. Examples of the polymeric acid include phthalocyanine polycarboxylic acid, phytic acid, hexametaphosphoric acid, polyphosphoric acid, polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid, polyitaconic acid, polymaleic acid, and their copolymers; and styrene-maleic acid copolymer, isobutylene-maleicacid<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> copolymer, vinyl ether-maleic acid copolymer, pectic acid, polyglutamic acid, polymalic acid, polyaspartic acid, acrylic acid-maleic acid-vinyl alcohol copolymer, and the like.

Because the pH of the aqueous liquid composition is not higher than 4.5, the chitosan and polymeric acid as essential components can be dissolved so that a homogeneous composition can be provided. If the pH of the aqueous liquid composition is higher than 4.5, a polyion complex of the chitosan and polymeric acid precipitates, and no homogeneous composition can be obtained.
