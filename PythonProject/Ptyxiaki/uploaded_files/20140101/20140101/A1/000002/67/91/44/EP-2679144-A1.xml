In particular, the device includes two moving parts, an upper one and a lower one, whose relative motion along the transverse axis to the longitudinal axis, achieves a significant reduction of laminar thickness during the patient's intubation procedure. More in particular, during the phase of insertion of an instrument in the patient's mouth (oral cavity), a small inter-foreteeth distance could result in a critical factor that makes the insertion of the ordinary devices very difficult or even impossible. Instead, the proposed solution permits a proper placement of the distal part of the instrument inside the laryngeal cavity even in the above said situations. A following increase of thickness, resulting from the passage of cylindrical elements when the distal part of the instrument is correctly positioned in front of the glottic rhyme, permits to obtain a safer intubation procedure, even in difficult situations, because of a wider visual field and a lower external surface in contact with the patient, just at the time when the instrument should find a way inside narrow spaces.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">The direct laryngoscopy is a technique that permits to visualize the laryngeal structures in a clear and straight way, and it is achieved by an instrument called <i>laryngoscope.</i> Since half a century, this technique made it possible to address the anesthetists operating around the world, in order to define a standard procedure of tracheal intubation addressed to place a tube in trachea, by which a patient can receive oxygen and at the same time can maintain protected air ways during the anesthesia.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Despite the improvement of such a technique, obtained at a global level by years of clinical practice, and despite the different shapes of laryngoscopic blades that have been designed and are available on the market, in same cases the direct laryngoscopy is not possible, because of particular anatomical parts in some persons, or because of particular situations that can happen in an emergency room.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In example, direct laryngoscopy is not possible when the alignment of the three patient's axis (oral axis pharyngeal axis and laryngeal axis) cannot be achieved by the standard actions that a physician knows and can do. Therefore, since a long time<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> there was a widely recognized need to find some alternative techniques, so that an optimal visualization of the laryngeal structures can be achieved, and so that to use a laryngoscope minimizing the risk of damage of the patient's tissues.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">When new technologies become available, with new advanced materials, the laryngeal structures had more chances to be properly visualized, even in a not direct way, by the so called indirect laryngoscopy. Therefore, the techniques of indirect laryngoscopy made it possible to visualize the laryngeal structures clearly, using a camera, or an optical fiber, or further a system of prisms with the distal elements that can be placed close to the tracheal cavity.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Among the devices that, at the present time, permit to achieve the indirect laryngoscopy technique, there are <i>Airtraq, Pentax AWS,</i> and <i>A.P. Advance LMA,</i> that contain the endotracheal tube in a tunnel that is integrated into the blade, so that a guidance can be achieved all along the path, until the tube exits with the far end directly in the proper position in trachea. Although this solution prevents possible risks arising from use of stylets, and therefore represents a more comfortable procedure of endotracheal intubation, according to an indirect laryngoscopy technique, however it is characterized by significant drawbacks.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">First of all, the operator is forced to express strong actions of pulling and rotating the device, just as an attempt, sometimes not effective, to align properly the far end of the instrument to the tracheal axis. Such movements can lead to a series of complications for the patient due to the strong forces that are expressed on tissues in case the above alignment is not easy to be obtained. The most important complication is represented by the possible damage to the laryngeal structures. Other possible complications due to the excessive thickness of the instrument and to quick movements in cases of emergency are oedema, bleeding or damages to teeth or dentures, that may also be inhaled and produce serious problems of respiratory obstructions.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Furthermore, the requirement to insert the endotracheal tube in an operative channel, in order to follow a proper routing path, leads as a consequence to the definition of an increased instrument's thickness, and to an increased minimum inter-foreteeth distance, in the attempts to insert the same instrument into the patient's mouth, and/or leads to the use of different instruments of different size, according to the diameter of the endotracheal tube to be inserted.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Another innovation in the laryngoscopy field has been introduced with the use of a magnetic guidance system according to the principles and teachings of the European<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> patent application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP11425045A"><text>EP 11425045 (De Domenico</text></patcit>) and a support device for endotracheal tube according to the principles and teachings of the European patent application <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP11425158A"><text>EP 11425158 (De Domenico</text></patcit>). In fact, these inventions, allow to overcome the above said drawbacks because they enable the variability of possible directions for routing the endotracheal tube at each stage of advancement within the patient's mouth, under the control of a guiding mechanism, with a consequent simplification of the procedure and a considerable reduction of the blade thickness in the longitudinal direction, so that to allow the reduction of the minimal inter-foreteeth distance required to introduce the laryngoscope blade through the mouth of the patient.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The aim of this invention is to further reduce the minimal inter-foreteeth distance required to introduce the laryngoscope blade through the mouth of the patient, without compromising the advantages relating to the above-mentioned inventions of the magnetic guidance system (patent application <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP11425045A"><text>EP 11425045, De Domenico</text></patcit>) and of the device for endotracheal tube (patent application <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP11425158A"><text>EP 11425158, De Domenico</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In particular, during the phase of passing through the patient's mouth (oral cavity), this invention allows the reduction of the laminar thickness in the distal part of the blade, that represents a critical step during the operations of correct positioning of the same blade, in order to allow the consequent increase of thickness when the distal end of the laryngoscope blade is already positioned inside the pharynx, exactly at the point when the increasing thickness of the laryngoscope enables the optimal visualization of the vocal cords (increasing the visual field), and at the same time the passage of the endotracheal tube side by side to the walls of the laryngoscope. The device is also versatile because it enables the use of tubes having different diameters.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The object of the present invention is therefore constituted by a device which overcomes all the above mentioned drawbacks, being versatile and able to be applied to many types of endotracheal intubation devices that are currently on the market.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Therefore, it is specific subject of the present invention a blade of a laryngoscope, or similar devices, having a progressive spreading mechanism, said blade <b>characterized in that</b> comprising:
<ul><li>a lower part, preferably rectangular, which extends along the longitudinal direction and having a profile that is curved at the end, in turn comprising: a first dividing wall positioned transversely to said lower part, which extends longitudinally up to a specific distance, and having a series of primary protruding teeth positioned along one or more columns, and that regulate the transverse thickness;</li><li>an upper part, preferably rectangular, which extends along the longitudinal<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> direction and having a profile that is curved at the end, in turn comprising: a second dividing wall positioned transversely to said upper part, which extends longitudinally up to a specific distance, and having a series of secondary protruding teeth positioned along one or more columns, that regulate the transverse thickness, and interlocking to said primary protruding teeth;</li><li>a series of cylindrical elements that are all connected each other in correspondence of their axis, using a flexible articulated structure free to move, under control of an operator, along the longitudinal direction, i.e. the main axis of the blade, inside an operative channel defined by a closed space between the above-mentioned lower part and the upper part of the blade,</li></ul>
