The underbone type motorcycle is equipped with a head pipe for pivotably supporting a handlebar, and a body frame having a main frame extending rearward and obliquely downward from the head pipe, and an engine is disposed below the body frame. In the underbone type motorcycle, the height of the portion between the handlebar and the seat is set low, so that space is formed in front of the seat. As a result, when riding on the motorcycle, the rider can easily straddle over the main frame, so the rider can easily mount on and dismount from the motorcycle. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP3449702B"><text>JP 3449702</text></patcit> describes an underbone type motorcycle in which a storage box and a fuel tank are disposed below the seat.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">When the storage box has a larger volumetric capacity, it can accommodate more items therein. However, it is not easy to enlarge the volumetric capacity of the storage box in the underbone type motorcycle. In the underbone type motorcycle, space is formed in front of the seat, as mentioned above, and the main frame extends frontward and obliquely upward from below the storage box. If the storage box is elongated frontward in order to increase its volumetric capacity, the storage box and the main frame may interfere with each other, so it is difficult to enlarge the storage box frontward. Moreover, in the underbone type motorcycle, it is not easy to change the shape of the main frame in order to increase the volumetric capacity of the storage box because the engine is supported non-swingably on the main frame. Furthermore, the fuel tank is disposed at the rear of the storage box. This means that, if the storage box<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> is elongated rearward, either the volumetric capacity of the fuel tank may decrease, or the size of the vehicle body may increase because the fuel tank needs to be disposed further rearward. Thus, it has been believed that it is difficult to further increase the storage space below the seat.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The present invention has been accomplished in view of the foregoing and other problems, and it is an object of the invention to provide a motorcycle that can effectively ensure sufficient storage space and at the same time inhibit the capacity of the fuel tank from decreasing.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">According to the present invention said object is solved by a motorcycle having the features of independent claim 1. Preferred embodiments are laid down in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to the present teaching it is provided an underbone type motorcycle that can effectively ensure sufficient storage space and at the same time inhibit the capacity of the fuel tank from decreasing. In particular, it is provided a motorcycle comprising: a head pipe; a body frame having a main frame extending rearward and obliquely downward from the head pipe; an engine supported non-swingably on the main frame and disposed below the main frame; a seat supported by the body frame; a storage box, at least a portion of which is disposed between the seat and the main frame; a fuel tank disposed below the seat and behind the storage box; and a rear wheel disposed below the fuel tank, wherein: the storage box has a front wall, a right wall extending rearward from a rightmost end of the front wall, a left wall extending rearward from a leftmost end of the front wall, and a rear wall connecting the right wall and the left<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> wall to each other; the storage box has an opening formed by an upper edge of the front wall, an upper edge of the right wall, an upper edge of the rear wall, and an upper edge of the left wall; a rightmost end of the rear wall is positioned more rightward than the rightmost end of the front wall; a leftmost end of the rear wall is positioned more leftward than the leftmost end of the front wall; at least a portion of a front end portion of the fuel tank is positioned more upward than at least a portion of the rear wall; the front end portion of the fuel tank has a recessed portion recessed rearward in a vehicle-widthwise central region; and the front end portion of the fuel tank includes a leftward positioned portion and a rightward positioned portion having respective frontmost ends and respectively positioned vehicle-widthwise leftward and rightward of the recessed portion, and the respective frontmost ends of the leftward and rightward positioned portions are positioned more frontward than a rearmost end of the recessed portion.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the motorcycle according to the present teaching, the rightmost and leftmost ends of the rear wall of the storage box are respectively positioned more outward than the rightmost and leftmost ends of the front wall. For this reason, in a vehicle-widthwise central region, the distance from the front wall to the rear wall of the storage box is shorter than that in the other portions of the storage box. Nevertheless, the recessed portion recessed rearward is formed in the vehicle-widthwise central region in the upper portion of the front end portion of the fuel tank, which is disposed behind the storage box. Thereby, the storage space is increased corresponding to the space of the recessed portion. The respective frontmost ends of the leftward and rightward positioned portions, which are respectively positioned vehicle-widthwise leftward and rightward of the recessed portion, are positioned more frontward than the rearmost end of the recessed portion. Therefore, the fuel tank can be ensured to have a sufficient<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> capacity even though the recessed portion is formed in the fuel tank. Thus, the above-described underbone type motorcycle can effectively increase the storage space below the seat while inhibiting the capacity of the fuel tank from decreasing.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In one embodiment of the present teaching, the rearmost end of the rear wall is disposed more rearward than the rearmost end of the right wall and the rearmost end of the left wall, and more rearward than the respective frontmost ends of the leftward and rightward positioned portions respectively positioned vehicle-widthwise leftward and rightward of the recessed portion.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Thereby, the volumetric capacity of the storage box can be made larger without increasing the size of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In one embodiment of the present teaching, an upper edge of the rear wall is formed in a circular arc shape as viewed in plan; and the rearmost end of the rear wall is disposed more rearward than the rearmost end of the right wall and the rearmost end of the left wall, and more rearward than the respective frontmost ends of the leftward and rightward positioned portions respectively positioned vehicle-widthwise leftward and rightward of the recessed portion.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Thereby, the volumetric capacity of the storage box can be made larger without increasing the size of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In one embodiment of the present teaching, the rear wall has a flange portion extending rearward and obliquely upward; the recessed portion is formed in an upper<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> portion of the front end portion of the fuel tank; and at least a portion of the flange portion is disposed more rearward than the respective frontmost ends of the leftward and rightward positioned portions respectively positioned vehicle-widthwise leftward and rightward of the recessed portion, and overlaps the fuel tank as viewed in plan.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Since the recessed portion is formed in an upper portion of the front end portion of the fuel tank in this way, the capacity of the fuel tank can be inhibited from decreasing. Moreover, since the flange portion is disposed in the recessed portion, the items accommodated in the storage box can be effectively prevented from making contact with the fuel tank.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In one embodiment of the present teaching, the flange portion is inclined with respect to the vertical so as to slope upward toward the rear; and a surface of the recessed portion is inclined with respect to the vertical so as to slope upward toward the rear.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Since the surface of the recessed portion is inclined with respect to the vertical so as to slope upward toward the rear in this way, the capacity of the fuel tank can be further inhibited from decreasing.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In one embodiment of the present teaching, an uppermost end of the rear wall is positioned higher than an uppermost end of the right wall and an uppermost end of the left wall; and an upper edge of the rear wall is formed so as to slope downward from the uppermost end of the rear wall toward the uppermost end of the right wall and the uppermost end of the left wall.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Since the upper edge of the rear wall is formed so as to slope downward from the uppermost end of the rear wall toward the uppermost end of the right wall and the uppermost end of the left wall in this way, water can be effectively prevented from entering the storage box by the rear wall extending higher than the uppermost ends and of the right wall and the left wall when water flows in from behind the storage box.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In one embodiment of the present teaching, the left wall has a left wall main portion and a left wall bulging portion, the left wall main portion formed to have a horizontal cross section in a linear shape or in a leftward convex curved shape, and the left wall bulging portion provided more rearward than a frontmost end of the left wall main portion and more frontward than a rearmost end thereof and formed to have a horizontal cross section in a leftward convex curved shape having a greater curvature than that of the left wall main portion; and the right wall has a right wall main portion and a right wall bulging portion, the right wall main portion formed to have a horizontal cross section in a linear shape or in a rightward convex curved shape, and the right wall bulging portion provided more rearward than a frontmost end of the right wall main portion and more frontward than a rearmost end thereof and formed to have a horizontal cross section in a rightward convex curved shape having a greater curvature than that of the right wall main portion.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The volumetric capacity of the storage can be made larger because the left wall bulging portion and the right wall bulging portion, which are respective portions of the left wall and the right wall, bulge vehicle-widthwise outward in this way.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> In one embodiment of the present teaching, an indented portion recessed upward is formed in a region of a reverse face of the seat that faces the rear wall and the recessed portion.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Since the indented portion is formed in the reverse face of the seat in this way, sufficient storage space can be provided from a region above the rear wall of the storage box toward a region above the recessed portion of the fuel tank.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In one embodiment of the present teaching, the motorcycle further has a rear fender disposed above a portion of the rear wheel, and a recessed portion recessed upward and positioned above a portion of the rear fender is formed in a lower portion of the rear wall of the storage box.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">By disposing a portion of the rear fender in the recessed portion of the storage box, the front-to-rear length of the vehicle can be made smaller, and the size of the motorcycle can be made smaller.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In one embodiment of the present teaching, when a helmet is accommodated in the storage box in such a posture that a top portion of a shell portion of the helmet faces downward and a peak of the helmet faces rearward, the recessed portion of the fuel tank is formed so that at least a portion of the peak of the helmet is disposed above the recessed portion as viewed in plan.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Even when the storage box has a volumetric capacity that can accommodate the shell portion of the helmet (for example, an open-face type helmet) but the whole of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the helmet is difficult to put in the storage box, the helmet can be accommodated in the storage space below the seat by putting the peak of the helmet in the recessed portion, because the recessed portion is formed in the front end portion of the fuel tank.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In one embodiment of the present teaching, a fuel pump is disposed in the fuel tank, and the fuel pump is mounted to a lower wall of the fuel tank.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As a result, the fuel pump can be disposed in a compact manner.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In one embodiment of the present teaching, the body frame comprises right and left seat frames extending rearward and obliquely upward from the main frame and a cross member mounted so as to span over the right and left seat frames; the seat frame is provided with a first mount portion to which the storage box is mounted; the cross member is provided with a second mount portion to which the fuel tank is mounted; the first mount portion is positioned more frontward than the second mount portion; and the storage box has a seat load bearing portion provided above the second mount portion.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">When the storage box and the fuel tank are joined together (in other words, when both the storage box and the fuel tank are mounted to the same portion of the body frame), there is a risk that the height of the storage box may become higher at the portion where the storage box and the fuel tank overlap each other. On the other hand, when it is attempted to prevent the height of the storage box from becoming higher, the volumetric capacity of the storage box may be decreased. In particular, when the storage box and the fuel tank are disposed so as to overlap each other as viewed in plan, the just-mentioned problem becomes more evident. Nevertheless, in the present<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> teaching, the storage box is mounted to the first mount portion of the seat frame, and the fuel tank is mounted to the second mount portion of the cross member. Since the first mount portion is positioned more frontward than the second mount portion, a sufficient volumetric capacity of the storage box can be provided without increasing the height of the storage box. Furthermore, because the storage box and the fuel tank can be disposed in a compact manner, the seat load bearing portion can be provided in the space above the second mount portion to which the fuel tank is fitted.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">As described above, the present teaching makes it possible to provide an underbone type motorcycle that can effectively ensure sufficient storage space and at the same time inhibit the capacity of the fuel tank from decreasing.</p><heading id="h0001">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0031" num="0031"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1] Fig. 1</figref> is a left side view illustrating a motorcycle according to one embodiment of the present teaching.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2] Fig. 2</figref> is a plan view illustrating a portion of the motorcycle according to one embodiment of the present teaching.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3A] Fig. 3A</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line IIIA-IIIA in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 3B] Fig. 3B</figref> is a partially enlarged view of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3A</figref>.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 4] Fig. 4</figref> is a left side view illustrating a seat, a storage box, and a region therearound, according to one embodiment of the present teaching.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 5A] Fig. 5A</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line VA-VA in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 4</figref>, which illustrates the structures of a right wall and a left wall of the storage box.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 5B] Fig. 5B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line VB-VB in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 4</figref>, which illustrates the structures of the right wall and the left wall of the storage box.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 5C] Fig. 5C</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line VC-VC in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 4</figref>, which illustrates the structures of the right wall and the left wall of the storage box.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 6A] Fig. 6A</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a fuel tank according to one embodiment of the present teaching.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 6B] Fig. 6B</figref> is a side view illustrating the fuel tank according to one embodiment of the present teaching.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 6C] Fig. 6C</figref> is a plan view illustrating the fuel tank according to one embodiment of the present teaching.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 7A] Fig. 7A</figref> is a plan view illustrating a storage box according to one embodiment of the present teaching.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 7B] Fig. 7B</figref> is a left side view illustrating the storage box according to one embodiment of the present teaching.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0013">Fig. 7C] Fig. 7C</figref> is a front view illustrating the storage box according to one embodiment of the present teaching.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0014">Fig. 7D] Fig. 7D</figref> is a rear view illustrating the storage box according to one embodiment of the present teaching.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 8] Fig. 8</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a storage box and a region therearound, according to one embodiment of the present teaching.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0016">Fig. 9] Fig. 9</figref> is a left side view illustrating the storage box and a region therearound, according to one embodiment of the present teaching.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0017">Fig. 10] Fig. 10</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a storage box and a region therearound, according to one embodiment of the present teaching.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0018">Fig. 11] Fig. 11</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a storage box, a fuel tank, and a region therearound, according to one embodiment of the present teaching.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0019">Fig. 12] Fig. 12</figref> is a plan view illustrating a portion of the motorcycle according<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> to another embodiment of the present teaching.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0020">Fig. 13] Fig. 13</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line XIII-XIII in <figref idrefs="f0019">Fig. 12</figref>.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0002">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><heading id="h0003">&lt;FIRST EMBODIMENT&gt;</heading><p id="p0032" num="0032">Hereinbelow, one embodiment (the first embodiment) of the present teaching will be described.
