The seatbelt generally includes shoulder and lap straps that may be fastened with an anchor point of the vehicle to restrain and protect the occupant in case of collision or sudden stop of the vehicle. However, the use of the vehicle seatbelt is not adapted for a young child who has a smaller body and may not be able to sustain the pressure applied by the seatbelt. As a result, safety legislations require the use of a child safety seat for seating a young child in a vehicle. An anchorage fixture provided in the vehicle can securely fasten with the child safety seat, which is more adapted to provide protection for the young child.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, when accidental collision occurs, excessive concentration of the collision energy may be transmitted from the restraint harness of the child safety seat to the body of the child. This may cause serious injury to the child.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need for a child safety seat that is safer in use, and can address at least the foregoing issues.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>SUMMARY</u></b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present application describes a child safety seat that includes a seat base having a shell body, and a support leg connected with the shell body.

Exemplary embodiments of the support leg are described in more details hereafter,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> including a support leg 100a as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, a support leg 100b as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, a support leg 100c as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>, and a support leg 100d as shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">FIGS. 1-5</figref> are schematic views illustrating the construction of the support leg 100a. The seat base 200 can have a shell body connected with the support leg 100a. The support leg 100a can include a tubular segment 10 and a foot portion 20. An upper end portion of the tubular segment 10 can be assembled with a shell body of the seat base 200. For example, the upper end portion of the tubular segment 10 can be pivotally connected with the shell body of the seat base 200 via a pivot joint 15. The tubular segment 10 can be affixed with the pivot joint 15, and the pivot joint 15 can include a hole 15a through which a shaft affixed with the seat base 200 can be assembled. The support leg 100a can be thereby operable to rotate relative to the shell body of the seat base 200 between a deployed position extending downward from the shell body for providing support, and a folded position close to the bottom of the shell body for storage.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The tubular segment 10 can extend along a lengthwise axis X of the support leg 100a. The tubular segment 10 can have a lower end portion fixedly assembled with the foot portion 20 via a fastener 30. For example, the tubular segment 10 can be sleeved and fitted at least partially into the foot portion 20, and the fastener 30 can engage through the tubular segment 10 and the foot portion 20. The fastener 30 can be a pin, a rivet, and like elements. The foot portion 20 can be thereby affixed with the tubular segment 10, and act as a support portion for the support leg 100a.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The support leg 100a can also include a cushioning structure that can block displacement of the fastener 30 so that the foot portion 20 is locked in position relative to the tubular segment 10, and to deform or break as a result of a displacement of the fastener<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> 30 along the lengthwise axis X into the cushioning structure when a substantial force is applied that forces the tubular segment 10 to move relative to the foot portion 20 along the lengthwise axis X. When collision happens, a relative displacement can thus occur between the foot portion 20 and the tubular segment 10, i.e., the foot portion 20 can move relative to the tubular segment 10 within a limited range from the first position to a second position so as to dissipate a portion of the collision energy.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In one embodiment, the aforementioned cushioning structure can include two holes 11 and 12, and a cushion portion 13 interposed between the two holes 11 and 12. The two holes 11 and 12 can be formed through the tubular segment 10, and can be spaced apart from each other along the lengthwise axis X of the support leg 100a. The cushion portion 13 can be a material portion of the tubular segment 10 defined between the holes 11 and 12.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">For assembling the support leg 100a, the tubular segment 10 can be partially inserted into the foot portion 20, and the fastener 30 can engage through a hole 21 of the foot portion 20 and the hole 11 of the tubular segment 10. The engagement of the fastener 30 through the holes 21 and 11 can thereby fixedly attach the tubular segment 10 with the foot portion 20, and the cushion portion 13 can block displacement of the fastener 30 from the hole 11 to the hole 12. As a result, relative displacement between the tubular segment 10 and the foot portion 20 can be prevented.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGS. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>, a bottom of the foot portion 20 can include a slot 22, and a side of the foot portion 20 can include a display window 23. The foot portion 20 can also include an indicator member 40 that is assembled through an interior of the foot portion 20. The indicator member 40 can be pivotally with the foot portion 20.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> The indicator member 40 can upwardly extend to the display window 23, and can have an upper end portion provided with two visually distinctive regions: a first region 41 and a second region 42. In addition, the indicator member 40 can have a lower end portion that can extend outward through the slot 22 at the bottom of the foot portion 20.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The interior of the foot portion 20 can also be assembled with a spring 50 that is connected with the indicator member 40. The spring 50 can bias the indicator member 40 toward an initial position where the second region 42 is visible at the display window 23.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">When the support leg 100a is unfolded to a deployed state as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the bottom of the foot portion 20 can rest in contact on a floor surface of the vehicle to provide support for the seat base 200. The lengthwise axis X of the deployed support leg 100a can lie substantially vertical relative to the floor surface. Owing to the contact against the floor surface, the lower end portion can be pushed upward by the floor surface so that the first region 41 is visible at the display window 23. The first region 41 can accordingly indicate that the support leg 100a is properly installed. In case the foot portion 20 of the support leg 100a does not properly contact the floor surface, the second region 42 can remain visible at the display window 23 to indicate that the support leg 100a is not properly deployed. In this manner, the caregiver can easily verify that the support leg 100a is properly installed.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">When the support leg 100a is folded toward the seat base 200, the lower end portion is no longer pushed by the floor surface, and the spring 50 can bias the indicator member 40 to restore the initial position where the second region 42 is visible at the display window 23.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In a normal configuration of use, the support leg 100a can be unfolded to the deployed state as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> to abut against the floor of a vehicle. The support leg 100a can thereby provide support for the seat base 200. In this configuration, the fastener 30 is located at a first position through the hole 11 of the tubular segment 10 and the hole 21 of the foot portion 20.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">When collision occurs, the energy of the collision is such that the tubular segment 10 is forced to move relative to the foot portion 20 (in particular the tubular segment 10 may be forced to move toward the foot portion 20), which causes the fastener 30 to break through the cushion portion 13 and move from the hole 11 to the hole 12 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>. While it travels from the hole 11 to the hole 12, the fastener 30 can be kept engaged through the hole 21 of the foot portion 20, such that the tubular segment 10 moves relative to the foot portion 20 between a first position where the fastener 30 is located in the hole 11 and a second position where the fastener 30 is located in the hole 12. The cushion portion 13 can thereby serve as a sacrificial portion that is broken by the fastener 30 to dissipate at least some of the collision energy applied to the support leg 100a.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0006 f0007 f0008">FIGS. 6-8</figref> are schematic views illustrating another embodiment of a support leg 100b assembled with the seat base 200. Compared to the support leg 100a described previously, the support leg 100b has a cushioning structure that includes a cushion portion having a narrow slot 13' that is interposed between the two holes 11 and 12. The cushion portion can be formed by a material portion of the tubular segment 10. The slot 13' cut through the cushion portion can extend parallel to the lengthwise axis X of the support leg 100b, and can connect with the holes 11 and 12. Moreover, the slot 13' can have a width<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> that is smaller than the width of the fastener 30. Other parts of the support leg 100b may be similar to the support leg 100a described previously.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In a normal configuration of use, the tight engagement of the fastener 30 through the holes 21 and 11 can fixedly attach the tubular segment 10 with the foot portion 20, and the cushion portion can block displacement of the fastener 30 from the hole 11 to the hole 12.
