In such spinning and take-up apparatuses, the spun yarn drawing apparatus includes the plurality of heating rollers for taking-up, drawing, and thermally setting yarns spun out from the melt spinning apparatus, and the take-up winder forms packages by winding yarns drawn by the spun yarn drawing apparatus.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A spun yarn drawing apparatus recited in Patent Literature 1 (International Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2011009498A"><text>2011/009498</text></patcit> (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>)) is arranged such that, two heating rollers for conducting preliminary heating of yarns before drawn are lined up in an up-down direction, and two heating rollers for conducting thermosetting of yarns after drawn are lined up in an up-down direction. The two preliminary heating rollers and the two thermosetting rollers are<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> disposed in a left-right direction. The two preliminary heating rollers are heated to the same temperature, and the two thermosetting heating rollers are heated to the same temperature. The temperature of the thermosetting heating rollers is arranged to be higher than the temperature of the preliminary heating rollers. The yarns spun out from the melt spinning apparatus are wound onto two preliminary heating rollers from below upwards each at a winding angle of 360 degrees or lower, and are then wound onto the two thermosetting heating rollers from below upwards. The two preliminary heating rollers on the upstream are rotated at substantially identical rotation speeds, whereas the two thermosetting heating rollers on the downstream are rotated at substantially identical rotation speeds that are faster than those of the two preliminary heating rollers on the upstream. The yarns running on these heating rollers are heated to a temperature which is equal to or higher than a glass transition temperature by the preliminary heating rollers. The yarns are drawn between the preliminary heating rollers and the thermosetting rollers as the yarn feeding speed of the thermosetting heating roller is faster than that of the preliminary heating roller, and the yarns having been drawn are then thermally set by the thermosetting rollers.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the spun yarn drawing apparatus recited in Patent Literature 1, it is necessary to keep the contacting length between each heating roller and the yarns to be sufficiently long to sufficiently heat the yarns to a predetermined temperature. This can be achieved by increasing the number of heating rollers onto which the yarns are wound or by increasing the diameter of each heating roller onto which the yarns are wound. This, however, is problematic in that high thermal energy is required to heat many heating rollers or large-diameter heating rollers. Furthermore, because the yarns are very thin, the contacting portion between the yarns and each heating roller is very small even if many yarns are wound onto the heating roller. The most part of the surface of each heating roller is therefore not covered with the yarns and exposed, and hence most of the heat of the heating roller intended to heat the yarns is wastefully released and not used for heating the yarns. As such, the use of the thermal energy is inefficient.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An object of the present invention is to provide a spun yarn drawing apparatus with improved heating<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> efficiency, which requires less consumption of heat energy for heating yarns.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to the first aspect of the invention, a spun yarn drawing apparatus includes at least one heating roller configured to draw a yarn spun out from a melt spinning apparatus and a thermal insulation box that houses the at least one heating roller therein, in the thermal insulation box being provided a contacting member that contacts the yarn before the yarn is wound onto the at least one heating roller and does not use a dedicated heat source for heating the contacting member during a stable operation.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the present invention, because the thermal insulation box houses therein the contacting member that contacts the yarns before the yarns are wound onto the at least one heating roller and does not use a dedicated heat source for heating the contacting member during the stable operation, the air inside the thermal insulation box is heated by the heat radiated from the at least one heating roller, and hence the contacting member is heated to a temperature substantially equal to the heated air. By the above-mentioned heated contacting members, the yarns are heated before being supplied to the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> at least one heating roller. This makes it possible to reduce the thermal energy which is required to heat the yarn by the at least one heating roller to the required temperature and shorten the contacting length between the yarn and the heating roller, with the result that the diameter of the at least one heating roller is reduced and the number of the at least one heating roller can be reduced as compared to the conventional spun yarn drawing apparatuses. Because the diameter and the number of the at least one heating roller can be reduced, it is possible to reduce the thermal energy required to heat the at least one heating roller to the heating temperature. Furthermore, because the yarn before drawn is heated by utilizing the heat radiated from the at least one heating roller to the heating of the contacting members, the heat radiated from the at least one heating roller can be effectively utilized and the heating efficiency is improved. It is noted that "stable operation" indicates that the at least one heating roller is at a predetermined temperature and the spun yarn drawing apparatus is ready to draw the yarn.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the second aspect of the invention, the spun yarn drawing apparatus of the first aspect of the invention is arranged so that the contacting member is not<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> provided with any heat source.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the present invention, the structure of the contacting member can be simplified as the contacting member is not provided with any heat source.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to the third aspect of the invention, the spun yarn drawing apparatus of the first or second aspect is arranged so that the contacting member is provided above the at least one heating roller.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the present invention, because the contacting member is provided above the at least one heating roller, the air heated by the heat radiated from the at least one heating roller moves up and hence the temperature in the thermal insulation box becomes high in the upper part thereof. Because the contacting member is heated by high-temperature air, the heat radiated from the at least one heating roller can be further effectively utilized and hence the heating efficiency is improved.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to the fourth aspect of the invention, the spun yarn drawing apparatus of one of first to third aspects is arranged so that the at least one heating rollers having different heating temperatures are provided<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> in the thermal insulation box, and the yarn is wound onto the at least one heating rollers in the order in which the heating temperatures increase.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to the present invention, because the heating rollers having different heating temperatures are housed in the one thermal insulation box, the heat radiated from the heating roller on the downstream having a high heating temperature can be utilized for heating the yarn at the heating roller on the upstream having a low heating temperature, with the result that the heat can be effectively utilized and the heating efficiency is improved.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to the fifth aspect of the invention, the spun yarn drawing apparatus of the fourth aspect is arranged so that the contacting member is provided above one of the at least one heating roller, which one of the at least one heating roller having a high heating temperature.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to the present invention, because the contacting member is provided above the heating roller having a high heating temperature, the contacting member is heated by particularly high-temperature air in the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> space heated by the heat radiated from the heating roller having the high heating temperature, with the result that the heat radiated from the high-heating-temperature heating roller can be further effectively utilized and the heating efficiency is further improved.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the sixth aspect of the invention, the spun yarn drawing apparatus of any one of first to fifth aspects is arranged so that the contacting member is made of a metal.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to the present invention, because the contacting member is made of a metal having high thermal conductivity, the temperature of the surface contacting the yarn is further uniformized. Furthermore, as the thickness of the contacting member is arranged to be as thin as possible, the thermal capacity of the member is reduced and the time required to reach the predetermined temperature is shortened.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the seventh aspect of the invention, the spun yarn drawing apparatus of any one of first to sixth aspects is arranged so that the contacting member is a roller.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> According to the present invention, the yarn contacting the contacting member is less damaged because the contacting member is a roller.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to the eighth aspect of the invention, the spun yarn drawing apparatus of the seventh aspect is arranged so that the contacting member is a hollow cylindrical roller.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to the present invention, because the contacting member is a hollow cylindrical roller, the thermal capacity of the contacting member is small and hence the temperature of the contacting member can be easily increased.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to the ninth aspect of the invention, the spun yarn drawing apparatus of seventh or eighth aspect is arranged so that the yarn is wound onto the contacting member at a winding angle of 90 degrees or larger.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to the present invention, because the yarn is wound onto the contacting member at the winding angle of 90 degrees or larger, the contacting length between the contacting member and the yarn becomes long and hence the yarn is heated with the long contacting length.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to the present invention, because the thermal insulation box houses therein the contacting member that contacts the yarn before it is wound onto the at least one heating roller and does not use a dedicated heat source for heating the contacting member during the stable operation, the air inside the thermal insulation box is heated by the heat radiated from the at least one heating roller, and hence the contacting member is heated to a temperature substantially equal to the heated air. By this heated contacting member, the yarn is heated before being supplied to the at least one heating roller. Therefore, because the thermal energy for heating the yarn to the required temperature by the at least one heating roller is reduced and the contacting length between the yarn and the at least one heating roller is shortened, the diameter and the number of the at least one heating roller can be reduced as compared to the conventional spun yarn drawing apparatuses. Furthermore, because the diameter and the number of the at least one heating roller can be reduced, the thermal energy required to heat the at least one heating roller to the heating temperature can be reduced. Furthermore, because the heat radiated from the at least one heating roller is utilized for heating the contacting member to heat the yarn before drawn, the heat<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> radiated from the at least one heating roller can be effectively utilized and hence the heating efficiency is improved.</p><heading id="h0003">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0025" num="0025"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a front elevation of a spinning and take-up apparatus of an embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a profile of the spinning and take-up apparatus of the embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a front elevation of a spinning and take-up apparatus of a modification.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a front elevation of a spinning and take-up apparatus of another modification.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> shows another example of the contacting plate.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> shows an example of the contacting rollers in an arrangement in which yarns are wound onto the godet rollers more than once.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0004">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p0026" num="0026">The following will describe a preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a front elevation of a spinning and take-up<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> apparatus including a spun yarn drawing apparatus of the embodiment of the present invention, whereas <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a profile of the spinning and take-up apparatus.

Each of the godet rollers 18 to 21 includes a heater therein. The godet rollers 18 to 21 are, for example, formed by chrome-plating the surface of the iron. The godet rollers 18 and 19 (heating rollers with low heating temperatures) are preliminary heating godet rollers for heating the yarns Y before drawn to at least the glass transition temperature. The godet rollers 18 and 19 are set at temperatures of 80 to 100°C because the yarns Y are made up of polyester fibers. The glass transition temperature varies in accordance with the type of the polymer. The godet rollers 20 and 21 (heating<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> rollers with high heating temperatures) are thermosetting godet rollers for thermally setting the drawn yarns Y. The godet rollers 20 and 21 are set at temperatures of 120 to 150°C when the yarns Y are made up of polyester fibers.

The godet roller 20 is provided to be deviated downward and rightward from the godet roller 19. The godet roller 21 is provided to be deviated upward and rightward from the godet roller 20. In other words, the godet rollers 18 to 21 are provided such that the godet rollers 18, 19, 20, and 21 are lined up in this order from left to right, and such that the godet rollers 18, 20, 19, and 21 are lined up in this order upward from below. The yarns Y are wound onto the godet rollers 18 to 21 each at a winding angle of 360 degrees or smaller.

The thermal insulation box 22 prevents the heat generated by the godet rollers 18 to 21 from escaping to the outside. Inside the thermal insulation box 22, the temperature in the upper part is higher than the temperature in the lower part on account of the convection of the heat radiated from the godet rollers 18 to 21. The temperature in the upper part is increased up to, for example, about 90°C.

In this regard, for example, the preliminary heating godet rollers 18 and 19 on the upstream rotate at substantially identical rotation speeds, and also the thermosetting godet rollers 20 and 21 on the downstream rotate at substantially identical rotation speeds. Furthermore, the thermosetting godet rollers 20 and 21 on the downstream rotate at higher rotation speeds than the preliminary heating godet rollers 18 and 19 on the upstream. Because the yarn feeding speeds of the godet rollers 20 and 21 on the downstream are higher than the speeds of the godet rollers 18 and 19 on the upstream, the yarns Y are drawn between the godet rollers 18 and 19 and the godet rollers 20 and 21. The yarns Y having been drawn are thermally set as the yarns Y contact the thermosetting godet rollers 20 and 21, and the yarns Y are sent to the guide rollers 23 and 24 by the rotation of the thermosetting godet rollers 20 and 21.

In this regard, the present invention is arranged so that, in the thermal insulation box 22, the contacting rollers 14 to 17 that do not use any heat source during the stable operation are provided to contact the yarns Y before they are wound onto the godet rollers 18 to 21, and the contacting rollers 14 to 17 heated by the air inside the thermal insulation box 22 heat the yarns Y before they run on the godet rollers 18 to 21.

In the present embodiment, the contacting rollers 14 to 17 are made of aluminum which is a metal having high thermal conductivity and small thermal capacity per unit volume. Furthermore, in the present embodiment, each of the contacting rollers 14 to 17 is arranged to be a thin-walled hollow cylinder in order to reduce the volume of each of the contacting rollers 14 to 17. Each of the contacting rollers 14 to 17 is preferably as thin as possible at the cylindrical part, in consideration of the reduction of the volume.

The phrase above further encompasses not only that a heat source such as an internal heater is not used but also that an outside heat source dedicated to heat the contacting rollers 14 to 17 is not used. It is noted that the contacting rollers 14 to 17 may be driven rollers or drive rollers. The term "stable operation" indicates that the godet rollers 18 to 21 are kept at predetermined temperatures and the spun yarn drawing apparatus 2 is able to draw the yarns Y, i.e., the spinning and take-up apparatus 1 is ready to produce the yarns Y.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In the present embodiment, the contacting rollers 14 to 17 are not provided with any heat source.

Alternatively, for example, the contacting rollers 14 to 17 each having a heat source may be used as if rollers do not having a heat source, in such a way that the contacting rollers 14 to 17 are heated by the heat source only at the time of the cold start after the power down of the apparatus, and the power of the heat source of each of the contacting rollers 14 to 17 is shut off once the temperatures of the godet rollers 18 to 21 reach the stable state temperatures. It is noted that the time duration from the cold start after the power down to the time at which the temperatures of the godet rollers 18 to 21 reach the stable state temperatures (predetermined temperatures) is not regarded as the stable operation. In the stable operation, the temperatures of the godet rollers 18 to 21 have reached the stable state temperatures (predetermined temperatures) and the yarns Y can be drawn by the godet rollers 18 to 21. With the<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> apparatus and the operation above, the stable state is quickly established after the apparatus having been powered down is started, and the production of the yarns can be quickly started and the time required to start the apparatus after it was powered down can be reduced. Furthermore, whether to use the heat source of each of the contacting rollers 14 to 17 may be selectable in accordance with, for example, the type of the yarns to be produced. That is to say, the heat source of each of the contacting rollers 14 to 17 is used when the yarns are thick, i.e., the contacting rollers 14 to 17 are used in a similar manner as the preliminary heating godet rollers 18 and 19 for preliminarily heating the yarns.
