The drier preferably rotates during operation, and the aggregate is fed into a first upper end of the drier and is discharged from a second lower end. In the drier, the aggregate is exposed to heat and is heated to a temperature between 120 and 300 °C, such that the aggregate is dried. The heat is generated by a heat source in the drier. Thereafter, the aggregate is placed in a mixer where a heated binder, which usually is bitumen based, is provided in liquid form. Subsequently, the asphalt mixture is kneaded, at a process temperature of approximately 160 °C, to its final consistency, for subsequent intermediate storage and future spreading.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Today the heat source in the drier oftentimes is a burner, which usually is run on heavy oil, diesel, coal or propane gas. It is important that the temperature in the drier remains equal over the time.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="FR2358966A"><text>FR 2358966 A</text></patcit> an example of a method for producing asphalt is disclosed.

The arrangement 1 comprises a hollow drier drum 2, adapted to hold an aggregate for an asphalt mixture and a heat source 3 arranged in connection with the drier drum 2. The heat source 3 is adapted to heat the drier drum 2, such that the aggregate is heated to a desired temperature. The desired temperature is between 120-300°C, and preferably between 180-280°C. The heat source 3 comprises a pellets combustion device 4 adapted to burn wood or biomass, or pellets, or pulverized pellets, of wood or biomass in order to generate the heat. The drier drum 2 may be provided with an inlet 5 for receiving an aggregate and an outlet 6 for discharging the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> aggregate from the drier drum 2. The pellets, or pulverized pellets, are fed to the pellets combustion device 4 via a supply line 7. The desired temperature is dependent on, e.g. the moisture content of the aggregate. The desired temperature of the aggregate is obtained by regulating the amount of wood or biomass, or pellets, or pulverized pellets, being fed to the pellets combustion device 4.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to one embodiment, the pellets have a predefined fraction.

The second predefined fraction is less than 1 mm. Thus, pulverized pellets of said first predefined fraction 10 having a greater fraction than 1 mm will remain in the pulverizing device 8 until a fraction of less than 1 mm is obtained. Burning pellets, or pulverized pellets with a predefined fraction less than 1 mm is advantageous in that the pellets, or pulverized pellets may be fed to the pellets combustion device 4 in a more precise amount than when feeding the pellets combustion device 4 with pellets, or pulverized pellets having a larger fraction, which ensures that the temperature is kept at an equal level in the drier drum 2 over a time period.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>, the sifting device 9 comprises a wind sifter provided with a first blowing device 12, adapted to generate a first air flow 13 which is adapted to flow through the pulverized pellets of the first predefined fraction 10 in the sifting device 9, such that the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> first air flow 13 forces the second predefined fraction 11 to be separated from the first predefined fraction 10.

The cyclone separator 14 is adapted to exhaust pulverized pellets of the second predefined fraction 11 from the sifting device 9 by suction.

The greater the flow rate is, the larger the fraction of the pulverized pellets obtained is.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In another embodiment, the sifting device 9 comprises a rotary feeder 16 adapted to feed the second predefined fraction 11 to the buffer silo 20.

The arrangement 1 may further comprise a compressor 18 adapted to aid in transporting pellets, or pulverized pellets of the second predefined fraction 11, via said supply line 7, to said pellets combustion means 4, and a feeding means 19 adapted to feed pellets, or pulverized pellets of the second predefined fraction 11 from said dosing device 17 to said supply line 7.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Furthermore, according the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>, the arrangement 1 comprises a buffer silo 20 adapted to store a minimum amount of pellets, or pulverized pellets of said second predefined fraction 11, wherein the minimum amount of pellets, or pulverized pellets of said second predefined fraction 11 being stored is approximately between 5-20 m<sup>3</sup>, and preferably 12 m<sup>3</sup>. Storing a minimum amount of pellets, or pulverized pellets of said second predefined fraction 11 in a buffer silo 20 ensures that an equal amount of pellets, or pulverized pellets of said second predefined fraction 11 is fed to the pellets combustions device 4 over a time period. The buffer silo 20 may further comprise a level regulation device 21 which, depending on the amount of pellets, or pulverized pellets of said second predefined fraction 11 present in the buffer silo 20, regulates the amount of<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> pellets being fed to the pulverizing device 8.
