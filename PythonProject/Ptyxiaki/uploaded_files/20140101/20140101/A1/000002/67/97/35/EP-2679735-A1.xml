The hydraulic shovel includes a crawler-type lower traveling body 1 and an upper slewing body 2 installed on the lower traveling body 1 so as to be slewable about an axis perpendicular to the ground. The upper slewing body 2A is attached with an attachment 9. The working attachment 9 has a boom 3, an arm 4, a bucket 5 which is a working device, a boom cylinder 6 that drives the boom 3, an arm cylinder<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> 7 that drives the arm 4, and a bucket cylinder 8 that drives the bucket 5. The working attachment 9 performs various kinds of work such as excavation, loading, leveling and the like as a result of a single operation or compound operation of raising/lowering of the boom 3, pushing/retracting of the arm 4, i.e. upward/downward pivoting, and excavation (scooping) and return of the bucket 5.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> shows a conventional hydraulic circuit for driving the boom cylinder 6 and the arm cylinder 7. The hydraulic circuit includes: a boom remote control valve 10 and an arm remote control valve 11 for operating the boom cylinder 6 and the arm cylinder 7, respectively; a boom control valve 12 and an arm control valve 13 which are respective hydraulic-pilot-operated selector valves adapted to be operated by receiving pilot pressure outputted by the remote control valves 10, 11; and a tank T and a hydraulic pump 14 which are connected to the boom cylinder 6 and the arm cylinder 7 via the control valves 12, 13, respectively.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The boom control valve 12, which is a control valve for the boom cylinder 6, has a neutral position 12n, a boom raising position 12a and a boom lowering position 12b, and is adapted to be switched between these positions to thereby enable the supply and discharge of pressure fluid to/from the boom cylinder 6 to be controlled. Similarly, the arm control valve 13, which is a control valve for the arm cylinder 7, has a neutral position 13n, an arm retracting position 13a and an arm pushing position 13b, and is adapted to be switched between the positions to thereby enable the supply and discharge of pressure fluid to/from the arm cylinder 7 to be<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> controlled. The boom cylinder 6 has a head-side (extension-side) fluid chamber 6a and a rod-side fluid chamber 6b, and the arm cylinder 7 has a head-side (extension-side) fluid chamber 7a and a rod-side fluid chamber 7b.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">During excavation work by the hydraulic shovel through an arm retracting operation alone of the arm 4, an excavation reaction force acting on the working attachment 9 increases the pressure inside the circuits pertaining to the arm cylinder 7 and acts on the boom 3 upward (in the direction of extending the boom cylinder 6) to increase the rod-side pressure of the boom cylinder 6, i.e. the pressure in the rod-side fluid chamber 6b, and decrease the pressure in the head-side pressure, i.e. the pressure in the head-side fluid chamber 6a. This excavation reaction force brings the vehicle body into a raised state to render the continuation of the excavation work impossible.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">To avoid such an occurrence, ordinarily performed is a boom raising operation in order to relieve the rod-side pressure of the boom cylinder 6 and an operation of letting out the fluid in the rod-side fluid chamber 6b to the tank T via the boom control valve 12. In short, performed is an arm retracting/boom raising compound operation. This operation reduces the rod-side pressure to thereby enable the boom cylinder 6 to bear the excavation reaction force, allowing the excavation work to be continued.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, the operation of the boom control valve 12 to the boom raising position 12a causes a meter-in opening and a meter-out opening of the valve 21 to be opened simultaneously, thus allowing a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> discharge fluid from the hydraulic pump 14 to be flowed into the head-side fluid chamber 6a of the low-pressure boom cylinder 6, that is, allowing the discharge fluid to be supplied to the boom cylinder 6 which essentially requires no fluid. This brings not only energy loss in the circuit but also reduction in the supply amount of the discharge fluid to the arm cylinder 7 (including other hydraulic cylinders such as the bucket cylinder 8 in a case where these other hydraulic cylinders are connected to the hydraulic pump 14) that is driven by the same discharge fluid to reduce power in the arm 4, thereby impairing work efficiency.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The increase in the rod-side pressure and the reduction in the head-side pressure in the boom cylinder 6 occur not only during an arm retracting/boom raising compound operation but also during a compound operation of scooping by the bucket 5 and boom raising for relieving the excavation reaction force derived from scooping. Not limited to the time when the excavation work is performed by the hydraulic shovel, for instance, also when a demolition work is performed by a demolition machine in which an opening and closing-type crushing device called a "nibbler" is attached, in place of the bucket 5, to the leading end of the arm 4, a reaction force during the work can act on the boom cylinder 6 in the direction of extending the cylinder 6, involving the increase in the rod-side pressure and the reduction in the head-side pressure.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As an approach for solving the above problem, Patent Document 1 discloses an art of relieving a rod-side pressure to the head-side fluid chamber of the arm cylinder in a situation of the increase in the rod-side pressure of the boom cylinder and the reduction in the head-side<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> pressure by an excavation reaction force. The art, however, involves narrowing a return passage to a tank from the rod-side fluid chamber of the boom cylinder in order to increase the rod-side pressure of the boom cylinder up to a pressure that can be used as the head-side pressure of the arm cylinder; this gives rise to an adverse effect of generating surplus rod-side pressure in the boom cylinder, upon the extension of the boom cylinder for a work such as horizontal dragging, to increase pressure loss.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2004005727A"><text>WO 2004/005727</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0003">Summary of the Invention</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">It is an object of the present invention to provide a construction machine having a working attachment which includes a boom, a boom cylinder and another hydraulic cylinder, the construction machine being capable of curtailing the supply of discharge fluid from a hydraulic pump to a head-side fluid chamber of the boom cylinder to secure required flow rate at the another hydraulic cylinder while relieving a rod-side pressure of the boom cylinder without incurring significant pressure loss when a reaction force acting on the working attachment as a result of a boom raising operation increases the rod-side pressure and reduce the head-side pressure of the boom cylinder.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The construction machine provided by the present invention comprises: a lower traveling body; an upper slewing body installed on the lower traveling body so as to be slewable; a tank which stores hydraulic fluid; a hydraulic pump which discharges hydraulic fluid from the tank; a working attachment attached to the upper slewing body and having a boom,<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> an arm attached to a leading end of the boom, a working device attached to a leading end of the arm, a boom cylinder which actuates the boom, an arm cylinder which actuates the arm, and a working cylinder which actuates the working device, at least one cylinder of the arm cylinder and the working cylinder which are positioned closer to a leading end of the working attachment than the boom cylinder being a fluid-supplied cylinder which receives a supply of hydraulic fluid from the hydraulic pump, together with the boom cylinder, the attachment being arranged so as to receive a reaction force during work involving extension of the fluid-supplied cylinder, the reaction force acting in a direction of raising the boom to thereby increase a rod-side pressure of the boom cylinder and reduce a head-side pressure thereof; a first operation device which is operated to move the boom cylinder; a second operation device which is operated to move the fluid-supplied cylinder; a first control valve which operates in response to the operation of the first operation device to control a motion of the boom cylinder; a second control valve which operates in response to the operation of the second operation device to control a motion of the fluid-supplied cylinder; a flow-rate-limiting section which limits a supply flow rate from the hydraulic pump to a head-side fluid chamber of the boom cylinder, only when an operation for raising the boom is performed in a situation where the rod-side pressure of the boom cylinder is higher than the head-side pressure thereof; and an anti-cavitation circuit for replenishing the head-side fluid chamber of the boom cylinder with hydraulic fluid from the tank.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><heading id="h0004">Brief Description of the Drawings</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1] Fig. 1</figref> is a diagram showing a hydraulic circuit according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2] Fig. 2</figref> is a diagram showing a hydraulic circuit according to a second embodiment of the present invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3] Fig. 3</figref> is a diagram showing a hydraulic circuit according to a third embodiment of the present invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4] Fig. 4</figref> is a flowchart showing a calculation control operation performed by a controller according to the third embodiment.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5] Fig. 5</figref> is a schematic side-view diagram of a hydraulic shovel that is an example in which the present invention is applied.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6] Fig. 6</figref> is a diagram showing a conventional hydraulic circuit installed in a hydraulic shovel.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Embodiments for Carrying Out the Invention</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">There will be explained embodiments of the present invention with reference to accompanying drawings.

The flow-rate-control valve 16 operates between a fully-open position 16b of maximum opening area and a throttle position 16a having a smaller opening area than that of the fully-open position 16b (in the present embodiment, the throttle position 16a is a maximum-throttle position having the smallest opening area). The fully-open position 16b includes a check valve element which prevents hydraulic fluid from backflow from the head-side fluid chamber 6a to the hydraulic pump 14.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Specifically, the flow-rate-control valve 16 has a first pilot port 161 and a second pilot port 162.

Into the second pilot port 162 is introduced a head-side<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> pressure PH of the boom cylinder 6, acting so as to urge the spool towards the fully-open position 16b. Thus, the flow-rate-control valve 16 is switched to the throttle position 16a only upon the boom raising operation (i.e. the rod-side pressure relief operation) in a situation where the rod-side pressure of the boom cylinder 6, i.e., the pressure in the rod-side fluid chamber 6b, is higher than the head-side pressure, i.e. the pressure in the head-side fluid chamber 6a, while being held at the fully-open position 16b in other cases.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The anti-cavitation circuit 17 is provided between the tank T and the head-side fluid chamber 6a of the boom cylinder 6 to replenish the head-side fluid chamber 6a with hydraulic fluid from the tank T. Specifically, the anti-cavitation circuit 17 includes: a conduit interconnecting the head-side fluid chamber 6a and the tank T; and a check valve provided halfway the conduit to prevent hydraulic fluid from inflow into the tank T. Circuits similar to the anti-cavitation circuit 17 are ordinarily provided also in the rod-side fluid chamber 6b of the boom cylinder 6 and in both fluid chambers 7a, 7b of the arm cylinder 7, but these other circuits have been omitted in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the present circuit, the flow-rate-control valve 16 is switched to the throttle position 16a upon the rod-side pressure relief operation to limit (including block) the fluid supplied to the head-side fluid chamber 6a of the boom cylinder 6 from the hydraulic pump 14, thereby allowing the hydraulic fluid discharged by the hydraulic pump 14 to be supplied exclusively, or at a sufficiently large ratio, to the arm cylinder 7. This increases the excavation power by the arm cylinder 7,<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> enhancing work efficiency accordingly. Specifically, upon the rod-side pressure relief operation, that is, when the boom control valve 12 is switched to the boom raising position 12a in a situation where the rod-side pressure of the boom cylinder 6, i.e., the pressure in the rod-side fluid chamber 6b, is higher than the head-side pressure, i.e., the pressure in the head-side fluid chamber 6a, the difference between the pilot pressure inputted at the first pilot port 161 of the flow-rate-control valve 16, i.e. a compound pressure of the pressure PR in the rod-side fluid chamber 6b and the pilot pressure for boom raising Pi outputted from the boom remote control valve 10, and the pressure PH in the head-side fluid chamber 6a inputted to the second pilot port 162, becomes sufficiently large. The flow-rate-control valve 16 is switched to the throttle position 16a by the pressure difference. The limitation of the flow rate of hydraulic fluid at the throttle position 16a makes the ratio of hydraulic fluid led to the arm cylinder 7, of the hydraulic fluid discharged by the hydraulic pump 14, be sufficiently increased.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the circuit according to the first embodiment, moreover, it is possible to operate the flow-rate-control valve 16 to obtain the flow rate limitation effect by utilization of only the pressures of the circuit, namely, the boom raising pilot pressure Pi from the remote control valve 10, and the rod-side pressure PR and the head-side pressure PH of the boom cylinder 6. In short, pure hydraulic control is possible, which enables simplification of the circuits and cost reduction to be achieved.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Although the pressure in the head-side fluid chamber 6a of the boom cylinder 6 becomes negative, the occurrence of cavitation can be<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> suppressed by the anti-cavitation circuit 17 supplying hydraulic fluid from the tank T to the head-side fluid chamber 6a.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Next will be explained features of a hydraulic circuit according to a second embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In addition to the effect of the first embodiment, the second embodiment elicits yet more reliable prevention of the pressure in the head-side fluid chamber 6a of the boom cylinder 6 from being negative. Specifically, in the first embodiment, the supply of fluid to the head-side fluid chamber 6a of the boom cylinder 6 depends only on the sucking action of hydraulic fluid from the tank T by the anti-cavitation circuit 17, which leaves a possibility of negative pressure in the head-side fluid chamber 6a; in order to dispel this, the circuit according to the second embodiment further includes a communication valve 19.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The communication valve 19 is made up of a hydraulic-pilot-operated selector valve, similarly to the flow-rate-control valve 16, having a first pilot port 191 and a second pilot port 192.

The communicating passage 20 is provided with a check valve 21 for preventing hydraulic fluid from backflow from the head-side fluid chamber 6a to the communication valve 9.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The communication valve 19 has a head-side communication position 19a for shutting off the tank passage 18 halfway and bringing the boom control valve 12 into communication with the head-side fluid<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> chamber 6a of the boom cylinder 6 via the communicating passage 20 and a tank position 19b for opening the tank passage 18. Into the first pilot port 191 are introduced the rod-side pressure PR in the boom cylinder 6 and the pilot pressure Pi for boom raising outputted by the boom remote control valve 10, acting so as to urge a spool of the communication valve 19 to the head-side communication position 19a. Into the second pilot port 192 is introduced the head-side pressure PH of the boom cylinder 6, acting so as to urge the spool towards the tank position 19b. Accordingly, the communication valve 19 is switched to the head-side communication position 19a only during the rod-side pressure relief operation, thereby allowing the return fluid from the head-side fluid chamber 6a of the boom cylinder 6 to be supplied to the head-side fluid chamber 6a of the boom cylinder 6 through the communicating passage 20 and the upstream-side portion of the tank passage 18, that is, performing a regeneration.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In this circuit, during the rod-side pressure relief operation, the communication valve 19 is switched to the head-side communication position 19a to enable hydraulic fluid to be replenished from the rod-side fluid chamber 6b of the boom cylinder 6 into the head-side fluid chamber 6a, that is, regenerated, thus allowing this replenishment to be combined with the replenishment through the suction of the hydraulic fluid by the anti-cavitation circuit 17 from the tank T to thereby enhance the cavitation prevention effect on the head side of the boom cylinder 6. Specifically, during the rod-side pressure relief operation, that is, when the boom control valve 12 is switched to the boom raising position 12a in a situation where the rod-side pressure of the boom cylinder 6, i.e., the pressure in the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> rod-side fluid chamber 6b, is higher than the head-side pressure, i.e., the pressure in the head-side fluid chamber 6a, the difference between the pilot pressure inputted at the first pilot port 191 of the communication valve 19, i.e., the compound pressure of the pressure PR in the rod-side fluid chamber 6b and the pilot pressure Pi for boom raising outputted from the boom remote control valve 10, and the pressure PH in the head-side fluid chamber 6a inputted into the second pilot port 192 becomes sufficiently large. This pressure difference switches the communication valve 19 to the head-side communication position 19a to bring the boom control valve 12 into communication with the head-side fluid chamber 6a. This communication allows hydraulic fluid to be replenished into the head-side fluid chamber 6a (regenerated), which excellently enhance the cavitation prevention effect.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Next will be explained features of a hydraulic circuit according to a third embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In the third embodiment, the prevention of pressure in the head-side fluid chamber 6a from being negative is more reliably established than in the second embodiment. In the second embodiment, there is performed replenishment of hydraulic fluid to the head-side fluid chamber 6a from the rod-side fluid chamber 6b of the boom cylinder 6, that is, regeneration thereof, in order to prevent pressure in the head-side fluid chamber 6a from being negative: in this situation, there exists a surface area difference between the fluid chambers 6a, 6b on account of a piston rod, which makes the flow rate into the head-side fluid chamber 6a be insufficient, only with the regeneration flow rate from the rod-side<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> fluid chamber 6b, thus generating the requirement of compensating the shortfall by the suction through the anti-cavitation circuit 17. The greater the proportion of suction-mediated replenishment, the higher the likelihood of negative pressure occurring in the head-side fluid chamber 6a becomes. Accordingly, the circuit according to the third embodiment is given a function of controlling the opening area (degree of throttling) of the flow-rate-control valve 16 so as to compensate the shortfall of regeneration flow rate from the rod-side fluid chamber 6b to the head-side fluid chamber 6a with hydraulic fluid passing through the flow-rate-control valve 16 from the hydraulic pump 14.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Specifically, the circuit according to the third embodiment comprises a flow-rate-control valve 16' instead of the flow-rate-control valve 16 according to the second embodiment, and, in addition to the constituent elements of the second embodiment, further comprises: pressure sensors 22, 23, 24, 25 as respective detectors which detect the head-side pressure PH and rod-side pressure PR of the boom cylinder 6, a pump pressure PP, which is the discharge pressure of the hydraulic pump 14, and the pilot pressure for boom raising Pi corresponding to the operation amount of the boom raising operation; a controller 26 which controls the opening area of the flow-rate-control valve 16' on the basis of signals outputted by the pressure sensors 22 to 25; and a proportional valve (electromagnetic proportional pressure reducing valve) 27 that enables the controller 26 to operate the flow-rate-control valve 16'.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The flow-rate-control valve 16' has a throttle position 16a and a fully-open position 16b, identically to those of the first and second<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> embodiments, while having only a single pilot port 163 as the pilot port, to which the proportional valve 27 is connected. The proportional valve 27 is interposed between a pilot hydraulic source, not shown, and the pilot port 163, such that the secondary pressure of the proportional valve 27, i.e. the pilot pressure inputted at the pilot port 163, is operated according to a control signal outputted by the controller 26. The secondary pressure, i.e. the pilot pressure, acts so as to urge a spool of the flow-rate-control valve 16' towards the throttle position 16a, such that the opening area at the flow-rate-control valve 16' changes in accordance with the above pilot pressure. The controller 26 and the proportional valve 27, thus, make up a flow-rate-control device which adjusts the opening area of the flow-rate-control valve 16', on the basis of the pressures PH, PR, PP and Pi detected by the pressure sensors 22 to 25, to thereby control the flow rate.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Next will be explained a specific calculation control operation performed by the controller 26 with reference to the flowchart of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In step S1, there are detected the boom head-side pressure PH, the rod-side pressure PR, the boom raising pilot pressure Pi and the pump pressure PP.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In step S2, the controller 26 performs a calculation (1): calculating a meter-in opening area Ain and a meter-out opening area Aout of the boom control valve 12 at the boom raising position 12a.

In this case, it is preferable that: the flow-rate-limiting section includes a hydraulic-pilot-operated flow-rate-control valve provided in a head-side supply conduit interconnecting the hydraulic pump and the head-side fluid chamber of the boom cylinder, the hydraulic-pilot-operated flow-rate-control valve having a fully-open position of maximum opening area and a throttle position of smaller opening area than the opening area of the fully-open position; the flow-rate-control valve has a first pilot port into which the rod-side pressure of the boom cylinder and the pilot pressure for boom raising outputted by the remote control valve that makes up the first operation device, and a second pilot port into which the head-side pressure of the boom cylinder is introduced; and the flow-rate-control valve is configured to be switched to the throttle position by a difference between respective pressures introduced into both of the pilot ports, only when an operation of raising the boom is performed in a situation where the rod-side pressure of the boom cylinder is higher than the head-side pressure thereof. The use of the flow-rate-limiting valve makes it possible to switch between flow rate limitation and lifting of the<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> limitation by utilization of only circuit pressures, namely, the boom raising pilot pressure from the remote control valve making up the first operation device and the rod-side pressure and the head-side pressure of the boom cylinder, that is, to perform pure hydraulic control, thereby permitting simplification of the circuits and reduction in costs to be achieved.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">More preferably, the construction machine according to the present invention further includes a regeneration circuit for supplying return fluid from a rod-side fluid chamber of the boom cylinder to the head-side fluid chamber of the boom cylinder during the boom raising operation in a situation where the rod-side pressure of the boom cylinder is higher than the head-side pressure thereof. This regeneration circuit enables hydraulic fluid to be supplied to the head-side fluid chamber of the boom cylinder not only by suction of hydraulic fluid from the tank by the anti-cavitation circuit but also by the utilization of the return fluid from the rod side to the head side, that is, by regeneration thereof, thereby permitting the head-side pressure of the boom cylinder to be restrained from being negative pressure.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In the construction machine provided with the regeneration circuit, it is preferable that the construction machine further includes respective detectors which detect the head-side pressure and rod-side pressure of the boom cylinder, a discharge pressure of the hydraulic pump, and an operation amount of the first operation device and a flow-rate-control device which varies the flow rate to be limited by the flow-rate-limiting section, wherein the flow-rate-control device performs:<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> calculating a flow rate of hydraulic fluid which can be regenerated from the rod-side fluid chamber to the head-side fluid chamber of the boom cylinder during the boom raising operation in a situation where the rod-side pressure of the boom cylinder is higher than the head-side pressure thereof; calculating a required flow rate of hydraulic fluid to be supplied to the head-side fluid chamber in accordance with an area ratio of the boom cylinder, on the basis of the flow rate of hydraulic fluid flowing out of the rod-side fluid chamber of the boom cylinder; calculating a required pump flow rate of hydraulic fluid to be supplied from the hydraulic pump to the head-side fluid chamber of the boom cylinder in order to prevent cavitation; calculating a flow rate, or a parameter corresponding thereto, for the flow-rate-limiting section, out of the required pump flow rate; and operating the flow-rate-limiting section so as to obtain a flow rate corresponding to the calculated flow rate or the calculated parameter. The detectors and the flow-rate-control device make it possible to secure a flow rate required for cavitation avoidance on the head side of the boom cylinder and thus reliably prevent cavitation from occurrence.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977365" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A construction machine, comprising:
