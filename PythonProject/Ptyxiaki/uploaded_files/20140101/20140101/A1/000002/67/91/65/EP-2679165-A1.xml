The elasticity information is any one of distortion, a modulus of elasticity, a coefficient of viscosity, and displacement. Further, the ultrasonic diagnostic device includes an image superimposing uniting unit 24 configured to adjust the tomographic image and the elasticity image to match the display of the image display unit 26 and superimpose the tomographic image and the elasticity image or display the tomographic image and the elasticity image in parallel to superimposing unite the tomographic image and the elasticity image and the image display unit 26 configured to display an image output from the image superimposing uniting unit 24.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> Further, the ultrasonic diagnostic device includes a superimposed region detecting unit 38 configured to detect a superimposed region for the tomographic image formed by the tomographic image forming unit 20 and the elasticity image formed by the elasticity image forming unit 34 and a tomographic image correcting unit 40 configured to correct the tomographic image in the superimposed region for the tomographic image and the elasticity image detected by the superimposed region detecting unit 38.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Further, the ultrasonic diagnostic device includes an operation unit 42 for giving an instruction to an image control unit 44 and the image control unit 44 configured to communicate control information based on the instruction from the operation unit 42 to the elasticity information calculating unit 32 and the image superimposing uniting unit 24.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Here, each of the components of the ultrasonic diagnostic device is explained more in detail. The ultrasonic probe 12 is formed by disposing a plurality of oscillators. The ultrasonic probe 12 has a function of transmitting and receiving ultrasound to and from the object 10 via the oscillator.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> The transmitting unit 14 has a function of generating a wave transmission pulse for driving the ultrasonic probe 12 to generate ultrasound and setting a convergent point of the ultrasound to be transmitted to certain depth. The receiving unit 16 amplifies, with a predetermined gain, a reflected echo signal based on the ultrasound received by the ultrasonic probe 12 and generates an RF signal, i.e., a wave reception signal. The phasing addition unit 18 receives the RF signal amplified by the receiving unit 16, subjects the RF signal to phase control, forms an ultrasonic beam with respect to one or a plurality of convergent points, and generates RF signal frame data.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The tomographic image forming unit 20 receives the RF signal frame data from the phasing addition unit 18, performs signal processing such as gain correction, log compression, wave detection, edge enhancement, and filter processing and obtains a tomographic image.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The RF signal frame data selecting unit 28 stores a plurality of RF signal frame data from the phasing addition unit 18 and selects one set of, i.e., two RF signal frame data from the stored RF signal frame data group. For example, RF signal frame data generated in time series, i.e., on the basis of a frame rate of an image from the phasing addition unit 18 is sequentially<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> stored in the RF signal frame data selecting unit 28. The RF signal frame data selecting unit 28 selects stored RF signal frame data (N) as first data and, at the same time, selects one RF signal frame data (X) out of an RF signal frame data group (N-1, N-2, N-3 ... N-M) stored temporally in the past. Here, N, M, and X are index numbers affixed to the RF signal frame data and are natural numbers.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The displacement measuring unit 30 performs one-dimensional or two-dimensional correlation processing or the like from the selected one set of RF signal frame data (N) and RF signal frame data (X) and calculates a one-dimensional or two-dimensional displacement distribution concerning displacement and moving vectors, i.e., directions and magnitudes of the displacement in the biological tissue corresponding to respective points of the tomographic image. Here, a block matching method is used for detection of the moving vectors. The block matching method is a method of dividing an image into blocks formed by, for example N×N pixels and, focusing on the block in a region of interest, finding a block most approximate to the focused block from a preceding frame, and determining a sampled value through predictive coding, i.e., differential referring to the found block.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> The elasticity information calculating unit 32 calculates distortions or moduli of elasticity of the biological tissue corresponding to the respective points on the tomographic image from a measurement value, for example, the displacement output from the displacement measuring unit 30 and a pressure value output from a pressure measuring unit 46. A reference plasmodium (not shown in the figure) can be set on a surface of the ultrasonic probe 12 and the pressure measuring unit 46 can measure a pressure value from a degree of deformation of the reference plasmodium deformed by pressing the object 10.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">At this point, the distortion is calculated by subjecting, for example, the displacement of the biological tissue to space differential. The modulus of elasticity is calculated by dividing a change in pressure by a change in distortion. For example, when displacement measured by the displacement measuring unit 30 is represented as L(X) and pressure measured by the pressure measuring unit 46 is represented as P(X), distortion ΔS(X) can be calculated by subjecting L(X) to space differential. Therefore, the distortion ΔS(X) is calculated using an equation ΔS(X)=ΔL(X)/ΔX. A modulus of elasticity Ym(X) is calculated by an equation Ym=(ΔP(X))/ΔS(X). Moduli of elasticity of the biological tissue equivalent to the respective points of the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> tomographic image are calculated from the modulus of elasticity Ym.
