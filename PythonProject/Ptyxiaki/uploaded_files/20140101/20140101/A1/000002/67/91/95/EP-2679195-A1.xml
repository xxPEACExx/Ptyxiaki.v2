Field of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a locking taper abutment, and more particularly to a locking taper abutment with a weakened zone.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>2. Description of the Related Art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, it shows a schematic view of a conventional locking taper abutment and implant. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, it shows a combined schematic view of the conventional locking taper abutment and implant. The locking taper connection is a connecting type for combining the abutment and the implant. The conventional locking taper abutment 10 includes a first portion 11, a second portion 12 and a third portion 13. The conventional implant 20 includes an opening 21.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The first portion 11 of the conventional locking taper abutment 10 is a tapered structure, and the angle (b) of the first portion 11 is a little bit bigger than the angle (a) of the opening 21. An appropriately small difference between the angles (a) and (b) can effectively connect the conventional locking taper abutment 10 and the implant 20. The advantages of the locking taper connection are that it is a simple structure, clinically easy to manipulate, good bacterial closure and no foul odor occurred after clinical use.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, it shows a schematic view of the fractured conventional locking taper abutment. Because generally a narrower implant accommodates a narrower abutment, fracture of the abutment may take place clinically. A fracture often occurs near the top of the opening 21 of the implant 20, therefore the fractured first portion 11 remained in the opening 21 of the implant 20 can not be taken out directly by an instrument. It needs to drill the remained first portion 11 through and then take it out.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Such an operation is not only clinically difficult, but it may also destroy the bacterial closure if inner wall of the implant 20 is hurt.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The object of the invention is to provide a locking taper abutment with a weakened zone so that the remained portion of the fractured abutment can be taken out by an instrument directly, and the opening wall of the dental implant will not be hurt. To achieve the object of the invention, the invention utilizes the following technology.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention provides a locking taper abutment with a weakened zone, including: a first portion, a second portion and a third portion. The first portion is used for disposing inside an opening of a dental implant.

The third portion is connected to the second portion, and is used for joining with a dental prosthesis.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Compared with the conventional technology, the invention has the following advantage. Since the second portion is not connected into the opening of the dental implant and the structurally weakened zone is so designed, possible fracture of the locking taper abutment occurs at the structurally weakened zone. Therefore the remained second portion protrudes from the opening of the dental implant after the locking taper abutment is fractured. The remained second portion can be taken out by an instrument directly. Thus it reduces the difficulty of clinical operation obviously. Furthermore, the opening wall of the dental implant will not be hurt, and the bacterial closure of the dental implant will not be destroyed.</p><heading id="h0005"><b><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic view of a conventional locking taper abutment and an implant;<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> shows a combined schematic view of the conventional locking taper abutment and the implant;</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> shows a schematic view of the fractured conventional locking taper abutment and the implant;</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> shows a schematic view of a locking taper abutment with a weakened zone and a dental implant according to a first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> shows a schematic view of the fractured locking taper abutment and the dental implant according to the first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> shows a schematic view of a locking taper abutment with a weakened zone and a dental implant according to a second embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> shows a schematic view of a locking taper abutment with a weakened zone and a dental implant according to a third embodiment of the present invention; and</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> shows a schematic view of a locking taper abutment with a weakened zone and a dental implant according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention.</p><heading id="h0006"><b><u>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">Before the description of the invention, some terminology must be clearly defined. The term "lower" is not related to gravity, it means in deeper bone, and "upper" means it's proximal to gingiva or a prosthesis.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, it shows a schematic view of a locking taper abutment with a weakened zone and a dental implant according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The locking taper abutment 30 with a weakened zone of the present invention includes a first portion 31, a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> second portion 32 and a third portion 33. The first portion 31 is used for disposing inside an opening 21 of a dental implant 20. In this embodiment, the first portion 31 is installed entirely into the opening 21 of the dental implant 20. The first portion 31 is a tapered structure, and the angle (b) of the first portion 31 is a little bit bigger than the angle (a) of the opening 21 of the dental implant 20. Since the first portion 31 is connected to the opening 21 of the dental implant 20 with a specific size, the diameter and length of the first portion 31 is specific.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The second portion 32 is connected to the first portion 31 and has a structurally weakened zone 321 so as to enable the possible fracture of the locking taper abutment 30 to occur at the structurally weakened zone 321. In this embodiment, the structurally weakened zone 321 includes at least one recess section extending inwardly from an outer edge of the second portion 32. The structural strength of the structurally weakened zone 321 is smaller than that of the first portion 31, and the structural weakened level must enable the possible fracture of the locking taper abutment 30 to occur at the structurally weakened zone 321, not at the first portion 31.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In this embodiment, the second portion 32 further includes a bottom area 323, a middle area 324 and a top area 325. The bottom area 323 is connected to the first portion 31. The middle area 324 is connected to the bottom area 323, and the structurally weakened zone 321 is mounted on the middle area 324. The top area 325 is connected to the middle area 324, and the outer diameter of the top area 325 is gradually enlarged so as to connect to the third portion 33.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The third portion 33 is connected to the top area 325 of the second portion 32, and is used for joining with a dental prosthesis (not shown in the figures).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In this embodiment, the locking taper abutment 30 of the invention further includes at least one clamp groove 322 mounted on the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> second portion 32 and disposed between the structurally weakened zone 321 and the first portion 31 to facilitate an instrument to clamp on the clamp groove 322. The structural strength of the clamp groove 322 has to be larger than that of the structurally weakened zone 321.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, it shows a schematic view of the fractured locking taper abutment and the dental implant according to the first embodiment of the present invention. After the locking taper abutment 30 is fractured at the structurally weakened zone 321, the remained second portion 32 protrudes from the opening 21 of the dental implant 20. Therefore, the remained second portion 32 can be taken out directly by an instrument (not shown in the figures) so as to reduce the difficulty of clinical operation obviously. Furthermore, the opening wall of the dental implant 20 will not be hurt, and the bacterial closure of the dental implant 20 will not be destroyed. Additionally, the clamp groove 322 can facilitate the instrument to clamp on so as to take out the remained second portion 32 and first portion 31.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, it shows a schematic view of a locking taper abutment with a weakened zone and a dental implant according to a second embodiment of the present invention.
