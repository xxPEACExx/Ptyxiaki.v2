First, second, and/or third force dissipaters 21, 22, and/or 23 are configured to deform at a predetermined deformation rate when exposed to the external impact force 20. The resulting deformation reduces the impact of the child's head as it is moves in the direction the side-wing panel 31, 32. The deformation also minimizes the acceleration of the child's head in the direction opposite of the impact force 20 during a subsequent recoil force 18.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Energy-dissipation system 16 minimizes acceleration of a child's head by reducing the distance of travel for a child's head and by absorbing impact energy to minimize deflection forces after a child's head has impacted energy-dissipation system 16. As seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1-3</figref>, under normal riding conditions, the head and body of a child riding in the juvenile vehicle seat 10 align with a center-line axis C of juvenile vehicle seat 10. As show in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1-3</figref>, center-line axis C is substantially perpendicular to the seat bottom 12 of juvenile vehicle seat 10.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1-3</figref>, the angle and movement of the head and body of a child seated in juvenile vehicle seat 10 can be represented in part by a head-line axis H and a body-line axis B. For example, head-line axis H in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1-3</figref> identifies an axis that extends through the middle of the child's head and substantially represents the vertical center of mass for the child's head. Similarly, body-line axis B in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1-3</figref> identifies an axis that extends through the middle of the child's body and substantially represents the vertical center of mass for the child's body. Prior to a collision, the child's head-line axis H and body-line axis B are coplanar with center-axis line C.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">During a collision or other incident, application of an external impact force 20 to juvenile vehicle seat 10 causes juvenile vehicle seat 10 to move in the direction of impact force 20 relative to an occupant. As a result of this movement, the occupant's head-line axis H and body-line axis B move toward first force dissipater 21. Such movement causes occupant to move toward and engage first force dissipater 21. This impact causes energy to be transferred from the impacting object (such as the<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> occupant's head) to first force dissipater 21, as suggested in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">Figs. 1-4</figref>. First force dissipater 21 absorbs that transferred energy to minimize the magnitude of a resulting force applied to a child seated in juvenile vehicle seat 10 during the collision. First force dissipater 21 functions to minimize the g-loads (acceleration) experienced by the child seated on seat bottom 12 of juvenile vehicle seat 10 during exposure of juvenile vehicle seat 10 to external impact force 20 as suggested in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1-3</figref>. First force dissipater 21 also functions to maximize the time interval (i.e., ride-down time) between the moment the impacting object strikes force dissipater 21 and the moment that resulting force reaches zero.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">As illustrated fully in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs 6A-6F</figref>, inclusion of first and second force dissipaters 21 and 22 in energy-dissipation system 16 also minimizes the distance of travel for a child's head during a collision. Prior to a collision, a child's head and body are generally positioned to be aligned with center-line axis C, as seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">6A</figref>. Immediately following a collision, the juvenile vehicle seat 10 will be moved in the direction of the impact force 20 relative to the child, causing the child's upper body and head to move in the direction of first force dissipater 21. Energy-dissipation system 16 minimizes the distance of travel of a child's head from a first, resting position aligned with center-line axis C as seen in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig 6A</figref>, to a second, angled position when the child's head engages with first force dissipater 21 after the external impact force 20 has been applied as seen in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6C</figref>. In addition, if there is a substantial recoil force 18 from the child's head when it rebounds or deflects from engagement with first force dissipater 21, energy-dissipation system 16 minimizes the distance of travel for a child's head from the second, angled position as seen in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6C</figref> to a third, counter-angled position engaging with second force dissipater 22 as a result of recoil force 18 in a direction opposite of first force dissipater 21, as seen in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6F</figref>.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Energy-dissipation system 16 also minimizes the maximum difference between a child's head-line axis C and body-line axis B during a collision.

In this way, first force dissipater 21 limits the angle or degree of movement of the child's body-line axis B away from center-line axis C and the child's head-line axis H. As the child's head continues to move toward first force dissipater 21, the angle between the child's head-line axis H and body-line axis B continues to shrink because<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> the child's body-line axis B is held in place by first force dissipater 21, thereby reducing g-loads or other similar forces on the child's head, such as whiplash.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">As suggested in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 7</figref>, first force dissipater 21 includes a first pad foundation 213 coupled to the seat backrest 24 and a first ride-down pad 211.
