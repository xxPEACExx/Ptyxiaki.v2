It is used to transport a small amount of gasoline or diesel fuel from a nearby service station to be poured into the fuel tank. It has the distinct feature of a structural configuration specifically designed to meet all of the requirements of the diverse applicable standards for said type of transport in containers used for this purpose.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">The field of application of the present invention falls within the sector of the industry dedicated to manufacturing plastic containers and bags, focussing mainly on the area of bags designed to hold liquids, and especially flammable liquids and fuels.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">As references to the state of the art, it must be pointed out that diverse types of bags are known in the market of the type at issue herein, among which should be mentioned those disclosed in documents MU9400345, MU200600305 or MU20082665, which, while suitably fulfilling the function of substituting the need to carry jerry cans or similar large containers, have significant safety issues, especially in relation to the system for pouring the liquid contained in the bag into the tank of the vehicle, as well as aspects that can be improved, such<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> as the resistance of the bag itself and the ease in maintaining it upright so that it can be easily filled.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The purpose of the present invention is to provide the market with a new improved emergency bag, regarding which it should be mentioned that the applicant is unaware of the existence of any similar invention that has technical, structural and constitutive features similar to those of the present bag disclosed herein.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Thus, the emergency bag for transporting liquids, especially fuel, proposed by the invention comprises a notable novelty in its field of application, given that its exhaustive implementation fulfils the aforesaid purpose; the characteristic details being what distinguish it from the known art, duly compiled in the final claims accompanying the present document.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Specifically, the invention proposes a bag made of flexible thermoplastic material designed so that in an emergency the user can transport petrol or diesel fuel manually. It comprises an inner bag made up of polyethylene film sheets welded together at the edges and equipped with a heat-welded rigid gland for easy filling, a thicker plastic outer bag containing an inner bag, and a handle for easy transport. The design has been specifically researched in order to create a seating base that enables the set of both bags to remain upright with the gland of the inner bag at the top in order to facilitate filling. Said outer bag has a suitably sized hole so that said gland of the inner bag can emerge.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Furthermore, the assembly is completed with a pouring cap that engages the gland by pressure after the bag is filled. As a safety means, once the stopper has been inserted into the gland it can not be removed again. This provides an easy and practical solution which, besides ensuring an hermetic seal during transport of the liquid fuel in order to avoid spills because its mouth is closed, enables pouring the fuel into the tank of the vehicle easily and safely.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">For this, said pouring cap, made of rigid plastic material, has a conical tubular shape and at its end or mouth, which as previously indicated is closed in principle, has been provided a pre-cut to facilitate breaking right before pouring, thus guaranteeing a single use of the bag.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Finally, it may be pointed out that the group of elements comprising the proposed emergency bag includes packaging or wrapping for keeping it together, thus forming an emergency kit. Said packaging serves for inserting the bag after it has been used and emptied and depositing it in the recycling container for plastic material in a clean and safe manner.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Thus it is evident that the disclosed emergency bag for transporting liquids, especially fuel, is an innovative structure unknown until now, with structural and constitutive features for the purpose for which it is designed, reasons that, together with its practical utility, endow it with sufficient grounds to obtain the privilege of exclusivity that is sought.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">To complement the description being provided and for the purpose of contributing to a better understanding of the features of the invention, attached to the present document and as an integral part thereof, is a set of drawings having a non limiting illustrative character that depict the following:

Continuing with said <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 2</figref>, it can also be seen how gland (4) has a rear fin (15) that enables it to form a weld to the inside part of inner bag (2), and how said inner bag (2) is joined to outer bag (5) by means of top weld points (16).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Thus, thanks to the design of outer bag (5), when it is filled with liquid, a seat base is formed that enables the assembly to remain firm with the gland at the top part as displayed in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">With regard to pouring cap (10) as can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 4</figref>, it has a conical tubular configuration and is made of a plastic material having a rigid character, has gland (4) for obtaining its pressure welded assembly, which is circular and has a coupling base (11) having slightly smaller dimensions than the internal diameter of said gland (4), in such a way that it penetrates tightly inside it, having said base a projection (17) apt to fit into a recess inside of said gland (4) designed for said purpose, and having a peripheral fin (12) superimposed on the perimeter of the gland (4).</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Pouring cap (10) furthermore, has on its opposite end, which constitutes the mouthpiece for pouring the liquid, a pre-cut (13) to facilitate breaking the tip (14) of said end when having to pour.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Having sufficiently described the nature of the present invention, as well as the manner to put into practice, a more extensive explanation is not deemed needed for a person skilled in the art to be able to understand its scope and the advantages that it provides, while stating that within its essence it will be possible to put into practice other forms of embodiments that may differ in detail from those indicated as examples, and which will likewise reach the protection that is obtained, as long as its main principle is not altered, changed or modified.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977061" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Emergency bag for transporting liquids, especially fuel, of the type made with flexible thermoplastic material having a gland for introducing the poured liquid and with a handle for facilitating transport, <b>characterised in that</b> it comprises:
