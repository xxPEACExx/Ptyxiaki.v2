A working mechanism for carrying out an excavating work or the like is liftably provided on the front part side of the upper revolving structure.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The upper revolving structure has a revolving frame forming a firm support structural body, the working mechanism is mounted on the front end side of the revolving frame, and a counterweight holding weight balance with the working mechanism is removably mounted on the rear end side. An engine for driving a hydraulic pump is mounted on the revolving frame, as locating on the front side of the counterweight.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Here, a diesel engine is generally used for the engine of the hydraulic excavator. This diesel engine exhausts harmful<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> substances such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and the like. Thus, in the hydraulic excavator, an exhaust gas post-treatment device for applying purification treatment of the exhaust gas is provided in the middle of an exhaust gas passage of the engine.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">This exhaust gas post-treatment device is composed of treatment devices such as a particulate matter trapping filter device (hereinafter referred to as a PM trapping filter device) for trapping and removing the particulate matter (PM) in the exhaust gas, a nitrogen oxide purifying device (hereinafter referred to as an NOx purifying device) for purifying the nitrogen oxides (NOx) by using a urea water solution or a selective reduction catalyst, oxidation catalyst for oxidation removal of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) and the like.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Incidentally, in a hydraulic excavator of a rear small-revolving type suitably used for an excavating work in an urban district and the like, a counterweight is arranged close to the revolving center in order to keep a revolving radius of the upper revolving structure small. Thus, a device accommodating space formed on the front side of the counterweight becomes narrow, and it is difficult to accommodate treatment devices such as the PM trapping filter device, the NOx purifying device and the like constituting the exhaust gas post-treatment device other than devices such as an engine, a heat exchanger and the like in this narrow device accommodating space.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In order to handle this difficulty, a hydraulic excavator in which a recessed portion is provided on the upper surface side of the counterweight is proposed. This hydraulic excavator has<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the PM trapping filter device fixed to the engine disposed on the front side of the counterweight and the NOx purifying device fixed to the recessed portion of the counterweight (Patent Document 1).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In this hydraulic excavator according to a conventional art, an exhaust pipe of an engine is connected to the PM trapping filter device, and the PM trapping filter device and the NOx purifying device are connected to each other through a pipe. It is so configured that the particulate matter contained in the exhaust gas from the engine is trapped by the PM trapping filter device and the nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas is purified by the NOx purifying device.</p><heading id="h0003">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT DOCUMENT</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2009184558A"><text>2009-184558 A</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">Incidentally, when the hydraulic excavator is transported to a work site or the like, such a method is employed that the working mechanism and the counterweight which are heavy articles are usually removed from a vehicle body (the upper revolving structure) and these working mechanism, the counterweight, and the vehicle body are loaded individually on a transport vehicle such as a trailer and transported to the work site.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Here, when the vehicle body from which the working mechanism and the counterweight have been removed is to be loaded<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> on the transport vehicle, the engine of the vehicle body is operated while the working mechanism and the counterweight are removed. After that, the vehicle body is self-propelled to a loading platform of the transport vehicle by driving the lower traveling structure, and the vehicle body is fixed to the loading platform.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the hydraulic excavator according to the above described conventional art, the PM trapping filter device constituting the exhaust gas post-treatment device is mounted on the engine, and the NOx purifying device is mounted on the counterweight. Therefore, in this hydraulic excavator, the NOx purifying device has to be removed from the PM trapping filter device at a stage prior to removal of the counterweight from the vehicle body.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">However, in the case of the hydraulic excavator on which the exhaust gas post-treatment device is mounted, it is usually configured that, if any one of the various treatment devices constituting the exhaust gas post-treatment device is removed from an exhaust passage of the engine, that is, if it is detected that the exhaust gas post-treatment device is not properly functioning, operation of the engine is not allowed or an alarm sound is emitted. Thus, there is a problem that a loading work becomes difficult if the vehicle body from which the counterweight has been removed is to be self-propelled and loaded on the transport vehicle.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Moreover, when the counterweight is to be removed from the vehicle body, a work of removing the NOx purifying device from the PM trapping filter device (removal from the exhaust passage of the engine) is required. On the other hand, when the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> counterweight is to be mounted on the vehicle body, a work of connecting the NOx purifying device to the PM trapping filter device (incorporating into the exhaust passage of the engine) is required. As described above, when the hydraulic excavator according to the conventional art is transported, troublesome works such as attachment/removal of the NOx purifying device to/from the PM trapping filter device are involved. Therefore, there is a problem that workability when the hydraulic excavator is transported to the work site is lowered.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In view of the above-described conventional art problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a construction machine in which the exhaust gas post-treatment device can properly function even if the counterweight is removed from the vehicle body.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">(1) In order to solve the above described problems, the present invention is applied to a construction machine comprising: an automotive vehicle body; a working mechanism provided on the front part side of the vehicle body; a counterweight removably provided on the rear part side of the vehicle body in order to hold weight balance with the working mechanism; an engine mounted on the vehicle body located on the front side of the counterweight; and an exhaust gas post-treatment device provided in the middle of an exhaust gas passage of the engine and configured to apply purification treatment to an exhaust gas by using a single treatment device or by connecting a plurality of treatment devices.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">A characteristic of the present invention is that at least one treatment device constituting the exhaust gas post-treatment<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> device is configured to be fixed to the counterweight when the counterweight is mounted on the vehicle body; and a treatment device support member for supporting the at least one treatment device is provided on one member of the engine and the vehicle body when the counterweight is removed from the vehicle body.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">With this arrangement, in a state in which the counterweight is mounted on the vehicle body while the construction machine is operating, at least one treatment device in the treatment devices constituting the exhaust gas post-treatment device can be mounted on the counterweight. On the other hand, when the counterweight is to be removed from the vehicle body in transport of the construction machine or the like, the treatment device mounted on the counterweight can be supported by the treatment device support member provided on one member of the engine and the vehicle body. Therefore, even if the counterweight has been removed from the vehicle body, there is no need to remove the treatment device from the exhaust passage of the engine, and the exhaust gas post-treatment device can properly function all the time.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As a result, in transport of the construction machine, for example, even in a state in which the counterweight is removed from the vehicle body, by normally operating the engine, the vehicle body of the construction machine can be self-propelled to the loading platform of the transport vehicle. Moreover, a work of removing the treatment device from the exhaust passage of the engine when the counterweight is to be removed from the vehicle body and a work of incorporating the treatment device in the exhaust passage of the engine when the counterweight is<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> to be mounted on the vehicle body can be made unnecessary. Therefore, workability when transporting the construction machine to the work site can be improved.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">(2) According to the present invention, the treatment device support member has a vehicle-body side fixing portion to be fixed to one member of the engine and the vehicle body and a weight-side fixing portion extending from the vehicle-body side fixing portion toward the counterweight; and it is so configured that when the counterweight is to be removed from the vehicle body, the vehicle-body side fixing portion of the treatment device support member is mounted on the one member, and the at least one treatment device is mounted on the weight-side fixing portion of the treatment device support member.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">With this arrangement, by mounting the treatment device on the weight-side fixing portion of the treatment device support member while the vehicle-body side fixing portion of the treatment device support member is mounted on one member of the engine and the vehicle body, the treatment device having been mounted on the counterweight can be mounted on the one member through the treatment device support member. Therefore, at the stage prior to the removal of the counterweight from the vehicle body, the treatment device removed from the counterweight can be supported with respect to the one member, and thus, only the counterweight can be removed from the vehicle body while the treatment device is kept incorporated in the exhaust passage of the engine.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">(3) According to the present invention, it is so configured that a support member storage portion for storing the treatment device support member removed from the one member of the engine<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> and the vehicle body is provided on the counterweight when the counterweight is mounted on the vehicle body.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">With this arrangement, even if it is no longer necessary to support the treatment device by the treatment device support member by mounting the counterweight on the vehicle body and by mounting the treatment device on this counterweight, the treatment device support member can be kept stored in the support member storage portion of the counterweight. As a result, loss of the treatment device support member can be reliably avoided, and when the counterweight is removed from the vehicle body, the treatment device can be reliably mounted on one member of the engine and the vehicle body by using the treatment device support member.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">(4) According to the present invention, it is so configured that, between the one member of the engine and the vehicle body and the vehicle-body side fixing portion of the treatment device support member, a spacer that removably mounted between the both is provided; when the counterweight is removed from the vehicle body, the vehicle-body side fixing portion of the treatment device support member is mounted on the one member through the spacer, and the at least one treatment device is mounted on the weight-side fixing portion of the treatment device support member; and when the counterweight is mounted on the vehicle body, a gap is formed between the vehicle-body side fixing portion of the treatment device support member and the one member by removing the spacer, and the weight-side fixing portion of the treatment device support member is mounted on the counterweight together with the at least one treatment device.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">With this arrangement, if the spacer is provided between the one member of the engine and the vehicle body and the vehicle-body side fixing portion of the treatment device support member, the vehicle-body side fixing portion of the treatment device support member can be integrally mounted on the one member. Moreover, if the spacer is removed from the space between the vehicle-body side fixing portion of the treatment device support member and the one member, the vehicle-body side fixing portion of the treatment device support member can be separated from the one member.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Therefore, by mounting the treatment device on the weight-side fixing portion of the treatment device support member in a state in which the spacer is provided between the vehicle-body side fixing portion of the treatment device support member and the one member, the treatment device can be easily mounted on the one member.

The exhaust pipe 9A of the engine 9 is connected to the inlet pipe 22B of the PM trapping filter device 22, and the outlet pipe 22C of the PM trapping filter device 22 is connected to the inlet pipe 23C of the NOx purifying device 23 through the vibration absorbing pipe<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> 25.
