When these cells are isolated and transplanted into the uterus, they can develop into one perfect individual. Pluripotent stem cells, which are cells capable of developing into various cells and tissues derived from ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal layers, are derived from an inner cell mass located inside blastocysts generated 4-5 days after fertilization. These cells are called embryonic stem cells and can differentiate into various other tissue cells but not form new living organisms. Multipotent stem cells are stem cells capable of differentiating into only cells specific to tissues and organs containing these cells.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The multipotent stem cells were first isolated from adult bone marrow (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Y. Jiang et al., Nature, 418:41, 2002</text></nplcit>), and then also found in other various adult tissues (<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>C. M.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> Verfaillie, Trends Cell Biol., 12:502, 2002</text></nplcit>). In other words, although bone marrow is the most widely known source of stem cells, the multipotent stem cells were also found in the skin, blood vessels, muscles and brains (<nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>J. G. Tomas et al., Nat. Cell Biol., 3:778, 2001</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>M. Sampaolesi et al., Science, 301:487, 2003</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>Y. Jiang et al., Exp. Hematol., 30:896, 2002</text></nplcit>). However, stem cells are very rarely present in adult tissues, such as bone marrow, and such cells are difficult to culture without inducing differentiation, and thus difficult to culture in the absence of specifically screened media. That is, it is very difficult to maintain the isolated stem cells <i>in vitro.</i></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Stem cells derived from human amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus can be easily obtained during pregnancy and childbirth, can proliferate in large quantities, and do not cause any tumor formation after transplantation into animals like embryonic stem cells, which are the most important advantages. In particular, human amniotic fluid stem cells have no ethical issues that embryonic stem cells possess and thus are the most potential stem cells that can be used in cell therapy. Cell sources such as autologous muscular tissue, bone marrow, fat, bone, etc. are used, but most are collected by invasive methods which carry significant complications such as bleeding, infection, damage to organs, etc, and thus a stem cell<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> source that can be obtained by non-invasive methods is required. Amniotic fluid stem cells can be easily obtained from the routine inspection during pregnancy and during childbirth, can proliferate in large quantities, and do not require immunosuppressive agents as they are non-immunogenic. Compared to embryonic stem cells, amniotic fluid stem cells do not cause any tumor formation after transplantation into animals, have no ethical issues, and can differentiate into all organs due to their pluripotential capability, thus serving as an ideal stem cell source for the treatment of diseases.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Meanwhile, urinary incontinence in women is caused by sagging of the urethra and bladder, which results from weakening of pelvic floor muscles arising from pudendal nerve injury due to frequent childbirth and aging. Currently, the number of female urinary incontinence patients in Korea is estimated to be about 4 to 5 million people and is increasing every year due to a rapid increase in the number of old age women. Thus, female urinary incontinence is one of the serious social problems all over the world. To treat urinary incontinence patients, surgical therapy or injection therapy for supporting the urethra and bladder are used. Currently, the surgical therapy which is an invasive method has a problem in that complications can occur, and the injection therapy has problems in that it<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> employs expensive substances, and thus cannot be easily applied to all patients, and in that it has a success rate of only 50-60%, such that injection and surgery are required again.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Stem cell injection therapy does not need anesthesia and enables easy injection of stem cells into urethral sphincter. Thus, if the stem cell injection therapy can improve the contractility of urethral sphincter and increase leak point pressure, the stem cell therapy can be advantageously used to treat urinary incontinence.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In recent years, cellular therapies for urethral sphincter regeneration using these stem cells have been actively applied in the treatment of urinary incontinence.

Cell injectable hydrogel of the present invention contains the stem cells to<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> simply inject the cells into the body without any surgical operation and to help the cells stay in one place of the body, thus facilitating the differentiation or organization of the cells in the body.

The stem cells are developmentally pluripotent and multipotent stem cells. A stem cell can divide to produce two daughter stem cells, or one daughter stem cell and one progenitor ("transit") cell, which then proliferates into the tissue's mature, fully formed cells.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As used herein, the term "differentiation" refers to a phenomenon in which the structure or function of cells is specialized during the division, proliferation and growth thereof, that is, the feature or function of cell or tissue of an organism changes in order to perform work given to the cell or tissue. Generally, it refers to a phenomenon in which a relatively simple system is divided into two or more<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> qualitatively different partial systems. For example, it means that a qualitative difference between the parts of any biological system, which have been identical to each other at the first, occurs, for example, a distinction such as a head or a body between egg parts, which have been qualitatively identical to each other at the first in ontogenic development, occurs, or a distinction such as a muscle cell or a nerve cell between cells occurs, or the biological system is divided into qualitatively distinguishable parts or partial systems as a result thereof.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As used herein, the term "cellular therapeutic agent" refers to a drug used for the purpose of treatment, diagnosis and prevention, which contains a cell or tissue prepared through isolation from humans, culture and specific operation (as provided by the US FDA). Specifically, it refers to a drug used for the purpose of treatment, diagnosis and prevention through a series of behaviors of <i>in vitro</i> multiplying and sorting living autologous, allogenic and xenogenic cells or changing the biological characteristics of cells by other means for the purpose of restoring the functions of cells and tissues. Cellular therapeutic agents are broadly divided, according to the differentiation level of cells, into somatic cell therapeutic agents and stem cell therapeutic agents. The present invention particularly relates to a cellular therapeutic agent containing amniotic<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> fluid-derived stem cells.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The inventors of the present invention have conducted experiments by directly injecting amniotic fluid-derived stem cells into urinary incontinence animal models to determine whether the stem cells would differentiate into muscles in the body to restore normal muscle function for controlling urinary incontinence and completed the present invention. The injection application of stem cells and the evaluation of in situ differentiation performed in the present invention have clinical significance. This is because the injected stem cells underwent proliferation <i>in vitro</i> only without gene manipulation or differentiation and were simply injected by injection without any invasive process such as surgery and it was proved that the injected stem cells differentiated in situ in urethral sphincter, a target tissue.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Moreover, in the present invention, various cell culture media were used for the differentiation of amniotic fluid stem cells into muscles, from which it was found that the conditioned medium (obtained from human skeletal muscle culture medium) was the best among others, and better functional restoration was observed when cells were added to an alginate/pluronic acid/hyaluronic acid hydrogel complex and injected into a damaged area, while the urethral function was restored even in the case of the medium<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> containing cells only.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Furthermore, three types of differentiation media were used to induce the differentiation of amniotic fluid stem cells into muscles by <i>in vitro</i> experiment, and the differentiation capability was evaluated by morphological, genetic, and immunochemical methods. To find the optimal differentiation conditions, a medium in which 5-azaC or TGF-β was added to regular myogenic medium and a medium containing human skeletal muscle supernatant were used. The supernatant medium was evaluated as the most suitable medium for the differentiation of amniotic fluid stem cells from the results of the analysis based on the cell proliferation rate and the expression of genes and proteins associated with myogenic differentiation.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the present invention, in an <i>in vivo</i> experiment using urinary incontinence mouse models, non-differentiated amniotic fluid stem cells were grafted onto a hydrogel and injected into urethral sphincter with weakened muscle function. A sham-operation group was established as a positive control, and a non-treated group and a cell group that was not treated with hydrogel were established as a negative control. Urodynamic factors such as urethral closing pressure and leak point pressure were measured from the animals in each group at one, two, and four weeks after operation, and the reconstruction of urethral sphincter was<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> evaluated through histological analysis. Significant recovery of urethral closing pressure and leak point pressure was observed in the experimental group compared to the control group, and the engraftment of amniotic fluid stem cells and the differentiation into surrounding myocytes were observed in the histological test.

On the contrary, the urethral sphincter which was denervated and into which human fibroblasts were injected showed significant CD8 lymphocyte reaction.</p><heading id="h0022"><b><u>6.

The signal intensity increased over time, and reached the highest value at 24 hours, and then there was no significant change in intensity up to 72 hours. With respect to the labeling efficiency at 24 hours, 94.31% of the cells in the entire group showed the RITC signal (<figref idrefs="f0014">FIG.<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> 5B</figref>). Nanoparticles were localized in cytoplasm and clearly detected in a merged image. MTS cell proliferation assay showed that the viability of hAFSCs treated with 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/mL MNPs@SiO<sub>2</sub> (RITC) for 24, 48 and 72 hours was similar over the entire period, which indicates that MNPs@SiO<sub>2</sub> (RITC) did not induce cytotoxicity in hAFSCs (<figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 5C</figref>). Referring to the effects of nanoparticles on the cell cycle progression in hAFSCs, no nanoparticle-induced cell cycle arrest was found. MNPs@SiO<sub>2</sub> (RITC)-labeled cells were injected into the urethral sphincter (1x10<sup>6</sup> cells). Optical images show that signals were expressed in the right side of the injection site of the labeled cells, while the control group and the non-labeled cells were not expressed. Over time, the signal intensity decreased slowly until 10 days (<figref idrefs="f0016">FIG. 5D</figref>).</p><heading id="h0023"><b><u>7.
