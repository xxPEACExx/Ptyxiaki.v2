When the roller bearing is configured as the shell type, it is possible to reduce the cost and weight of the roller bearing.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The outer ring 12a, which is brought into contact with the timing chain 1, is made of steel and hence has high mechanical strength. In this way, since the outer ring 12a is made of steel, even when the timing chain 1 is made of steel, the outer ring 12a does not wear and can have sufficient mechanical strength.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Further, when the hardness of the steel outer ring 12a is higher than the hardness of the timing chain 1, the wear of the outer ring 12a can be prevented.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">As a material of the outer ring 12a, a material, such as SUJ2 and SCM, which can be subjected to hardening treatment by heat treatment, is used.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In order to improve the retaining performance of lubricating oil, minute depressions and projections may be formed on the surface of the outer ring 12a.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Further, the surface of the outer ring 12a may be subjected to nitriding treatment as hardening treatment, so as to increase the mechanical strength of the outer ring 12a.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In order to avoid local surface pressure due to point contact with the timing chain 1, it is desirable that the surface of the outer ring 12a has a generating line shape of a barrel shape or a straight shape.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The outer ring 12a can be formed by press-forming or cut-forming.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">When the outer ring 12a is formed by press forming, it is preferred that, after the retainer 12b and the roller 12c are incorporated into the outer ring 12a, the inward-extending flange sections are respectively formed at opposite ends of the outer ring 12a by edge bending processing, and that the outer ring 12a is then heat treated after the assembly.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In order to reduce vibration and to achieve silence, it is desirable that the roundness of the outer ring 12a is 20 µm or less.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052"><!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> Further, from a viewpoint of mechanical strength, it is preferred that the thickness of the outer ring 12a is 1 mm or more.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The rollers 12c are held by the retainers 12b in the circumferential direction at predetermined intervals therebetween. As the retainer 12b, a V-shaped retainer having a V-shaped pillar section is used. When the retainer 12b is used, it is possible to prevent the skewing of the roller 12c and to prevent the end surface of the roller 12c from being brought into direct contact with the flange section of the outer ring 12a. Further, it is possible to prevent the wear of the side plate member 9. Note that the roller bearing having a roller structure without using the retainer 12b may also be adopted.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Next, in order to attach the roller 12 to the side plate members 9 facing each other, the roller 12 provided with the roller bearing on the outer peripheral surface of the support shaft 13 is first prepared as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref>.

In the present embodiment, the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> opening section a is formed to be wide, and the insertion recess 14a is formed to have a tapered shape. Therefore, when the support shaft 13 is inserted, the support shaft 13 can be easily guided from the opening section a to the circular arc-shaped fixing recess 14b through the insertion port b.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In the above-described embodiment, the diameter φ of the circular arc-shaped fixing recess 14b is formed to be smaller than the diameter of the support shaft 13, and hence the support shaft 13 is press-fitted and attached to the fixing recess 14b. As a result, it is possible to suppress the rotation of the support shaft 13. In addition, the width of the insertion port b connected to the fixing recess 14b is formed to be smaller than the diameter φ of the circular arc-shaped fixing recess 14b, and hence the insertion port b performs a function of preventing the coming-off of the support shaft 13. Further, the support recess 14 is formed so as not to penetrate the side plate member 9, and hence the support shaft 13 inserted into the support recess 14 can be prevented from moving in the shaft direction.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In the state where the support shafts 13 of the roller 12 are respectively fitted into the support recesses 14 of the mutually facing side plate members 9, the outer ring 12a of the roller bearing constituting the roller 12 is lower than the end surface of the side plate<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> member 9 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 8</figref>. Thereby, the timing chain 1 is guided between the mutually facing wall surfaces of the side plate members 9 while being in contact with the outer ring 12a of the roller bearing constituting each of the rollers 12.

When each height of the end surface of the side plate member 9 and the outer ring 12a is higher than the position of the connection pin 1b mutually connecting the plates 1a constituting the timing chain 1, the connection pin 1b is brought into contact with the mutually facing wall surfaces of the side plate members 9, and hence such configuration is not preferred.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Next, <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 9</figref> is a transverse sectional view showing a chain guide 5 according to another embodiment of the present invention.

Further, it is also possible to dissipate heat. It is preferred that the discharge hole 15a of the oil hole 15 is formed in the direction opposite to the timing chain 1 as described above. Thereby, oil is smoothly supplied to the inside of the bearing.
