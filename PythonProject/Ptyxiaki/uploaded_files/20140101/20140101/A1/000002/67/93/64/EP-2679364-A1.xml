The silicon ingots are cut into square blocks, and then cut into thin silicon wafers. A multi-wire saw is the most common and the most mature slicing equipment at present. A group of parallel spools is arranged in the working area of the multi-wire saw, sawing wires parallel to one another are wound on the spools to form a square cutting wire mesh (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) running at a certain linear speed. An upper horizontal wire mesh surface and a lower horizontal wire mesh surface of the cutting wire mesh are silicon ingot cutting surfaces. The silicon ingots are fixed on a cutting table. The cutting table vertically penetrates the upper horizontal wire mesh surface and the lower horizontal wire mesh surface, and the multi-wire saw provides free abrasives of abrasive slurry for the sawing wire during cutting so that the silicon ingots are cut into silicon wafers.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The cutting method of a wire saw machine has been greatly improved technically compared with a traditional band saw cutting method and ID blades slicing cutting method, but there are still a lot problems such as surface cracks of surface cutting by abrasive slurry" uncontrollable depth of the affected layer, difficulty in separation between abrasive particles and silicon powder scraps, harsh working environment, and lower efficiency.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The cutting method of diamond wire saw with micro abrasive concretion is a new processing method proposed for solving the above problems. From the present research achievements, the diamond wire saw with abrasive concretion has the advantages of ease in recovery of silicon crumbs, good working environment, and small damage of the cutting surface, high efficiency, thin slicing, thickness equalization and the like.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The abrasive particles concretion method of the diamond wire saw mainly includes: (1) fixing with resin bond (including metal and non-metal core wires); (2) fixing by mechanical extrusion (metal core wire); (3) fixing by brazing (metal core wire); (4) fixing with electroplated abrasive (metal core wire). Each diamond wire saw with abrasive concretion has different characteristics, but also has obvious defects.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">(1) As to the resin bond diamond wire saw with abrasive concretion, the finishing surface quality is good, but the efficiency is low, the resin heat resistance is poor, the bonding strength is low, the wire diameter of the wire saw is easily worn, the change in kerf is great, and the subsequent processing cost may be increased due to the out-of-tolerance in thickness of the silicon wafer.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">(2) As to the diamond wire saw with abrasive concretion by mechanical extrusion, the working efficiency is high, but the core wire is damaged under extrusion, the service life is affected after the strength degradation, and the finishing quality of surface is difficult to guarantee.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">(3) As to the diamond wire saw with abrasive concretion by brazing (metal core wire), the working efficiency is high, but the strength and toughness of the core wire are destroyed due to the high temperature during the brazing process, the manufacturing process is complex, and the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> difficulty in volume production is high.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">(4) As to the diamond wire saw with abrasive concretion by electroplated abrasive (metal core wire), the retention of wire diameter is good, but the finishing quality is not satisfying, and the wire saw is easily broken to lead to higher cutting cost.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In China, the above four categories of products have been partially applied on slicing of silicon materials bricking, but are not yet widely used. Its main reason lies in that the diamond multi-wire saw performs one-time cutting to the silicon ingot by adopting the same wire, it's difficult to meet the index requirements of surface finishing quality, efficiency, service life, and cost performance of the silicon wafer at the same time, and in addition, the performance of the matching equipment are also unsatisfactory.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The purpose of the invention is to provide a diamond wire saw device for meeting the index requirements of surface finishing quality, efficiency, service life, and cost performance of silicon wafers through multi-cutting with diamond wire saws with different characteristics during t silicon wafering.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The diamond wire saw device capable of realizing the above purpose comprises a diamond sawing wire, the difference is that at least two diamond sawing wires are arranged in the front and back of a cutting working surface along a cutting feed direction, or at least two groups of the diamond sawing wires are arranged in the front and back of more than one parallel cutting working surface, and the diamond sawing wires in the same group are parallel to one another to form a layer of cutting mesh surface; the diameter of a latter diamond sawing wire or a latter group of diamond sawing wires is equal to or greater than that of a former diamond sawing wire or a former group of diamond sawing wires.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The cutting mesh surface is formed by winding one or more long diamond sawing wires on one group of spool.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In one group of spools, a square mesh surface is formed by at least two spools, a triangular mesh surface is formed by three spools, or a polygonal mesh surface is formed by more spools.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Conventionally, four spools are arranged in the four corners to form a square wire mesh. The number of the square wire mesh is two groups or more, and each group of the square wire meshes is combined to form a two-layer or multi-layer cutting mesh surface.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A two-layer or three-layer cutting mesh surface is taken as an example:</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Two groups of the square wire meshes are nested to form a concentric hollow square, or two groups of the square wire meshes are distributed in the front and in the back along the cutting feed direction.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Three groups of the square wire meshes are nested with one another; or a group of the square wire meshes are distributed in front of or behind two groups of the square wire meshes nested to form a concentric hollow square along the cutting feed direction.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The wire diameter of the latter diamond sawing wire or the latter group of diamond sawing wires is equal to but preferably greater than that of the former diamond sawing wire or the former group of diamond sawing wires; the size of diamond grains attached onto the latter diamond sawing wire or the latter group of diamond sawing wires is equal to but preferably smaller than that of diamond grains attached onto the former diamond sawing wire or the former group of diamond sawing wires.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The relationship between the adjacent diamond sawing wires or between<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the adjacent cutting mesh surfaces is parallel, and to better eliminate the cut marks formed on the surface of the silicon wafer during the former cutting of the diamond sawing wire, an included angle can be formed between the adjacent diamond sawing wires or the adjacent cutting mesh surfaces.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">When the strength of the silicon wafer is sufficient, the running directions of the adjacent diamond sawing wires or the adjacent cutting mesh surfaces can be the same, however, the running directions are preferably opposite for keeping the cutting stability.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to the fundamental principles of diamond processing, the grain size of diamond plays a decisive role for the cutting efficiency and surface roughness, and the cutting efficiency can be improved by adopting the more coarse diamond, however, the surface roughness is poorer; a better surface roughness can be obtained by adopting the finer diamond, however, the cutting efficiency is greatly affected. Thus, all diamond sawing wires can independently run with different parameters, for the purposes of cutting, fine grinding, and polishing of different diamond sawing wires to the silicon wafer. By adopting the technical scheme of the diamond wire saw device, the diamond sawing wires corresponding to the process are selectively used in different cutting wire meshes according to the different demands of cutting, coarse grinding, and fine grinding, so that the wire diameter and the grain size of diamond are appropriate to the process, not only the cutting efficiency is improved, but also the requirements of surface roughness are met, and the cut silicon wafers are further developed towards the bigger and thinner silicon wafers.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Advantages of the invention are summarized below:</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">By adopting the method of cutting the silicon wafers in sequence via the cutting mesh surfaces of a plurality of groups of diamond sawing wires, the cutting,<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> fine grinding, and polishing procedures of the silicon wafer are finished via the diamond sawing wires with different characteristics according to different working parameters; the machining allowance of cutting, fine grinding, and polishing is greatly lowered in sequence, and the shearing force to the silicon wafer during the processing is greatly reduced in sequence, so as to be favorable for the formation of thin sheets, thus the higher utilization ratio of silicon materials is obtained, the requirements of developing the narrower cutting seams and the thinner cut silicon wafers is met, the problem that the requirements of the grain size of diamond to the cutting efficiency and the surface roughness cannot be met at the same time is solved, and the selection of the grain size of diamond is wider.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a three-dimensional structural diagram of a group of square wire meshes formed by winding a diamond sawing wire on a group (four) of spools in a traditional diamond wire saw machine;</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a front view of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a structural diagram of a first example of a diamond wire saw device;</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a structural diagram of a second example of a diamond wire saw device;</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a structural diagram of a third example of a diamond wire saw device;</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a structural diagram of a fourth example of a diamond wire saw device;</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> is a structural diagram of a fifth example of a diamond wire saw device; and</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram illustrating the cutting, fine grinding, and polishing of<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> three different diamond sawing wires in the same silicon slit in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Legends: 1.
