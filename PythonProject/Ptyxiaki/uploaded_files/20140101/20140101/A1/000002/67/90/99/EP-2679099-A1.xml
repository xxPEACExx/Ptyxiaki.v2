The entire disclosure of this Japanese patent application is thus included in the present application.</p><heading id="h0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The present invention relates to a chocolate or chocolate-like food that is used at the time of production of a chocolate product and a method of producing the chocolate or chocolate-like food; and more particularly, relates to a chocolate or chocolate-like food containing a specific triglyceride in a specific amount and a method of producing the chocolate or chocolate-like food. In addition, the present invention also relates to a chocolate product using the chocolate or chocolate-like food. Further, the present invention also relates to a method of inhibiting bloom on the chocolate or chocolate-like food.</p><heading id="h0003">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">A chocolate or chocolate-like food molded into a block- or plate-like shape is often produced by being added with solid fats with relatively high melting point in addition to cocoa butter such that the chocolate or chocolate-like food does not change its shape resulting from loosening the chocolate or chocolate-like food. This is thought to be influenced by circumstances that temperature control was not feasible in a distribution stage and it was not uncommon for the chocolate product to be exposed to high temperatures. However, the shipment at a variety of temperature ranges appropriate to the type of food product has become available in these days. There is no need to worry about a chocolate<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> mix melting during the stage of distribution and, in contrast, occurrence of low-temperature bloom is becoming problematic in the chocolate product, which low-temperature bloom is caused by the chocolate product being kept at low-temperatures.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Occurrence of low-temperature bloom is often problematic particularly in the chocolate product added with nuts and seeds such as almonds, macadamia nuts, hazelnuts or peanuts. In a chocolate product containing the nuts and seeds, oil and fat migration between fats contained in the nuts and seeds and fats contained in a chocolate mix may sometimes occur, which causes deterioration of the quality of the product. The nuts and seeds lose color and gloss, get dried and slightly opaque, and change to have too crunchy textures. Meanwhile, the phenomena of occurrence of bloom in a chocolate mix with a chalky look, loss of a shiny sheen, and change in hardness are seen.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">From such circumstances, inhibition of bloom occurrence at low temperatures, rather than heat resistance at high temperatures, is being required in the chocolate product. Further, improvement of textures of the chocolate or chocolate-like food, which have been put second to heavily-weighed heat resistance, has been advanced. In view of this, various twists including inhibiting low temperature bloom and improving the texture of the chocolate or chocolate-like food have been added.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For example, it has been suggested to inhibit occurrence of bloom caused by oil and fat migration in mixed food products in which chocolate is combined with a nut or the like by using an oil and fat composition containing specific polyglycerol fatty acid ester in the chocolate (for example, see Patent Document 1). However, it was not necessarily preferred in that a large amount of synthetic emulsifier was used as an essential component.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Further, it has been suggested to produce a chocolate having soft textures, bloom resistance and grain resistance by using an oil and fat composition containing a specific triglyceride in the chocolate (for example, see Patent Document 2). However, because of a soft<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> chocolate mix obtained by utilizing a palm soft fraction, it could not be said that the composition was suitable for chocolate products with a block- or plate-like shape.</p><heading id="h0004">PRIOR ART REFERENCES</heading><heading id="h0005">PATENT DOCUMENTS</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2007091529A"><text>WO 2007/091529</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2008228641A"><text>2008-228641</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0006">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0007">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide a chocolate or chocolate-like food capable of inhibiting occurrence of low-temperature bloom.

Position 1, 2, or 3 of the triglyceride refers to a position at which the fatty acids bind. The following is used as an abbreviated name of constituent fatty acids of the triglyceride. X: saturated fatty acid having 16 or more carbon atoms, P: palmitic acid, St: stearic acid, Ar: arachidic acid, U: unsaturated fatty acid having 16 or more carbon atoms, O: oleic acid. Analysis of triglyceride composition can be carried out using gas chromatography (in reference to <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>JAOCS, vol70, 11, 1111-1114 (1993</text></nplcit>)) and a silver ion column-HPLC method (in reference to <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>J. High Resol. Chromatogr., 18, 105-107 (1995</text></nplcit>)). Further, analysis of constituent fatty acids of an oil and fat can be carried out using gas chromatography (in reference to AOCS Ce1f-96).</p><heading id="h0012"><u>I. Chocolate or Chocolate-like Food</u></heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">The term "a chocolate or chocolate-like food" of the present invention means an oil-based food product containing an oil and fat, wherein the oil and fat is a continuous phase. The chocolate or chocolate-like food preferably contains sugars. In addition, the "a chocolate or chocolate-like food" of the present invention is preferably a chocolate. It is worth noting that the chocolate of the present invention is not limited by the code "Fair Competition Codes concerning Labeling on Chocolate and/or Chocolate-like Food" (Japan Chocolate Industry Fair Trade Conference) or by definitions covered in laws and regulations, and refers to one produced by adding cacao mass, cocoa powder, edible oil and fat (such as cocoa butter), sugars as major raw materials, and dairy products, flavoring agents, emulsifiers or the like as necessary; and by undergoing the steps of chocolate production. Further, the chocolate or chocolate-like food of the present invention also includes, besides dark chocolate and milk chocolate, white chocolate and colored chocolate in which cacao mass or cocoa powder is not used. Furthermore, the chocolate or chocolate-like food of the present invention is preferably a tempering type chocolate or chocolate-like food.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The oil and fat contained in the chocolate or chocolate-like food of the present invention are ones containing 50 to 85% by weight, preferably 60 to 82% by weight, more preferably 65 to 75% by weight of<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> triglyceride in which oleic acid is bound at position 2 and saturated fatty acids having 16 or more carbon atoms is bound at positions 1 and 3 (XOX type triglyceride); and 5 to 18% by weight, preferably 6 to 16% by weight, more preferably 7 to 14% by weight of triglyceride in which two oleic acids are bound and one saturated fatty acid having 16 or more carbon atoms is bound (XO2 type triglyceride).

The content of the above XO2 type triglyceride is a total amount of these. Note that the XOO type triglyceride may be expressed also as an OOX type triglyceride but both have the identical structure. Low temperature bloom on a chocolate or chocolate-like food can be inhibited by adjusting the XOX type triglyceride and XO2 type triglyceride in an oil and fat of a chocolate or chocolate-like food to an amount within the above range. In addition, texture and snap property of the chocolate or chocolate-like food become good.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the above XOX type triglyceride and XO2 type triglyceride, the saturated fatty acid X has 16 carbon atoms or more, preferably 16 to 26 carbon atoms, more preferably 16 to 24 carbon atoms, still more preferably 16 to 22 carbon atoms, and further more preferably 16 to 20 carbon atoms.
