Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2011034496A"><text>2011-034496, filed February 21, 2011</text></patcit>, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Heretofore, as a method for molding a molded material composed of a fiber reinforced plastic (FRP), there is known an autoclave molding method in which a number of laminated thin plate-shaped fiber reinforced plastics are heated under high pressure (for example, refer to Patent Document 1). This autoclave molding method is performed with an autoclave, in the interior of which high pressure and high temperature gas circulates.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In this autoclave, in a state where a molded material is arranged within a pressure vessel in which a high pressure and high temperature gas has been supplied from the outside, the high pressure and high temperature gas within the pressure vessel is<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> heated and circulated. As a result, thin plate-shaped fiber reinforced plastics, which are laminated in a number of layers, are heat-cured and bonded, and a composite material can be obtained as a result.<br/>
As another method for heat molding a molded material, there is known a method in which molding is performed within a curing furnace with no pressurizing operation, and a method in which only a jig is heated to cure a molded material.</p><heading id="h0003">[Prior Art Document]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Patent Document]</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004"><ul><li>[Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP4109660B"><text>4109660</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the above autoclave, when heat curing molding a large vent type stringer member to be used for a main wing of an aircraft for example, use of a retaining jig for retaining the shape of the molded material is essential. Consequently, the ambient temperature within the pressure vessel is unlikely to be transmitted directly to the molded material, and the efficiency of heat application to the molded material is deteriorated, resulting in a long curing time.<br/>
Furthermore, since the molded material is of a large size and is also of a specialized shape, unevenness occurs in heat application, and there is concern of defective products that may occur due to uneven heat curing or internal heat generation of the molded material.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> The present invention takes into consideration the above circumstances, with an object of providing an autoclave and a method for heat curing a molded material, capable of shortening the heat curing molding time of a molded material, and suppressing the occurrence of defective products.</p><heading id="h0007">[Means for Solving the Problem]</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention employs the following measures in order to solve the above problem.<br/>
That is to say, the autoclave according to the present invention is an autoclave for heat curing with high temperature gas a heat application target molded material, the autoclave comprising: a pressure vessel of which the molded material is arranged in the interior; a retaining jig which retains the shape of the molded material, and the interior of which is formed with a cavity; a high temperature gas supplying device which supplies the high temperature gas to the molded material within the pressure vessel; and an auxiliary high temperature gas supplying device which supplies the high temperature gas into the cavity of the retaining jig.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the autoclave equipped with this type of retaining jig, due to the auxiliary high temperature gas supplying device which supplies high temperature gas into the cavity of the retaining jig, it is possible to transmit the ambient temperature of the pressure vessel interior directly to the contact portion between the molded material and the retaining jig, to which, heretofore, the ambient temperature of the pressure vessel interior was unlikely to be transmitted directly. Therefore it is possible to increase the speed of temperature increase of the molded material. As a result, for example, in a large vent type stringer member, which conventionally requires a long heat curing time, it<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> is possible to reduce the amount of time required for heat curing molding. Furthermore, even heat application to a molded material, which has been conventionally difficult now becomes possible, and the occurrence of defective products can be suppressed.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Moreover, even in a case where, for example, heat has been generated excessively in a part of the contact portion between the molded material and the retaining jig, it is possible, with high temperature gas supplied to the cavity of the retaining jig, to remove heat of this heat-generated part. That is to say, it is possible, with the high temperature gas supplied by the auxiliary high temperature gas supplying device, to obtain an effect of releasing heat of the above heat-generated part, and therefore the occurrence of defective products caused by this heat generation can be suppressed.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Furthermore, in the auxiliary high temperature gas supplying device according to the present invention that supplies high temperature gas into the retaining jig cavity, it is preferable that there is provided a guide pipe that takes in a part of the high temperature gas that is supplied into the pressure vessel of the autoclave by the high temperature gas supplying device, and that guides it into the retaining jig cavity.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the autoclave comprising a retaining jig having this type of guide pipe, it is possible to supply the high temperature gas within the pressure vessel more efficiently into the retaining jig cavity. As a result it is possible to further shorten the heat curing molding time for a molded material, and suppress the occurrence of defective products caused by uneven heat application or heat generation within the molded material.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Moreover, in the autoclave according to the present invention, the guide pipe may be provided at both ends of the cavity of the retaining jig, and there may be provided a flow outlet which communicates between the inside and the outside of the cavity, and through which the high temperature gas supplied into the cavity by the guide pipe flows out.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to the autoclave having this type of guide pipe that is provided at both ends of the retaining jig, more high temperature gas flows into the retaining jig so that heat transmission between the retaining jig inner surface and the molded material is further improved. As a result, it is possible to further shorten the heat curing molding time, and suppress the occurrence of defective products caused by uneven heat application or heat generation within the molded material.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Furthermore, it is preferable that the autoclave according to the present invention is provided with a first fin arranged on an inner surface that forms the cavity of the retaining jig.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Due to this first fin, the total heat transfer area of the inner surface that forms the cavity of the retaining jig is increased, and heat transmission between the high temperature gas that has flowed into the retaining jig cavity, and the molded material can be improved. As a result, it is possible to further shorten the heat curing molding time, and suppress the occurrence of defective products caused by uneven heat application or heat generation within the molded material.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Moreover, the autoclave according to the present invention is preferably such<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> that the first fin is arranged in a spiral shape.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Due to this type of spiral-shaped fin, high temperature gas supplied into the retaining jig cavity by the auxiliary high temperature gas supplying device becomes a swirling flow so that it is possible to further improve heat transmission between the high temperature gas and the molded material. As a result, it is possible to further shorten the heat curing molding time, and suppress the occurrence of defective products caused by uneven heat application or heat generation within the molded material.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Furthermore, it is preferable that the autoclave according to the present invention is provided with a second fin arranged on an outer surface of the retaining jig.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Due to this type of second fin provided on the outer surface of the retaining jig, the total heat transfer area of the retaining jig outer surface is increased so that heat transmission between the high temperature gas within the pressure vessel, and the molded material can be improved. As a result, it is possible to further shorten the heat curing molding time, and suppress the occurrence of defective products caused by uneven heat application or heat generation within the molded material.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Moreover, it is preferable that the autoclave according to the present invention is provided with a flow guide which guides the high temperature gas within the pressure vessel that is supplied by the high temperature gas supplying device, so that it flows along an outer surface of the retaining jig.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Due to this type of flow guide, the high temperature gas is guided to flow along<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the retaining jig to improve heat transmission between the high temperature gas within the pressure vessel and the molded material, so that the ambient temperature within the pressure vessel is more likely to be transmitted to the molded material. As a result, it is possible to further shorten the heat curing molding time, and suppress the occurrence of defective products caused by uneven heat application or heat generation within the molded material.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Furthermore, in the autoclave according to the present invention, it is preferable that a black body coating material is applied to a surface of the retaining jig.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">By applying this type of black body coating material (for example, normal white or black paint), radiant heat transmission between the high temperature gas within the pressure vessel and the retaining jig is promoted, and a further shortening of the heat curing molding time for a molded material can be achieved.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The method for heat curing a molded material according to the present invention is a method for heat curing a molded material in which a heat application target molded material is heat-cured with high temperature gas,.
