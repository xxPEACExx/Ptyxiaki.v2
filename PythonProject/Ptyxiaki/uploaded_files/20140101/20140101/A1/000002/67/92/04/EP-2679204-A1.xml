For example, the body portion 2303 may have a polygonal columnar shape having three or more corners. Therefore, the body portion 2303 has an almost true circular cross-section when being cut along a plane perpendicular to the axis and viewed from the lid margin side in this embodiment, but may have an elliptic, polygonal, or irregular cross-section.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">The body portion 2303 includes an inclined surface 2332 which is inclined relative to the axis of the body portion and extends from the hook connecting portion 2331 toward the back side (the opposite side of the abdominal portion 2333).
