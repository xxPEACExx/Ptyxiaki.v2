A predetermined pressure of fluid in the upstream passage brings about a displacement or an elastic deformation of the diaphragm and consequent opening of the valve, i.e., opening of the communication between the upstream passage and the downstream passage.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Valves of this sort are used, for example, as check valves, which are purposely designed to open when the pressure in the upstream passage exceeds a predetermined relatively modest threshold value, and then to reclose promptly so as to prevent, with the maximum degree of safety, any reflux from the downstream passage to the upstream passage when the pressure in the latter drops again below the threshold value, or else in the case of an even minimal overpressure within the downstream passage.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Prior art</u></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">From the patent documents Nos. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1099457B1"><text>EP-1099457B1</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP1093828B1"><text>EP-1093828B1</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP1946793A1"><text>EP-1946793A1</text></patcit>, all of which are filed in the name of the present applicant, there are known one-way valves of the type specified above, in which the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> annular valve seat is defined by a wall with conical surface of the first tubular connector, diverging towards the second tubular connector, and the diaphragm is constituted by the bottom wall of a cup-shaped element, the outer peripheral edge of which is normally pressed in fluid-tight contact against the annular valve seat under an axial thrust exerted by the side wall of the cup-shaped element. In operation, when the pressure within the upstream passage reaches the aforesaid predetermined value, an axial displacement of the bottom wall of the cup-shaped element is produced in the direction of the second tubular connector, as a result of which the corresponding outer peripheral edge contracts radially, moving away from the annular valve seat with a high degree of promptness and immediacy of opening of the one-way valve.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In applications on medical infusion lines, a filter is normally provided for filtering any possible impurities contained in the fluid that traverses the valve. Traditionally, the filter consists of an element separate from the valve, set along the line upstream of the first tubular connector, or else a filtering body inserted within the upstream passage defined by the aforesaid first tubular connector.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Both of the solutions prove far from practical and to some extent complicate production of the medical line.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">From the document No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO2010107597A"><text>WO-2010/107597</text></patcit>, a one-way valve is known of the type specified above, in which the filter is integrated within the body and consists of a permeable membrane set transversely and carried by a peripheral ring engaged with interference fit or snap-action fit on an internal annular flange of the body set upstream of the valve seat with respect to the direction of flow through the valve.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The above fit does not ensure the necessary stability of retention of the filter, which can be easily disengaged from the flange of the body, with the consequent risk of opening paths of flow without any filtering.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary of the invention</u></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The object of the present invention is to overcome the above drawback, and this object is achieved thanks to the fact that the one-way valve is of the type defined in the pre-characterizing part of Claim 1, the peculiar characteristic of which lies in the fact that the annular element of the filtering membrane is axially clamped and blocked between the first and second tubular connectors.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>Brief description of the drawings</u></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The invention will now be described in detail with reference to the annexed drawings, which are provided purely by way of non-limiting example and in which:

In the condition of closing of the valve (represented in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>), the skirt 8 is subjected to a predetermined axial elastic preload and presses the edge 13 in fluid-tight contact against the valve seat 14 so as to interrupt communication between the axial passages 12, and hence the downstream passage 5, and the upstream passage 4. When an overpressure of higher degree than a pre-set threshold value is produced within the upstream passage 4, the axial displacement of the bottom wall 7 of the open/close element 6 in the direction of the tubular connector 3 causes separation between the edge 13 and the valve seat 14, setting the upstream passage 4 in communication with the downstream passage 5.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the peculiar characteristic of the invention, the connector 1 incorporates, in an integrated way, a filter set through the line of flow between the upstream passage 4 and the downstream passage 5, which is axially blocked between the first tubular connector 2 and the second tubular connector 3, upstream of the open/close element 6 of the valve with respect to the flow through the body 1 of the valve.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the embodiment represented in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, the filter consists of a transverse membrane 15, made of an appropriate permeable filtering material, the outer peripheral edge of which is fixed on a radially<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> inner flange 17 of an annular element 18 set between the tubular connectors 2 and 3.

The annular element 18 has a peripheral flange 19 for front coupling to a radially outer flange 20 of the tubular connector 2, and a stepped side wall 21 for coupling to a complementary stepped internal surface 22 of the widened portion 9 of the tubular connector 3.
