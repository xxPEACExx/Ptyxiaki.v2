Further, the present invention relates to a method of reducing the transport of molecules through the intestinal mucosa of the intestinal tract of a mammal. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </p><p id="p0005" num="0005"> Hyperglycaemia is a major symptom in objects suffering from non-insulin dependent diabetes, the most prevalent disease affecting individuals with a Westernized life style (Yoon KH, Lee JH, Kim JW, Cho JH et al, Lancet 368: 1681-1688, 2006). Hyperglycaemia is further associated with coronary heart disease, obesity and chronic inflammation (Sinnaeve PR, Steg PG, Fox KA, et al. Archives Internal Medicine 169:402-409, 2009; Shoelson SE, Goldfine AB, Nature Medicine, 15: 373-374, 2009). In affected patients, elevated postprandial glucose is an early indicator of glucose intolerance or a pre-diabetes condition. The elevated postprandial glucose level is a more sensitive indicator of pre-diabetes than elevated fasting glucose levels. Treating patients who have early signs of hyperglycaemia, including elevated postprandial glucose level, with intensive glucose control is therefore fundamental to prevent or reduce later cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006"> Other diseases affected by hyperglycaemia include genetic diseases such as schizophrenia and mental depression. These are triggered by production of advanced glycation end products following the reaction between elevated blood glucose levels and intrinsic proteins (Bengmark S, Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, 31 : 430-440, 2007). </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> A reduction of blood glucose levels is thus a desired aim. Management of hyperglycaemia disclosed in the art typically relies on: </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> - reducing the dietary carbohydrate intake; </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> - replacing the use of high-glycaemic carbohydrates by low-glycaemic carbohydrates; and/or </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> - using hypoglycaemic agents that stimulate the uptake of glucose from the blood into peripheral cells. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 Medical therapies to reduce hyperglycaemia in patient suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus, also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes, typically involve insulin-dependent mechanisms and do thereby lose their effectiveness as pancreatic β- cell function declines (Smiley D, Umpierrez GE, Annals New York Academy. Science 1212: 1-11, 2010). </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> After digestion of dietary carbohydrates, glucose is taken up through the apical brush border membrane of the epithelial intestinal cells, mainly by the sodium-glucose linked transporter (SGLTl), to the enterocyte (Dyer J, Wood IS, Palejwala A et al Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol 282: G241-248, 2002). </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> Control of the intestinal absorption of glucose would thus be of help to regulate levels of glucose in the blood. Accordingly, compositions affecting the intestinal absorption of glucose would be of interest. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> It would further be of interest to be able to regulate the uptake of small as well as large molecules, such as saccharides, amino acids, peptides, and proteins, particularly in patients with disturbed intestinal barrier function. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"> Consequently, the present invention seeks to mitigate, alleviate, eliminate or circumvent conditions associated with hyperglycaemia by providing a composition comprising thylakoids or parts thereof, for reducing the transport of molecules through the intestinal mucosa of the intestinal tract of a mammal and thereby delaying the uptake of molecules, such as saccharides, such as mono-, oligo- or polysaccaride, or proteins, or a mixture thereof, from the gastrointestinal tract, wherein said composition is to be administered to the intestinal tract of a mammal. Thylakoids are the </p><p id="p0016" num="0016">photosynthetic membranes present in green leaves and green algae. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017"> In an embodiment, the molecule is glucose. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018"> Further, the present invention seeks to regulate the concentration of such molecules in blood by delaying their uptake, thereby preventing the development of their elevated postprandial concentration, for example reducing hyperglycemia. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019"> Another aspect of the invention relates to the use of a composition comprising thylakoids or parts thereof, for delaying gastrointestinal uptake of molecules, such as glucose, and thereby reducing the peak of their concentration in blood. By reducing the intestinal uptake of glucose, development of diabetes and other diseases and disorders related to hyperglycaemia, such as such as diabetes mellitus, schizophrenia and mental depression may be prevented and/or treated.

However, thylakoids are digested more slowly than other cell compartments, such as mitochondria, which is beneficial. </p><p id="p0054" num="0054"> Thus, such compositions may be used for the prevention and/or treatment of hyperglycemia, and especially postprandial hyperglycemia. Further, by reducing the glucose uptake in the intestine, the blood glucose levels may be lowered. By lowering the blood glucose levels insulin resistance, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and inflammation may be prevented and/or treated. Further, conditions with a strong inflammatory component, such as mental depression and schizophrenia, may be greatly improved. </p><p id="p0055" num="0055"> Thus, the present invention relates to the use of thylakoids, i.e. photosynthetic membranes from green leaves or green algae, or parts thereof, for the reduction of the transport of molecules, such as glucose, through the intestinal mucosa of the intestine. By reducing the transport of such molecules, the intestinal uptake of molecules is delayed. Thus, diseases caused by unbalanced concentration of the molecules, such as glucose, in the blood may be prevented and/or treated. The thylakoids, or parts thereof, used may be part of a pharmaceutical as well as a food composition. </p><p id="p0056" num="0056"> An embodiment, relates to the use of a composition comprising thylakoids, or parts thereof, for preventing and/or treating hyperglycemia and especially postprandial hyperglycemia. In some embodiments, the compositions are used to promote healthy blood sugar (e.g., glucose) levels, to manage blood sugar levels, to support healthy

 Measurement of transport of molecules through intestinal mucosa using the Ussing method (3). </p><p id="p0067" num="0067"> A total of eight female rats (220-280 g) were anaesthetized in the morning with isoflouran whereafter the proximal and distal parts of the small intestine were collected, rinsed and immediately immersed in room-tempered modified Krebs buffer (Ox 1 M NaCl / 3 mM CaC12 / 5 x5 mM KC1 / 14 mM KH2P04 / 29 mM NaHC03 / 5 x7 mM Na-pyruvate / 7 mM Na-fumarate / 5 x7 mM Na-glutamate / 13 x4 mM glucose / pH 7.4) oxygenated with carbogen (95/5 %, 02/C02). The intestine was cut in 3 cm sections, opened along the mesentery and pinched to the nails of the pre-heated (37° C) Ussing half-cell (Precision Instrument Design, Los Altos, CA, USA), modified in accordance with Grass and Sweetana (4). The half-cell was connected to another half-cell, and thus the arrangement had two sides: one facing the mucosal side of the intestine and the other facing the serosal side, with an exposed intestinal area of 1 x78 cm2. The Ussing chambers were filled with 5 ml Krebs buffer, kept at 37° C and connected to a carbogen supply. All intestinal segments were mounted in the chambers within 30 minutes after the intestine was collected. The intestinal segments were considered viable for a minimum of two hours after mounted in the chambers (6). </p><p id="p0068" num="0068"> At start of the experiment, the buffer was exchanged to fresh buffer in the serosal half-cell, and test solution in the mucosal half-cell. The test solution (5 ml) consisted of modified Krebs buffer supplemented with oleic acid (18: ln-9, 5.07 mM), NaTDC (5.2 g/1), and the marker molecules methyl-D glucose, 3-O-methyl 3H (190 Da, 1.85Ί0-2 GBq, 3.1 μΐ/ml,) or methyl-D glucose, 3-O-methyl 14C (190 Da, 1.85Ί0-3 GBq, 0.8 μΐ/ml), FITC-dextran (4 000 Da, 1 g/1) and ovalbumin (45 000 Da, 25 g/1). Thylakoid membranes - both non-treated and treated with trypsin - were also added to the test solution to get final concentrations of 1.2, 2.9 and 5.8 chl mg/ml. This concentration interval is obtainable by dosing from about 0.2 mg to about 2 mg chlorophyll per kg body mass of the subject to be treated, which corresponds to about 2.4 mg to about 24 mg isolated thylakoids per kg body mass of the subject to be treated. Serosal samples of 1 ml were collected every 20 minutes during 120 minutes, with replacement of the sampled volume by fresh buffer. </p><p id="p0069" num="0069"> The abovementioned dosage is for a composition with a high purity of thylakoids, i.e. isolated thylakoids. </p><p id="p0070" num="0070"> In some embodiments, the dosing of thylakoids is equivalent to from about 1.0 mg to about 2.0 mg chlorophyll per kg body mass of the subject to be treated, preferably from about 1.5 to about 2.0 mg chlorophyll per kg body mass of the subject to be

 Following every experiment, a sample from the serosal half-cell was collected and analysed for chlorophyll content to investigate a possible thylakoid migration through the intestinal wall. No such migration was found. Electron microscopy. </p><p id="p0079" num="0079"> Intestinal segments incubated for 120 minutes in Ussing chambers in the absence of oleic acid and NaTDC but with thylakoid membranes (2.9 mg chl/ml) were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.15M cacodylate buffer and embedded in Epon, and finally stained in 3% (v/v) uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Fig 4 shows an electron microscope picture of thylakoids attached to the mucosa layer after an Ussing experiment. </p><p id="p0080" num="0080"> Without being bound to any theory, it is believed that the retardation of the passage of molecules through the mucosa layer may be explained by the fact that the thylakoids seems to bind to the mucosa layer as shown by Fig 4. A visual inspection of the mucosa layer seems to confirm this. It is hypothesized that this binding may form a thylakoid layer acting as a barrier on the surface of the mucosa. This barrier may constitute a sterical hindrance bale to retard the passage of molecules, both small and large, through the mucosa as shown by Figs 1 to 3.
