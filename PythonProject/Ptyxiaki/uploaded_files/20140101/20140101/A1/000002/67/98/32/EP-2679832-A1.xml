However, there is no commercial system available, which can generate energy based on hydrostatic energy source, such as a hydrostatic pressure or head.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>Description of the invention</u></b></heading><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Object</u></b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The aim of the present invention is to provide a device and a method for exploiting hydrostatic energy, such as for instance static or hydrostatic pressure or head, to generate and deliver energy, such as for instance hydraulic energy, electrical energy, or mechanical energy. It is further the aim of the invention, to provide a device with a relatively simple and economic structure to be used in a commercial energy generation system. Wherein in the following pressure or hydrostatic potential is meant by head. Static pressure or hydrostatic pressure or head is the pressure exerted by a fluid on a body when the body is at rest relative to the fluid.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>Solution</u></b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">According to the invention, a device for exploiting hydrostatic energy is suggested, wherein the device comprises at least a first chamber and a second chamber, wherein the first chamber and the second chamber are at least partially filled with a fluid. Furthermore, the inventive device comprises a first piston moveably arranged within the first chamber and a second piston moveably arranged within the second chamber, wherein the first piston is mechanically or hydraulically connected to the second piston, wherein the first chamber comprises at least a first means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid and a second means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid, wherein the second chamber comprises at least a third means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid and a fourth means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">By a means for inlet, it is to be understood that the fluid can enter the according chamber through this means. By means for discharge it is to be understood<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> that the fluid can exit the according chamber through this means. Therefore, discharge stands for outlet.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The first chamber and the second chamber can in principle be designed in any shape. For instance the two chambers can have an angular, or a cylindrical shape. For example, the first chamber and/or the second chamber comprise a circular, elliptical, rectangular, quadratic or other cross section. Furthermore, the two chambers can have equal or a different shape. Each piston arranged in the according chamber comprises the same principal shape as the according chamber. It is preferred, that the two chambers have a different size. For example, the second chamber can have a larger size than the first chamber and therefore comprises a larger volume than the first chamber.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The first piston is connected to the second piston by any appropriate mechanical or hydraulic connection means. The two means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid at each of the two chambers can be any appropriate means for inlet and/or discharge of a fluid. For instance these means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid can consist of pipes, holes drilled through the chamber wall or others. The fluid within each of the chambers can be any kind of fluid. For instance the fluid can be a liquid, such as water, oil, petroleum, or any other kind of appropriate liquid. Furthermore, the fluid can be gaseous. For instance, the fluid within each of the two chambers can be air, oxygen or any other kind of appropriate gas. Furthermore, the fluid can be compressible or incompressible, Newtonian or non-Newtonian, pure substances or mixtures. Even if not necessary, it is preferred, that each chamber is at least partially filled with the identical fluid.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The inventive device can be arranged in any appropriate way. For instance, the inventive device can be arranged in such a way that the two chambers are arranged one above the other. Furthermore, it is possible to arrange the two chambers next to one another. Furthermore, it is possible to connect both chambers with each other. Furthermore it is possible to arrange both chambers in a distance to each other, wherein the distance between the two chambers comprises a free space or a space filled with any appropriate material.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Preferably, at least one means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid is connected to a supply source, e.g. a static pressure, a hydrostatic pressure or<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> head source. For example the one means for inlet and / or discharge of the fluid is supplied with a pressure existing on a certain depth or water level within a tank, lake or any other arrangement filled with a fluid, e.g. water, air or other. Additionally, it is possible to connect this means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid to a pressure tank or pressure vessel, e.g. a pressurized hydro-pneumatic tank. Any other kind of fluid can be used as well. The incoming hydrostatic pressure will then cause the piston arranged within the according chamber to move up and/or down or back and/or forwards. In order to ensure a continuous reciprocating movement of the piston, the means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid can be controlled, for instance be opened or closed, in any appropriate way. The reciprocating movement of the pistons can be used to generate any kind of energy. For instance the movement of the pistons can be used to generate a hydraulic energy, in particular an increased pressure or head. The movement of the pistons can be used to generate mechanical or electrical energy. Energy can also be generated from any single or individual stroke of the first piston and/or the second piston. However, a reciprocating movement is preferred.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is preferred, that the first piston splits up the interior of the first chamber into a first volume and a second volume and wherein the first means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid is allocated to the first volume and wherein the second means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid is allocated to the second volume and wherein the second piston splits up the interior of the second chamber into a third volume and a fourth volume and wherein the third means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid is allocated to the third volume and wherein the fourth means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid is allocated to the fourth volume. Preferably, each volume or space is fully or completely filled with the fluid. The size of each volume or space, within each chamber varies during operation of the inventive device due to the reciprocating movement of the first and second piston. It is preferred that the stroke or distance of each movement is identical for the first and the second piston.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The first piston can be connected to the second piston by any appropriate connection means. Therefore, the first piston can move in an opposite direction to the movement of the second piston. However, it is preferred that<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the first piston is connected to the second piston in such a way, that both pistons move synchronously to each other and in the same direction with each stroke. It is further preferred, that the first volume or space within the first chamber and the third volume or space within the second chamber are decreased or increased at the same point of time due to the movement of the first piston and the second piston.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Each means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid is arranged at an end region of the volume this means is allocated to. For example, the first means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid is arranged at a first front side of the first chamber or at a side wall of the first chamber close to the first front side of the first chamber or at the corner region between the first front side of the first chamber and a side wall of the first chamber. Therefore, each means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid is arranged in such a way, that it is not covered by a piston during its movement.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">It is further preferred that the first chamber comprises a fifth means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid and a sixth means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid and wherein the second chamber comprises a seventh means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid and a eighth means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid. Preferably always two means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid are allocated to an identical volume. For example, the first and the fifth means of inlet and/or discharge of the fluid are both allocated to the first volume, and the second and sixth means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid are both allocated to second volume, and the third and seventh means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid are both allocated to third volume, and the fourth and eighth means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid are both allocated to the fourth volume.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Additionally, the device preferably comprises a first tank, wherein the first tank is connected by a connection means to the first means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid and/or that the first tank is connected by a connection means to the second means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid and/or that the first tank is connected by a connection means to the third means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid and/or that the first tank is connected by a connection means to the fourth means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid and/or<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> that the first tank is connected by a connection means to the fifth means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid and/or that the first tank is connected by a connection means to the sixth means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid and/or that the first tank is connected by a connection means to the seventh means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid and/or that the first tank is connected by a connection means to the eighth means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid. The first tank can be used as an auxiliary tank for temporary collecting or storing the fluid. Appropriate connection means for connecting the first tank with any of the means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid can be any connection means appropriate for moving the fluid. For example, pipes can be used as connection means which allow the fluid, e.g. water, to move or flow from and/or to the first tank.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The first tank can be arranged next to the first chamber and/or next to the second chamber. Furthermore, the first tank can be arranged above the first chamber and/or above the second chamber. The first tank can be any appropriate repository, bin or container. Furthermore, the first tank can consist of any possible shape. Additionally, the first tank can be opened or closed. Preferably, the pressure within an opened or closed first tank is in the range of the atmospheric pressure, for example within the range of the atmospheric air pressure. The first tank can be located close to the inventive device or at a certain distance to the inventive device. It is further possible to locate the first tank far away, for example multiple meters or kilometers, away from the inventive device.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is further preferred that the first tank is at least partially arranged around the first chamber and/or around the second chamber. The first tank can comprise separate walls. It is further possible that the outer wall of the first chamber or the second chamber is used as a wall for the first tank.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Preferably, at least one means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid is connected to a supply source, e.g. a static pressure, a hydrostatic pressure or head source. For this reason, this means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid is supplied with a higher pressure compared with the pressure in the first tank of the device, e.g. pressure in the first tank could be the atmospheric pressure, or pressure in the first tank could be higher or lower than the atmospheric pressure.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> For example the one means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid is supplied with a pressure existing on a certain depth or water level within a tank, lake or any other arrangement filled with a fluid, e.g. water, or it can be supplied with atmospheric pressure, e.g. the atmospheric air pressure, if the first tank comprises enough vacuum pressure.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Additionally the device comprises a manual or automatic control system in particular, valves or an automatic hydraulic directional valve. A valve can be arranged at or within the means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid. Furthermore, the valves can be arranged within or at the connection means. The control system, e.g. the valves, is used to control the flow of the fluid and in particular the direction of the flow of the fluid through each of the means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid. Furthermore the control system, e.g. valves, is used to stop and/or initiate the flow or movement of the fluid through a means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid. The control system can for example set a certain configuration for all means for inlet and/or the discharge of the fluid at any certain point of time. For example, at a point of time the first means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid can be configured or activated for inlet, wherein the second means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid is configured or activated for discharge or outlet, and wherein the third means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid is configured or activated for inlet, and wherein the fourth means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid is configured or activated for discharge or outlet. Valves used for the control system can consist of any appropriate type of valves. For example such valves can be check valves, or any type of shut off valves, e.g. gate, ball, butterfly, globe or membrane valves, or combination of some of these valves.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">That at least two means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid are connected by connection means wherein the connection means or preferably comprising pipes and/or holes internally drilled inside and along the chamber walls. The pipes can consist of flexible or non-flexible pipes. Furthermore, the pipes can consist of a combination of flexible and non-flexible pipes. Holes which are internally drilled inside and along the chamber walls can be arranged along the entire length of a wall of the first chamber and/or the second chamber. Furthermore it is possible, that the holes internally drilled inside and along the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> chamber walls are arranged along a part of the length of the first chamber and/or the second chamber. It is also possible, that the chamber walls are consisting of a double-walled arrangement, wherein the space between the two walls of the double-walled arrangement is used as the connection means.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Preferably, at least one of the means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid allocated to the first volume is connected to at least one of the means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid allocated to the fourth volume. Furthermore it is preferred that at least one of the means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid allocated to the third volume is connected to at least one of the means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid allocated to the second volume. The word "connected" means that the fluid can flow or move through the connection means.

It is further preferred, that the connection means used to mechanically or hydraulically connect the first piston with the second piston is connected to a front side of the first piston and to a front side of the second piston. For instance, the connection means can be a bar, or a rod. Due to the connection area or interface area needed for connecting such a connection means, e.g. rod, at one of the front sides of a piston, the remaining and effective surface area of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> this front side is reduced.

However, since the surface areas of each front side of a piston are different, a higher pressure is obtained in the side of the chamber with a smaller surface area of the front side of the piston. Therefore, the pressure in the first volume of the first chamber can be different to the pressure in the second volume of the first chamber during movement of the first piston. Furthermore, the pressure within the third volume of the second chamber is different to the pressure in the fourth volume of the second chamber during movement of the second piston.

Therefore, the fluid 12 will not flow through one of the eight means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12 as long as all shut off valves are closed.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In a first step, shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2b</figref>, the shut off valve 30c and the shut off valve 30b are opened. After opening shut off valve 30b, fluid 12, assumed to be water in this example, at the static pressure 40 will enter the second chamber 11 through the third means 17 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2a</figref> the chambers of the inventive device were initially filled with air before starting of the inventive device or opening any valve. Due to the static pressure 40 applying to the second chamber 11 through the third means 17 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12, the fluid 12 is entering the second chamber 11 and applying pressure to the surface area 36a of the front side 36 of the second piston 14. This pressure is forcing the second piston 14 to move from the left to the right position within the second chamber 11. Since<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> the first piston 13 is mechanically connected with the second piston 14, the first piston is moved from the left side to the right side of the first chamber 10 at the same time as the second piston 14 is moved from left to right within the second chamber 11. Therefore, the first volume 19 within the first chamber 10 and the third volume 27 within the second chamber 11 are being increased while the second volume 20 within the first chamber 10 and the fourth volume 28 within the second chamber 11 are being decreased at the same time. The air within the fourth volume 28 of the second chamber 11 flows out of the second chamber 11 through the eight means 24 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12 and flows through pipe 32c partially into the auxiliary tank 25 and partially flows into the first volume 19 of the first chamber 10 through the fifth means 21 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12. Since the first chamber 10 is smaller than the second chamber 11, not the entire volume of fluid 12 exiting the second chamber 11, while decreasing the fourth volume, fits into the first volume 19. Therefore, a part of the fluid 12 exiting the second chamber 11 (air at this step) flows into the first tank 25. Furthermore, air from the second volume 20 of the first chamber 10 flows out through the sixth means 22 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12 and flows into the second tank 39 through pipes 32d and 32f. Once both pistons, the first piston 13 and the second piston 14, have moved from left to right, all shut off valves are closed. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2b</figref> shows the inventive device after the first movement of the two pistons 13 and 14 from left to right, before closing valves 30b and 30c. In this situation, the first volume 19, the second volume 20 and the fourth volume 28 are filled with air. The third volume 27 is now filled with water.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In a next step, shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2c</figref>, shut off valves 30j, 30d, 30h, and 30a are opened. Therefore, the static pressure 40 enters the second chamber 11 through the fourth means 18 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12. The fourth volume 28 of the second chamber 11 is therefore being filled with fluid 12 in this example with water. The pressure applied to the fourth surface area 37a of the fourth front side 37 of the second piston 14 is forcing the second piston 14 to move from the right side of the second chamber 11 to the left side of the second chamber 11. Due to the mechanical connection of the two pistons 13 and 14, the first piston 13 is moved from right to left at the same time. The<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> third volume 27 is being decreased while the fluid 12, water, flows out of the third volume 27 of the second chamber 11 through the seventh means 23 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12 into the second tank 39. Since the third surface area 36a of the third front side 36 of the second piston 14 is smaller than the fourth surface area 37a of the fourth front side 37 of the second piston 14, the pressure within the third volume 27 is higher than the pressure within the fourth volume 28. Also, due to the mechanical connection of the two pistons 13 and 14, the second volume 20 is being increased and first volume 19 is being decreased. Increasing in volume 20 creates a suction effect, while decreasing in volume 19 increases pressure in this volume (air pressure at this step). An increased pressure is also obtained in the first volume 19 of the first chamber 10, since the fourth surface area 37a of the fourth front side 37 of the second piston 14 is larger than the first surface area 34a of the first front side 34 of the first piston 13. The fluid 12 temporally stored within the first tank 25 (air at this step) enters the first chamber 10 through the second means 16 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12 as the second volume 20 increases. The air within the first volume of the first chamber 10 is forced through the first means for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12 through valves 30j and 30k. Once the first piston 13 and the second piston 14 have been moved back from right to left all shut off valves are closed. <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2c</figref> shows the step after movement of the two pistons 13, 14 back from the right side to the left side of each chamber 10, 11 before closing the valves 30a, 30d, 30h, 30j.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2d</figref> shows the next step for moving back both pistons 13, 14 from the left side of each chamber 10, 11 to the right of each chamber 10, 11. For moving back the first piston 13 and the second piston 14, the shut off valves 30b and 30c are opened. Therefore, water at the static pressure 40 enters the third volume 27 of the second chamber 11 through the third means 17 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12 and through valve 30b. Therefore, the third volume 27 within the second chamber 11 is being increased and the fourth volume 28 within second chamber 11 is being decreased while the second piston 14 is moved back from left to right within the second chamber 11. Due to the mechanical connection of the first piston 13 with the second piston 14, the first piston 13 is also moved from the left side of the first chamber 10 to the right<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> side of the first chamber 10. Therefore, also the first volume 19 of the first chamber 10 is being increased, thus creating a suction effect in volume 19, while the second volume 20 of the first chamber 10 is being decreased, thus increasing pressure in this volume 20. An increased pressure is obtained also in this volume 20 since the third surface area 36a of the third front side 36 of the second piston 14 is larger than the second surface area 35a of the second front side 35 of the first piston 13. The water within the fourth volume 28 of the second chamber 11 exits the second chamber 11 through the eight means 24 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12 and partially enters the first chamber 10 through the check valve 30i and through the fifth means 21 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12 while increasing the first volume 19. The remaining part of the fluid 12 enters the first tank 25. Once both pistons, the first piston 13 and the second piston 14, have moved back from the left to the right side of each chamber 10, 11, all valves are closed.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 2e</figref> shows the next step for moving back the pistons 13, 14 from the right side to the left side. For this step, shut off valves 30j, 30d, 30h, and 30a are opened. Water at the static pressure 40 enters the second chamber 11 through valve 30a and through the fourth means 18 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12 while increasing the fourth volume 28. This causes the second piston 14 to move from the right side of the second chamber 11 to the left side of the second chamber 11. Due to the mechanical connection of the two pistons 13 and 14, the first piston 13 is moved from the right side of the first chamber 10 to the left side of the first chamber 10 at the same time. Due to differences between the different involved surface areas, i.e., fourth surface area 37a larger than third surface area 36a, and fourth surface area 37a larger than first surface area 34a, the pressure within the first volume 19 of the first chamber 10, and within the third volume of the second chamber 11, are substantially increased. The fluid 12 exits the third volume 27 of the second chamber 11 through the seventh means 23 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12 and flows through the valves 30d and 30e and enters the second tank 39. Furthermore, the fluid 12 exits the first volume 19 of the first chamber 10 through the first means 15 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12 and flows through the valves 30j and 30k, and 30l and enters the second tank 39. Additionally, the fluid 12 temporally<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> stored within the first tank 25 is sucked by the second volume 20 and enters the first chamber 10 through the valves 30h, 30g and the second means 16 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12.

Therefore, the shut off valves 30c and 30b are opened. Water at the static pressure 40 enters the second chamber 11 through the valve 30b and the third means 17 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12. Therefore, the third volume 27 within the second chamber 11 is being increased while the fourth volume 28 within the second chamber 11 is being decreased. The second piston 14 and the first piston 13 are moved back from the left side to the right within each chamber 10 and 11. The fluid 12 exits the second chamber 11 through the eight means 24 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12 and partially enters the first chamber 10 through the fifth means 21 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12, sucked by the first volume 19, while the remaining fluid 12 enters the auxiliary tank 25. Since the first volume 19 increases while the second volume 20 decreases, and since the third surface area 36a is larger than the second surface area 35a, pressure increases in second volume 20, and the fluid 12 exits the first chamber 10 through the sixth means 22 for inlet and/or discharge of the fluid 12 and enters the second tank 39.

Such an application can be for example used to deliver water to houses or to high rise buildings. Furthermore such an application can be used as the prime or sole of water supply system 42a. In this case, the increased discharge pressure is discharged into a pressure tank, e.g. a pressurized hydro-pneumatic tank to provide a specific flow and pressure pattern for water supply.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057"><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 5</figref> shows a principal application for generating mechanical energy by connecting a wheel for example a fly-wheel 43, to one of the pistons 13, 14 arranged within a chamber 10, 11 of the device 100 for exploiting hydrostatic energy.

In this case, the incoming hydrostatic pressure, once in the interior of the device, and due to differences in surface areas of each piston, moves the interior pistons up and down or back-and-forth (in a reciprocating movement) which is converted into rotational movement. Such an embodiment can be used to store rotational energy and stabilize rotational speed.

In such an application, the movement of the pistons 13, 14 within the chambers 10, 11 of the device 100 for exploiting hydrostatic energy is used to produce a necessary changing magnetic field to produce electric energy. Instead of applying high forces against the fluid 12 to increase the discharging pressure, they can be applied<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> against a "changing with the time magnetic field" to generate electric energy directly. Such a configuration or embodiment is based on the Faradays law of electromagnetic induction, which applies to the production of electric current across a conductor moving through a magnetic field. Based on the Faradays law, the electromotive force (EMF) around an electric closed path is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux to any surface bounded by the path. In other words, an electric current will be induced in any closed circuit when the magnetic flux through a surface bounded by the conductor changes. This applies whether the field itself changes in strength or the conductor is moved through it. The incoming hydrostatic pressure 40, once in the interior of the inventive device 100, due to differences in surface areas of each piston moves an interior piston 13, 14 up and down or back-and-forth in a reciprocating movement. This movement is then used to produce the necessary changing magnetic field to produce electric energy. For this purpose, the device 100 comprises electric wire coils 45 arranged around the first chamber 10 and around the second chamber 11.

The hydrostatic pressure 40 has in this case been previously charged in the hydro-pneumatic tank by using for example pressurized air. Since discharge pressure 42 is significantly higher than the hydrostatic pressure<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> 40 in the hydro-pneumatic tank, the discharged flow can be easily injected back into the hydro-pneumatic tank. This means, that only a very small part of the total discharged energy is taken to inject this flow back.

For detecting when the hydrostatic energy generator internal piston 53 reaches the upper end or the lower end during the movement within the first chamber 10 and the second chamber 11, the position of the valve internal piston 52 (see <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 9a and 9b</figref>) must be synchronized with the hydrostatic energy generator internal piston 53.

The first internal hole 54 activates the automatic hydraulic directional valve 50 when the hydrostatic energy generator internal piston 53 reaches the upper end. The second internal hole 55 activates the automatic hydraulic directional valve 50 when the hydrostatic energy generator internal piston 53 reaches the lower end. The term "Activates the automatic hydraulic directional valve 50" means that the incoming static source 40 (e.g. hydrostatic pressure) is transferred through these internal holes to the automatic hydraulic directional valve 50 to push the valve internal piston 52.
