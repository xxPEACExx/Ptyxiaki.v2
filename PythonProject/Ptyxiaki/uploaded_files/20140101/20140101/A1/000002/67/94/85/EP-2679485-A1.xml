Developments of the invention are stated in the dependent claims and the following description.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to a first aspect of the present invention, a floor panel for a floor of a passenger cabin of a mobile platform is provided. The floor panel comprises a base body and a cover element. The base body has a cable channel which is integrated in the base body and the extents along a longitudinal direction of the base body for accommodating electric cables. For example, the cable channel extends along the entire length of the base body.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The cover element is adapted for being arranged on top of the cable channel and on top of a part of the top surface of the base body. This cover element serves for covering the cable channel. It can be firmly attached to the base body and is adapted to support the floor panel with respect to flow of forces, thereby adding to its stability.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The base body may be realized in the form of a sandwich component that includes two honeycomb structures, the first honeycomb structure extending from a left edge of the base body to a left side of the cable channel and the second honeycomb structure extending from a right edge of the base body to a right side of the cable channel.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In other words, the two honeycomb structures are arranged side by side and may even lie in the same plane. Between the two honeycomb structures, the cable channel is located.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">By firmly attaching the cover element to the base body and by arranging the cover element on top of the top surface of the base body the floor panel may be of a comparatively slim design and may be less thick than other floor panels which comprise cable channels. Thus, an easy introduction in flying aircrafts may be possible. No changes of aircraft systems, such as electric or hydraulic systems, which are located underneath the floor panels may be necessary. Advantageously, the floor panel fits in different positions and in different orientation into an aircraft cabin. For example, the cable channel can easily be shifted sideways by simply rotating the base body by 180° around its vertical axis. If the floor panel is arranged between two seat tracks, the cable channel may thus be moved from the left seat track, or vice versa.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Thus, a redesign of the cabin may be performed more easily.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Since the cover element not only serves for covering the cable channel but also provides mechanical stability since it is firmly fixed to the floor panel base body and can thus transfer forces which are created when a person walks over the floor panel, the weight of the floor panel may be smaller than the weight of comparable floor panels.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the floor panel is self-supporting when it is supported along its left and right edges only, if the cover element is attached to the base body.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In other words, is the floor panel integrated in the passenger cabin of the mobile platform and attached to structural elements of the fuselage of the mobile platform, such as, for example seat tracks, it is self-supporting in case the cover element is attached to the base body, even if the floor panel is only supported in the region of its left and right edges only.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">For example, the cover element is a planar cover element, and may be a sheet of metal. It is adapted to be placed on top of the opening of the cable channel and does not necessarily extend into the cable channel.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, both honeycomb structures share a common top cover layer and a common bottom cover layer, wherein the bottom of the cable channel is formed by the top cover layer and the bottom cover layer.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the floor panel is adapted for being arranged between a first seat rail (also referred to as seat track) and a second seat rail which is parallel to the first seat rail. The base body, according to this exemplary embodiment, comprises a first attachment region parallel and adjacent to the left edge of the base body for attachment to the first seat rail. The base body also comprises a second attachment region parallel and adjacent to the right edge of the base body for attachment to the second seat rail.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Furthermore, according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the top cover layer includes a first carbon fibre reinforced plastic layer comprising parallel arranged fibres having longitudinal axes in a first direction, and a second carbon fibre reinforced plastic layer comprising parallel arranged fibres having a longitudinal axis in a second direction, which is different from the first direction. For example, the angle between the two directions is 90°, +45° or -45°.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Of course, the top cover layer may include further layers of carbon fibre reinforced plastic layers and/or glass fibre reinforced plastic layers.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the bottom cover layer includes a plurality of carbon fibre reinforced plastic layers. Of course,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> one or more additional layers may be provided, for example glass fibre reinforced plastic layers.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the floor panel comprises at least one primary coil for a wireless transmission of electric signals from the primary coil to a receiver of an electric consumer.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">This electric consumer may, for example, be an entertainment device integrated in a passenger seat.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">For example, the at least one primary coil is integrated in the cable channel of the base body or in the cover element.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to another aspect of the present invention, a floor panel arrangement for a passenger cabin of a mobile platform is provided, the arrangement comprising a first floor panel and a second floor panel, as described above and below. Further, the arrangement comprises a connecting element connecting the first floor panel to the second floor panel. The connecting element has a flat middle region which is positioned in the cable channels of the two floor panels on top of and adjacent to the top cover layers of the two floor panels.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the connecting element further comprises a left side portion and a right side portion arranged between the first floor panel and the second floor panel. For example, both the left side portion and the right side portion may be flat elements protruding from a corresponding rim of the flat middle region of the connecting element, wherein the flat middle region of the connecting element has a surface normal perpendicular to the surface normals of the left and right side portions.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to another aspect of the present invention, a mobile platform is provided which comprises a passenger cabin with an above and below described floor panel and/or floor panel arrangement.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the mobile platform is an aircraft, such as a helicopter or an airplane.

The base body is realized in the form of a sandwich component with a first honeycomb structure 103 and a second honeycomb structure 104, between which a cable channel 106 is arranged. Both honeycomb structures 103, 104 share a common top cover layer 101 and a common bottom cover layer 102. For example, the top cover layer 101 comprises two layers of carbon fibre reinforced plastic. Of course, additional layers of carbon fibre reinforced plastic and/or glass fibre reinforced plastic may be provided.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The bottom cover layer 102 comprises two or more layers of carbon fibre reinforced plastic, for example 8 or 10 layers.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The top cover layer 101 and the bottom cover layer 102 of the two honeycomb structures 103, 104 need each other in the region of the cable channel 106 to form the bottom 105 of the cable channel.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1B</figref> shows a more detailed view of the section 120 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref>.
