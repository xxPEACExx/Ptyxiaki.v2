In injection molding, in a case where a molding material is a thermoplastic resin such as polyamide (PA), polyphenylene sulphide (PPS), polyether ether ketone (PEEK) or the like, with respect to a plastic heated at a softening temperature (generally 180°C to 450°C), an injection pressure is applied and a metal die is filled to form the mold. The molding process is called "mold clamping" since maintaining an inner pressure of the die is necessary until the plastic filling the die has solidified.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> In the mold clamping of the injection molding machine in the related art, as a method of applying a mold clamping force, a cylinder drive method using a hydraulic control has mainly been used. However, in recent years, without using a large amount of oil, a ball screw drive method by an electric servo control using a high torque motor which is environmentally frienclly and excellent in energy saving performance has been developed and put into practical use.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><figref idrefs="f0015">Figs. 17</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0016">18</figref> illustrate an electric injection molding machine 101, which includes a mold clamping unit 102 and an injection unit 103. The mold clamping unit 102 has a rear platen 104, a movable platen 105 and a fixing platen 106, and performs opening and closing of the molding die and the mold clamping through a mold clamping mechanism 108 where a molding die 107 placed between the movable platen 105 and the fixing platen 106 is placed between the rear platen 104 and the movable platen 105.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The mold clamping mechanism 108 has a toggle structure and if a mold clamping ball screw 110 pivotally supported on the rear platen 104 is driven to turn by a mold clamping motor 109, a cross head 111 moving back and forth, is expanded and contracted. As a result, the movable platen 105 is moved back and forth. The mold clamping ball screw 110 is pivotally supported on the rear platen 104 by a support bearing 112.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In addition, the movable platen 105 has a drive mechanism 141 which drives an ejector pin 140 in order to thrust out a product from the molding die 107 after die forming. The drive mechanism 141 has a motor and a ball screw, and rotates an<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> ejector axis 142 forming a screw axis of the ball screw so as to move the ejector pin 140. The ejector axis ball screw is pivotally supported on the movable platen 105 by a support bearing (not illustrated).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The injection unit 103 has a rear plate 113, a movable plate 114 and a front plate 115. A proximal portion of a measurement/injection screw 117 placed in a cylinder assembly 116 of the front plate 115 is pivotally supported on a front surface of the movable plate 114 (mold clamping unit side) via a support bearing 118 (screw sleeve). The measurement/injection screw 117 measures a resin for molding and during melting and kneading, is rotated to turn by a metering motor (not illustrated) attached to the movable plate 114.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">As also illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5</figref>, the movable plate 114 has additionally a ball nut 120 fixed to a rear surface thereof and an injection ball screw 121 screwed thereto is pivotally supported on the rear plate 113, thereby configuring an injection mechanism 122. The injection ball screw 121 is pivotally supported on the rear plate 113 by a support bearing 123 and in addition, is driven by an injection motor 124 attached to the rear plate 113.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">If the injection motor 124 is driven in forward direction, the injection ball screw 121 is subject to a positive rotation. Then, the movable plate 114 moves forward and a molten resin inside the cylinder assembly 116 is injected into the molding die 107 by the injection/measurement screw 117. Upon injection, the measurement motor is driven, the injection/measurement screw 117 is rotated and the resin is newly subject to measuring and mixing. At this time, the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> injection/measurement screw 117 retreats, being pressed by a pressure of the resin fed thereinto. However, a back pressure is exerted by the injection motor 124 such that the mixing and the melting are sufficiently performed. In a stage after completing the measurement, in order to prevent a leakage from a nozzle's tip end, the injection motor 124 is in reverse rotation, the injection/measurement screw 117 is slightly retreated and a sack back is performed.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In addition, the injection unit 103 has a nozzle touch mechanism 153 which brings a ball screw 151 to be in positive rotation or reverse rotation using a drive motor 150 and makes the cylinder assembly 116 proceed back and forth to the fixing platen 106. The nozzle touch mechanism 153 presses a nozzle 116a on a tip end attached to the cylinder assembly 116, using a predetermined force, to the molding die 107 attached to the fixing platen 106. The nozzle touch ball screw 151 is pivotally supported by a support bearing (not illustrated).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Here, in the injection molding machine using an electric servo control, the above described mold clamping ball screw support bearing 112, an ejector axis ball screw support bearing, an injection ball screw support bearing 123 and a nozzle touch ball screw support bearing undertake a large axial load during a rotation support of the ball screw, mold clamping and the like. Accordingly, a specifically dedicated ball screw support bearing using a large diameter ball as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref> comes to be used.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In addition, in a ball screw device disclosed in PTL 1, a multiple row combination ball bearing which supports a screw axis of a ball screw adaptable for the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> electric injection molding machine is disclosed in that a load carrying capacity of a thrust load is greatly secured by setting a contact angle to be more than or equal to 40 degrees and less than or equal to 65 degrees.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Citation List</b></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013"><ul><li>Patent Literature<br/>

The angular contact ball bearing 200 undertakes an axial load of the ball screw generated due to a broaching load during a process. Even in that case, in order to be able to satisfy a rolling contact fatigue life of the bearing, a specification is made so that a contact angle is complied with a load direction as much as possible. Generally, the contact angle is set to be 60 degrees. In a case of a tandem duplex using the bearings which have the same contact angle as each other by juxtaposing the neighboring bearings, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0017">Fig. 19A</figref>, an extension line L of a normal line of the contact angle is not generally included inside an axial direction end plane 201 of the adjacent bearing 200. In addition, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0017">Fig. 19B</figref>, even in a case of considering an osculating ellipse C of a ball and a raceway groove, the extension lines<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> La and Lb connecting radial direction end points a and b of the osculating ellipse C inside each raceway groove from a ball center are not generally included inside an axial direction end plane 201 of the adjacent bearing 200. Such angular contact ball bearing is designed in consideration of the rolling contact fatigue life. In a case of applying to the machine tools, a bearing ring rarely undertakes such an extremely large load as to cause damage due to bending of the bearing ring. Accordingly, even though a specification allows such tandem duplex, no problems have occurred.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">On the other hand, accompanied by motorization of the injection molding machine or the like which use hydraulic pressure, there has emerged a use for bearing a large thrust load which is unexpected in a commonly used ball screw support angular contact ball bearing. For that reason, if the large thrust load acts, a groove portion or the bearing ring undertakes an intensive load and thus there is a probability of malfunction such as fractured bearing ring or the like.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In addition, in the use of the injection molding machine, in order to satisfy the fatigue life of the bearing with respect to the large load, so as to undertake the load in one direction, there are a lot of cases to adopt four to five rows of the multiple row combination ball bearing which was rarely used in the related art. Accordingly, there may be also a lot of spots subject to the occurrence of malfunctions.</p><heading id="h0006">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">The present invention, in consideration of the above described problems, is intended to provide a multiple row combination ball bearing capable of preventing a malfunction such as damage and fracture of the bearing ring, even in a case of bearing<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> an extremely large thrust load.</p><heading id="h0007"><b>Means for solving the problem</b></heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">The above-described object can be achieved with following configuration.
