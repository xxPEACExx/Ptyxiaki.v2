It is further directed to the use of branched chain amino acids for the preparation of either a food supplement or a medicament for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of joint and/or postural instability. In 2008 eight million people in Germany suffered from joint related diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and others. </p><p id="p0003" num="0003"> 360 000 had a joint replacement, therefrom the majority regarding the hips and the knees (Press release Endoprothetic clinic Ortenau (19.05.2010)). Joint replacements are normally the last option to relieve pain in damaged or arthritis joints and restore the range of motion available in joints. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004"> Initially exercise, strengthening, and stretching techniques are performed to decrease joint pain and increase joint range of motion. However, if significant relief of pain and improvement in mobility is not achieved, a joint replacement is an important consideration to improve function of life and to enable people to be physical active. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005"> According to the WHO physical inactivity is now identified as the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality (6% of death globally). Physical inactivity levels are rising in many countries with major implications for the prevalence of </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and the general health of the population worldwide. (WHO Brochure ..GLOBAL recommendations on PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR HEALTH" 2010). </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> It is obvious that joint pain and joint stiffness restrain people from being physical active. Furthermore the perceived loss of stability (frailty) increases the fear to tumble, people lose confidence for being physical active. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> Joint stability is a pre-requisite of mobility and physical activity. Joint stability describes the displacement or respectively subluxation of two bones relative to each other and can be measured. A subluxation is the condition of a vertebra that has lost its proper juxtaposition with the one above or the one below or both to an 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 extent less than a luxation, which impinges nerves and interferes with the transmission of mental impulses. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> Preservation of joint stability cannot be ascribed to the ligaments alone, but should be considered as a synergistic function in which bones, joint capsules, ligaments, muscles, tendons, and sensory receptors and their spinal and cortical neural projects and connections function in harmony. Biomechanical malalignment of the joints can contribute to the development of OA. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> Joint instability refers to a joints inability to withstand normal ranges of impact and motion without becoming injured, displaced or dislocated. Various musculoskeletal, or extra-articular, structures may be involved such as the bones, tendons, ligaments, muscles and soft tissue. Compromised intra-articular (within the cavity of the joint) integrity may also contribute to joint instability. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> One of the main mechanical functions of articular cartilage is to act as a low- friction, load-bearing surface. These mechanical loads are absorbed by the cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM), where they are subsequently dissipated and transmitted to chondrocytes (cartilage cells). Due to its unique location at joint surfaces, articular cartilage experiences a range of static and dynamic forces that include shear, compression and tension. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> Chondrocytes, cells specialised in the release of cartilage constituents, sense and convert the mechanical signals they receive into biochemical signals, which subsequently direct and mediate both anabolic (matrix building) and catabolic (matrix degrading) processes. These processes include the synthesis of matrix proteins (type II collagen and proteoglycans), proteases, protease inhibitors, transcription factors, cytokines and growth factors. Homoeostasis is strongly influenced by the type of loading, high strain rates which cause tissue damage, results in degradation and a decrease in matrix production as well as apoptosis. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> A lack of joint stability leads to imbalanced mechanical loads of the cartilage and can thereby increase wear and tear. Osteoarthritis is characterised by a loss of cartilage. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> Main causes for the development of OA are </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"> • Age </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> • Obesity 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 • Joint injury or joint overuse </p><p id="p0017" num="0017"> • Occupational stress: repetitive and monotonous movements at work and</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">• Inactivity </p><p id="p0019" num="0019"> Inactivity contributes to joint deterioration. Considering the fact that the cartilage in joints can only be nurtured by diffusion (due to a lack of blood vessels) and these diffusion processes are supported by the compression or flexion of the articular cartilage, the meaning of mobility is obvious. </p><p id="p0020" num="0020"> Joint stability, especially knee stability is normally evaluated by the Lachmann test wherein the participant is asked to lie supine and the knee flexes around 30° (Torg J, Conrad W, Kalen V. Clinical diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament instability in the athlete. Am J Sports Med 4: 84-93 (1976)). The examiner then stabilizes the femur and applies an anterior force on tibia without restraining axial rotation. Deflection of the tibiae against the patella is measured while the leg is charged with 75% of body weight and flexed 30°. </p><p id="p0021" num="0021"> As described above physical activity can be used to increase joint stability and postural instability. Further, chondroprotectives, such as glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, are frequently used in order to diminish loss of cartilage especially in osteoarthritis. Although some studies confirm some beneficial effects in OA further therapeutic possibilities are highly needed, especially such that increase joint stability and postural instability. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022"> Surprisingly it was found by the present invention that the regular intake of at least two branched chain amino acids (for at least two month) leads to an increase of joint stability and postural stability and can thereby increase the quality of life. Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a composition for the use to increase joint stability and/or postural stability, wherein said composition comprises at least two branched chain amino acids. </p><p id="p0023" num="0023"> Advantageously, the intake comprises L-leucine together with at least one of the branched chain amino acids L-iso-leucine and L-valine, as, for example, L- leucine and L-iso-leucine or L-leucine and L-valine.

A device with a high temporal and local resolution for the measurement of the tibial displacement under functional conditions has been developed at the University of Stuttgart. Basis of the measurement is the determination of the deflection of the tibiae against the patella vie an 10 g accelerometer at dynami force application of two different forces. The leg is charged with 75% of the body weight (control via scales) and flexed 30° (Figure 1 ). </p><p id="p0087" num="0087">Measurement of postural stability </p><p id="p0088" num="0088"> Postural stability (total, anteroposterios, and mediolateral postural stability) is assessed according to the balance test as described by Myer et al. (Myer G, Brunner H , Meldon P, Peterno M, Ford K, and Hewett T Specialised </p><p id="p0089" num="0089">neuromuscular training to improve neuromuscular function and biomechanics in a patient with quiescent juvenile rheumatoid arthritis Phys Ther 85:791 -802 (2005)). In such method a stabilometer Balance-coordination system (for example GK 1000 IMM Elektronik GmbH) is used to measure the sway amplitude of the center of pressure (COP) within a 40 sec bipedal standing test. Person has to stand with both legs on an instable platform and then all the movements to regain balance can be measured electronically and thereby the postural stability. </p><p id="p0090" num="0090">Study </p><p id="p0091" num="0091"> The effect of the composition of the present invention on joint stability was tested in a double-blind randomized placebo controlled clinical study. 48 healthy subjects, aged 54 to 72 years with a BMI from 22 to 30 (ratio men and women 1 :1) and with low activity level were included in the current trial. In total 45 subjects finished the main part of the study. Participants had to exercise moderately 3 times the week for 30 minutes using a device which allows to train with the individual body weight and to increase the efforts by increased repetition. During the study (3 months) participants had to take branched chain amino acid containing powder composition as described above (verum) or placebo once per day closed to the

 highest level of physical activity. Baseline values for physical performance and biomarkers of cartilage synthesis and degradation were evaluated at the beginning of the study (visit 1) and further measurement occurred intermittently every month, ending with the end of the study (visit 4). Measurements were done before (pre), directly after (Oh after) and three hours after (3h after) having a specified physical work-load (see Figure 2). </p><p id="p0092" num="0092"> Physical work-load was exercised by using a "Physical workload model". In such Physical workload model participants had to perform an eccentric walk down with a 25% gradient on a treadmill. Subjects were additionally loaded with 10 % of their body weight in the form of a lead-weighted jacket. Women had to walk at 4 km/h, men at 5 km/h. At visit 1 participants were asked to walk as long as possible according to their individual capacity without exceeding 40 minutes. At visit 4 the individual protocol from visit 1 was repeated. Before treadmill (pre) and directly after treadmill (Oh after) and at 3 hours (3h after) leg extension was assessed using the David Back concept (David Health Solutions LTD) (Wydra G. Zur Problematik von Normen in der Bewegungstherapie Krankengymnastik 2004) The measurement of leg extension represents a validated method to evaluate the muscle strength and thereby also loss of strength (Saris W. et al, PASSCLAIM- Physical performance and fitness Eur J Nutr 2003). </p><p id="p0093" num="0093"> As biomarkers for cartilage synthesis and degradation CP2 (C-propeptide of type two collagen CP2, synonym CM CP), a marker reflecting the synthesis of new collagen, and C2C (type two collagen collagenase cleavage neoepitop), a marker reflecting the degradation of collagen from blood samples, were assessed (Bijlsma J et al Osteoarthritis: an update with relevance for clinical practice Lancet 2011). The rationale underlying the use of such biomarkers is that physical workload of joints leads to the release of structural fragments of collagen in the cartilage which have to be replaced by the synthesis of new collagen. Such increased metabolism induced by physical workload results in a decrease of the ratio of cartilage degradation and synthesis biomarkers (C2C/CP2). Therefore, a decline of the workload induced decrease of C2C/CP2 ratio can be interpreted as an </p><p id="p0094" num="0094">improvement of joint stability. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="15"/>-->
 Results </p><p id="p0095" num="0095"> Under physical strain on the joints (in the Physical workload model) the intake of the verum led to an additional improvement of joint stability compared to placebo. </p><p id="p0096" num="0096"> The results on strength loss after physical strain are presented in Figure 3. As shown by this the loss of the strength of the physical strain was significantly less pronounced in the verum group after taking verum for 3 month as compared to the placebo group, wherein the loss of strength was nearly identical at the two time points. The less pronounced loss of strength in the verum group indicates its beneficial increase in strength endurance. The increase of strength endurance is beneficial in daily activities such as stair climbing and long distance walking and might encourage especially older people to stay physically active. Physical activity is necessary to maintain healthy joints. </p><p id="p0097" num="0097"> The results on ratio of cartilage degradation and synthesis biomarkers of the physical strain are presented in Figure 4. As shown by this the decrease of the ratio of cartilage degradation and synthesis biomarkers (C2C/CP2) is less pronounced in the verum group as indicated by the Delta between the values prior physical strain (pre) and of the values directly after (Oh) and three hours after (3h) physical strain. Further, after three months intake of study medication (visit 4) the verum group shows a less pronounced decline of the C2C/CP2 ratio zero (Oh) and three hours after (3h) physical strain compared to the beginning (visit 1) , which is not the case in the placebo group. </p><p id="p0098" num="0098"> Taken together these results clearly demonstrates that treatment with the composition containing at least two branched chain amino acids results in a reduction of strain on joint structures induced by physical load and an </p><p id="p0099" num="0099">improvement of the joint stability.
