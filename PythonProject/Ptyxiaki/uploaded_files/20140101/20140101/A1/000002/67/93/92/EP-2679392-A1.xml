Here, the term "resolution" means the number of dots included in a one-inch length. Therefore, the higher the resolution, the higher the density of dots is, so that a finer image expression becomes possible. On the other hand, the lower the resolution, the lower the density of dots is, which results in coarse image expression.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Now, in the inkjet recording system, when recording is performed at a constant timing (frequency), recording at high resolution makes a distance between particles (dots) of ink narrow, so that it is necessary to prevent dots from mixing with each other, thereby making a travelling speed of a material to be recorded low.<br/>
On the other hand, when an image is recorded at low resolution, a distance between dots becomes wide, so that the travelling speed of the material to be recorded can be made fast.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> In recent years, in the inkjet recording system, a recorded material having high resolution is demanded. Therefore, an inkjet recording apparatus recordable at high resolution is focused on.<br/>
In the inkjet recording apparatus with a high resolution, however, even image data which can be recorded at low resolution is recorded at high resolution, so that a travelling speed of a material to be recorded becomes slow. As a result, there is such a drawback that productivity lowers.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">On the other hand, an inkjet recording apparatus which has realized a printing mode where printing is performed at a high speed and at low resolution and a printing mode where printing is performed at a low speed and at high resolution is known (for example, see Patent Literature 1). According to such an inkjet recording apparatus, it is possible to select the low resolution or the high resolution for each image data to perform inkjet recording.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">PTL 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2007185877A"><text>2007-185877</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, in the inkjet recording apparatus described in PTL 1, even in such a case that an image portion which can be accommodated at a low resolution and an image portion which requires a high resolution coexists in one image data piece, these portions can be recorded only at a unified (the same) resolution. That is, it is impossible to perform recording at different resolutions during inkjet recording.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> -->When the inkjet recording apparatus described in PTL 1 is used, recording of image data at a low resolution results in a blurred image or an image lack in sharpness, while recording at a high resolution results in reduction in productivity.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In view of these circumstances, the present invention has been made, and an object thereof is to provide a recording method using an inkjet recording apparatus, which can obtain a recorded material excellent in image quality and is excellent in productivity.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problems</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present inventors have made a keen study in order to solve the above problem, and have considered recording to a plurality of design regions in image data at resolutions suitable for them individually. The present inventors have found that the above problem can be solved by changing a travelling speed of a material to be recorded so as to correspond to respective resolutions during continuous recording and have completed the present invention.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A first aspect of the present invention lies in that (1) a recording method using an inkjet recording apparatus which performs recording on a travelling material to be recorded by a line head, comprising: a first step of setting resolutions to respective design regions of image data having a plurality of different design regions; a second step of setting a travelling speed of a material to be recorded so as to correspond to each of the resolutions, and a third step of setting acceleration/deceleration of the material to be recorded in order to connect different traveling speeds, wherein the travelling speed of the material to be recorded is changed during continuous recording by the line head.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A second aspect of the present invention lies in (2) the recording method using an inkjet recording apparatus (1) wherein the travelling speed of the material to be recorded is changed in a multiple-stage fashion, and when the resolution is high, the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> travelling speed of the material to be recorded is set slow, and when the resolution is low, the travelling speed of the material to be recorded is set fast.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A third aspect of the present invention lies in that (3) the recording method using an inkjet recording device (2) wherein at a deceleration time of the material to be recorded, recording is performed at a resolution of the material to be recorded set just before decelerated, and at an acceleration time of the material to be recorded, recording is performed at a resolution of the material to be recorded just after accelerated.</p><heading id="h0008">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the recording method using an inkjet recording apparatus according to the first aspect of the present invention, resolutions corresponding to respective design regions are set. Thereby, a recorded material excellent in image quality can be obtained, and formation of an image which is blurred or lack in sharpness can be inhibited.<br/>
Further, since the travelling speed of the material to be recorded can be continuously changed so as to correspond to a set resolution during continuous recording, inkjet recording can be performed efficiently. For example, productively can be improved by recording a portion of an image in image data which can be recorded at a low resolution at a fast travelling speed of the material to be recorded.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the recording method using an inkjet recording apparatus according to the second aspect of the present invention, when the travelling speed of the material to be recorded can be changed in a multiple-stage fashion, a more suitable resolution can be applied to a design region and recording can be performed at the resolution.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the recording method using an inkjet recording apparatus according to the third aspect of the present invention, in the case that at a deceleration time of the material to be recorded, recording is performed at a resolution of the material to be recorded set just before decelerated, and at an acceleration time of the material to be recorded,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> recording is performed at a resolution of the material to be recorded just after accelerated, continuous recording is made possible and a recorded material excellent in image quality can be obtained even at the acceleration time and the deceleration time so that blurring or lack in sharpness can be prevented from occurring.</p><heading id="h0009">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a schematic diagram showing an inkjet recording apparatus where a recording method using an inkjet recording apparatus according to an embodiment is used;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is a flowchart showing the recording method using an inkjet recording apparatus according to the embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> is a block diagram showing a control method for performing the recording method using an inkjet recording apparatus according to the embodiment; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> is a graph showing a relationship between a travelling speed of a material to be recorded and a resolution when inkjet recording was performed in this example.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010">Description of Embodiments</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">A suitable embodiment of the present invention will be described below in detail referring to the drawings if necessary.

<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a schematic diagram showing an inkjet recording apparatus where a recording method using an inkjet recording apparatus according to an embodiment is used.<br/>
As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, an inkjet recording apparatus 10 is provided with a guide roller 2 for guiding a travelling material to be recorded 1, a plurality of line heads 4 for performing recording on the material to be recorded 1, and a drying machine 3 for drying the material to be recorded 1 on which recording has been performed by the line heads 4.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the inkjet recording apparatus 10, as the material to be recorded 1, for example, a paper, a film, a cloth, or the like can be used properly, though limited thereto.<br/>
Further, since the inkjet recording apparatus 10 is generally provided with four line heads 4, recording using four colors can be performed. For example, by using Y (yellow), M (magenta), C (cyan), K (black), recording with full color can be made possible.<br/>
Further, the drying machine 3 has a cylindrical dryer, where the material to be recorded 1 is dried by bringing the material to be recorded 1 which has been applied with inkjet recording in close contact with a surface of the dryer.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Next, a recording method using the inkjet recording apparatus 10 will be described.<br/>
<figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is a flowchart showing a recording method using an inkjet recording apparatus according to the embodiment.<br/>
As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, the recording method using the inkjet recording apparatus 10 according to this embodiment comprises: a first step S1 of setting resolutions corresponding to respective design regions of image data having a plurality of different design regions; a second step S2 of setting a travelling speed of a material to be recorded 1 so as to correspond to each of the resolutions; and a third step S3 of setting acceleration/deceleration of the material to be recorded so as to connect different travelling speeds.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> Since the recording method using the inkjet recording apparatus 10 is provided with the first step S1, the second step S2, and the third step S3, it is possible to change the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 during continuous recording performed by the line heads 4.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Here, the resolution generally changes according to the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 and the timings of ink discharges performed by the line heads 4. For example, the resolution is made high by making the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 slow, while the resolution is made low by making the travelling speed fast. Further, the resolution is made high by making the timings of ink discharges performed by the line heads 4 early and the resolution is made low by making the timings late.<br/>
In the recording method using the inkjet recording apparatus 10, the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 and the timings of ink discharges performed by the line heads 4 are adjusted so as to correspond to a set resolution.<br/>
Further, the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 can be changed by controlling the rotating speed of the guide roller 2 for guiding the material to be recorded 1. Incidentally, these controls will be described later.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The respective steps will be described below in detail.</p><heading id="h0011">(First Step)</heading><p id="p0024" num="0024">The first step S1 is a step of setting resolutions to respective design region of image data. In this specification, the image data means one data piece composed of a plurality of different design regions.<br/>
Further, the design region is a unit (page) of a character, a pattern, a color, or the like, and it means a portion having the same resolution. Incidentally, since the design region means a continuous portion having the same resolution, a design itself may change. Further, the resolution is determined at a producing time of image data.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> -->As the image data, data which is generally used in inkjet recording can be used.

Resolutions achieving proper image qualities are set to respective design regions. For example, since a monochromatic character, a solid pattern, or the like does not require a high-level image expression (image quality or quality), setting to the low solution is performed, and since precise image expression requires a high-level image expression (image quality or quality), setting to the high resolution is performed, and in the case of an intermediate between both the cases, setting to the intermediate solution is performed.</p><heading id="h0012">(Second step)</heading><p id="p0027" num="0027">The second step S2 is a step of setting a travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 so as to correspond to each of the resolutions set at the first step S1.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">At the second step S2, the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 is set to multiple stages. In this case, since the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 can be changed to multiple stages, inkjet recording can be performed more efficiently and productivity can be improved.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> In the recording method using the inkjet recording apparatus 10 according to the embodiment, for example, the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 can be set to three stages of a high speed, a middle speed, and a low speed.<br/>
The travelling speeds of the material to be recorded 1 are allocated to the design regions of the resolutions set at the first step S1.<br/>
At this time, when the resolution is high, the travelling speed of the material to be recorded may be set to the slow speed, and when the resolution is low, the travelling speed of the material to be recorded may be set to the fast speed. Specifically, when the resolution is the low resolution, the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 is set to the fast speed, when the resolution is the middle resolution, the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 is set to the middle speed, and when resolution is the high resolution, the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 is set to the low speed.</p><heading id="h0013">(Third Step)</heading><p id="p0030" num="0030">The third step S3 is a step of setting acceleration/deceleration of the material to be recorded 1 for connecting different travelling speeds. That is, the third step S3 is a step of setting a timing of acceleration/deceleration of the material to be recorded 1 in the course of accelerating or decelerating the material to be recorded 1 from the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 before changed to achieve the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 after changed.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">At the third step S3, recording is performed at the resolution of the material to be recorded just before deceleration at the deceleration time of the material to be recorded 1. That is, the material to be recorded is decelerated at the design region set at the low resolution in the state where the travelling speed of the material to be recorded set just before decelerated is fast. Thereby, even at the deceleration time, recording can be performed at the same resolution as that of the design region set.<br/>
Therefore, in this case, recording where the travelling speed of the material to be recorded has been set to the high speed and recording where the travelling speed of the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> material to be recorded has been decelerated are continuously performed at the design region set to the low resolution.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">On the other hand, at the acceleration time of the material to be recorded 1, recording is performed at the resolution just after accelerated. That is, the material to be recorded is accelerated at the design region set to the low resolution in the state where the travelling speed of the material to be recorded just before accelerated is fast. Thereby, even at the acceleration time, recording can be performed at the same resolution as that of the design region set.<br/>
Therefore, in this case, recording where the travelling speed of the material to be recorded has been accelerated and recording where the travelling speed of the material to be recorded has been set to the high speed are continuously performed at the design region set to the low resolution.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">From these matters, it is understood that the acceleration/deceleration of the material to be recorded 1 is performed at the design region set to a lower resolution of the resolutions in the recordings before and after the acceleration/deceleration. Incidentally, the resolution is the resolution which has been set at the first step S 1.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">At the deceleration of the material to be recorded 1, the timing of the deceleration start of the material to be recorded 1 can be set arbitrarily in conformity with the ability of the inkjet recording apparatus 1 for accelerating/decelerating the material to be recorded, and the timing of the deceleration termination of the material to be recorded 1 is caused to conform to the timing at which recording of the design region at the high resolution starts.<br/>
For example, when transition is performed from the state where the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 is set to the high speed and recording is being performed at the low resolution to the state where the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 is changed to the low speed and recording is performed at the high<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> resolution, the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 is decelerated at an arbitrary timing from the state where recording is being performed at the low resolution.<br/>
At this time, if the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 is simply decelerated, the resolution gradually becomes high. Therefore, the low resolution is maintained by decelerating the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 and delaying the ink-discharge timings of the head lines 4.<br/>
Then, recording at the high resolution is performed by changing the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 to a targeted low speed at the timing at which recording of the design region at the high resolution starts and adjusting the timings of ink discharges performed by the line heads 4.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">On the other hand, at the acceleration time of the material to be recorded 1, the timing of the acceleration start of the material to be recorded 1 is caused to conform to the timing at which recording of the design region at the high resolution is terminated, and the timing of the acceleration termination of the material to be recorded 1 can be set arbitrarily to conform to the ability of the inkjet recording apparatus 10 for accelerating/decelerating the material to be recorded.<br/>
For example, when transition is performed from the state where the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 is set to the low speed and recording is being performed at the high resolution to the state where the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 is changed to the high speed and recording is performed at the low resolution, recording is performed at the low resolution by adjusting the timing at which the line heads 4 discharge inks at the timing at which recording of the design region at the high resolution is terminated and the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 is accelerated.<br/>
At this time, if the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 is simply accelerated, the resolution gradually becomes low. Therefore, the low resolution is maintained by accelerating the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 and making the timing at which the line heads 4 discharge inks early.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> -->Then, recording at the lower resolution is performed by changing the travelling speed of the material to be recorded 1 to a targeted high speed and adjusting the timing at which the line head 4 discharges ink.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Thus, in the recording method using the inkjet recording apparatus 10 according to this embodiment, the timings at which the line heads 4 discharge inks can be adjusted to conform to a targeted resolution such that the resolution is maintained even at the acceleration/deceleration time of the material to be recorded 1.<br/>
Thereby, even at the acceleration/deceleration time of the material to be recorded, a recorded material excellent in image quality can be obtained and blurring or lack of sharpness can be inhibited.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">At the third step S3, acceleration and deceleration at the acceleration and deceleration times of the material to be recorded 1 are determined by the timings of acceleration and deceleration of the material to be recorded 1 set arbitrarily. That is, the longer the times at the acceleration and deceleration times, the smaller the acceleration and the deceleration are, and the shorter the times at the acceleration and deceleration times, the larger acceleration and the deceleration are. At this time, the acceleration at the acceleration/deceleration time of the material to be recorded 1 is preferably in a range of 0.1 to 0.5m/s<sup>2</sup> in view of stability of the tension acting on the material to be recorded 1, while the deceleration at the acceleration/deceleration time of the material to be recorded 1 is preferably in a range of -0.5 to -0.1m/s<sup>2</sup> in view of stability of the tension acting on the material to be recorded 1.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In the recording method using the inkjet recording apparatus 10 according to this embodiment, by applying the above-described first step S1, second step S2, and third step S3 to predetermined image data, a recoded material excellent in image quality can be obtained and excellent productivity can be achieved.<br/>
In other words, since the material to be recorded 1 can be caused to travel at the high speed regarding a design region recordable at the low resolution and the material to<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> be recorded 1 can be caused to travel at the low speed regarding a design region recordable at the high resolution, inkjet recording can be performed efficiently, so that productivity is improved.<br/>
Further, since recording can be performed at a resolution suitable for each design region, a recorded material excellent in image quality can be obtained and occurrence of an image which is blurred or lack in sharpness can be inhibited.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Next, a control method for carrying out the recording method using the inkjet recording apparatus 10 according to this embodiment will be described.<br/>
