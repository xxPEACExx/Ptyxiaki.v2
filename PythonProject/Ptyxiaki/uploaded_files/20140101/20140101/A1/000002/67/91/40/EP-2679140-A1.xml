In this type of a medical endoscope system, arbitrary devices in the system can be manipulated through a controller by manipulating a manipulation panel connected to the controller.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Usually, a manipulation panel connected to a controller is disposed in a non-sterilization area within a surgery room, and accordingly it is not appropriate in view of sanitation for a surgeon (a physician for example) to manipulate the manipulation panel directly. Accordingly, it has been common in a conventional medical endoscope system for an assistant (a nurse for example), who assists a surgeon, to manipulate a manipulation panel in accordance with instructions from the surgeon so as to manipulate devices.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, a problem has been pointed out wherein it is difficult to manipulate devices at timings that a surgeon desires without delays when the manipulation of devices is performed through an assistant.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As techniques related to the above problem, there are gesture techniques. Gesture techniques are disclosed by, for example, Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2, and have also been applied to medical endoscope systems in recent years.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Applying a gesture technique to a medical endoscope system enables surgeons to manipulate devices directly, not<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> through assistants, thereby making it possible to manipulate devices at desired timings.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004289850A"><text>2004-289850</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: International Publication Pamphlet No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP3025859A"><text>03/025859</text></patcit>,</li></ul></p><heading id="h0003">Disclosure of the Invention</heading><heading id="h0004">Problem to be solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">Although applying a gesture technique to a medical endoscope system may be very profitable as described above, problems specific to a gesture technique have been pointed out. Specifically, a camera installed in a medical endoscope system is used for recognizing gestures, and when there are a plurality of surgeons in the viewing field of the camera, the controller sometimes responds to actions of a surgeon that are not intended to manipulate devices.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Usually, during a surgery, only a particular surgeon who leads the surgery wants to perform manipulation of devices such as changing of setting values of the devices. When it is taken into consideration that other surgeons do not perform manipulation of devices against the will of that particular surgeon, a medical endoscope system needs to prohibit manipulation of devices by persons other than that particular surgeon so as to reliably block the control of devices based on the above misrecognition.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">However, according to the technique of Patent Document 1 or 2, it is difficult to sufficiently block the control of devices based on misrecognition.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Patent Document 1 describes a technique about a controlling method that enables smooth manipulation or the like by determining relationship between devices and people and by using movement/posture/state of people. More specifically, a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> technique has been disclosed in which one person is selected from among a plurality of people on the basis of a prescribed priority order of position/posture/person, and postures and motions of that person control devices.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Patent Document 2 discloses a technique in which gestures are recognized while individuals are identified and thereby interfaces corresponding to individuals are provided regardless of positions in a room. More specifically, it is a technique in which individuals are identified from the target's head and height and manipulation commands are transmitted to a manipulation target that is registered beforehand by a hand sign in a room.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Neither of the techniques disclosed by Patent Documents 1 and 2 is a technique that allows only one prescribed particular person to manipulate devices while clearly prohibiting other people from doing so. Accordingly, it is difficult to block control of devices based on misrecognition at a sufficiently high level required for medical endoscope systems.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In view of the above situation, it is an object of the present invention to provide a medical endoscope system that allows only one particular surgeon to manipulate devices with gestures, prohibiting other people from manipulating devices with gestures.</p><heading id="h0005">Means for solving the problems</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">A medical endoscope system according to a first aspect of the present invention is a medical endoscope system in which the system includes: an image pickup device, a plurality of control target devices, and a controller that controls the plurality of control target devices, and the controller includes: a manipulator setting unit configured to set one manipulator candidate as a manipulator who is permitted to perform manipulation from among a plurality of manipulator candidates registered beforehand, and to set other manipulator candidates other than the one manipulator candidate as<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> manipulation prohibited persons who are prohibited from performing manipulation, an object detection unit configured to detect an object that meets a prescribed condition from an image output from the image pickup device, a manipulator recognition unit configured to determine an object that corresponds to a manipulator set by the manipulator setting unit from among objects detected by the object detection unit, and to recognize the determined object as the manipulator, an action detection unit configured to detect a prescribed action of the determined object, a control signal generation unit configured to generate a control signal that controls at least one control target device among the plurality of control target devices in accordance with a result of detection by the action detection unit, and a device control unit configured to control the at least one control target device in accordance with the control signal.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A second aspect of the present invention is the medical endoscope system according to the first aspect, in which the controller includes a manipulator addition unit configured to change, to a manipulator, a manipulation prohibited person set by the manipulator setting unit.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">A third aspect of the present invention is the medical endoscope system according to the second aspect, further including a display unit configured to display information about the medical endoscope system;

Thereby, only changing of the setting causes the same effect as caused by a configuration of switching between the medical endoscope system 3 and the medical endoscope system 3a.</p><heading id="h0011">Explanations of Symbols</heading><p id="p0080" num="0080"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>2</dt><dd>surgery room</dd><dt>3, 3a</dt><dd>medical endoscope system</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>patient monitor system<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --></dd><dt>9</dt><dd>cable</dd><dt>10</dt><dd>patient bed</dd><dt>11, 12</dt><dd>cart</dd><dt>13</dt><dd>electrocautery scalpel device</dd><dt>14</dt><dd>pneumoperitoneum apparatus</dd><dt>15, 23</dt><dd>endoscopic camera device</dd><dt>16, 24</dt><dd>light source device</dd><dt>17</dt><dd>video tape recorder</dd><dt>18</dt><dd>gas tank</dd><dt>19, 26</dt><dd>display device</dd><dt>20, 27</dt><dd>concentrated display panel</dd><dt>21</dt><dd>manipulation panel</dd><dt>22, 22a</dt><dd>system controller</dd><dt>25</dt><dd>image processing device</dd><dt>28</dt><dd>relay unit</dd><dt>29</dt><dd>relay cable</dd><dt>30</dt><dd>remote controller</dd><dt>31, 32</dt><dd>endoscope</dd><dt>31a, 32a</dt><dd>camera cable</dd><dt>31b, 32b</dt><dd>light guide cable</dd><dt>33</dt><dd>microphone</dd><dt>35</dt><dd>RFID terminal</dd><dt>36</dt><dd>gesture camera</dd><dt>48</dt><dd>patient</dd><dt>51</dt><dd>object detection unit</dd><dt>52</dt><dd>manipulator recognition unit</dd><dt>53</dt><dd>action detection unit</dd><dt>54</dt><dd>control signal generation unit</dd><dt>55</dt><dd>device control unit</dd><dt>56</dt><dd>object setting unit</dd><dt>57</dt><dd>manipulator setting unit</dd><dt>58</dt><dd>manipulator addition unit</dd><dt>59</dt><dd>action setting unit</dd><dt>60</dt><dd>touch panel detection unit</dd><dt>61</dt><dd>audio detection unit<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --></dd><dt>62</dt><dd>storage unit</dd><dt>63</dt><dd>manipulator setting information</dd><dt>64</dt><dd>face data</dd><dt>65</dt><dd>model information</dd><dt>66</dt><dd>gesture information</dd><dt>100</dt><dd>log-on window</dd><dt>101</dt><dd>setting button</dd><dt>102</dt><dd>procedure selection button group</dd><dt>200</dt><dd>system controller setting window</dd><dt>201, 301, 401</dt><dd>log-off button</dd><dt>300, 400</dt><dd>peripheral device manipulation window</dd><dt>402</dt><dd>manipulator setting button</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977607" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A medical endoscope system comprising:
