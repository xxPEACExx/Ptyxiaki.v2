The management device 3 is connected to the cable 2, such that the electric signal ES is<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> propagated in the cable 2. Preferably, the perimeter cable 2 is an electric cable.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The electric signal ES can have the shape of a sine wave, a square wave, etc. Advantageously, the lawn mower 1 further comprises a control unit 60, which has the task of managing at least partially operation of the lawn mower.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In particular, the control unit 60 comprises sensor means 40 for detecting the electric signal ES that is propagated in the cable 2.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In one embodiment, the sensor means 40 can comprise a detecting element 41 (<figref idrefs="f0004">fig.4</figref>), preferably consisting of an inductive element, such as, for example a reel.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Preferably, the sensor means 40 further comprises a current reader 42 and, possibly, a current amplifier 43 designed to permit improved reading of the detected signal.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Preferably, the detecting element 41 is fitted to the frame 10 in a front position thereof. In particular, the detecting element can be advantageously positioned in front of an axis X, which ideally, or also mechanically, joins the front wheels of the lawn mower 1 (<figref idrefs="f0004">figure 4</figref>).</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">By virtue of the measurements made by the sensor means 40, the control unit 60 manages the movement of the lawn mower 1.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In particular, it manages an approach to the recharging base 80 by following the perimeter wire 2 until it arrives at a first portion Q of the electric cable 2, in which the first portion Q has a first conformation C1.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In order to carry out the approach, the control unit 60 further comprises a memory 61 for storing a maximum value Vmax and a minimum value Vmin for a detecting intensity of said electric signal ES.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Such maximum and minimum values Vmax, Vmin are relative to the intensity with which the sensor means 40 detects the electric signal ES.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In practice, the maximum and minimum values Vmax, Vmin can be expressed in volt. Said maximum and minimum values Vmax, Vmin are respectively representative of a minimum distance Dmin and a maximum distance Dmax of the lawn mower 1 from the perimeter cable 2.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In fact, the closer the lawn mower 1 is to the cable 2 (lesser distance), the greater will be the intensity with which the electric signal ES is detected and, vice versa, the further the lawn mower 1 is from the cable 2 (greater distance) the less will be the intensity with which the electric signal ES is detected.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The maximum and minimum values Vmax, Vmin can be advantageously detected by the lawn mower 1, by the sensor means 40, during operation of the lawn mower 1. Alternatively, these values can be set.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The control unit 60 further comprises a calculation module 62 associated with the aforesaid memory 61.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The calculation module 62 is configured for determining a target value Tv for detecting the intensity of the electric signal ES. The target value Tv is not nil and is comprised between the maximum value Vmax and the minimum value Vmin. The target value Tv is representative of a target distance Td of the lawn mower 1 with respect to the perimeter cable 2.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In practice, the calculation module 62 determines the target value Tv in such a manner as to determine correspondingly the target distance Td at which the lawn mower 1 will have to position itself in relation to the cable 2.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Conveniently, the target value Tv is substantially different from a preceding target value determined by the detecting intensity of the same electric signal ES. In practice, as will be clearer below, the target value Tv is used for defining the method with which the lawn mower 1 approaches the recharging base 80 until it detects the first portion Q of electric cable 2 having the first conformation C1. In order to perform this approach following substantially the course of the cable 2, but without passing always on the same zones or traces, the target value Tv is determined in such a manner that it takes on a different value for each work cycle, i.e. for each time in which the lawn mower 1 has to approach the recharging base 80.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In one embodiment, the target value Tv is determined in a random manner, by an algorithm that is able to generate random numbers comprised within the interval that have as limits the aforesaid maximum value Vmax and minimum value Vmin. Preferably, the limits Vmax and/or Vmin can be excluded from the range of acceptable values.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">More in general, within the interval that has Vmax, Vmin as limits a sub-interval can be selected within which the target value Tv is calculated.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In a different embodiment, the target value Tv is determined according to a set sequence of values, for example cyclically.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The control unit 60 further comprises an operating module 63 configured for controlling the movement means 20 to move the lawn mower 1 such that the sensor means 40 detects the electric signal ES at an intensity that is substantially equal to the target value Tv.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In other words, by combining the information coming from the sensor means 40 and from the calculation module 62, the operating module 63 sends appropriate control signals to the movement means 20, such that, during the movement of the lawn mower 1, the intensity with which the sensor means 40 detects the electric signal ES is substantially equal to the target value Tv.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In this manner, the lawn mower 1, whilst it approaches the recharging base 80, is maintained at a distance from the perimeter cable 2 that is substantially equal to the aforesaid target distance Td.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Going into greater detail, the operating module 63 preferably comprises a comparing module 63a configured for comparing the target value Tv with the intensity with which the electric signal ES is detected by the sensor means 40. In this manner it is possible to check whether the lawn mower 1 is moving at a correct distance (i.e. distance that is substantially equal to the target distance Td).</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Preferably, the operating module 63 further comprises a control module 63b associated with the comparing module 63a and configured for controlling in a suitable manner the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> movement means 20 as a function of the comparison made by the comparing module 63a.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">In particular:
