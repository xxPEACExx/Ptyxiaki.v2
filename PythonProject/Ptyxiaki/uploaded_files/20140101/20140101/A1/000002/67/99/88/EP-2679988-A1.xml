At present, operators are required to periodically remove sacrificial inserts of fiber rope and replace them with new rope. Analysis of removed sections determines the localized condition of the rope but does not provide an accurate<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> picture of the overall condition of the mooring line. The present embodiments were designed to provide an accurate, "real time" picture of the mooring line, while the mooring line is in operation, without the need for a human or remotely operated vehicle (ROV), to actually inspect the line.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Conventionally, there are no existing systems or methods, other than visual inspection, to continuously monitor the condition of a tubular, such as a fiber or wire rope mooring line, during use.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The present system can enable in service cleaning, inspection, and measuring of a wide variety of tubulars, including wire ropes, cables, fiber optic lengths, casings, risers, control umbilicals, and similar tubulars, while the measured tubulars are in use, without interrupting use of the tubulars.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Additionally, conventional visual inspection is limited in its accuracy, providing only a subjective determination of the condition of a small area of a tubular. Operators are required to remove pieces of rope or other tubulars and replace them with new material, and the removed pieces are then analyzed to determine the localized condition of the tubular.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The present system can be useable to assess the overall condition of tubulars, while the tubulars are in use, which can be done by moving a closable housing, which can further have a digital cameras along a tubular and can identify changes in cross-sectional geometry of the tubular. The system can simultaneously clean the surface of the tubular and record geometrical dimensions for later comparisons with manufacturer specifications.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Additionally, the present system can save human lives, because humans are no longer needed to visually inspect ropes or moorings in deep water.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Conventional methods enable only periodic assessment of a rope or tubular through analysis of removed portions. The present system is capable of continuous monitoring and inspection of tubulars, enabling one or multiple tubulars to be monitored remotely. Multiple tubulars can be monitored simultaneously, enabling the present<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> system to inspect any number of facilities at one time.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">There has existed a need for a device that can be deployed by a remote operating vehicle "ROV" to identify changes in the cross sectional geometry of a rope or other type of tubular. Changes in these measurements can indicate potential deterioration of the rope, which can indicate a failure in a mooring system, which can further cause a moored subsea structure to drift.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The present system can include a closable housing, which can be moved along a section of in-situ fiber or wire rope, cleaning the surface and recording geometrical dimensions for comparison with manufacturer's specifications. The closable housing can be a frame, such as a RMS frame.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The closable housing can have a first housing portion hinged to a second housing portion, and can be maintained in an open position during deployment to the rope, cable or other tubular.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The hinges can be contemplated to be operable by one or more hydraulic actuators, such as Helac L10 Series actuators.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">At least one hydraulic actuator and up to about four hydraulic actuators can be used to operate the hinges. A preventer can be provided to prevent pinching when putting the tool on the rope</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The closable housing can be in an open position, wherein the rope can be a tubular such as a casing. The rope or tubular can have a tubular perimeter. The closable housing can have a first housing portion and a second housing portion, which can be connected together in a hinged arrangement using hydraulic actuators.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">A remote operated vehicle "ROV" can deploy the closable housing to the fiber, wire rope, fiber optic length, casing, pipe, control umbilical, riser, or other tubular.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The closable housing can have a length ranging from about 1 foot to about 12 feet and a width ranging from about 1 foot to about 4 feet. The closable housing can be contemplated to have a central opening for accommodating a tubular having an outer<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> diameter ranging from about ¼ of a foot to about 12 feet.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Each portion of the closable housing can be made from aluminum, stainless steel, carbon steel, an acetal copolymer, such as Delrin™, or other similar durable materials. The first and second housing portions can be contemplated to have substantially similar dimensions, however in an embodiment, one housing portion can have a larger or a smaller dimension than the other housing portion.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The closable housing can have a coating, such as paint or powder for resisting corrosion, physical wear, and/or damage caused by exposure to inclement weather and marine environments.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The hinges can include any type of hinge, such as barrel hinges, operable by one or more hydraulic actuators. At one hinge to up to about four hinges can be used to connect the first housing portion to the second housing portion. The hinges can be made from the same material as the housing, or from different materials.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In an embodiment, the present system can include a hinge coupling having a channel for receiving a removable hinge rod, such as a pin, for locking the hinges in a closed position.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">At least one high pressure water jet unit, such as Karcher™ Water Jet Unit, having one or more nozzles, can be disposed on a cleaning end of the closable housing. The nozzles can be positioned to impact the tubular perimeter for cleaning the tubular. The present system can include from at least one to up to about four high pressure water jet units.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">A marine growth plough can be also disposed on the cleaning end, for engaging the tubular perimeter. The marine growth plough can be made from an acetal copolymer or another similar material and can range from about 20 centimeters to about 40 centimeters in length and about 20 centimeters to about 40 centimeters in width. The marine growth plough can be contemplated to work in conjunction with the high pressure water jet units and one or more brushes to remove marine growth from a tubular.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In an embodiment, the present system can include a plurality of integrated brushes, which can be a heavy duty bristle brush with a concave shape, for cleaning the tubular after applying high pressure water from the high pressure integrated jet units, prior to inspecting the tubular with the digital cameras.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The marine growth plough, one or more of the high pressure water jet units, one or more brushes, or combinations thereof can be contemplated to be removable for providing customized types of cleaning to a tubular.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">At least one hydraulic actuator can cause the first and second portions of the housing to close around the rope, cable or other tubular, and clasp shut. The rope can be centralized in the closable housing using at least 4 roller assemblies and up to 8 roller assemblies. As the frame is towed along the rope by the ROV using a tether, or pulled from the surface with a vessel, the closable housing removes marine growth using a marine growth plough, high pressure water jet units and an annulus of brushes. It can further be contemplated that in an embodiments, no brushes are used.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">At least one enclosable camera block containing one or more digital cameras, such as marinized digital cameras, can be disposed on an inspection end of the closable housing. The inspection end can be contemplated to be located opposite the cleaning end of the closeable housing.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The enclosable camera blocks can range in size from about 50 millimeters to about 150 millimeters in length, about 50 millimeters to about 150 millimeters in width, and about 50 millimeters to about 200 millimeters in thickness. The enclosable camera blocks can be made from an acetal copolymer or another similar material. The present system can include from one enclosable camera block to four enclosable camera blocks. Each enclosable camera block can contain from one digital camera to four digital cameras.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In an embodiment, the present system can include a removeable camera arm, which can be disposed between the closable housing and the enclosable camera block. The camera arm can be useable for extending the digital cameras away from the tubular, such as when cleaning and inspecting a large diameter tubular that requires more<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> distance between the cameras and the tubular for inspection of the tubular.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The removable camera arm can be made from an acetal copolymer, aluminum, or another similar durable material. The removable camera arm can have a length ranging from about 20 centimeters to about 400 centimeters and a diameter ranging from about 25 centimeters to about 100 centimeters.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In an embodiment, two digital cameras can be positioned at about a 90 degree angle in relation to each other, and at about a 90 degree angle in relation to the longitudinal axis of the tubular. It can be contemplated that as the closable housing is moved along the tubular, the two cameras can record two cross-sectional measurements at about a 90 degree angle to one another.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">It can be contemplated that at least four enclosable camera blocks can be used, each positioned at about a 90 degree angle in relation to one another around the tubular, and positioned at about a 90 degree angle in relation to the longitudinal axis of the tubular.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The enclosable camera blocks can use video cameras to record simultaneous cross-sectional measurements at about a 90 degree angle to each other. The video cameras can transmit a signal via a ROV to a top side computer suite, which can include a processor, which can have computer instructions for instructing the processor to process the signals from the cameras at about 50 frames per second, in real time, while simultaneously applying a mathematical model for continuous measurement of the tubular, creating a geometric tubular profile.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Computer instructions can instruct the processor to compare the geometric tubular profile to a database of manufacturer's geometric tubular profiles in data storage associated with the processor, enabling real time determination of deviations in the tubular.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The present system can further include one or more indicators, such as alarms, flashing lights, other audio or visual signals, a report, or combinations thereof, for indicating when a deviation occurs between the created geometric profile for the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> tubular and the manufacturer's geometric tubular profiles from the database. The alarm can be triggered when a deviation exceeds a preset limit.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">An imaging target plate can be disposed opposite the enclosable camera blocks for enabling continuous digital imaging of the tubular as the closable housing can engage and roll along the tubular. The imaging target plate can be contemplated to be about 60 centimeters by about 6.35 centimeters by about 28 centimeters with two longitudinal 45 degree bends.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In an embodiment, an integrated light emitting diode "LED" can be in each enclosable camera block, which can illuminate the tubular adjacent each camera against the imaging target plate.
