Therefore, a steam temperature and a metal temperature on a rear heat transfer surface of the boiler rise, and a possibility of occurrence of tube leak increases in design that a heat transfer surface material, arrangement of the heat transfer surface, and others are unchanged from the conventional examples. Therefore, a design temperature of the rear heat transfer surface must be increased to be higher than those in the conventional examples, and there is a problem that quality of the material must be enhanced in terms of strength and heat resistant properties.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">To increase a detention time of the combustion gas to reach the NOx reduction region in the furnace of the after-air port from the burner or to equalize a design temperature of the rear heat transfer surface to a conventional examples while adopting an NOx reduction countermeasure for reducing the air excess ratio (the input air capacity /the theoretical air capacity)<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> to be lower than those in the conventional examples, changing a direction of flames of the burner to an upward or downward direction of the furnace in accordance with combustion conditions such as a load can be considered.

A first aspect of the present invention provides a combustion device comprising a plurality of burners 19 arranged on a furnace wall 10 of a furnace 18, each burner 19 comprising: a cylindrical fuel nozzle 3 that injects a mixture of a fuel and a carrier gas therefor into the furnace 18; one or more cylindrical combustion gas nozzles 8, 11 that are provided on the outer circumference of the fuel nozzle 3 and inject a combustion gas into the furnace 18; and a wind box 12 that supplies the combustion gas to the combustion gas nozzles 8, 11, wherein the wind box 12 has a combustion gas inflow opening portion 12a, 12b into which the combustion gas flows from one<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> direction vertical to the axial direction of the burner 19 and is partitioned to form a plurality of parallel flow paths through which the combustion gas flows in from the combustion gas inflow opening portion 12a, 12b, some of the plurality of flow paths are connected to an upper side of the combustion gas nozzles 8, 11, the other flow paths are connected to a lower side of the combustion gas nozzles 8, 11, and first flow rate adjusting means 15 for adjusting a flow rate of the combustion gas is independently provided to each of the plurality of flow paths.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A second aspect of the present invention provides the combustion device according to the first aspect, wherein one duct 16 through which the combustion gas is supplied to the plurality of wind boxes 12 from the outside of the furnace 18 is installed on the outer side of the furnace wall 10 on which the wind boxes 12 are installed.<br/>
A third aspect of the present invention provides the combustion device according to the first or second aspect, wherein the plurality of wind boxes 12 are aligned and installed inside or outside of the one duct 16.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A fourth aspect of the present invention provides the combustion device according to any one of the first to third aspects, wherein second flow rate adjusting means 17 for adjusting a flow rate of the combustion gas that flows into each burner 19 on the upstream side of the first flow rate adjusting<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> means 15 is provided in each wind box 12.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the combustion device according to the present invention, since the first flow rate adjusting means 15 for adjusting a combustion gas flow rate is provided to each of the plurality of combustion gas nozzles 8 and 11, when an opening degree of the first flow rate adjusting means 15 is adjusted, a momentum of the combustion gas injected into the furnace from the burner 19 can be independently adjusted on each of upper and lower sides. For example, when the first flow rate adjusting means 15 is adjusted to increase an air flow rate injected into the furnace 18 from the combustion gas nozzle 8 or 11 so that a momentum (an air injection flow rate) of the air flow rate from the lower side can be higher than that from the upper side of the burner 19, flames can be deflected to a downward direction. When the flames are deflected to the downward direction, the maximum thermal load region in the furnace 18 shifts to the lower side, thermal absorption of the furnace 18 increases, and an exhaust gas temperature at an outlet of the furnace can be reduced. Further, when the flames are deflected to the lower side of the burner 19 to shift the combustion region of the burner 19 to the lower side, a detention time of the NOx reduction region in the furnace 18 between the burner 19 and the after-air port 24 provided on the furnace wall 10 on the downstream side of the burner 19 becomes longer than that in a case where an injecting direction of flames is parallel, and the NOx concentration in the exhaust gas is reduced to be<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> lower than that provided by the conventional technology.<br/>
Furthermore, when the second flow rate adjusting means 17 is provided on the upstream side of the first flow rate adjusting means 15, an air capacity supplied to each burner 19 can be adjusted.</p><heading id="h0008">EFFECT OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the invention of the first aspect, when the momentum of the combustion gas injected into the furnace 18 from the burner 19 is deviated depending on each of the upper and lower sides, the flames can be deflected, and the thermal absorption of the furnace can be controlled. As a result, a temperature controller on the rear heat transfer surface of the furnace 18 can be eliminated. Additionally, in case of modifying an existing combustion device, the NOx reduction technology based on the change in the after-air port installing position and the air excess ratio can be applied without changing a steam temperature and a metal temperature of the rear heat transfer surface in the conventional example. Further, when the flames are deflected toward the lower side in the furnace 18, the combustion region of the burner 19 can be shifted to the lower side, the detention time of the NOx reduction region between the burner 19 and the after-air port 24 can be increased to be longer than that in a case where the injecting direction of the flames is horizontal, and the NOx concentration in the exhaust gas can be reduced as compared with the conventional<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> example.<br/>
According to the invention of the second aspect, in addition to the effect of the invention of the first aspect, the combustion gas supplied to the wind box 12 provided on the outer side of one furnace wall surface 10 can be collectively supplied from one duct 16, and the combustion gas supply system for the plurality of burners 19 can have a simple configuration.<br/>
According to the invention of the third aspect, in addition to the effect of the invention of the first or second aspect, since the plurality of wind boxes 12 are aligned and installed on the outer side of the furnace wall 10 inside or outside one duct 16, construction of the plurality of wind boxes 12 and the duct 16 can be facilitated.<br/>

According to these structures and the operating method, even when the combustion air inlet openings 12b and 12b are provided on both sides of the lower side of the wind box 12, the combustion air inlet opening 12a in the central portion is divided into two portions, and the dampers 15b, 15aa, 15ab, and 15b are provided on the upstream side of the respective air inflow paths as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 13</figref>, the same effect can be obtained by adjustment methods of the dampers 15b, 15aa, 15ab, and 15b.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">This embodiment is characterized in that the burners 19 each having the wind box 12 are installed on the boiler furnace wall 10 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 14</figref> and the combustion air is supplied into the burners 19 from a duct 16 provided on the outer side of the furnace wall 10. However, arrangement of the duct 16 is dependent on a boiler configuration and an installation angle of the burner 19. Further, even if the burners 19 each having the wind box 12 are arranged in the duct 16 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG.<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> 15</figref>, the same operation method can be carried out.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">According to this embodiment 3, when flames in the furnace 18 are deflected to the downward direction, the maximum thermal load region in the furnace 18 shifts to the lower side, thermal absorption of the furnace thereby increases, an exhaust gas temperature at an outlet of the furnace 18 can be reduced, a detention time of an NOx reduction region in the furnace 18 between the burner 19 and an after-air port 24 can be increased beyond than that in a case where a combustion region is evenly formed on each of upper and lower sides of the burner 19 by shifting the combustion region of the burner 19 to the lower side, thus providing the pulverized coal burner 19 that can reduce the NOx concentration.</p><heading id="h0014">EMBODIMENT 4</heading><p id="p0052" num="0052">This embodiment provides a configuration where a second damper 17 as a supply air capacity adjuster for each burner 19, which is configured to adjust a flow rate of combustion air flowing into each burner 19, is provided on the upstream side of a damper 15 in addition to the configurations of Embodiments 1 to 3. Since a distribution can appear in a fuel supplied to a plurality of burners 19 arranged on a boiler furnace wall 10, it is desirable to enable adjusting a combustion air flow rate in accordance with each burner 19 so that a combustion air flow<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> rate consistent with a fuel supply amount can be obtained.<br/>
Here, although the combustion air flow rate can be adjusted by a first damper 15 alone if its opening degree is adjusted in accordance with each burner 19, when the first damper 15 provided for the purpose of deviating a momentum of the combustion air on each of upper and lower sides of each burner 19 has a function of adjusting the combustion air flow rate consistent with the fuel supply amount, controlling this damper becomes difficult.<br/>
Thus, in this embodiment, the first damper 15 and the second damper 17 that share the two different functions are independently provided.<br/>
Each of <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 16 and FIG. 17</figref> shows a configuration where, in addition to first dampers 15a and 15b configured to deviate an air momentum on each of upper and lower sides of the burner 19 described in Embodiment 1 (<figref idrefs="f0004">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>), second dampers 17a and 17b for adjusting a flow rate of the combustion air flowing into each burner 19 are provided on the upstream side of the first dampers 15a and 15b.<br/>
As described above, for example, when the upper first damper 15a in the first dampers 15a and 15b that deviate the momentum of the combustion air depending on each of the upper and lower sides of each burner 19 is closed and the lower first damper 15b is opened, an injection amount of the combustion air on the lower side of the burner 19 increases, and an increase in the momentum of the combustion air flowing toward the lower side of the burner 19 enables deflecting flames in a furnace<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> 18 to a downward direction (see <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3(b)</figref>).<br/>
When the second dampers 17a and 17b are provided on the upstream side of the first dampers 15a and 15b, the flow rate of the combustion air flowing into each burner 19 can be individually adjusted without suppressing a deviation of the momentum of the combustion air on each of the upper and lower sides of the burner 19.<br/>
Providing the first dampers 15a and 15b, which are adjusters that deviate the momentum of the combustion air on each of the upper and lower sides of each burner 19 in each wind box 12, on the downstream side of the second dampers 17a and 17b can suffice, and the second dampers 17a and 17b can be arranged at any positions.<br/>
Furthermore, as each of the first dampers 15a and 15b and the second dampers 17a and 17b, a member that adjusts an opening area by sliding a plurality of laminated porous plates may be used in place of the illustrated butterfly type damper, and it can have any structure as long as it has a gas flow rate adjusting function.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In this embodiment, such a secondary air nozzle 8 having the guide sleeve 13 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is provided in the wind box 12, and the combustion air is injected into the furnace 18 from the outlet of the burner 19 in a spreading manner. The opening portion 8a is provided in the secondary air nozzle 8, and it is desirable to provide the slide type damper 9 that can adjust an air capacity flowing into the secondary air nozzle<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> 8.<br/>
For example, when the upper first damper 15a in the wind box 12 shown in <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 16</figref> is closed and the lower first damper 15b in the same is opened to increase an injection amount of the combustion air on the lower side of the burner 19, the combustion air can be prevented from flowing into the tertiary air nozzle 11 on the upper side in the wind box 12 by fully closing the opening portion 8a of the secondary air nozzle 8 provided on the upper side in the wind box 12 with use of the slide type damper 9a, and the momentum of the combustion air injected into the furnace 18 from the secondary air nozzle 8 can be substantially homogeneously maintained along the circumferential direction of the burner 19, thereby holding the flame stabilizing properties.<br/>
When the first dampers 15a and 15b and the slide type damper 9a are operated and the momentum of the tertiary air on each of the upper and lower sides of the burner 19 is deviated while maintaining the flame stabilizing properties of the burner 19, flames in the furnace 18 can be deflected.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">According to these structures and the operating method, the damper adjustment method for dividing each of the combustion air inlet openings 12a and 12b in the wind box 12 into two parts and providing the first dampers 15aa, 15ab, 15ba, and 15bb and the second dampers 17aa, 17ab, 17ba, and 17bb to the respective combustion air inlet openings 12a and 12b as shown in <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 17</figref> enables individually adjusting the flow rate of the combustion<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> air flowing into each burner 19 without suppressing a deviation of the momentum of the combustion air on each of the upper and lower sides of the burner 19.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In this embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 18</figref>, the burners 19 each having the wind box 12 are arranged in the duct 16.
