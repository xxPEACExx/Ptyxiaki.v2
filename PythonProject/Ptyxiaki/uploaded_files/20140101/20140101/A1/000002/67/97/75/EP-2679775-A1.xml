The transition duct generally includes an end frame that surrounds a downstream end of the transition duct. The end frame includes a terminal end generally disposed adjacent to a turbine section of the gas turbine. In particular embodiments, the end frame may include one or more slots. The one or more slots may include an upstream surface axially separated from a downstream surface where the one or more slots downstream surface is generally adjacent to the end frame terminal end. The end frame may also include a plurality of axially extending passages that extend through a portion of the end frame and intersect with the one or more slots. In this manner, a compressed working fluid may flow through at least a portion of the plurality of axially extending passages and into the one or more slots, thereby impinging the compressed working fluid on and/or flowing the compressed working fluid across the one or more slots downstream surface adj acent the end frame terminal end. The volume between the slot downstream surface and the end frame terminal end may form an integral heat shield between the end frame and the turbine section. As a result, the compressed working fluid may cool the end frame terminal<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> end, thus resulting in reduced thermal stresses on the end frame and improved mechanical life of the end frame and the transition duct.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary gas turbine and a cross section of a portion of the gas turbine, <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> illustrates a cross sectional view of a combustor of the gas turbine as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a gas turbine 10 generally includes a compressor 12, one or more combustors 14 downstream from the compressor 12 and a turbine section 16 downstream from the plurality of combustors 14. As shown, the plurality of combustors 14 may be arranged in an annular array about an axial centerline of the gas turbine 10. The turbine section 16 may generally include alternating stages of stationary vanes 18 and rotating blades 20. The rotating blades 20 may be coupled to a shaft 22 that extends through the turbine section 16. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, each of the plurality of combustors 14 may include an end cover 24 at one end and a transition duct 26 at the other end. One or more fuel nozzles 28 may extend generally downstream from the end cover 24. A combustion liner 30 may at least partially surround and extend downstream from the one or more fuel nozzles 28. The transition duct 26 may extend downstream from the combustion liner 30 and may terminate adjacent to a first stage of the stationary vanes 18. In alternate designs, the transition duct 26 may extend downstream from the one or more fuel nozzles 28.

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, a portion of the compressed working fluid 38 may flow across the transition duct 26 and towards the end cover 24 before reversing direction. The compressed working fluid 38 mixes with fuel from the one or more fuel nozzles 28 so as to form a combustible mixture within a combustion chamber 40 that may be at least partially defined inside the combustion liner 30. The combustible mixture is burned to produce a rapidly expanding hot gas 42. The hot gas 42 generally flows from the combustion liner 30, if present, through the transition duct 26 and into the turbine section 16 where energy from the hot gas 42<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> is transferred to the various stages of rotating blades 20 attached to the shaft 22, thereby causing the shaft 22 to rotate and produce mechanical work. The mechanical work produced may drive the compressor 12 or other external loads, such as a generator (not shown) to produce electricity. Another portion of the compressed working fluid 38 from the plenum 34 may be utilized primarily for cooling various components within the plurality of the combustors 14 and/or the turbine section 16.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> provides a plan view of an exemplary transition duct 26 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, according to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure.
