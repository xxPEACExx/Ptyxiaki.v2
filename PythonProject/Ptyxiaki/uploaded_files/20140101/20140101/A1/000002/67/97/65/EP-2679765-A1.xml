Cooling systems are essential in power electronic devices to transfer the heat generated by the power semiconductors. Frequency converters in the medium voltage and power range drive electric motors by controlling the speed and torque of these machines and are a well proven equipment in the entire onshore and offshore platform based industry.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In recent years, there has been a growing interest in installing electrical installations on the sea floor in depths from a few tens of meters to even kilometres. Oil and gas production subsea employs electric equipment like drilling motors, pumps, and compressors that are currently driven by frequency converters located on topside platforms. Electric power is provided to the subsea machinery by expensive umbilicals. By installing frequency converters and other power electronic equipment subsea, cables and topside installations could be spared and enormous cost savings could be achieved.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In bringing power electronics subsea, two general concepts exist: (1) the equipment stays at atmospheric pressure; and (2) the equipment is pressurized to the hydrostatic pressure level on seabed. The two concepts can be differentiated as follows. Concept (1) has the advantage that standard electric/electronic components, known from onshore installations, can be used, while disadvantages include thick walls needed for the enclosure to<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> withstand the pressure difference between inside and outside. Thick walls make the equipment heavy and costly. In addition, heat transfer through thick walls is not very efficient and huge, expensive cooling units are required. Concept (2) has the advantage that no thick walls are needed for the enclosure since no pressure difference exists between inside and outside the containment. Cooling is greatly facilitated by thin walls. Disadvantages of concept (2) are that all the components must be free of gas inclusions and compressible voids, otherwise they implode during pressurization and are destroyed.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">"Controlled subsea electric power distribution with SEPDIS™" by Solvik et al. published in ABB Review 2/2000 discloses a two-phase cooling system relating to concept (1). In particular this paper discloses a passive cooling system arranged to cool a subsea frequency converter of a very thick wall pressure vessel.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The problem of cooling power electronics in subsea equipment is however not yet solved satisfyingly. Challenges include <i>inter alia</i> reducing the size and cost of currently applied, thick-walled heat exchangers.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">In view of the above, a general object of the present disclosure is to provide a subsea unit that solves or at least mitigates the problems of the prior art.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Hence, according to a first aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a subsea unit arranged to house an electric or electronic device, wherein the subsea unit comprises a two-phase cooling system arranged to cool the electric or electronic device, which two-phase cooling system has an evaporator, a condenser, and a conduit which together with the evaporator and condenser forms a closed loop for circulating a cooling fluid, wherein the evaporator is arranged to be in thermal connection with the electric or electronic device, and wherein the subsea unit has an enclosure arranged to enclose the two-phase cooling system, which enclosure has a portion that is mechanically flexible such that an ambient subsea pressure can be<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> transmitted to the inside of the enclosure, and wherein the subsea unit comprises a liquid for counteracting deformation of the enclosure when subject to an ambient subsea pressure higher than a pressure that the enclosure can withstand.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">By means of a two-phase cooling system in a pressurised subsea unit which has an enclosure having a portion that is mechanically flexible to allow ambient subsea pressure to be transmitted to the inside of the subsea unit, robust, efficient and affordable subsea cooling may be provided. When the subsea unit is submerged into water, water flowing on the outside of the enclosure may for example have a cooling effect on e.g. the condenser.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to one embodiment the conduit has a portion that is mechanically flexible so as to allow pressure inside the enclosure and outside the conduit to be transmitted to the inside of the conduit.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to one embodiment the two-phase cooling system comprises a cooling fluid comprising at least two components that provide a thermodynamic two-phase state of the cooling fluid at a pressure higher than the critical pressure of any of the individual components of the cooling fluid. When a single-component two-phase cooling system is pressurised to ambient sea-water pressure, which for example may be in the range of 100 to400 bar and above the critical pressure of the single component, there is no difference between liquid and gas any more, and hence there is no liquid-gas two-phase equilibrium any more. At pressures equal to or higher than the critical pressure, vapour-liquid cooling is not possible any more, since there is no latent heat or vaporisation anymore and no density difference between vapour and liquid can drive the fluid motion in a passive cooling cycle. Even at pressures slightly below the critical pressure, two-phase cooling does not work efficiently, since the latent heat of vaporisation decreases strongly towards the critical pressure. No known single-component fluids have critical pressures suitable for deep sea applications. Moreover, apart from the requirement of a sufficiently high critical pressure, also the boiling temperature at the pressure of interest should be in the right range. The<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> boiling temperature should be around 60 °C for power-electronics cooling. Hence, the boiling temperatures of those single-component fluids available for higher pressures, e.g. ammonium and water, are far too high even for pressures around 100 bar.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to one embodiment the at least two components are adapted to provide a thermodynamic two-phase state of the cooling fluid at ambient pressure at a depth at which the subsea unit is to be installed. Advantageously, the at least two components are adapted to provide a vapour-liquid two phase state at ambient pressures at a depth at which the subsea unit is to be installed</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to one embodiment the conduit is partially filled with the cooling fluid when the conduit is subjected to sea level pressure, and wherein the subsea unit comprises a pressure compensating vessel comprising additional cooling fluid, and a valve, wherein the conduit is arranged to be in fluid connection with the pressure compensation vessel via the valve such that the additional cooling fluid is able to flow from the pressure compensating vessel to the conduit when the subsea unit is subjected to a pressure that is higher than a pressure inside the conduit. Thereby thick walls of the conduit of the two-phase cooling system may be avoided. Thick walls are costly and are detrimental to the thermal performance. In order to avoid thick walls, pressure differences across the conduit walls should be kept low. In particular, the pressure in the conduit should be continuously adapted to the outside pressure when lowering the equipment to seabed; i.e. the pressure in the conduit should successively be increased from atmospheric pressure to water pressure on the seabed.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to one embodiment the additional cooling fluid in the pressure compensating vessel is pressurised to seabed pressure of a depth at which the subsea unit is to be installed. Hence, during the lowering of the subsea unit to seabed, the valve may open just enough to let as much additional cooling fluid pass to the conduit as is necessary to increase the conduit pressure to about ambient pressure.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to one embodiment the valve has a body having a through opening in the axial direction of a conduit portion connected to the valve, which valve is movable in a radial direction of the conduit portion between a first position in which the body blocks the additional cooling fluid from flowing from the pressure compensating vessel to the conduit and a second position in which the through opening is aligned with the interior of the conduit portion to thereby allow the additional cooling fluid to flow from the pressure compensating vessel to the conduit. Hence, a simple passive mechanical valve construction may be provided, reducing the risk of equipment failure.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to one embodiment the valve has a first end in fluid communication with the cooling fluid in the conduit and a second end, opposite the first end, subjected to ambient pressure, wherein a pressure difference between the first end and the second end allows the body to move between the first position and the second position.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">One embodiment comprises a mechanical spring arranged to provide a force in the radial direction at the first end of the valve so as to enable the body to move from the second position to the first position.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As an alternative to the mechanical valve construction, one embodiment may comprise a first pressure sensor and a second pressure sensor arranged to measure a pressure in the conduit and outside the conduit in the subsea unit, respectively, and a control unit arranged to control the valve based on measurements of the first pressure sensor and the second pressure sensor.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">One embodiment comprises a pressure-relief valve connecting the conduit and an exterior of the subsea unit, wherein the pressure-relief valve is arranged to open when the ambient pressure in the subsea unit is lower than the pressure in the conduit to thereby let a portion of the cooling fluid escape the subsea unit. Thereby the subsea unit may be raised from the seabed to atmospheric pressure for servicing, as the cooling fluid can escape to ambience via the pressure-relief valve. The pressure-relief valve may be a passive device that opens once the pressure in the conduit exceeds the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> ambient pressure by a certain amount, similar to a steam cooker. This way, significant overpressure in the conduit is avoided at any time. The cooling fluid may be environmentally friendly, such that the cooling fluid that has escaped will not harm the environment.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to one embodiment the condenser is in thermal connection with an exterior of the enclosure.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to one embodiment, the two-phase cooling system comprises a cooling liquid, and wherein the conduit, the evaporator and the condenser have walls that are thick enough to withstand a pressure difference between a sealing pressure inside the conduit, the evaporator and the condenser, which sealing pressure is a pressure at which the cooling liquid has been sealed in the two-phase cooling system, and ambient pressure at a depth at which the subsea unit is to be installed</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The subsea unit may advantageously be included in a subsea power system such as a transmission system or distribution system.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Generally, all terms used in the claims are to be interpreted according to their ordinary meaning in the technical field, unless explicitly defined otherwise herein.

The conduit 3 forms a closed loop together with the evaporator 4 and the condenser 5 for circulating the cooling fluid 6-1 to thereby achieve cooling of the electric or electronic device 11.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">According to one variation of the two-phase cooling system 2, the evaporator 4 has an inlet 4-1 and an outlet 4-2, and the condenser 5 has an inlet 5-1 and an outlet 5-2, wherein the conduit 3 connects the outlet 4-2 of the evaporator<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 4 with the inlet 5-1 of the condenser 5 and the outlet 5-2 of the condenser 5 with the inlet 4-1 of the evaporator 4. To that end, the conduit may either be a single piece conduit, or it may alternatively comprise several parts, e.g. a first part connecting the outlet of the evaporator to the inlet of the condenser and a second part connecting the outlet of the condenser to the inlet of the evaporator.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The two-phase cooling system 2 is preferably vertically oriented in the subsea unit 1-A when the subsea unit 1-A is installed on the seabed to thereby allow gravity-driven circulation of the cooling fluid 6-1. Thus, when the subsea unit 1-A is installed on the seabed, the section of the conduit 3 provided with the evaporator 4 provides a cooling fluid flow vertically upwards, and the section of the conduit 3 provided with the condenser 5 provides a cooling fluid flow vertically downwards in the direction of the seabed. According to one variation of the two-phase cooling system 1-1, the evaporator 4 and the condenser 5 are arranged in different horizontal planes when the subsea unit 1-A is arranged on the seabed. The evaporator 4 is arranged at a lower end of a first vertical portion of the conduit 3, through which the cooling fluid 6-1 is arranged to flow upwards, and the condenser 5 is arranged at an upper end of a second vertical portion of the conduit 3, through which the cooling fluid 6-1 is arranged to flow downwards, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs 1a-b</figref>.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">According to one variation of the subsea unit 1-A, the evaporator 4 is in thermal connection with the electronic or electric device 11 such that the heat emitted by the electronic or electric device 11 may be transmitted to the cooling fluid 6-1 for vaporisation thereof. According to one variation of the subsea unit 1-A, the condenser 5 is in thermal connection with an exterior of the enclosure 1-1 such that condensation of the cooling fluid 6-1 in vaporised state may be obtained. Optionally, fins may be provided on the external surface of the enclosure. As an alternative, the condenser could be provided outside the enclosure for direct seawater cooling of the condenser.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">For the purpose of transmitting the ambient subsea pressure to the inside of the enclosure 1-1, the enclosure 1-1 has a portion that is mechanically flexible.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> Furthermore, subsea unit 1-A comprises a liquid L for counteracting deformation of the enclosure 1-1 when the subsea unit 1-A is subject to an ambient subsea pressure higher than a pressure that the enclosure can withstand without deformation. Hereto, the liquid L fills the interior space of the subsea unit 1-A so as to prevent the occurrence of any air gaps between the inside surface of the enclosure 1-1 and any internal component of the subsea unit 1-A. The liquid L is advantageously a dielectric liquid such as oil in order to prevent short circuit of the electric or electronic device 11.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">According to one variation of the two-phase cooling system 2, conduit 3 has a portion that is mechanically flexible so as to allow external pressure on the mechanically flexible portion of the conduit 3 to be transmitted to the interior of the conduit 3. Ambient pressure adaptation in the conduit 3 may thereby be obtained. Alternatively, the conduit, the evaporator and the condenser may have walls that are thick enough to withstand a pressure difference between a sealing pressure inside the conduit, the evaporator and the condenser and ambient pressure at a depth at which the subsea unit is to be installed. By sealing pressure is meant the pressure at which the cooling liquid is sealed in the two-phase cooling system when the two-phase cooling system is manufactured. According to this latter alternative, the pressure compensating vessel, the valve connecting the two-phase cooling system and the pressure compensating vessel, and the pressure-relief valve may be dispensed with as the pressure, i.e. the sealing pressure, in the two-phase cooling system is essentially constant at any ambient pressure which it has been constructed to withstand.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Preferably the cooling fluid 6-1 comprises at least two components which provide a thermodynamic two-phase state of the cooling fluid 6-1 at a pressure higher than the critical pressure of any of the individual components of the cooling fluid 6-1. In particular, the at least two components are selected so as to provide a thermodynamic two-phase state of the cooling liquid 6-1 also at ambient pressures at the depth at which the subsea unit 1-A is to be installed. More specifically, the at least two components are selected so as to provide a vapour-liquid two phase state also at ambient pressures at the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> depth at which the subsea unit 1-A is to be installed. The cooling fluid 6-1 may be a two-component mixture or a multi-component mixture comprising more than two components. The at least two components of the cooling fluid 6-1 may according to one variation be selected in such a way that they provide thermodynamic two-phase state of the cooling fluid also at atmospheric pressure. There exist a plurality of two-component and multi-component fluids suitable for the deep sea cooling purposes of this disclosure, for which ambient pressures on the seabed typically ranges from 100 to 400 bar.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">When the subsea unit 1-A, and thus the conduit 3, is subjected to atmospheric pressure prior to installation on the seabed, the conduit 3 is advantageously only partially filled with cooling fluid 6-1. In order to be able to adapt the pressure in the conduit to ambient pressure, the pressure compensating vessel 7 comprises additional cooling fluid of the same kind as cooling fluid 6-1 in the conduit 3. The valve 8-A provides a fluid connection between the pressure compensating vessel 7 and the conduit 3 such that the additional cooling fluid may flow from the pressure compensating vessel 7 to the conduit 3 through the valve 8-A when the ambient pressure in the subsea unit 1-A becomes higher than the pressure inside the conduit 3. When manufacturing the subsea unit 1-A, the additional cooling fluid in the pressure compensating vessel is advantageously pressurised to seabed pressure of a depth at which the subsea unit is to be installed.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2a</figref> is a cross-sectional side view of a portion 3-1 of the conduit 3 when connected to the valve 8 and the pressure compensating vessel 7. The valve 8-A, which is arranged in a valve case 8-0 at the interface between the conduit 3 and the pressure compensating vessel 7, has a body 8-1 having a through opening 8-2 in the axial direction A of the conduit portion 3-1 connected to the valve 8, a first end 8-3 and a second end 8-4 opposite the first end 8-3. The valve 8 further comprises a mechanical spring 8-5 arranged to apply a force in a radial direction r of the conduit portion 3-1 at the first end 8-3 of the valve 8.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The body 8-1 is movable in the valve case 8-0 in the radial direction r between a first position in which the body 8-1 blocks additional cooling fluid from flowing from the pressure compensating vessel 7 to the conduit 3, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2a</figref>, and a second position in which the through opening 8-2 is aligned with the interior of the conduit portion 3-1 to thereby allow additional cooling fluid 6-2, pressurised to a pressure P-2 corresponding to the pressure at which the subsea unit 1-A is to be installed, to flow from the pressure compensating vessel 7 to the conduit 3, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2b</figref>. The body 8-1 moves from the first position when there is a sufficient pressure difference between ambient pressure P-3 applied to the second end 8-4 of the body 8-1 and a pressure P4 applied to the first end 8-3 by the mechanical spring 8-5 and a pressure P-1 in the conduit 3. When the pressure P-1 in the conduit 3 has been adapted to ambient pressure P-3, the body 8-1 moves from the second position to the first position due to the force applied by the mechanical spring 8-5 on the first portion 8-3 of the body 8-1, thereby blocking further additional cooling fluid 6-2 from flowing from the pressure compensating vessel 7 to the conduit 3.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The pressure-relief valve 12 connects the conduit 3 and an exterior of the subsea unit 1-A. Similarly to a pressure cooker, the pressure-relief valve 12 is arranged to open when the ambient pressure in the subsea unit 1-A is lower than the pressure in the conduit to thereby let a portion of the cooling fluid 6-1 escape the subsea unit 1-A.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1b</figref> shows a second example of a subsea unit. Subsea unit 1-B is similar to subsea unit 1-A of the first example, except for valve 8-B connecting the pressure compensating vessel 7 and the conduit 3, a control unit 9, a first pressure sensor 10-1 and a second pressure sensor 10-2. The first pressure sensor 10-1 is arranged to measure a pressure in the conduit 3 and the second pressure sensor 10-2 is arranged to measure the ambient pressure in the subsea unit 1-B, outside the conduit 3. The control unit 9 is connected to each of the sensors 10-1 and 10-2, and is arranged to provide a control signal to the valve 8-B to open when the ambient pressure outside the conduit measured by the second pressure sensor 10-2 is sufficiently higher than the pressure<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> measured by the first pressure sensor 10-1. When the pressure inside the conduit 3 has been adapted to the ambient pressure, the control unit 9 is arranged to send a control signal to the valve 8-B to close.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">It is envisaged that the subsea unit presented herein finds applications within the oil and gas industry, subsea HVDC/HVAC transmission and distribution systems as well as offshore power generation such as wind energy, tidal energy, wave energy, and ocean current energy.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The inventive concept has mainly been described above with reference to a few examples.
