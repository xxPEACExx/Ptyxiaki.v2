present invention relates to a mixture separating method and a mixture separating apparatus for separating, by substance type, a mixture containing a plurality of types of substances, or for separating a specific type of substance from the mixture, using a magnetic field having a magnetic field gradient.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">When collecting metals or resins from waste such as a used electronic product including the metals or resins as the builders, typically, various separating processes are performed on a mixture of different types of substances obtained by grinding the waste or part thereof. For example, Patent Document 1 (<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2010524663A"><text>JP 2010-524663A</text></patcit> discloses a recycling method, including a process that places shredder residue obtained from waste into a sink-float tank, and separates the residue into metal residue and plastic residue using the difference in density or specific gravity, a process that separates, by type, the metal residue using an air separator, a magnetic belt, or the like, and a process that separates, by type, the plastic residue using a temperature separator, a hydrocyclone, or the like.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The method disclosed in Patent Document 1 employs a plurality of separators, tanks, and the like in order to realize the above-described separating processes, and thus, a complicated and large-scale system is necessary for realizing this method. Meanwhile, Patent Document 2 (<patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2002059026A"><text>JP 2002-59026A</text></patcit>) discloses a method for sorting a mixture using the magneto-Archimedes effect. According to this method, a mixture of a plurality of types of diamagnetic plastic particles is placed into a supporting liquid, and a magnetic field having a magnetic field gradient, that is, a gradient magnetic field is applied thereto, so that the diamagnetic plastic particles in the mixture float at positions corresponding to their physical properties (volume susceptibility and density), and the plastic particles are sorted by type. If a mixture containing a plurality of types of substances, such as a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> mixture obtained from waste as disclosed in Patent Document 1, is separated by type using the magneto-Archimedes effect (or magnetic force or magnetic buoyancy applied to particles in a medium) as in the invention described in Patent Document 2, the separating apparatus and the separating process will be significantly simplified and more efficient.</p><heading id="h0003">PRIOR ART REFERENCES</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2010524663A"><text>JP 2010-524663A</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2002059026A"><text>JP 2002-59026A</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, with the approach shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> of Patent Document 2, it is difficult to perform continuous treatment that involves collecting particles separated by type while placing a mixture into a supporting liquid. Although <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> of Patent Document 2 shows the approach that causes a supporting liquid to flow and collects magnetically levitating particles using a collecting net, the accuracy in separating particles may possibly deteriorate when positions for trapping the particles are changed by a disturbance (turbulence, meandering of the flow line, etc.) in the flow of the supporting liquid. Furthermore, if a plurality of collecting nets are arranged in series along the channel as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> of Patent Document 2, the accuracy in separating particles at a downstream collecting net may deteriorate due to the influence of a disturbance caused by an upstream collecting net. If the mixture contains high-density metal particles, the metal particles that have sunk to the bottom of the channel have to be washed along, and thus, the above-described problems occur more easily.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention solves the above-described problems, and provides a method and an apparatus capable of continuously and accurately separating, by substance type, a mixture containing a plurality of types of particles made of different substances, using a gradient magnetic field. Moreover, the present invention provides a method and an apparatus capable of continuously and accurately separating particles made of a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> specific substance from a mixture containing a plurality of types of particles made of different substances, using a gradient magnetic field.</p><heading id="h0007">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention is directed to a mixture separating method for separating, by type, a mixture containing at least two types of particles, particles of one type of which are made of a paramagnetic or diamagnetic substance, or for separating the particles of the one type from the mixture, including: a step of applying a magnetic field whose magnetic field gradient has a vertical component and a horizontal component to a supporting liquid stored in a separating tank; a step of placing the mixture into the supporting liquid to which the magnetic field has been applied, and guiding the particles of the one type using the magnetic field such that the particles of the one type are positioned in the supporting liquid at a predetermined height from a bottom face of the separating tank while horizontally traveling, or a step of placing the mixture into the supporting liquid to which the magnetic field has been applied, and causing the particles of the one type to magnetically levitate at a liquid surface of the supporting liquid and horizontally travel using the magnetic field; and a step of collecting the particles of the one type positioned at the predetermined height or at the liquid surface of the supporting liquid, wherein particles of another type of the at least two types of particles are positioned at a position vertically different from that of the particles of the one type, between the bottom face of the separating tank and the liquid surface of the supporting liquid.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Moreover, the present invention is directed to a mixture separating apparatus for separating, by type, a mixture containing at least two types of particles, particles of one type of which are made of a paramagnetic or diamagnetic substance, or for separating the particles of the one type from the mixture, including: a separating tank for storing a supporting liquid; magnetic field generating means for applying a magnetic field whose magnetic field gradient has a vertical component and a horizontal component to the supporting liquid; introducing means for introducing the mixture into the supporting liquid, said means being disposed at one end side of the separating tank; and collecting<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> means for collecting the particles of the one type, said means being disposed at the other end side of the separating tank, wherein, when the mixture is introduced via the introducing means into the supporting liquid to which the magnetic field has been applied, the particles of the one type are guided using the magnetic field such that the particles of the one type are positioned in the supporting liquid at a predetermined height from a bottom face of the separating tank while traveling toward the other end side of the separating tank, or the particles of the one type are caused to magnetically levitate at a liquid surface of the supporting liquid and travel toward the other end side of the separating tank using the magnetic field, the collecting means collects the particles of the one type positioned at the predetermined height or at the liquid surface of the supporting liquid, from the separating tank, and particles of another type of the at least two types of particles are positioned at a position vertically different from that of the particles of the one type, between the bottom face of the separating tank and the liquid surface of the supporting liquid.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention may be configured such that the separating tank is provided with a substantially horizontal shelf board, and the particles of the one type sink in the supporting liquid and are positioned on the shelf board. Furthermore, the invention may be configured such that the particles of the one type magnetically levitate stably at the predetermined height in the supporting liquid.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention may be configured such that the magnetic field is generated using magnetic field generating means having a superconducting bulk magnet or having a solenoid coil with a coil central axis inclined with respect to the vertical direction. Furthermore, the invention may be configured such that the magnetic field is obtained by composition of a first magnetic field generated by first magnetic field generating means and a second magnetic field generated by second magnetic field generating means, and the first magnetic field has a magnetic field gradient oriented in the vertical direction and the second magnetic field has a magnetic field gradient oriented in the horizontal direction.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention may be configured such that the supporting liquid is an aqueous solution containing at least one type of paramagnetic inorganic salt, and more<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> specifically such that the supporting liquid is an aqueous solution containing at least one type of paramagnetic inorganic salt selected from the group consisting of manganese chloride, cobalt chloride, nickel chloride, ferrous chloride, cobalt nitrate, nickel nitrate, gadolinium nitrate, dysprosium nitrate, and terbium nitrate.</p><heading id="h0008">Advantageous Effects of the Invention</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the present invention, the magnetic field gradient of the magnetic field that is to be applied to the particles contained in the mixture and to the supporting liquid has a horizontal component in addition to a vertical component. Accordingly, a horizontal force resulting from this magnetic field is applied to paramagnetic or diamagnetic particles contained in the mixture, and these particles are guided to a predetermined height from the bottom face of the separating tank while horizontally traveling from the placing or introducing location to the collecting location, or horizontally travel from the placing location to the collecting location while magnetically levitating at the liquid surface of the supporting liquid. Since the trajectories of the particles in the supporting liquid vary depending on the physical properties of the particles, the magnetic or diamagnetic particles and the other particles contained in the mixture are positioned at vertically different heights between the bottom face of the separating tank and the liquid surface of the supporting liquid.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In this manner, according to the present invention, the particles in the mixture are caused to travel from the location for placing into the supporting liquid to the collecting location by the magnetic force, and thus, it is possible to collect the separated particles while the mixture is being introduced into the supporting liquid. Furthermore, the supporting liquid does not have to flow along in order to cause the particles to travel, and thus, it is possible to accurately separate the mixture by type, or to accurately separate a specific type of particle from the mixture.</p><heading id="h0009">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing the outline of a mixture separating apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> -->

The mixture separating apparatus of the first embodiment includes a magnet (11) that is magnetic field generating means of the present invention and generates a gradient magnetic field, and a separating tank (31) for storing a supporting liquid (21). The magnet (11) is a superconducting magnet using a solenoid coil, and a wire member made of a superconducting material (Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn, NbTi, etc.) forming the magnet (11) is wound inside a cylindrical or doughnut-like container (41) made of stainless steel or the like so as to cover an inner wall (43) of the container (41). Inside the container<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> (41), a cooling mechanism (not shown) that cools down the magnet (11) is provided. A non-superconducting electromagnet also may be used as the magnet (11).</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The mixture separating apparatus of the first embodiment is provided with a leg portion (45) that supports the container (41). The container (41) is fixed to the leg portion (45) in a state in which a coil central axis A of the magnet (11) is inclined with respect to the vertical direction. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref> show a state in which the coil central axis A of the magnet (11) is inclined by approximately 30 degrees with respect to the vertical direction. The inclination angle of the magnet (11) (and the shape of a support portion (47) described later) may be adjusted as appropriate according to the mixture that is to be treated and the supporting liquid (21) that is to be used.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The separating tank (31) in the shape of a rectangular solid or a box is disposed in the internal space surrounded by the inner wall (43) of the container (41). The separating tank (31) is supported on the support portion (47) fixed to the inner wall (43) of the container (41). The separating tank (31) and the support portion (47) are made of a non-magnetic material such as plastic or non-magnetic stainless steel. In an upper portion of the separating tank (31) at one end side, a hopper (33) is provided that is means for throwing or introducing a mixture, and that is used to place a mixture that is to be treated into the supporting liquid (21) in the separating tank (31). A shelf board (37) is provided so as to horizontally project from a wall portion (35) that is on the opposite side to the hopper (33). <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a partially cutaway top view of the separating tank (31).</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A mixture that is to be treated using the mixture separating method or the mixture separating apparatus of the present invention contains a plurality of types of particles made of different substances. In the plurality of types of particles, at least one type of particle is made of a paramagnetic or diamagnetic substance. The mixture that is to be treated using the mixture separating apparatus of the first embodiment contains first particles (indicated by black circles) made of a paramagnetic or diamagnetic substance and second particles (indicated by white circles) made of a substance different from the substance forming the first particles. The second type of particle may be made of any one of a paramagnetic substance, a diamagnetic substance, and a ferromagnetic substance.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The separating tank (31) is linked to collecting means for separately collecting<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the first particles and the second particles that have been separated from each other.

Each of the suction tubes (51) and (53) is linked to the separating tank (31) via a hole formed through the wall portion (35) of the separating tank (31).

The magnitude B of the magnetic field reaches a maximum value Bmax when h = 0, that is, at the center O of the magnet (11), and monotonically decreases as the distance h increases. The magnitude B of the magnetic field is substantially constant on a plane orthogonal to the coil central axis A. Hereinafter, a description will be given assuming that a magnetic field generated by the magnet (11) is oriented downward along the coil central axis A, but the magnetic field generated by the magnet (11) may be oriented upward along the coil central axis A.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref> shows a change in a product of the magnitude B of the magnetic field generated by the magnet (11) and a magnetic field gradient ∂B/∂h, that is, B x ∂B/∂h with respect to the distance h. As the distance h increases, the magnitude B of the magnetic field decreases, and thus, the magnetic field gradient ∂B/∂h becomes negative, and B x ∂B/∂h also becomes negative. The product B x ∂B/∂h is zero when h = 0, that is, at the center O of the magnet (11), and decreases once and then increases as h increases from 0.
