A laser light L oscillated from the laser oscillation device 21 is reflected by a reflecting mirror 22 toward a direction of a liquid 24, and vertically enters in a liquid surface.<br/>
Namely, the above-mentioned liquid phase laser ablation apparatus disclosed in the above Patent Document 1 discloses a method comprising steps of: immersing a target 32 in the liquid 24 stored in a vessel (cell), the target 32 containing a component to be atomized; irradiating a laser light L which is focused by a focusing lens (collecting lens) 23 onto a surface of the target 32 from upward direction, and generating nanoparticles of, for example, metal, oxide, organic compounds, or the like that constitute the target 32.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Moreover, <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 7</figref> shows another example of a structure of the conventional liquid phase laser ablation apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Application (Laid-Open) Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2006122845A"><text>2006-122845 </text></patcit>(Patent Document 2).<br/>

As a result of "the rebounding phenomenon of the liquid", droplets would scatter or splash to an upper part of the incident point and its circumference, so that there may be arisen a problem such that circumference equipment or facilities are damaged or defiled.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Although the amount of scattering (rebounding) of these droplets changes in accordance with output power of the laser light, the scattering of the droplets generally occurs within a range from the liquid surface to a portion 20 - 30 cm apart from the liquid surface. When these rebounded liquid are adhered to optical components such as the focusing lens, a reflection mirror or the like, absorption, scattering (dispersion), and reflection of the laser light will occur at the adhered portion, so that the optical components are damaged, and the adhered portion will partially ground (peeled off) thereby to generate fine components of the optical components, then the generated<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> fine components are disadvantageously mixed into the liquid thereby to cause a contamination of the liquid. As a result, impurities are mixed into a group of nanoparticles as a product, so that there may arise a greater risk such that the purity of the product is lowered or the like.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Moreover, due to the damage or defilement of the optical components, irradiating conditions of the laser light cannot be kept constant and the conditions are unstably changed, so that there may be posed problems such that the laser light cannot be stably irradiated to the target for a long period of time, and an operation control for the laser ablation apparatus becomes to be complicated.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">On the other hand, in the conventional liquid phase laser ablation apparatus indicated in the Patent Document 2, the apparatus is not a system for irradiating the laser light to the liquid surface, the phenomenon of "rebound of liquid" would not occur. However, even if the window body (laser light introduction window) is formed from material such as quartz glass, calcium fluoride or the like having a high transmittance with respect to the laser light, the absorption, scattering (dispersion), and reflection of the laser light will occur at a portion (interface) at which the window body contacts the liquid contained in the vessel, as the same manner as in the apparatus disclosed in the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> Patent Document 1.<br/>
Then, the window body causes a scarred portion, and a transmittance of the laser light at the scarred and damaged portion is disadvantageously lowered, so that not only an ablation operation cannot be efficiently performed, but also segments generated by the window body being ground are mixed in a product as contamination. As a result, there may be also posed a problem such that a purity of the nanoparticles as the product is disadvantageously lowered.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Furthermore, when the laser light is repeatedly irradiated to the scarred portion formed to the window body, cracks are liable to occur to the scarred portion, so that there may be a greater risk such that the window body is finally broken, and there is also a disadvantage such that it takes a lot of troubles and cost over the replacement of parts constituting the apparatus.<br/>
Further, as the same manner as in the apparatus disclosed in the Patent Document 1, the irradiating conditions of the laser light cannot be kept constant and the conditions are unstably changed, so that there may be also posed problems such that the laser light cannot be stably irradiated to the target for a long period of time, and the operation control for the laser ablation apparatus becomes to be complicated.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present invention had been achieved for solving the problems inherent to the conventional prior arts, and an object of the present invention is to provide a liquid phase laser ablation method and a liquid phase laser ablation apparatus capable of performing the laser ablation continuously and stably and capable of stably generating atomized particles, due to structures such that even if the liquid rebounds, the rebounded liquid would not adhere to the optical components such as the focusing lens (collection lens), the reflecting lens, the window body of vessel or the like, and these optical components are configured so as not to contact the liquid.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Moreover, another object of the present invention is to provide a liquid phase laser ablation method and a liquid phase laser ablation apparatus for a case where the atomized particles are generated by irradiating a laser light to a target containing a component to be atomized, in which the laser ablation is continuously performed by stably irradiating the laser light to the target whereby the atomized particles are efficiently generated.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, the present invention provides a liquid phase laser ablation<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> apparatus comprising: a vessel for storing liquid in which a component to be atomized is arranged; a laser oscillating device for oscillating a laser light irradiated to the component through the liquid; a reflecting mirror configured to freely change an angle of incidence of the laser light with respect to a surface of the liquid; a focusing lens for focusing the laser light oscillated from the laser oscillating device; a cover body for covering an upper surface of the vessel; and a laser light introduction port provided on the cover body or a side surface of the vessel above the surface of the liquid,</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Further, in the above-mentioned liquid phase laser ablation apparatus, it is preferable that the component to be atomized is arranged in the liquid as a target compact containing particles of the component to be atomized.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">On the other hand, in the above-mentioned liquid phase laser ablation apparatus, it is also preferable that the component to be atomized is arranged as a slurry in which the particles of the component to be atomized are dispersed in the liquid.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">That is, in the liquid phase laser ablation apparatus according to the present invention, the following two types of liquid phase laser ablation methods can be adopted in<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> accordance with forms of arranging the component to be atomized in the liquid.<br/>
Namely, there can be employed one method comprising the steps of: preparing a target containing the component to be atomized; immersing the target into the liquid; irradiating a laser light to the target; and generating the atomized particles. Further, there can be also employed another method comprising the steps of: preparing a slurry (dispersion liquid) in which relatively large particles (particle size of sub-micron to several millimeters) of the component to be atomized are dispersed; irradiating a laser light to the dispersed particles in the slurry; and generating the atomized particles.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Since an upper surface of the vessel is covered with the cover body (lid), the liquid or the slurry rebounded by the irradiation of the laser light would not adhere to the focusing lens or the reflecting mirror, so that the laser ablation can be stably continued for a long period of time, and the nanoparticles can be generated efficiently.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Furthermore, in the above-mentioned liquid phase laser ablation apparatus, it is also preferable that the angle of incidence of the laser light with respect to the surface of the liquid is set to exceed 0 degree and less<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> than 90 degrees. The incident angle of the laser light being to "exceed 0 degree and less than 90 degrees" has the same meaning as "exceed 90 degrees and less than 180 degrees" when expressed in terms of supplemental angle.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In this case, since the incident angle of the laser light with respect to the liquid surface becomes to an angle other than a perpendicular angle, "the liquid-rebounding phenomenon" in the same direction as in a direction introducing the laser light from a portion at which the laser light is incident does not occur, and there is no fear of defiling the circumference equipment installed close to an incident point.<br/>
Moreover, since the rebounded liquid would not adhere to the optical components such as a focusing lens and a reflecting mirror or the like, the absorption, scattering, reflection or the like of the laser light would not take place at all.

In this embodiment, the slurry in which particles of the component to be atomized are dispersed is used in place of the afore-mentioned target 32.<br/>
This liquid phase laser ablation apparatus is configured, for example, so as to comprise: a vessel for holding the slurry in which the particles of the component to be atomized are dispersed; a laser oscillation device for oscillating the laser light to irradiate the particles contained in this slurry with laser light; a focusing lens for focusing the laser light oscillated from the laser oscillation device; a reflecting mirror configured to freely change an<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> angle of incidence of the laser light with respect to a surface of the afore-mentioned slurry; a cover body for covering an upper surface of the vessel; and a laser light introduction port provided on the cover body or a side surface of the vessel.<br/>

Concretely, agitators or stirrers having various shapes attached to rotation shafts are prepared, and the agitator or the like is installed into the slurry stored in the vessel whereby the slurry is agitated by the agitator or the like.<br/>
As another countermeasure, it is also effective to stir the slurry by means of a magnetic stirrer in which a stirrer (rod-shaped magnet) of which surface is subjected to surface coating of Teflon (registered trademark) or the like<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> is enclosed in the vessel, and a rotating magnetic field is applied to the stirrer from outside of the vessel 11 whereby a rotation power is transmitted to the stirrer.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">As described above, also in case of this embodiment using the slurry in which the particles of the component to be atomized are dispersed, the following advantageous effects can be obtained as the same manner as the previous embodiment using the target.<br/>
That is, the incident angle of the laser light with respect to the surface of the slurry is set to the angle exceeding 0 degree and less than 90 degrees, and the incident angle would not take a verticality but takes an angle other than right angle, so that there are few possibilities of causing the "liquid-rebounding phenomenon" in which the slurry is rebounded from an incident portion of the laser light at slurry surface to a direction which is the same direction as the laser light introduction direction, whereby there is no fear of circumferential parts being contaminated and damaged.<br/>
In addition, since the rebounded liquid 31 (slurry) would not adhere to the optical components, so that the absorption, scattering and reflection of the laser light L would not take place. Moreover the contamination caused by the segments exfoliated from the optical components is eliminated, so that the lowering in purity of a product can<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> be effectively prevented.<br/>
Moreover, since there is little contamination or damage to the optical components, the conditions for irradiating the laser light become constant, and the laser light can be stably irradiated for a long period of time, so that there can be obtained an effect such that an operational control of the ablation apparatus can become easy.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Next, the following comparative experiments were conducted using the liquid phase laser ablation apparatuses according to concrete Examples and Comparative Examples. Specifications and operating conditions of parts commonly used in both Examples and Comparative Examples are as follows.
<ol><li>(1) As the vessel, a box-shaped glass vessel having inner dimensions of 50 mm length, 75 mm wide and 52 mm depth with an internal volume of 200 cm<sup>3</sup>, and an effective internal volume of 160 cm<sup>3</sup> for injecting the liquid or slurry was used.</li><li>(2) A pure water was used as the liquid to be filled up in the vessel.</li><li>(3) Gold (Au) was used as the target.</li><li>(4) As the laser oscillation device, there was used a Nd:YAG laser oscillation device for oscillating a laser light having a wavelength of 266 nm in ultraviolet light range, of<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> which the output power was 100 mJ / pulse and the pulse frequency was 10 pulses / sec (PPS).</li></ol></p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Firstly, as a Comparative Example, an ablation operation was carried out by using the conventional liquid phase laser ablation apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 8</figref>. In this case, an incident angle of the laser light L was fixed so that the laser light L might enter perpendicularly to the surface of the liquid 24.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">On the other hand, liquid phase laser ablation apparatuses according to Examples shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> were produced by modifying the optical system of the conventional liquid phase laser ablation apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 8</figref>. Namely, the reflecting mirror 22 was appropriately rotated so that the incident angle θ of the laser light L with respect to the liquid surface of the liquid (pure water) 31 filled up in the vessel was varied within a range of 30 to 60 degrees, and each of the incident angle θ of the laser light L was fixed.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Then, when the above liquid phase laser ablation apparatuses according to Examples and Comparative Example were continuously operated under the same conditions, deterioration (variation with time) of the irradiating condition of the laser light and an amount of<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> generated nanoparticles were measured and compared.<br/>
In this regard, the deterioration of the irradiating condition was measured as a time range from an initial state to a time when the irradiating condition of the laser light was varied (deteriorated) at 5 % or more because the liquid or the slurry was rebounded by the irradiation of the laser light and the rebounded liquid or the slurry was adhered to the optical system such the focusing lens or the like.<br/>
The amount of the generated nanoparticles was measured as an amount of nanoparticles which can be manufactured in one continuous operation of the laser ablation apparatus.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">As a result, in each of the apparatuses of Examples, the liquid or slurry rebounded by the irradiation of the laser light did not adhere to the optical components such as the focusing lens or the like.<br/>
Therefore, in each of the apparatuses of Examples, 5% or more of variation in the irradiating condition of the laser light was not observed at all even if the irradiation was continued for 5 hours or longer. In contrast, in a case where the comparative apparatuses were used, a time until the irradiating condition of the laser light was changed by 5% or more was about 5 minutes.<br/>
In addition, a weight of the nanoparticles capable of<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> being manufactured in one continuous operation could be increased by 5 to 7 times as compared with a case where the apparatus of comparative example was used, and it was confirmed that the manufacturing efficiency of the nanoparticles could be remarkably improved.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">As explained above, in each of the embodiments, the fundamental structure of the present invention is to adjust the incident angle of the laser light so that the liquid or slurry rebounded by the laser light irradiation to the liquid or slurry may not adhere to the optical components such as the focusing lens, the reflecting mirror, the window body.<br/>
That is, an essential requirement for the present invention is that at least the laser light is irradiated to the liquid surface at an incident angle other than vertical angle (right angle). In this regard, although the incident angle becomes different in accordance with a type of embodiment, if the degree of incident angle of the laser light to with respect to the liquid surface is indicated by "θ ", the θ can be arbitrarily selected from a range specified by a relation formula: <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mn mathvariant="normal">0</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">°</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">θ</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">90</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">° or</mi><mspace width="2em"/><mn mathvariant="normal">90</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">°</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">θ</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">180</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">°</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">.</mn></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="75" he="4" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
Moreover, the incident angle of the laser light with respect to the liquid surface may appropriately change during the operation of the laser ablation.<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --></p><heading id="h0011">Industrial Applicability</heading><p id="p0068" num="0068">According to the liquid-phase laser ablation apparatus and the liquid-phase laser ablation method of the present invention, when the laser light is irradiated to the target arranged in the liquid and the target containing the component to be atomized, or the slurry in which the particles of the component to be atomized are dispersed, the laser light can be irradiated to the liquid at an incident angle other than vertical angle (right angle).<br/>
In addition, also the upper surface of the vessel is covered with the cover body (lid), the liquid or the slurry rebounded by the irradiation of the laser light would not adhere to the optical components such as the focusing lens or the reflecting mirror. Therefore, the absorption, scattering, reflection or the like of the laser light would not take place at all. In addition, a contamination by segments exfoliated from the optical components can be eliminated.<br/>
Moreover, since the liquid or the slurry rebounded by the irradiation of the laser light would not adhere to an optical system, the irradiating conditions of the laser light would not be varied or changed, and it becomes possible to continuously perform the laser ablation in a stable state, and the finely atomized particles can be efficiently generated.<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --></p><heading id="h0012">Reference Signs List</heading><p id="p0069" num="0069">11 ... vessel (cell), 12... upper cover (cover body, lid), 13 ... laser light introduction port, 14... window body (laser light introduction window), 15 ... laser light introduction pipe, 16... penetration hole, 21 ... laser oscillation device, 22 ... reflecting mirror, 23... focusing lens (collecting lens), 24 ... liquid, 31 ... liquid (or slurry in which particles are dispersed), 32... target, L-- laser light.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977254" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A liquid phase laser ablation apparatus comprising:
