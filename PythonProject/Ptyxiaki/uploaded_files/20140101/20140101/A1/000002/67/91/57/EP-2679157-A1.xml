Such a stereoscopically viewable image (hereinafter, stereoscopic image or stereo image) is generated based on a plurality of images having a parallax obtained by imaging the same subject from different directions.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The generation of such stereoscopic images is performed not only in the fields of digital cameras and televisions but also in the field of radiation image capturing. That is, it is practiced that a plurality of radiation images having a parallax is obtained by applying radiation to a subject from different directions and detecting radiation transmitted through the subject with respect to each direction using a radiation image detector, and a stereoscopic image is generated based on these radiation images. The generation of the stereoscopic image in the manner described above allows a radiation image having a sense of depth to be observed, that is, it is possible to observe a radiation image more suitable for diagnosis. As one of radiation image capturing apparatuses that generates such stereoscopic images, a mammography apparatus is proposed.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0003">[Prior Art Documents]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Patent Documents]</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2006231054A"><text>2006-231054</text></patcit>.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Disclosure of Invention</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In a mammography apparatus for capturing a breast image, radiation is applied from a radiation source unit installed above the subject to a breast of the subject. Here, in order to prevent radiation emitted from the radiation source unit from being applied to the face of the subject, for example, a face guard is provided against the radiation source unit.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is often the case that the subject forced to have an uncomfortable body posture with a breast being fixed barely maintains a stable body posture by tightly pressing the head of the subject against the face guard.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the mammography apparatus that captures a stereoscopic image by applying radiation from different image capturing directions as described above, however, it is necessary to move the radiation source unit in a left-right direction viewed from the subject. This will cause the face guard to be moved to a position away from the face position of the subject along with the movement of the radiation source unit, so that the subject is unable to maintain the body posture and may result in an unstable dangerous state.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Consequently, Patent Document 1 proposes the provision of a drive means for moving the face guard in a direction opposite to the moving direction of the radiation source unit so that the face guard remains at the face position of the subject. As for the drive means, for example, an electric roller for sliding the face guard, an electric gear, or the like are proposed.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is undesirable that the face guard is configured to be invariably moved along with the movement of the radiation source unit as in the apparatus described in Patent Document 1. Because, if that is the case, the face guard is moved unnecessarily, for example, at the time of maintenance or calibration in which no radiation image<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> capturing is performed, thereby disturbing the maintenance or calibration, as well as being undesirable from the viewpoint of durability.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Further, an electric roller or gear is used for making the face guard movable in Patent Document 1, but a more simple mechanism for making the face guard movable is desirable from the viewpoint of cost.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In view of the circumstances described above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a breast image capturing apparatus provided with a face guard capable of stabilizing the body posture of a subject by maintaining the position of the face guard at the face position of the subject and improving user-friendliness and durability by a simple arrangement and without moving the face guard unnecessarily.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A breast image capturing apparatus of the present invention is a breast image capturing apparatus, including a radiation application section which includes an arm section for moving a radiation source in a left-right direction in front of a subject and applies radiation to a breast of the subject from different image capturing directions above the breast through the movement of the radiation source by the arm section, and a radiation image detector that detects a radiation image generated through the application of radiation by the radiation application section with respect to each of the image capturing directions, wherein:

This allows the position of the shielding member to be maintained at the face position of the subject when the face of the subject is abutted to the shielding member, i.e., while radiation image capturing is performed, whereby the body posture of the subject may be stabilized.

The face guard 21 is a plate-like guard formed using a lead or copper member that absorbs radiation and radiation image capturing is performed with the face of the subject M being pressed against the face guard 21. By pressing the face of the subject M against the face guard 21, the subject M is prevented from being exposed to radiation as described above and the body posture of the subject M may be stabilized. As for the material of the face guard 21, lead-containing glass and resin (acrylic resin) may be used.
