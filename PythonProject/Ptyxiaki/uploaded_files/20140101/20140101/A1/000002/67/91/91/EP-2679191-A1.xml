More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a connector assembly configured for use with electrosurgical cables that utilize a double helix wound electrical connector configuration.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Description of Related Art</u></b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Electrosurgery involves application of high radio frequency current to a surgical site to cut, ablate, seal, coagulate or desiccate tissue. An electrosurgical generator, typically, delivers radio frequency energy to one or more active electrodes of an electrosurgical instrument. The electrosurgical instrument may be configured to function in various modalities, e.g., bipolar or monopolar modes.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Various types of electrosurgical cables may be utilized to transmit the electrosurgical energy from the electrosurgical generator to the electrosurgical instrument. Due to the radiative nature of RF energy, stray electrosurgical RF energy is emitted outside the transmission path of certain types of electrosurgical cables, which may reduce treatment energy. Moreover, electrical fields associated with the stray electrosurgical RF energy may interfere with the operation of other electronic equipment in the operational theatre, e.g., patient monitoring equipment in the surgical environment.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In order to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings associated with certain types of electrosurgical cables, electrosurgical cables have been developed which utilize a double<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> helix wound electrical connector configuration. Present day connector assemblies, however, currently provide connection solutions for IDC ribbon cables, solder-cup D-subminiature cables, crimp style plastic connectors and surface mount PCB connectors (e.g., right and straight angle PCB connectors) and are not, typically, suitable for use with electrosurgical cables that utilize double helix wound electrical connector configuration. That is, the integrity of the double helix configuration of an electrosurgical cable is compromised when these types of connectors are utilized to connect the electrosurgical cable to the electrosurgical generator and/or electrosurgical instrument.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>SUMMARY</u></b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In view of the foregoing, a connector assembly configured for use with electrosurgical cables that utilize a double helix wound electrical connector configuration may prove advantageous in the medical arts.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Embodiments of the present disclosure are described in detail with reference to the drawing figures wherein like reference numerals identify similar or identical elements.

Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present disclosure in virtually any appropriately detailed structure.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In accordance with the instant disclosure, a connector assembly configured for use with electrosurgical cables that utilize a helical configuration is provided. The connector assembly is configured to interchangeably couple to an electrosurgical cable for coupling the electrosurgical cable to an electrosurgical energy source and/or one or more types of electrosurgical instruments.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> shows an electrosurgical system 2 according to the present disclosure. The system 2 is a bipolar electrosurgical system that includes an electrosurgical forceps 4. Forceps 4 generally includes a housing 6, a shaft 16 a handle assembly 8, a rotating assembly 10 and a trigger assembly 12, which mutually cooperate with an end effector assembly 14 to grasp and treat tissue. Shaft 16 includes a distal end 18 that mechanically engages end effector assembly 14 and a proximal end 20 that mechanically engages housing 6 proximate the rotating assembly 10. Handle assembly 8 includes a fixed handle 22 and a movable handle 24. End effector assembly 14 includes jaw members 26, 28 movable from a first position wherein the jaw members 26, 28<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> are spaced relative to one another to a closed position wherein the jaw members 26 and 28 cooperate to grasp tissue therebetween. Each of the jaw members 26, 28 includes an electrically conductive sealing plate 30, 32 connected to an energy source (e.g., a generator 34) that communicates electrosurgical energy through tissue held between jaw members 26, 28. Electrosurgical RF energy is supplied to the forceps 4 by generator 34 via an electrosurgical cable 36 having a supply line 38 operatively connected to an active electrode (not explicitly shown) and returned through the return line 40 operatively connected to the return electrode (not explicitly shown). Cable 36 couples to a proximal end 7 of a housing 6 via a connector assembly 42 that couples to cable 36. In particular, one or more mechanical interfaces (e.g., keying structure 9, threads, or the like) are provided at proximal end 7 and are configured to selectively engage one or more corresponding mechanical interfaces on connector assembly 42, described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> shows a schematic block diagram of generator 34. Briefly, generator 34 includes a controller 44, a high voltage power supply 46 ("HVPS 46") and an RF output stage 48. HVPS 46 provides DC power to the RF output stage 48, which then converts DC power into RF energy and delivers the RF energy to forceps 4 to electrosurgically treat tissue, e.g., coagulate, cut, seal or ablate tissue. Controller 44 includes a microprocessor 50 operatively connected to a memory 52 which may be volatile type memory (e.g., RAM) and/or non-volatile type memory (e.g., flash media, disk media, etc.).</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">One or more mechanical interfaces (e.g., a keying structure 33, threads, or the like) are provided on an outside of the generator 34 and are configured to selectively couple to connector assembly 42 (<figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">Figs. 1-2</figref>). In the illustrated embodiment, keying structure 33 is provided on an outside of electrosurgical generator 34 and is configured to selectively engage a<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> corresponding keying tract 43 (<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>) on connector assembly 42, described in more detail below. Alternatively, or in addition thereto, the mechanical interface(s) on generator 34 may be in the form of or may include a plurality of threads (not explicitly shown) that are configured to engage a corresponding plurality of threads 45 on connector assembly 42, see <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> for example.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of cable 36. Cable 36 includes a plurality of electrical conductors in the form of supply and return lines 38, 40. Supply and return lines 38, 40 may be peripherally insulated via one or more suitable types of insulating materials, e.g., a removable plastic sheathing (not explicitly shown). In accordance with the instant disclosure, supply and return lines 38, 40 are helix wound and may be of any length depending on geometric configuration and physical properties (e.g., tensile strength, flexibility, etc.) of materials used in manufacturing of cable components. Supply and return lines 38, 40 are oriented in a double helix that includes two congruent helixes with the same axis, differing by an angular translation of at least but not limited to 180 degrees along the axis. Supply and return lines 38, 40 may be oriented in a plurality of other arrangements which wrap the lines 38, 40 around themselves. The arrangement of the lines 38, 40 in this double helix configuration orients the opposing electrical fields generated by the electrosurgical RF energy passing therethrough to mitigate and/or cancel out thereby minimizing the amount of stray electrical RF energy. Supply and return lines 38, 40 are wound within the cable 36 around a dielectric insulator 54, which provides support for the supply and return lines 38, 40 and an insulative sheath 56 that covers supply and return lines 38, 40. Insulator 54 and the sheath 56 may be formed from the same type of material. In the illustrated embodiment, sheath 56 may be pulled back (or a portion thereof may be removable) to expose supply and return lines 38, 40 to facilitate coupling cable 36 to connector assembly 42.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> Likewise, the sheathing that covers supply and return lines 38, 40 may be configured to be pulled back or removed.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In accordance with the instant disclosure, cable 36 provides a transmission medium to deliver RF energy from generator 34 to a tissue site. Cable 36 orients supply and return lines 38, 40 so that the electrical fields generated therethrough are canceled, thereby reducing the amount of leaked stray RF energy. More specifically, placement and the physical geometric orientation of supply and return lines 38, 40 in the double helix configuration provides for reduced RF leakage by the electrical field coupling generated during transmission of electrosurgical RF energy and maximizes the amount of energy delivered to the treatment site. Other positive attributes associated with placement and orientation of supply and return lines 38, 40 in the double helix configuration may include, but are not limited to: increased safety in the operating theatre due to reduced stray energy; decreased capacitive and RF field leakage, which, in turn may improve RF control of the delivered energy; decreased RF transmission loss, which, in turn, may improve efficiency of the generator 36; and decreased RF noise to additional equipment found in (or adjacent) the surgical theatre, such as patient monitoring equipment.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, connector assembly 42 is illustrated.
