61/463,850, filed on February 23, 2011, and U.S. Application No. 61/574,270, filed on July 30, 201 1. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005">TECHNICAL FIELD </p><p id="p0006" num="0006"> This disclosure generally relates to nucleic acid sequencing systems and methods and compositions that can be used in such systems and methods. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">BACKGROUND </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> Several techniques are currently available for detection and typing of bacterial and viral pathogens. This includes methods employing: </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> 1 ) indirect determination of genetic sequence including species/strain-specific PCR, repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR), pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and optical DNA mapping, </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> 2) direct determination of the sequence by either multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) or whole bacterial genome sequencing, or </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> 3) a combination of the above such as determination of the base composition of PCR products by mass spectrometry. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> The first group of techniques (Cepheid, PathoGenetix, Inc., OpGen, Inc.) has lower resolution and discrimination power compared to the second group of techniques and is limited by the small number of conserved genomic regions interrogated. The techniques in the second group, however, have been prohibitively expensive and provide only low throughput, although, with the introduction of 2<sup>nd</sup> (SOLiD and PGM by Life </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Technologies/Ion Torrent, Illumina, Roche 454, Complete Genomics) and 3<sup>rd</sup> (Pacific Biosciences, Helicos) generation high throughput sequencing techniques, the per sample cost is trending below $ 10,000. Moreover, the currently available sequencing technologies suffer from either complex sample preparation and DNA cluster generation (SOLiD and lonTorrent 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 by Life Technologies, Roche 454, Complete Genomics, lllumina), short read length (Helicos, SOLiD, lllumina), or high error rate (Pacific Biosciences). Additionally, the currently available single-molecule sequencing instruments (Pacific Biosciences and Helicos) are bulky, very expensive, and require highly trained personnel to operate. The third group of techniques (Ibis Biosciences Inc.) is able to determine the nucleotide composition of only relatively short sequences of PCR products and suffers from all limitations of conventional PCR. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> In contrast to currently available single molecule technologies (Helicos, Pacific Biosciences), the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing described herein does not require development of mutant polymerases capable of incorporating modified nucleotides, expensive labeled nucleotides, or lasers and costly high-speed cameras. Thus, the rotation- dependent transcriptional sequencing described herein can be integrated into inexpensive portable point-of-care systems. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"> In addition, the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing described herein allows for ultimate flexibility and fast reconfiguration; permitting rapid response to unforeseen endemic threats, emerging diseases, pandemics and new bioterror threats by simply updating the platform-associated nucleic acid database and software without any change of the reagents. This is in contrast to numerous diagnostic platforms exploiting PCR, where significant time is required for assay reconfiguration and validation before platform redeployment to address any new targets. This is also in contrast to non-sequencing single- molecule Genome Sequence Scanning platform using Direct Linear Analysis (DLA) technology (PathoGenetiX), which relies upon a spatial pattern of tags separated by at least 3 kb and makes this technology insensitive to sub-kb insertions or deletions as well as single- nucleotide variances. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> Furthermore, the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing described herein allows for ultimate multiplexing capability. While PCR- and microarray-based methods are limited by the detection of only known infectious agent(s) and cannot identify variants that are mutated or bioengineered (i.e. with a single nucleotide difference), the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing described herein is, in a sense, "target agnostic," as the methods decode primary structure of any and all DNA molecules in or extracted from the specimen, and, thus, is capable of detecting and identifying thousands of known or unknown (e.g., 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 genetically-modified) targets simultaneously. Such an inherited "broadband" multiplexing capability provided by the systems and methods described herein is in contrast to approaches employing PCR that require specific sets of reagents (primers and probes) for detection of each pathogen. Additionally, PCR-based technologies are limited by the number of assays allowed in multiplexed reactions simply due to the nature of PCR, or by the need to split the sample (i.e., containing the target nucleic acids) between multiple reactions, thereby compromising the sensitivity of detection and the accuracy of quantification. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017">SUMMARY </p><p id="p0018" num="0018"> Rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing relies upon the RNA polymerase being immobilized relative to the solid surface. As a consequence of transcription, the RNA polymerase exerts torque on the nucleic acid, which, in turn, manifests itself as rotation of a tag attached to the nucleic acid. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019"> In one aspect, a method of determining the sequence of a target nucleic acid molecule is provided.

 DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS </p><p id="p0039" num="0039"> Figure 1 shows an embodiment of a single-molecule rotation-dependent </p><p id="p0040" num="0040">transcriptional sequencing complex (Figure 1 A) and an embodiment of on-chip (Figure I B) rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing complexes, as described herein. </p><p id="p0041" num="0041"> Figure 2 A is an image of magnetic rotation tags using a 20x water objective. In this image, the FOV is limited by the detector and not by the objective. In this image, the magnetic rotation tags have a diameter of 2.7 microns. Figure 2B is an image of magnetic rotation tags under tension (here, in the presence of a magnetic force), which shows, compared to Figure 2A, that the magnetic rotation tags have moved "upwards" due to application of the magnet. The double-images are created due to the presence of two light sources illuminating the rotation tag from above at two different angles. Therefore, when rotation tags move out of the focal plane, the two "shadows" separate. This method can be used to determine how uniform the tension is in the plane of the sample and in different z- axis locations out of the plane. The rotation tags that are still in-focus in Figure 2B are likely clumped on the solid surface. Figure 2C is a photograph of an array of rotation tags tethered by His-tagged RNA polymerase and a 5.1 Kb DNA template on a passivated solid surface. </p><p id="p0042" num="0042"> Figure 3 are graphs showing two modes of nucleic acid sequencing described herein: Panel A shows an asynchronous, real-time "nucleotide pattern" sequencing strategy, where a limited concentration of a single nucleoside triphosphate (guanine (G) in this Panel) causes the polymerase to pause when incorporating G nucleotides into the nascent strand. Panel B shows a synchronous sequencing strategy, where a "base-by-base" introduction of nucleoside triphosphates results in a continuous decoding of the nucleotide sequence. </p><p id="p0043" num="0043"> Figure 4 are graphs from four different flow cells, each having a different nucleoside triphosphate present in a limiting amount. The bottom panel shows the nucleic acid sequence compiled from the four flow cells. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044"> Figure 5 is a schematic showing one embodiment of a flow cell as described herein. For example, a flow cells can include a laser-cut Pressure Sensitive Adhesive (PSA) film of approximately 50 micron thickness laid on top of an Omni Vision sensor (OV 14810; after removal of the window and coating with SiN). This configuration results in a flow cell on top of a CMOS chip. A glass or polymeric slide, having holes for microfluidic feed-through tubes, is then applied.

 Figure 6A is a photograph and Figure 6B is a line drawing showing a prototypical solid surface in which fibers are used to deliver light and a microscope objective is used for imaging. A solid surface slide containing rotation-tagged nucleic acids and RNA </p><p id="p0045" num="0045">polymerases is shown positioned below the fibers and above the objective. </p><p id="p0046" num="0046"> Figure 7 shows one embodiment of a rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing system as described herein. The schematic shows a tension source, a source of illumination, and four flow cells on top of solid surface chips with in- and out-fluidics. </p><p id="p0047" num="0047"> Figure 8A is a photograph and Figure 8B is a line drawing showing one embodiment of a rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing system. This embodiment uses a 20x water-objective, "super-lens" from Olympus that provides more than 1 mm FOV with A = 0.9, which is high resolution with a large field of view. The solid surface, light delivery and tension source (e.g., a magnet) are also shown. </p><p id="p0048" num="0048"> Figure 9A is a photograph and Figure 9B is a line drawing showing another embodiment of a rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing system. In this embodiment, a compact optical system is shown with an AF optical resolution target , illumination fibers, a 20x Mitutoyo objective, tube lens and camera. A disk magnet is also visible above the target but out of the way for this image. For 1 micron resolution at objective space, one or more cameras having a pixel size greater than 20 micron can be used. </p><p id="p0049" num="0049"> Figure 10 shows that rotation of a rotation tag (e.g., a doublet comprising a first tag and a second tag) can be detected even when using low resolution (i.e. 10 x 10 pixels per bead imaged through an objective or via the on-chip method). Further reduction to 5 x 5 pixels is possible using more advanced algorithms. Furthermore, if a tapered bundle is used, then the resolution increases for each bead that is located on top of the bundle cores by a factor related to the size of the cores and the size of each pixel at the other side of the bundle, as well as the number of pixels on the detector the cores span. </p><p id="p0050" num="0050"> Figure 1 1 A is a flow diagram illustrating an example analysis of the rotational pattern of a rotation tag, and Figure 1 I B is a flow diagram illustrating an example process for determining the sequence of a target nucleic acid molecule. </p><p id="p0051" num="0051"> Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION </p><p id="p0052" num="0052"> The present disclosure describes a single molecule sequencing system in which many of the constraints of existing single molecule system are relaxed, including complexity, cost, scalability and, ultimately, longer read lengths, higher throughput and enhanced accuracy. The real time, single molecule sequencing method and system described herein can sequence thousands of nucleotides in a very short time with high accuracy due to highly processive transcriptional machinery and simple optical and imaging systems. </p><p id="p0053" num="0053"> The advantages of the present system are numerous. For example, double stranded nucleic acid is used as the template, which minimizes and limits the requirements for sample preparation. In addition, labeled nucleotides are not required, since very simple imaging methods can be used (e.g., CMOS), which significantly reduces the cost. Also, wild type RNA polymerase enzymes can be used; no special modifications to the enzyme are necessary, and the surface chemistry and enzyme immobilization technologies are routine. The present systems and methods are suitable for homopolymeric sequences, since rotation is the same for each nucleotide and, thus, is cumulative over multiple nucleotides. The present systems and methods also are readily adaptable for high throughput sequencing. </p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Overview of Rotation-Dependent Transcriptional Sequencing </p><p id="p0055" num="0055"> Rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing relies upon transcription of target nucleic acid molecules by RNA polymerase. The RNA polymerase is immobilized on a solid surface, and a rotation tag is bound to the target nucleic acid molecules. During </p><p id="p0056" num="0056">transcription, RNA polymerase establishes a transcription bubble in the template nucleic acid that contains within it an RNA : DNA hybrid of approximately 8 bases. As the RNA polymerase advances along the double-stranded nucleic acid template, it must unwind the helix at the leading edge of the bubble and reanneal the strands at the trailing edge. The torque produced as a result of the unwinding of the double-stranded helix results in rotation of the template nucleic acid relative to the RNA polymerase of about 36° per nucleotide incorporated. Therefore, when the RNA polymerase is immobilized on a solid surface and a rotation tag is attached to the template nucleic acid, the rotation of the template nucleic acid can be observed and is indicative of transcriptional activity (i.e., incorporation of a nucleoside triphosphate) by the enzyme. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="13"/>-->
 As described herein, the sequence of target nucleic acid molecules are determined or obtained based upon changes in the rotational pattern of a rotation tag. Also as described herein, detecting the presence or absence of rotation of the nucleic acid can be done, for example, using illumination of the rotation tag bound to the target nucleic acid molecules. The rotational sequencing methods described herein can be scaled up for whole genome sequencing using an array of RNA polymerase enzymes and any number of routine imaging methods suitable for capturing the rotation of the rotation tag. </p><p id="p0057" num="0057"> Figure 1 shows a single-molecule sequencing embodiment (Figure 1A) and an on- chip array embodiment (Figure I B) of the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing complex described herein. The rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing complex described herein can be used to determine the sequence of a target nucleic acid molecule 10. In some embodiments, RNA polymerase 20, immobilized on a solid surface 30 or on a chip 80, is contacted with a target nucleic acid molecule 10 (i.e., a nucleic acid molecule having an unknown sequence). According to the methods described herein, the target nucleic acid molecule 10 includes a rotation tag 40. Under particular sequencing conditions, which include the presence of at least one nucleoside triphosphate, changes in the movement and/or velocity of the rotation tag 40 create a rotational pattern. These steps are repeated multiple times, and the sequence of the target nucleic acid is determined based, sequentially, on the presence or absence of a change in the rotational pattern under the particular sequencing conditions. These features are discussed in more detail below. </p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Solid Surface </p><p id="p0059" num="0059"> For the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing described herein, an RNA polymerase is immobilized on a solid surface. In the embodiments described herein, a solid surface typically is made from a silica-based glass (e.g., borosilicate glass, fused silica, or quartz). Solid surface materials for single molecule imaging are well known and routinely used in the art, and the same solid surface materials used for single molecule imaging also can be used in an array format. However, other materials (e.g., polypropylene, polystyrene, silicon, silicon nitride, and other polymers or composites thereof) also can be used provided they are suitable for use in the sequencing described herein. Figure I B shows an "on-chip" embodiment, where the solid surface 30 also includes the detection system. These types of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="14"/>-->
 solid surfaces (e.g., CMOS and CCD) are also known in the art and are discussed in more detail below. </p><p id="p0060" num="0060"> Before immobilizing one or more biological molecules into a solid surface, the solid surface generally is modified (e.g., functionalized) to receive and bind the biological molecules. Methods of functionalizing solid surfaces for immobilizing biological enzymes are known in the art. In some embodiments, the solid surface can be functionalized with copper or nickel, while in some embodiments, the solid surface can be functionalized with Ni-NTA (see, for example, Paik et al., 2005, Chem. Commun. (Camb), 15: 1956-8) or Cu- NTA. Alternatively, metals such as cobalt or the like can be used to modify a solid surface for immobilization. </p><p id="p0061" num="0061"> Prior to modifying a solid surface, the solid surface can be treated with, for example, PEG moieties. Such strategies can be used to regulate the density of RNA polymerases on a solid surface, and also can be used to generate a pattern of RNA polymerases on the solid surface, such as a uniform, a semi-ordered or a random array of RNA polymerases. The PEG environment results in minimal interactions between the enzyme and the surface (except for the binding tag on the N- or C-terminus), and ultimately results in minimal disturbance to the native conformation of the immobilized enzyme. In addition, surface passivation methods are known in the art and can include, for example, treating the solid surface with bovine serum albumin (BSA). </p><p id="p0062" num="0062">RNA Polymerase </p><p id="p0063" num="0063"> The rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing methods described herein are based on the action of RNA polymerase during the process of transcription and the rotational force produced on the transcribed nucleic acid (see, for example, US 2007/0077575). While multi-subunit RNA polymerases (e.g., E. coli or other prokaryotic RNA polymerase or one of the eukaryotic RNA polymerases) can be used in the sequencing methods described herein, the small, single-subunit RNA polymerases such as those from bacteriophage are particularly suitable. Single subunit RNA polymerases or the genes encoding such enzymes can be obtained from the T3, T7, SP6, or l 1 bacteriophages. </p><p id="p0064" num="0064"> The bacteriophage RNA polymerases are very processive and accurate compared to many of the multi-subunit RNA polymerases, and often produce fewer deletion-insertion 
<!-- EPO <DP n="15"/>-->
 errors. Additionally, RNA polymerases from bacteriophage are significantly less prone to back-tracking compared to multi-subunit counterparts such as the RNA polymerase from E. coli. RNA polymerase from several different bacteriophages has been described. Simply by way of example, the T7 RNA polymerase is made up of a single polypeptide having a molecular weight of 99 kDa, and the cloning and expression of the gene encoding T7 RNA polymerase is described in US Patent No. 5,693,489. The structure of T7 RNA polymerase has been resolved to a level of 3.3 Angstroms, with four different crystal structures having been solved: T7 RNA polymerase alone (uncomplexed), T7 RNA polymerase bound to a nucleic acid promoter, the entire initiation complex (T7 RNA polymerase bound to a nucleic acid promoter and one or more transcription factors), and T7 RNA polymerase bound by an inhibitor. </p><p id="p0065" num="0065"> RNA polymerases that are suitable for use in the methods described herein typically provide rotations of the nucleic acid having durations in the range of sub-microsecond to 100 milliseconds for every nucleotide incorporated into the transcript, but RNA polymerases that provide rotations having durations in the range of 100 milliseconds up to several seconds per nucleotide also can be used. It would be understood by those skilled in the art that, in order to produce the necessary rotation, the RNA polymerase must transcribe double-stranded nucleic acid. </p><p id="p0066" num="0066"> The density and/or distribution of RNA polymerases on a solid surface can be controlled or manipulated, for example, to optimize the particular sequencing reactions being performed. As is known in the art, an array of biological molecules can be generated in a pattern. For example, an array of biological molecules can be randomly distributed on the solid surface, uniformly distributed or distributed in an ordered or semi-ordered fashion. In some embodiments, a solid surface can have greater than 100 RNA polymerases, or greater than 1000 RNA polymerases (e.g., greater than 10,000 RNA polymerases) immobilized thereon. In some embodiments, a solid surface can have at least one RNA polymerase immobilized per ~5 μιη<sup>2</sup> (e.g., at least one RNA polymerase immobilized per -2.5 μιη<sup>2</sup>, ~1 μιη<sup>2</sup>, -0.5 μπι<sup>2</sup>, or -0.1 μιτ»<sup>2</sup>). It would be understood that the density of RNA polymerases on a solid surface may depend, at least, in part, upon the size of the target nucleic acid molecules being sequenced as well as the particular rotation tag utilized. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="16"/>-->
 While the sequencing methods described herein rely upon the rotation created during transcription by RNA polymerase, other molecular motors can be used in conjunction with RNA polymerase to create rotation. Molecular motors are biological molecules that consume energy, typically by hydrolysis of a nucleotide triphosphate, and convert it into motion or mechanical work. Examples of molecular motors include, without limitation, helicases, topoisomerases, DNA polymerases, myosin, ATPases and GTPases. In some embodiments, a molecular motor can be immobilized on a solid surface and transcription by RNA polymerase can occur at a position on the target nucleic acid molecule between the molecular motor and the rotation tag. In such instances, the rotational pattern would be a result of any rotational force placed on the nucleic acid molecule by the molecular motor combined with the rotational force placed on the nucleic acid molecule by the RNA polymerase. As an alternative to an enzymatic molecular motor, a solid state MEMS motor, for example, can be used, in conjunction with RNA polymerase, to generate rotation. </p><p id="p0067" num="0067"> RNA polymerase can be immobilized on a solid surface using any number of known means. For example, in one embodiment, the RNA polymerase contains a His-tag (e.g., His tags having 4 His residues, 6 His residues, or 10 His residues). A His-tag or other suitable tag can be used provided it is compatible with the surface chemistry (e.g., functionalization) discussed above. Target Nucleic Acid Molecules </p><p id="p0068" num="0068"> Nucleic acid molecules for rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing can be obtained from virtually any source including eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea. Eukaryotic nucleic acids can be from humans or other mammals (e.g., primates, horses, cattle, dogs, cats, and rodents) or non-mammals (e.g., birds, reptiles (e.g., snakes, turtles, alligators, etc.) and fish), while prokaryotic nucleic acids can be from bacteria (e.g., pathogenic bacteria such as, without limitation, Streptococcus, E. coli, Pseudomonas, and Salmonella) or Archaea (e.g.,</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Crenarchaeota, and Euryarchaeota). </p><p id="p0070" num="0070"> Nucleic acid molecules for rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing can be contained within any number of biological samples. Representative biological samples include, without limitation, fluids (e.g., blood, urine, semen) and tissues (e.g., organ, skin, mucous membrane, and tumor). 
<!-- EPO <DP n="17"/>-->
 As discussed herein, one of the advantages of the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing methods described herein is that double-stranded nucleic acid is used as the template. This reduces the need to manipulate the sample and the nucleic acid, which is a significant advantage, particularly when sequencing nucleic acids greater than 1 Kilobase (Kb; e.g., greater than 2 Kb, greater than 5 Kb, greater than 10 Kb, greater than 20 Kb, or greater than 50 Kb) in length, since many methods used to obtain nucleic acids from biological samples result in undesired cleavage, shearing or breakage of the nucleic acids. Obviously, single-stranded nucleic acids (or samples containing single-stranded nucleic acids) can be used in the present methods. However, such single-stranded nucleic acids must be converted into a double-stranded nucleic acid in order to exhibit rotation during transcription. Methods of making double-stranded nucleic acids are well known in the art and will depend upon the nature of the single-stranded nucleic acid (e.g., DNA or RNA). Such methods typically include the use of well known DNA polymerases and/or Reverse Transcriptase enzymes. </p><p id="p0071" num="0071"> Sample preparation will be dependent upon the source, but typically will include nucleic acid isolation followed by promoter ligation. Nucleic acid templates used in the sequencing methods described herein do not require any special preparation and, thus, standard DNA isolation methods can be used. Finally, a promoter sequence that is recognized by the particular RNA polymerase being used in the transcriptional sequencing system must be ligated to the target nucleic acid molecules. Promoter sequences recognized by a large number of RNA polymerases are known in the art and are widely used. In addition, methods of ligating one nucleic acid molecule (e.g., a promoter sequence) to another nucleic acid molecule (e.g., a target nucleic acid molecule having an unknown sequence) are well known in the art and a number of ligase enzymes are commercially available. </p><p id="p0072" num="0072"> In addition, isolated nucleic acids optionally can be fragmented and, if desired, particular sizes can be selected or fractionated. For example, isolated nucleic acids can be fragmented using ultrasonication and, if desired, size-selected using routine gel </p><p id="p0073" num="0073">electrophoresis methodology. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="18"/>-->
 In addition, the target nucleic acids optionally can be circularized into, for example, a plasmid, so that sequencing can be performed on a circular target in a repetitive or recursive fashion. Rotation Tags </p><p id="p0074" num="0074"> For the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing methods described herein, the target nucleic acid molecule being sequenced includes a rotation tag bound thereto. Such a tag is fixed to the nucleic acid such that it rotates under the torque imparted on the nucleic acid by the RNA polymerase. Rotation tags can be as large as many microns (e.g., greater than 1 micron, 2 microns, 3 microns or 5 microns) in diameter and as small as nanometers (e.g., about 50 nm, 100 nm, 250 nm, 500 nm, 750 nm, 850 nm, or 950 nm) in diameter. As used herein, a rotation tag can be non-spherical or spherical; however, if the rotation tag is a single sphere, it must have some non-uniform feature that can be used to detect rotation. </p><p id="p0075" num="0075"> A non-spherical tag can include a single moiety that is not a sphere (e.g., a tapered rod, triangular, conical, or egg-shaped). In addition, a non-spherical tag can be made using two (or more) different size spherical tags (e.g., a first tag attached to a second tag) that, together, provide an asymmetry that allows detecting of rotation. In some embodiments, the first and second tags can be the same or essentially the same size. For example, the first tag, tethered to the target nucleic acid molecule, can be considered the reference tag, while the second tag, attached to the first tag, can be considered the rotation tag. In some </p><p id="p0076" num="0076">embodiments, the first tag, tethered to the target nucleic acid molecule, is larger while the second tag, attached to the first tag, is smaller. This configuration places the second tag as far as possible from the point of rotation of the first tag, which enhances the resolution of the rotation under optical detection. Thus, the size of the smaller tag has to be large enough for detection purposes but small enough to minimize the hydrodynamic effects due to the size of the overall rotation tag. </p><p id="p0077" num="0077"> For example, in some embodiments, a rotation tag can include a larger bead (e.g., from about 1 micron up to about 3 microns in diameter) as a first tag and a smaller bead (e.g., from about 0.5 microns up to about 1 micron in diameter) as a second tag. For example, the larger bead can be 0.75 or 1 micron and the smaller bead can be 0.5 micron. These sizes are adequate to resolve rotation (using, as described in more detail below, for example, an optical 
<!-- EPO <DP n="19"/>-->
 system that includes a 50x magnification Mitutoyo objective with numerical Aperture of 0.75 in combination with a l x tube lens and a scientific CMOS camera of 6.5 micrometer pixel size or smaller). In some embodiments, a first tag can be 0.75 microns in diameter and a second tag can be 0.35 microns in diameter. These sizes also are adequate to resolve rotation (using, as described in more detail below, for example, a l OOx objective with a numerical aperture of 0.9 or higher using a scientific CMOS camera). </p><p id="p0078" num="0078"> An attachment between, e.g., a first tag and a second tag can be a mechanical tether or linkage (e.g., streptavidin-biotin bond), a chemical bond (e.g., amine or carboxy), a magnetic attraction, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, a first tag and a second tag can be physically attached to one another through, for example, a polymerization reaction. </p><p id="p0079" num="0079"> On the other hand, a rotation tag can be spherical provided that its rotation can be detected. The use of a rotation tag that is spherical reduces or eliminates the non-linear dynamics created by a non-spherical rotation tag, and a spherical rotation tag will exhibit lower hydrodynamic resistance during rotation than a non-spherical rotation tag. One example of a spherical tag having a non-uniform feature that can be used to detect rotation is a Janus bead. See, for example, Casagrande et al. (1989, Europhys. Lett. 9:251). A Janus bead refers to a spherical bead in which one hemisphere is hydrophobic and the other hemisphere is hydrophilic, due to a nickel coating on half of the sphere. The different features of the hemispheres allows for detecting rotation, even when the rotation tag is spherical. </p><p id="p0080" num="0080"> In some embodiments discussed herein, a rotation tag can be magnetic. Magnetic tags, spherical or non-spherical, are well known in the art and can be in the form of magnetic beads, rods, or other magnetic moieties such as, without limitation, superparamagnetic particles. The entire rotation tag can be magnetic, or only a portion of the rotation tag can be magnetic. For example, in some embodiments, only the first tag of a rotation tag can be magnetic. There are a number of commercial sources for magnetic tags. The following paragraphs describe a number of ways in which a magnetic rotation tag can be generated for use in the sequencing methods described herein. </p><p id="p0081" num="0081"> In some embodiments, a nanomagnetic solution (e.g., 1 % w/v in toluene or xylene with Cobalt, or Fe3o4 or FePt in toluene or xylene) can be applied to ordinary polymeric beads to make them magnetic. In some embodiments, the nanomagnetic materials can be 
<!-- EPO <DP n="20"/>-->
 applied to half of the surface of the polymer bead. This results in a magnetic bead whose halves exhibit a different index of refraction or other optical property (e.g., scattering). In some embodiments, superparamagnetic particles (or half of the particle) can be coated with nanosilver ink to create optically reflecting, yet fully superparamagnetic beads. In these embodiments, deposition and evaporation processes can be used with such "inks" (e.g., PRIMAXX) to impart particular optical properties on magnetic particles or portions of magnetic particles. In some embodiments, superparamagnetic particles (or half of the particle) can be coated with quantum dots to impart particular optical properties on particles that already are magnetic. In some embodiments, magnetochromic particles can be used as rotation tags. Within magnetochromic particles, nanomagnets form chains within polymers or encapsulated in Carbon shells. The chains of nanoparticles are aligned with respect to each other using an external magnetic or electromagnetic field. When light scatters from the particle, the aligned chains act as Bragg diffraction gratings and scatter light in appropriately defined directions. The magnetochromic particles rotate inside an external field such that intensity modulation can be monitored between the stopped particle with all chains aligned and the particle in rotation where the chains are not completely aligned to determine the rotation duration from a starting position to a resting or stopping position until the next rotation. </p><p id="p0082" num="0082"> In some embodiments, a first magnetic tag can be combined with a second tag that can induce an electric field change onto a detector. Such electric tags are known in the art and can be polymeric spheres that include metallic elements, are charged, or are micron-sized radiofrequency oscillators that induce a change in the magnetic or electric field, which can be captured on an instrument (described in more detail below). </p><p id="p0083" num="0083"> Simply to provide a spatial perspective and without being bound by any particular size or distance limitation, the bottom surface of a rotation tag, even when a 10 Kb nucleic acid molecule is being transcribed, still may only be 3 μιη from the top of the solid surface. That is, the rotation tag is very close to the solid surface even at the beginning of </p><p id="p0084" num="0084">transcription. At the end of transcription, the rotation tag could be nearly contacting the RNA polymerase enzyme, and so separated from the top of the solid surface by a very small distance. In other words, a rotation tag that has a diameter of 2 μηι will be approximately the same size as the nucleic acid molecule being transcribed. It would be understood by those in 
<!-- EPO <DP n="21"/>-->
 the art that transcription of the target nucleic acid molecules by RNA polymerase could proceed in the opposite direction, thereby moving the rotation tag farther away from the solid surface during transcription. </p><p id="p0085" num="0085"> Rotation tags can be attached to target nucleic acid molecules using tethers. Tethers to attach rotation tags to target nucleic acid molecules are known in the art and include, without limitation, a chemical linkage (e.g., crosslinking, van der Walls or hydrogen bond) or a protein linkage (e.g., biotin-streptavidin binding pairs, digoxigenin and a recognizing antibody, hydrazine bonding or His-tagging). For example, in some embodiments, a rotation tag can be coated, at least partially, with streptavidin, while a biotinylated nucleic acid tether can be ligated to the target nucleic acid molecules. In some embodiments, a biotin-labeled nucleic acid (e.g., about 500 base pairs (bp)) can be ligated to one end of the target nucleic acid molecules. The target nucleic acid molecules having the biotin-labeled tether then can be combined with streptavidin-coated rotation tags. There are a number of commercially available tags, including magnetic tags that are coated or partially coated with various chemistries that can be used to tether the target nucleic acid molecules and/or bind a second tag (e.g., Dynal, Invitrogen, Spherotech, Kisker Inc., Bangs Laboratories Inc.). </p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Tension on the Nucleic Acid Molecules </p><p id="p0087" num="0087"> In some embodiments, the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing methods described herein include applying a directional force on the target nucleic acid molecules, which results in the target nucleic acid molecules being placed under some amount of tension. Tension on the target nucleic acid molecules becomes important with longer target nucleic acid molecules, as longer nucleic acid molecules can fold-up or collapse on themselves. Any type of abnormal helical structure of the target nucleic acid molecules could dampen or mask the torque transferred from the RNA polymerase to the rotation tag. </p><p id="p0088" num="0088"> The directional force applied to the target nucleic acid molecules needs to be sufficient so as to maintain the double-stranded helical nature of the target nucleic acid molecule, particularly downstream of the transcription complex, and particularly when the rotation tag is thousands or hundreds of thousands of nucleotides away from the RNA polymerase. However, the directional force applied to the target nucleic acid molecules can't be so strong (i.e., apply so much tension) such that rotation of the rotation tag is impeded in 
<!-- EPO <DP n="22"/>-->
 any way or the backbone of the target nucleic acid molecule breaks. Such tension on the target nucleic acid molecules also can reduce the Brownian motion of the rotation tag or other noise effects (e.g., thermofiuidic noise effects), thereby increasing the accuracy of detecting the rotational pattern of the rotation tag. </p><p id="p0089" num="0089"> The tension is intended to elevate the nucleic acid-tethered rotation tag up and away from the surface in a prescribed amount of force and location in the three-dimensional space. The direction of the tension can extend the target nucleic acid in essentially a 90° angle (i.e., in the z-axis) relative to the plane of the solid surface (i.e., in the x-axis), but the directional force also can extend the target nucleic acid molecules in a direction that is more or less than 90° relative to the plane of the solid surface. It would be understood, however, that the rotation tag cannot be so near the solid surface that the surface (e.g., due to surface chemistry or surface fluidic phenomena) interferes with (e.g., changes, alters, dampens, reduces, eliminates) the torque profile and/or the pattern of movement of the rotation tag as a signal of RNA polymerase activity.^ </p><p id="p0090" num="0090"> In some embodiments, the tension source (or the source of the directional force) can be a magnet. In such cases, the rotation tag or a portion of the rotation tag can be magnetic. As indicated herein, magnetic tags (e.g., beads, rods, etc.) are well known in the art. For example, a magnetic force can be applied that provides a uniform spatial force in the direction of the z-axis at a magnitude of, for example, about 1 pN, to adequately stretch the target nucleic acid molecules and avoid any looping. At the same time, such magnets generate only a miniscule force in the direction of the x-axis. These features allow the rotation tags to freely rotate, while stabilizing any Brownian motion of the rotation tags. In some embodiments, the tension source can be a result of a directional flow of, for example, liquid (e.g., water or buffer) or air. </p><p id="p0091" num="0091"> The amount of tension applied to the target nucleic acid molecules can be calibrated using standard fluidic methodology and incorporated in data acquisition and analysis process or base calling algorithms. For example, such a calibration can include monitoring the Brownian motion of a rotation tag, attached to a nucleic acid molecule being transcribed by a RNA polymerase, which is immobilized on the surface, at various locations above the surface, at various angles relative to the plane of the surface, and/or in different flows or magnetic fields.

 Simply to provide a spatial perspective and without being bound by any particular size or distance limitation, in an on-chip embodiment, the rotation tag can be on the order of 1 micron above the surface when tension is applied. For example, since each base is separated by 0.3 nm from the next base, a one Kb nucleic acid molecule that is attached at- the surface to the RNA polymerase will have the rotation tag on the other end at a distance of about 300 nm from the surface. This distance can be varied using, without limitation, different immobilization methods of the RNA polymerase to the solid surface and nucleic acids (e.g., promoter sequences, tether sequences) of different lengths. The rotation- dependent transcriptional sequencing described herein can accommodate situations in which the rotation tag is from 10 nm to many microns from the surface. </p><p id="p0092" num="0092"> Figure 2 shows 2.7 micron magnetic beads before (Figure 2A) and after (Figure 2B) application of a magnetic field. </p><p id="p0093" num="0093">Detection Methods </p><p id="p0094" num="0094"> Detecting the rotational pattern of the rotation tag under various sequencing conditions in the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing methods described herein requires a light source, for projecting light onto the rotation tag, and optics, for visualizing the rotation tag and observing changes in the rotational pattern. While any number of suitable illumination methods and optics can be used in the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing methods described herein, the following embodiments are provided as examples of the simplicity of the present systems and methods and the lack of any requirement for complex and expensive technologies for the detection component. </p><p id="p0095" num="0095"> The light source can be LED, or the light source can be white light or single- or multi- fibers. The light source can be steady illumination or can be provided as pulsed illumination, if desired. The light can be projected from the same direction or from multiple directions.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">For example, the light source can be polymer fibers or bundles, which can be tunable (e.g., in intensity and/or spectrum). Fresnel and/or Fraunhoffer diffraction can be used, based on the size of the rotation tag and its distance from the detector, to identify the rotation tag (e.g., the shape of the rotation tag) and identify its rotation. </p><p id="p0097" num="0097"> The optics can be simple lenses and objectives (e.g., a microscope lens with a 50x objective, e.g., Mitutoyo 50x with numerical aperture of 0.75) and a tube lens with l x 
<!-- EPO <DP n="24"/>-->
 magnification. The optics also can include a camera (e.g., a video camera, e.g., a scientific CMOS) operating at appropriate frames per second. Alternatively, the optics can utilize current complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) or charge-coupled device (CCD) technology, provided they have an adequate number of pixels (and provided the light source provides sufficient photons to image the rotation of the rotation tag). Currently used CMOS detectors are very fast (e.g., 1000 or more frames per second, corresponding to exposures of 1 ms or less). This level of detector speed removes any ambiguity due to the stochastic nature of rapid nucleotide incorporation that plagues current approaches. For example, many current approaches (e.g., Pacific Biosciences, Complete Genomics, Inc.) are typically limited to exposures of 10 ms or longer, due to the need to collect an adequate number of fluorescent photons within the camera exposure window, which results in errors in the sequence data collected. </p><p id="p0098" num="0098"> The ability to use a small pixel size for the imaging detector is another advantage of the present methods compared to other sequencing technologies (e.g., Pacific Biosciences, Complete Genomics Inc., and others that rely upon single-molecule fluorescence or general fluorescence at high throughput image capture). The rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing described herein can use a small pixel size (e.g., 1.4 microns, which is the current state of the art for cell phone cameras), compared to the 6.5 microns, which is the state of the art for the CMOS sensors used in other real-time sequencing applications. This is primarily because the current sequencing methods can accommodate more noise than other systems. Significantly, in the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing described herein, the throughput of imaging can be much higher because of the ability to use large sensors having small pixels (e.g., 8 - 10 MPixels common in next-generation cell phones) and by imaging a larger area of the surface. The detection methods for the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing methods described herein allow for the use of commercial CMOS camera hardware with only modifications to the software, as opposed to other sequencing systems in the industry, which rely upon specialized optical platforms (e.g., ChemFet, Ion Torrent). </p><p id="p0099" num="0099"> The data acquisition method in video mode from these sensors typically uses the intensity value of each pixel (e.g., using RAW format data). When the light source is a white LED or an RGB illuminator with appropriate balancing between the colors, diffraction and shadow patterns of a rotation tag will be recorded in adjacent pixels and an image can be 
<!-- EPO <DP n="25"/>-->
 generated as if the sensor was a black and white sensor. For example, direct shadow or diffraction of, for example, a non-spherical rotation tag, can be recorded on the detector's pixels and rotation can be detected due to the changing effects on diffraction. </p><p id="p0100" num="0100"> Simply by way of example, detection of rotation (e.g., detection of the pattern of rotation by a rotation tag) can occur as follows. Rotation tags can be illuminated from above using, for example, an LED or fiber coupled - LED or LED array. Below the solid surface flow cell, a Mitutoyo 50x objective having a numerical aperture of 0.75 that is infinity corrected can be used in conjunction with a tube lens that images the field of view onto a scientific CMOS chip (e.g., having 5.5 MP, with a 6.5 micron center-to-center distance between pixels that are approximately 6.5 micron size each). Assigning 10 x 10 pixels to each rotation tag, such a pixel size is adequate to detect rotation of 1 micron beads, which, on the entire CMOS surface, can result in more than 55,000 rotation tags. If each rotation tag is attached to a 5 Kb target nucleic acid molecule, the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing described herein can sequence more than 275 Mbases in a single run on a single chip. By way of comparison, the E. coli genome is 4.5 Mbases. If the rate of transcription is 10 nucleotides per second, which is a reasonable number for immobilized RNA polymerase, the complete E. coli genome could be sequenced as described herein in 500 seconds, i.e. less than 10 minutes. A detector that has the ability to record up to 100 frames per second (i.e., 10 frames per each transcribed nucleotide) is sufficient for the sequencing systems and methods described herein. The calculations above do not include any efficiency of attachment. In addition, in an asynchromous pattern of sequencing, assuming the pause by RNA polymerase is less than 10 frames, it does not add any extra reaction time to the calculation above, however, the asynchronous pattern of sequencing could add time to the reaction if the rate-limiting nucleoside triphosphate is tuned to much lower levels (e.g., to increase accuracy and minimize deletion errors). </p><p id="p0101" num="0101"> Another example of detecting the rotational pattern of the rotation tag follows. </p><p id="p0102" num="0102">Rotation tags can be illuminated using an LED or fiber coupled - LED or LED array, where the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing complexes are placed on top of a tapered waveguide having a 350 nm core size on one side and a 6.5 micron core size on the other (about a 1 : 19 taper), which can be bonded to the surface of a scientific CMOS chip (e.g., Fairchild Imaging). Such a chip has 5.5 MPixels with 6.5 micron center-to-center distance 
<!-- EPO <DP n="26"/>-->
 between pixels that are each approximately 6.5 microns. In this case, assigning 3 x 3 pixels to each rotation tag, which is adequate to detect rotation of a 1 micron bead on top of the 350 nm cores, allows for more than 610,000 rotation tags on such a chip. If each rotation tag is attached to a 5 Kb target nucleic acid molecule, a total of more than 3 Gbases can be sequenced in a single run on a single chip. This is essentially single coverage of the entire human genome. The calculations above do not take into account efficiencies of attachment, the rounding effects of the signal from the round cores of the taper to the square pixels, or the loss of pixels due to mismatch in the bonding process of core-to-pixel. </p><p id="p0103" num="0103"> The following is an example of detection of a rotational pattern in a high throughput sequencing system. For example, instead of using the tapered waveguide and scientific</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">CMOS sensor described in the above example, an OmniVision Inc. chip with, for example, 14.5 MP and 1.2 microns per pixel, can be used after having removed the detector window and attached one or more components of the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing complexes directly on the microlens array of the chip. The rotation pattern using 2.8 micron rotation tags can be detected on 2 x 2 pixels using signal processing of videos. Allowing for an extra 2 pixels in each direction for an array of rotation tags in proximity to each other, 8 pixels total can be assigned per rotation tag. In this case, a single chip can have more than 1.8 million rotation tags attached to target nucleic acid molecules being sequenced. </p><p id="p0105" num="0105">Therefore, three of these chips would be adequate to sequence the complete human genome, while four chips could significantly increase the accuracy. Electronics to produce a readout of this sensor in adequate speeds (e.g., to match the nucleotide incorporation rate for the specific chip) based on FPGA or other DSP designs and direct storage to arrays of solid state drives can be used and their components are known in the art. </p><p id="p0106" num="0106"> Simply by way of example, detection of rotation can occur as follows. LED structured illumination (e.g., Lightspeed genomics module adapted for speckle-free excitation with a 4x lens) can be used to create a diffractive shadow of a rotation tag on the surface of a SciCMOS camera (e.g., 5.5 MP at 100 frames per second). The interference pattern can exploit 5 frames per image in order to enhance resolution by 9x, effectively creating a 49 MP sensor at 20 fps. Each single molecule can be assigned, for example, to a 5 x 5 pixel, which allows for about 2 million rotation tags per chip. Assuming Poisson efficiencies at the tag-to-tag coupling, 660,000 available single RNA polymerase molecules

 each transcribing 5 Kb nucleic acid molecules results in 3.3 Gbases that can be sequenced in a single run. In the asynchronous sequencing method, four reactions can be performed (although, in some embodiments, three reactions are performed and the fourth nucleotide is inferred from the sequencing information obtained with the other three nucleoside triphosphates). Allowing for 5 frames per enzyme pause with a total of 250 ms at each pause, while the polymerase otherwise incorporates 15 nt per second, throughput is an extreme 18 Gb per hour. This sequencing rate is significantly higher than any current technologies, even for short read lengths. As indicated herein, current cell phone camera technology (10 MP, 1.2 μ ι pixel size) meets the requirements of this system. </p><p id="p0107" num="0107"> Similarly, color (e.g., with RGB filter coatings on the sensor) or monochrome cell phone or digital camera sensors meet the requirements for use in the sequencing methods and systems described herein (e.g., 14.5 MP and a 1.25 micron pixel sensor). Even though each pixel of an RGB sensor is coated with a red or green or blue filter in a pattern, those sensors can be used in the sequencing systems and methods described herein since the light source used in the sequencing systems and methods described herein can have a broad spectrum</p><p id="p0108" num="0108">(e.g. white LED(s)) and provide scattered, reflected, diffracted or transmitted optical signal to the detector portion of the camera chip (e.g. silicon). </p><p id="p0109" num="0109"> In this example, the number of pixels used to detect each rotation tag can be estimated by the shadow or diffraction of the rotation tag. When direct light illumination is used instead of fluorescence excitation, thick optical filters that block the excitation light and/or have fluorescence passbands are not necessary. These filters can be hundreds of microns thick, which can complicate the optical designs needed to collect the fluorescence on a small number of pixels on the on-chip detector. Collecting the light on a small number of pixels is important since one aspect of the throughput of sequencing systems is defined by the total number of pixels on the detector divided by the number of pixels assigned to each site or event. For example, with an i-Phone-style 8 MP CMOS sensor, assigning 10 pixels per site, allows for a total of 800,000 sites. If a 1 Kb nucleic acid, on average, is sequenced per run per site, then, at most, throughput is 800 MBases per run. Using Fraunhoffer diffraction and 3 micrometer beads at a distance of 1 micrometer, then less than 10 pixels per site can be used without the need for lenses having complicated optical designs.

 In one embodiment, a source of tension can be provided that allows for an array of rotation tags to be elevated from the surface to an area, for example, greater than 4 x 4 mm<sup>2</sup>. The present methods and systems are not limited by the field of view (FOV), particularly when the sequencing is performed on-chip, where the effective FOV is the entire area of the chip. For example, the surface area of the Omnivision 14 MP sensor is about 6 4 mm. </p><p id="p0110" num="0110"> As indicated herein, one of the many advantages provided by the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing methods described herein is the extremely fast nucleotide incorporation by RNA polymerases due to their stochastic nature.

It would be understood by those skilled in the art that, in the presently described asynchronous sequencing methods, for example, only the "end-point" information needs to be recorded, e.g., only the number of total rotations until a pause occurs. That is, there is no need to capture the individual incorporation steps, which may be very fast and difficult for a simple detector to image effectively. Therefore, as long as a sequencing reaction is recorded at a high enough frame rate to detect the total amount of rotations between pauses by the</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">RNA polymerase (due to the presence of a nucleoside triphosphate in a rate-limiting amount), an accurate nucleic acid sequence can be determined. </p><p id="p0113" num="0113"> In some embodiments, the rotational pattern of a magnetic rotation tag can be captured using a GMR (giant magneto-resistance) array as the sensor. In some embodiments, a spin-valve array or MRAM can be used to detect the rotational pattern of a magnetic rotation tag. For example, a computer memory array (e.g., RAM, e.g., DRAM) can be modified (e.g., polished to remove layers from the surface that may be shielding the magnetic field effects) to accept a surface modification close to the memory cell capacitive elements. The induced electric field of a magnetic rotation tag can be sensed by the two-dimensional array of cells/capacitors of the RAM. The cells of the RAM array then can be read directly using memory reading software following installation of the memory into a computer. In the case when MRAM is used as a sensor, flow can be used to provide a source of tension to the target nucleic acid without the use of a magnetic field. Alternatively, a magnetic field can be used as the source of tension in a field where the sensing signal of the MRAM cells is modified.

 Sequencing Conditions </p><p id="p0114" num="0114"> Referring again to Figure 1A, the rotation-dependent transcription complex 100 can be generated in a number of different fashions. For example, promoter-bound target nucleic acid molecules 10 can be provided to a solid surface 30 having RNA polymerase 20 immobilized thereon. In this embodiment, the rotation tag 40 can be bound to the target nucleic acid molecules 10 before or after the target nucleic acid molecules 10 are complexed with the immobilized RNA polymerase 20. In another example, the RNA polymerase 20 and the promoter-bound target nucleic acid molecules 10 can be combined and then deposited on the solid surface 30. As indicated, the rotation tag 40 can be bound to the promoter-bound target nucleic acid molecules 10 before or after the complex is deposited on the solid surface 30. In another example, rotation tags 40 can be attached to the promoter-bound target nucleic acid molecules 10 and contacted with RNA polymerase 20. The RNA polymerase 20 can be immobilized on a solid substrate 30 before introducing the rotation tagged-target nucleic acid molecules 10, or the entire complex can be deposited and immobilized on a solid substrate 30. </p><p id="p0115" num="0115"> The rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing described herein can be performed in an asynchronous (i.e., rate-limiting) mode (Figure 3A) or a synchronous (i.e., base-by- base) mode, or any combination thereof to determine the sequence of a target nucleic acid molecule (Figure 3B). At a minimum, "sequencing conditions," as used herein, refers to the presence of at least one nucleoside triphosphate, which can be used as described below to determine the sequence of a target nucleic acid molecule. </p><p id="p0116" num="0116"> In addition to the presence of at least one nucleoside triphosphate as discussed in more detail herein, conditions under which sequencing reactions are performed are well known in the art.

 triphosphates, where the nucleoside triphosphates are present in different amounts, at least one of which is rate-limiting and at least one of which is not rate-limiting. For example, one of the four nucleoside triphosphates is provided in a rate-limiting amount (e.g., in an amount that is less than the amount of the other three nucleoside triphosphates). In such a reaction, the RNA polymerase will effectively pause each time it tries to incorporate the nucleoside triphosphate provided in the rate-limiting amount into the transcript, and such a pause can be observed in the rotational pattern of the rotation tag as described herein. </p><p id="p0118" num="0118"> Significantly, the number of bases between each pause can be precisely determined by detecting the cumulative amount of rotation between pauses. Thus, the precise position of, for example, each guanine (G) nucleotide along the sequence of the target nucleic acid molecule can be concisely determined due to changes in the rotational pattern when the G nucleoside triphosphate is provided in rate-limiting amounts. Similar reactions can be performed under second, third and, if desired, fourth, sequencing conditions in which, respectively, the second, third, and fourth nucleoside triphosphate of the four nucleoside triphosphates is present in a rate-limiting amount. As shown in Figure 4, the combined information from the four reactions, whether they are performed simultaneously with one another or sequentially following one another, provide the complete sequence of the target nucleic acid molecule. </p><p id="p0119" num="0119"> The pattern, even from a single reaction resulting in the positional sequence of one of four nucleotides can be compared to nucleic acid databases and used to identify the nucleic acid molecule with a high level of confidence. In addition, it would be understood by those skilled in the art that the sequence of a target nucleic acid molecule could be compiled using the positional information produced from three of the four nucleoside triphosphates, as the positional information of the fourth nucleotide in the sequence can be inferred once the other three nucleotides are known. b) Synchronous or Base-bv-Base Sequencing </p><p id="p0120" num="0120"> The rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing method described herein can be used to sequence nucleic acids in a synchronous pattern, which otherwise might be known as base-by-base sequencing. For synchronous or base-by-base embodiments, the sequencing conditions under which the initial reaction occurs (i.e., first sequencing conditions) include 
<!-- EPO <DP n="31"/>-->
 the presence of a single nucleoside triphosphate. In such a reaction, transcription by the RNA polymerase will only proceed if the target nucleic acid contains the complementary base at that position, which can be observed as a change in the rotational pattern of the rotation tag as described herein. Based on the structural characteristics of the double-helix, incorporation of one nucleotide by RNA polymerase results in about a 36 rotation. Such reaction conditions are continued until the rotational pattern of the rotation tag does not change. It would be understood that the cumulative change in the rotational pattern can be used to precisely determine the number of times the first nucleoside triphosphate was sequentially incorporated into the transcript (e.g., in a homopolymeric region of the target nucleic acid molecule). </p><p id="p0121" num="0121"> When a change is no longer observed in the rotational pattern of the rotation tag under the first sequencing conditions (i.e., the presence of a first nucleoside triphosphate of the four nucleoside triphosphates), or if no changes in the rotational pattern are observed under the first sequencing conditions, a reaction is performed under second sequencing conditions. Second sequencing conditions include the presence of a second nucleoside triphosphate of the four nucleoside triphosphates. Changes in the rotational pattern of the rotation tag are indicative of transcription (i.e., the incorporation of one or more of the particular nucleoside triphosphate present into the transcript by the RNA polymerase), while the absence of a change in the rotational pattern of the rotation tag indicates that no transcription took place. </p><p id="p0122" num="0122"> Such reactions, under first sequencing conditions, second sequencing conditions, third sequencing conditions (i.e., the presence of a third nucleoside triphosphate of the four nucleoside triphosphates) or fourth sequencing conditions (i.e., the presence of a fourth nucleoside triphosphate of the four nucleoside triphosphates), can be carried out in such a manner that the sequence of the target nucleic acid molecule is sequentially determined based on the changes in the rotational pattern and/or cumulative angle of rotation of the rotation tag under each of the respective sequencing conditions. It would be understood by those skilled in the art that steps can be taken to remove the residual nucleoside triphosphates under one sequencing condition before introducing a different sequencing condition. For example, the surface on which the RNA polymerase is immobilized can be washed or flushed before introducing a different nucleoside triphosphate. While such washing steps are not required, it 
<!-- EPO <DP n="32"/>-->
 would be understood that such steps would increase the accuracy of the resulting sequence information. c) Additional Sequencing Methodologies </p><p id="p0123" num="0123"> The rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing methods described herein are amenable to a number of different variations and routine modifications, which can be utilized, for example, and without limitation, to increase the accuracy of the sequencing information and increase the amount of information obtained in a sequencing reaction. </p><p id="p0124" num="0124"> For example, many RNA polymerases possess a "strand-switching" or "turn-around transcription" ability. This feature can be advantageously used in the methods described herein to increase the accuracy of the resulting sequence information. For example, when RNA polymerase reaches the end of a target nucleic acid, the RNA polymerase can "jump" to the opposite strand and continue transcription. See, for example, McAllister at al. (US 2007/0077575) and Rong et al. (1998, "Template Strand Switching by T7 RNA Polymerase", J. BioL. Chem., 273(17): 10253-60). In addition, certain RNA polymerases can "jump" from the double-stranded DNA template to the hybrid DNA-RNA transcript and resume transcription of the DNA strand. In addition, this type of recursive sequencing of a target nucleic acid molecule can be genetically engineered by introducing (e.g., ligating) a RNA polymerase promoter onto each end of the target nucleic acid molecule, such that the RNA polymerase binds and transcribes the opposite strand. </p><p id="p0125" num="0125"> In addition, one or more different RNA polymerases (e.g., RNA polymerases from different organisms or different RNA polymerases from the same organism) can be immobilized onto a solid surface. As is known in the art, different RNA polymerases recognize and bind to different promoter sequences. Therefore, one or more different RNA polymerase promoters can be ligated to different populations of target nucleic acid molecules and a combined population of target nucleic acid molecules can be sequenced, based on the rotational pattern of the rotation tag, using the one or more different RNA polymerases immobilized on the solid surface. By differentially-labeling, for example, the different RNA polymerases or the different populations of target nucleic acid molecules (using, for example, beads emitting different wavelengths, fluorescent tags, or fluorescently-labeled antibodies), the sequence of one population of target nucleic acid molecules can be distinguished from the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="33"/>-->
 sequence of another population of target nucleic acid molecules. Using such methods, sequencing reactions on different populations of target nucleic acid molecules can take place simultaneously. </p><p id="p0126" num="0126"> In some embodiments, both the RNA polymerases and the populations of target nucleic acid molecules can be differentially labeled. It would be understood that labeling the target nucleic acid molecules can occur directly via the nucleic acid or, for example, via the rotation tag. This ability to differentially label at multiple levels of the sequencing reaction can be used, for example, to compare the processivity of different RNA polymerases on target nucleic acid molecule having the same sequence, which may identify, for example, homopolymeric regions or regions of methylation, or to compare the transcription of target nucleic acid molecules having different sequences by more than one RNA polymerase. </p><p id="p0127" num="0127"> Simply by way of example, any combination of RNA polymerase enzymes (e.g., from one or more of the T7, T3, SP6 or Kl 1 bacteriophages), in conjunction with the appropriate nucleic acid promoter sequences, can be used in the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing methods described herein. As discussed herein, this feature allows for a multiplexing of the sequencing reactions. Other variations that utilize different RNA polymerases in conjunction with their specific promoter sequences as well as differential- labeling techniques are contemplated herein. </p><p id="p0128" num="0128"> In some embodiments, two asynchronous rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing reactions can be performed under the same sequencing conditions (e.g., first sequencing conditions). Once sequencing has progressed for a sufficient number of nucleotides (e.g., at least 100 nt, 500 nt, 1,000 nt, 5,000 nt, or 10,000 nt), the sequencing conditions of one of the reactions can be changed (e.g., to second sequencing conditions), and the rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing continued. The resulting sequence information obtained under the first sequencing conditions can be used to align a particular target nucleic acid molecule in the first reaction with the same particular target nucleic acid molecule in the second reaction, which, when the sequencing conditions are changed, allows positional sequence information to be obtained for two nucleotides within a particular target nucleic acid molecule. </p><p id="p0129" num="0129"> Those skilled in the art would understand that, due to the torsion place on the nucleic acid molecules by the RNA polymerase, the rotation tag may produce a "load", possibly

 slowing down the RNA polymerase. This can be prevented or diminished, for example, by using a rotation tag having a different shape (e.g., two oblong beads or a bead-rod combination), which can result in more friction in the fluidic medium than a simple spherical bead. On the other hand, there may be RNA polymerases and/or sequencing conditions in which a mechanical loading of the RNA polymerase can be used to advantageously affect the rate of sequencing. </p><p id="p0130" num="0130">Articles of Manufacture / Kits </p><p id="p0131" num="0131"> Articles of manufacture (e.g., kits) are provided herein.

Both Figures 8 and 9 also include a camera 200. </p><p id="p0147" num="0147"> In one embodiment, structured illumination and stroboscopy can be used in a rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing system as follows. For example, two or more fibers each can be coupled to a separate LED and their illumination directed in different

 angles with respect to the plane of the solid surface. The light sources can be independently controlled in light intensity (or "amplitude"), in spectral content (e.g. different color LEDs or filtered white LEDs) and in time (e.g. via triggering the electronics from a single trigger but after different delays incorporated in the timing of the trigger). The same trigger, but, for example, at a different delay or amplitude or shape, can initiate the exposure of the camera. Since the exposure duration of the camera can be controlled separately, it is feasible to time the first light source (e.g., reflection can be captured, for example, by the even number frames) and the second light source (e.g., reflection can be captured, for example, by the odd number frames) to illuminate the rotation tag and its signature. Since the illumination is at different angles (e.g. one from the top and one from the bottom, i.e., in an epiposition, or one from top and one at, e.g., a 45° angle to the vertical), the rotation tag can be detected in one image and not in the another image. Since a series of images is captured, and since more than one source can be used, it is possible to reconstruct virtually a three-dimensional shape of the rotation tag in every frame. This level of detection leads to higher accuracy and fewer deletion errors in the final sequence. </p><p id="p0148" num="0148"> The rotation-dependent transcriptional sequencing systems described herein can significantly advance point-of-care diagnostics and genomics based on massively parallel single molecule analysis with the single nucleotide resolution.

The level where the distance between the histogram and the line is maximal corresponds to the threshold value.

For example, if the first datum indicates a change in the rotational pattern and the second datum indicates the presence of guanine nucleoside triphosphate in the reaction, then the nucleotide at the identified position in the target nucleic acid molecule is determined to be cytosine. Similarly, if the first datum indicates an absence of change in the rotational pattern and the second datum indicates the presence of guanine nucleoside triphosphate in the reaction, the nucleotide at the indicated position in the target nucleic acid molecule is determined to be non-guanine (i.e., adenine, guanine, and thymine). </p><p id="p0165" num="0165"> If it is determined that the identified position can be advanced to a next position (1 140), the identified position is set equal to the next nucleic position in the target nucleic acid molecule (1 150) and the process 1 100 continues (1 120). If it is determined that the identified position cannot be advanced to a next position (1 140), the sequence of the target nucleic acid molecule based on the first information and second information received at each identified position is compiled (1 160) and the process 1 100 ends. The identified position cannot be advanced to a next position when transcription can no longer occur due, for example, to completion of transcription of the target nucleic acid molecule or expiration of RNA polymerase activity (e.g., due to decay of enzyme activity). </p><p id="p0166" num="0166"> Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, or in combinations of one or more of them.
