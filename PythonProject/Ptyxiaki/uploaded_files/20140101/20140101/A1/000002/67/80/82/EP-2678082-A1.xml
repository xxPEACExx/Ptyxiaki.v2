A pivot member 20 extends outwardly from the side face 14. </p><p id="p0036" num="0036">On its peripheral end, the pivot member 20 has a pendulum attachment means 22 which may be in the form of either a pivot pin or a suitable hole for receiving a pivot pin. A pendulum shaft 24, formed from an elongate member, has on one end pivot member attachment means 26 and on the other end golf club attachment means 28. The pivot member attachment means 26 may be formed from either a pivot pin or a suitable hole for receiving a pivot pin such that it cooperates with the pendulum attachment means 22. The golf club attachment means 28 has an attachment pin 30. The pendulum 24 is mounted on the pivot member 20 such that the end having a golf club attachment means 28 is able to swing in an accurate or arcuate manner. In a preferred embodiment the pendulum is formed from three telescopic members 24a, 24b and 24c such that it is adjustable in length. </p><p id="p0037" num="0037">A base portion 31 is formed from a plate 32 having three hinges 34, 36 and 38 spaced apart around the peripheral circumference thereof, Each hinge is connected to a supporting leg 40, 42 and 44, respectively. The supporting legs are telescopic such that their length can be extended to raise the height of the base portion 31 and also to spread their distribution on the ground and account for uneven ground surfaces to 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
 provide stability. A spirit level (not shown) may also be disposed on the base 31 to enable the training aid to be correctly set up. </p><p id="p0038" num="0038">A stem 46 extends downwards from the under face 18 of the hub 12 and through a hole in the base portion 31 such that it is able to pass there through under the control of a worm and wheel mechanism 48. It will be appreciated that other types of mechanism may be used which function to provide control Controlling the worm and wheel mechanism such that the stem 46 moved downwards through the hole in the base portion 31 reduces the height of the pivot member 20 relative to the ground surface. Similarly, controlling the worm and wheel mechanism such that the stem 46 moves in an upwards direction increases the height of the pivot member 20 relative to the ground surface. </p><p id="p0039" num="0039">An adjustable member 50 extends upwardly in a direction substantially opposite to the direction in which the pendulum extends and has a head position member 52 fixed to its peripheral end. The head adjustable member 50 is angled such as to position the head position member 52 directly above the golf club attachment means 28 and may be adjustable to alter the extent towards and away from a user. The training aid may be operated with or without the adjustable member and the head position member 52. </p><p id="p0040" num="0040">A specially adapted golf club head 54 may be detachably attachable to the golf club attachment means 28 such that is fixed in position thereto. The golf club head 54 is attachable to the attachment means at different angles such as to provide different angles of loft on the club head face. The loft may range from approximately 0 to 70°. The golf club head 54 may either have a permanently attached shaft 56 or, alternatively, a shaft which is attachably detachable to the golf club head 54 to form a golf club 58. The golf club 58 may be used attached to the golf training aid before being detached therefrom to be used on a golf course. In use, the golf training aid is set up by extending the legs 40, 42 and 44 to suitable lengths to provide stability. The height of the pivot member 20 is set by adjusting the height of the stem 46 relative to the base 31 , by using the worm and wheel mechanism 48. The pendulum 24 is then adjusted in length such that the golf club attachment means 28 overlies the practice putting surface 60 without significantly contracting it. A golf club head 54 is attached to the golf club attachment means 28 such that the shaft 56 extends upwardly in a normal position suitable for practising the putting stroke. The golf club head may be a golf club that can be used in normal play in which case, for example, the toe end of the club head may have attachment means that permit the head to be detachably connected to the golf club attachment means 28. The attachment 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
 means on the toe end of the head may be detachable from the head which may allow the club to be more readily used in normal play. </p><p id="p0041" num="0041">A user grips the golf club 58 in the normal manner before undertaking a putting stroke. In undertaking a putting stroke the club head 54 is guided by the arc which the pendulum determines and draws with the club attachment means 28. This arc is the predetermined preferred arc for undertaking a correct putting stroke. Accordingly, the user experiences the biomechanical feedback in his own body as to how he should be undertaking a putting stroke and also experiences how it should feel. </p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Referring to Figures 3 to 6, a preferred golf club putter head 154 comprises a toe 57, a heel 159, a front ball-striking surface 60, a rear portion 162 and a top surface 164. </p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The putter head 154 may further comprise shaft linkage 166 for attaching and linking a golf club shaft 156 to the putter head. The shaft linkage 166 has a pivot member 168 fixed to the top surface 164 such that it extends therefrom in a substantially upward direction. The shaft linkage further comprises a double ended clevis joint 170. The double ended clevis joint 170 is a rectangular tube having a first clevis joint 172 disposed at one end and a second clevis joint 174 disposed the other end. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The first clevis joint 172 has an open end which is orthogonal relative to the open end of the second clevis joint 174. </p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The pivot member 168 is disposed within the open end of the first clevis joint 172 and is pivotably attached thereto by means of a pivot pin 176 which extends through the pivot member 68 and the first clevis joint 72. The pivoting action of the first clevis joint 1 2 relative to the pivot member 168 may allow the golf club shaft 156 to be pivoted in a forward and backward direction relative the putter head 154 and may thereby allow the angle between the longitudinal axis of the shaft 156 and the plane of the ball-striking surface 160 to be adjusted and fixed at a desired angle - i.e. the loft of the ball-striking surface 160 can be adjusted as desired. </p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The shaft 156 has a distal end 178 which is disposed within the open end of the second clevis joint 174 and is pivotably attached thereto by means of a pivot pin 180 which extends through the distal end 178, of the shaft, and the second clevis joint 174. The pivoting action of the shaft 156 relative to the clevis joint 170 allows the shaft 156 to be pivoted in a direction perpendicular to the direction of pivot between the first clevis joint and the pivot member. The pivoting action provided by the second clevis joint 174 therefore allows the free end (handle) of the shaft to be pivoted in a plane formed

 between the toe 157 and the heel 159 and thereby allows the angle of the shaft to be adjusted to suit the height and putting style of the user. </p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Referring more particularly to figures 4 and 6, the rear portion 162 comprises a shoulder 180 having an upwardly extending surface such as a substantially vertical surface 182 and a surface transverse thereto such as a substantially horizontal surface 184. Suitably disposed on the surface 184 is a marker 186 and extending outwards such as substantially perpendicularly outwards from the upwardly extending surface 182 in a suitable relationship such as a substantially parallel relationship relative to the horizontal surface 184 is an alignment plate 188. The alignment plate 188 has an alignment aperture 190 extending therethrough such as to provide a preferred line of sight 192 from the user's eye, through the alignment opening which may comprise an aperture 190 to the marker 186. The marker 186 may be, for example, a coloured mark or raised or indented portion disposed on the surface 184. The marker 186 is preferably spaced from the opening 190. </p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Figure 7 and 8 disclose an alternative form of a marker and guide that may be affixed to a club head such as a putter. In this embodiment an upper marker 290 may include downwardly extending spigots 292 that are arranged to be received in aligned openings 294 in a lower marker 286 possibly by being a friction fit therein. The lower marker includes a recess 295 into which the upper marker may fit. </p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The upper marker 290 includes an aperture 296 which may have a first markings 298 extending in the direction of the intended swing of the club and may have a second marker 300 at right angles to the first marker. The lower marker may have a first marking 298A spaced from the upper marking 298 and may have a second marking 300A at result angles thereto which marker 298A and 300A may cross each other. </p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In use it is desired to attempt to keep the first marking 298 and 298A aligned with each other as shown in Figure 8 when swinging the club. It may also be desired to keep the second markers aligned with each other when swinging the club, as shown in Figure 8. </p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In accordance with one embodiment of the invention a club is provided having the opening 190 and the marker or the upper and lower marker 290 and 286 which club may or may not be used with the training aid. </p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In use, the putter head 154 is adjusted relative to the shaft 156, to suite the user, using the shaft linkage 166. The shaft may be adjustable in length such as by comparing telescopic shaft for instance. The user then practices their putting stroke and in doing 
<!-- EPO <DP n="10"/>-->
 so maintains the line of sight 192, such that they are able to see the marker 186 through the alignment aperture 190 at all times during the putting stroke. This, along with the training aid allows the optimum putting stroke to be achieved for greater directional and length accuracy. </p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Referring to particularly to Figures 4 and 5, a ballast hole 192 is formed in the toe 157, of the putter head 154. The hole 192 extends in a direction towards the heel 159 and is shaped to slideably receive and cooperate with a ballast weight 194 (see Figure 5). The hole 192 has a first diameter for receiving the main body of the ballast weight and a second smaller diameter for receiving an extended portion of the ballast weight. The hole 192 has a circumferentially discrete region of increased diameter extending longitudinally along the length of the hole to provide a receiving groove 196. </p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The ballast weight 194 provides for adjustable putter weights to suite the user. The ballast weight 194 is a cylinder having an outer diameter which corresponds with the first diameter of the hole 192, such that the weight 194 is slideably received within the hole 192. The weight has an inner end 198 and an outer end 200. The inner end 198 has an extended portion in the form of an alignment projection 202, which extends in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the weight 194 and is dimensioned to have a diameter which corresponds with the second smaller diameter of the hole. The outer end 200, of the ballast weight 194, has an attachment hole 204 extending along the longitudinal axis of the ballast weight 194. The attachment hole 204 is operable to slideably receive the attachment pin 30 of the golf training aid 10 (see Figures 1 and 2). The attachment hole 204 is shaped to prevent rotational displacement of the attachment pin 30 relative to the hole 204. Accordingly, the hole 204 has one or more flat portions, which may be machined, and which cooperate with flat portions disposed on the attachment pin 30 to prevent rotation displacement. </p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The ballast weight 194 also has a raised portion of increased diameter to form a locking member 206, which extends along the outer surface of the weight in a direction substantially parallel to the longitudinal direction thereof. The locking member 206 is dimensioned to be slideably receiving in the groove 196 such that when the weight 194 is disposed within the hole 192 the locking member 206 cooperates with the groove 196 to prevent rotational displacement of the weight 194 relative to the hole 192. </p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Although the golf training aid, club head and club described above are illustrated in the drawings as suitable for right-handed use, it will be appreciated that the golf training aid, club head and club is equally applicable to left-handed use within the scope of the present invention.
