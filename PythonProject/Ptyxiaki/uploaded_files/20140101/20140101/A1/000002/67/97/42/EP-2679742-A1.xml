A currently known technique consists of thermoforming the different dome-like shells and adhering them to each other by means of for instance a foam or adhesive of a variable thickness (normally between 5 and 10 mm). The foam thickness provides for a suitable distance between adjacent dome-like shells and prevents them lying against each other.

These first, second and third dome-like shells are substantially identical, i.e. identical save for tolerances, and are typically thermoformed in the same mould. <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> illustrates an exploded mounted position in which the second dome-like shell is rotated through 90 degrees relative to the first dome-like shell, and the third dome-like shell is in turn rotated through 90 degrees relative to the second dome-like shell. It is noted that as reference for the rotation a position is used in which the adjacent identical dome-like shells fit together as in the stacking position of <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 2B. Figure 2A</figref> illustrates a cross-section of the mounted position in which the third dome-like shell 3 is supported on the second dome-like shell 2 and the second dome-like shell 2 is supported on the first dome-like shell 1.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Each dome-like shell 1, 2, 3 is provided with a dome element 41, 42, 43 and a peripheral flange 11, 12, 13 connecting thereto and taking the form here of a framework. Note that other shapes can also be envisaged in accordance with the form of the dome. The invention is thus also applicable to dome-like shells with a round peripheral flange or to dome-like shells with a polygonal peripheral flange. Each peripheral flange 11, 12, 13 is provided with a plurality of studs 21a-f, 22a-f, 23a-f. A plurality of studs 21a-c, 22a-c, 23a-c; 21d-f, 22d-f, 23d-f; 21a-c, 22a-c,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 23a-c; 21d-f, 22d-f, 23d-f are typically provided on each side 31, 32, 33, 34 of each peripheral flange 11, 12, 13. The studs are preferably arranged at a pitch distance from each other and in regular distribution over the periphery. The studs are arranged such that, when a second dome-like shell is rotated through a determined angle relative to a first identical dome-like shell lying thereunder, the studs are localized such that the studs of the second dome-like shell which has been rotated relative to the first dome-like shell do not overlap. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> the second dome-like shell is rotated through 90 degrees relative to the first dome-like shell, and in this position the studs 22d-f do not overlap with studs 21a-c and studs 22a-c do not overlap with studs 21d-f. Note that it is for instance also possible to provide the pattern such that it is not a rotation through 90 degrees but a rotation through 180 degrees which produces the desired result of non-overlapping studs, see <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 5</figref> and the discussion thereof below. The skilled person will further appreciate that other rotations are also possible in the case of peripheral flanges of different shape.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">For the purpose of forming the first and second studs cavities are typically provided in a clamping mould used to clamp the peripheral flange fixedly during the process of thermoforming the dome-like shells. During the thermoforming process the first and second dome-like shells are formed by blowing or vacuum-forming and the first and second studs are pressed into the peripheral flange.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As best seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 3</figref>, which shows a top view of a second dome-like shell which is placed in the mounted position on the first dome-like shell, i.e. in a position rotated through 90 degrees on the first dome-like shell, the first peripheral flange 11 is provided along its periphery with a pattern of first studs 21a-21f. The first dome-like shell 1 is more particularly provided on a first side 31 with three first studs 21a-21c, on<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> a second side 32 with three first studs 21d-21f, on a third side 33 once again with first studs 21a-21c and on a fourth side 34 once again with first studs 21d-21f. The stud pattern on third side 33 thus corresponds to the stud pattern on first side 31 which has been rotated through 180 degrees. In similar manner the stud pattern on fourth side 34 corresponds to the stud pattern on second side 32, but rotated through 180 degrees. Such a peripheral pattern makes it possible to make identical dome-like shells 1, 2, 3 which on the one hand are placeable on each other in a stacking position, see <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 2B</figref>, and which on the other are mountable at a distance from each other in a mounted position in which adjacent dome-like shells are rotated in each case through 90 degrees relative to each other, this without spacers being necessary between adjacent dome-like shells.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The assembly of dome-like shells 1, 2, 3 of <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> can be secured in the mounted position, for instance in classical manner using nut and bolt.

First studs 21d'-21e' are arranged such that they fit between second studs 22a'-22c' of a second dome-like shell 2' placed above the first dome-like shell 1', wherein the second dome-like shell 2' is rotated through 90 degrees relative to first dome-like shell 1'. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref> illustrates yet another variant in which the first side 31" and the fourth side 34" are provided with the same first pattern which are rotated through 90 degrees relative to each other, while second side 32" and third side 33" are provided with a complementary second pattern. According to such an embodiment, the second dome-like shell will<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> thus have to be rotated through 180 degrees relative to the first dome-like shell in order to ensure that the studs of the first dome-like shell do not overlap with the studs of the second dome-like shell.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The skilled person will appreciate that numerous other patterns are also possible, wherein all that is important is that a second dome-like shell is placeable in a rotated position on the first dome-like shell such that second peripheral flange 12 is supported on first studs 11.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In the illustrated embodiments the studs protrude upward from a peripheral flange in the same direction as the dome element itself.
