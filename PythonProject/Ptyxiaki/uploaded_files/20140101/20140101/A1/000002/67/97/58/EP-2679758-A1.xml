--><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a glazing panel.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In particular, the present invention relates to a glazing panel comprising at least two parallel outer glazing panes spaced apart from one another by means of a spacer frame structure and wherein one glazing pane surface of each outer glazing pane is a bonded glazing pane surface which is bonded to a lateral side of the spacer frame structure.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">According to the state of the art, all kinds of such glazing panels exist, often described as insulating glazing or double glazing, which glazing panels are usually mounted in a window frame for realizing a window.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Typically, the window frame supports and bears the glazing panel and is providing the structural strength needed in order to restrict deformations of the window and to withstand loads exerted on the window, such as wind loads, loads exerted during opening and closing or wrong manipulation of the window by a person and so on.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The glazing panel or insulating glazing is considered as being a transparent plate which just completes the window and which is not fulfilling any structural function such as a bearing, a supporting or a load taking function.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">An important drawback of the existing windows is that the window frame is forming a non-transparent part of the window with relatively important dimensions compared to the total window surface, so that incident light is partly obstructed.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In windows with a hinged window frame which can be opened and closed the part of the window that is transparent is even still smaller.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In other words, the transparency ratio of the existing windows is rather small.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">As a consequence, the existing windows are also rather inefficient thermal insulators, since the window frame is usually a rather weak thermal insulator, at least compared to the double glazing panels.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Also the fact that less sun light can penetrate through the known types of windows due to the presence of the window frame, than would be the case with a window consisting essentially only of a double glazing panel, implies that available solar energy is not used for heating.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Another drawback of the existing windows is their visual aspect, which is often non-esthetic.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">For example, in cases where fixed windows are mixed with windows having sash frames that can be opened, there is usually a clear visual difference.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In some cases, glazing panels are also used to construct a so-called curtain wall, which have a higher transparency ratio than the traditional windows.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Nevertheless, also in these applications the loads exerted on the glazing panels are accommodated by a supporting structure, which inevitably obstructs light from penetrating the building and which is often again visually non-esthetic.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is therefore an objective of this invention to overcome one or more of the above-mentioned drawbacks or possibly other non-mentioned drawbacks of the known glazing panels and windows.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In particular, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a glazing panel with a very high structural strength which is able to withstand loads similar to the loads usually applied on a known window, without the need of an outer window frame or supporting structure.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">It is still another objective of the present invention to keep the non-transparent parts of such a glazing panel as small as possible in order to avoid obstruction of light penetration.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">To this end, the present invention relates to a glazing panel comprising at least two parallel outer glazing panes spaced apart from one another by means of a spacer frame structure, one glazing pane surface of each outer glazing pane being a bonded glazing pane surface which is bonded to<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> a lateral side of the spacer frame structure, wherein said lateral sides of the spacer frame structure are provided with a protrusion which supports the corresponding bonded glazing pane surface, a slot being left adjacent to the protrusion between the concerned lateral side of the spacer frame structure and the concerned bonded glazing pane surface, the slot being at least partly filled with an adhesive material.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A big advantage of such a glazing panel according to the invention is that its spacer frame structure has an adapted shape which enables the realization of a glazing panel which is extremely strong and which can be used as a structural building component rather than as a decorative element without any load bearing function.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Indeed, finite element calculations demonstrated that it is possible to develop such a glazing panel according to the invention with extraordinary structural strength, if, on the one hand, the spacer frame structure provides in a sufficient rigid support in order to withstand the loads, and if, on the other hand, small deformations of the outer glazing panes are not too much prevented by the spacer frame structure and the bond between the spacer frame structure and the outer glazing panes, so that stresses in the assembly are kept at a sufficiently low level.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The protrusions at both lateral sides of the spacer frame structure provide in the necessary support for the outer glazing panes, while at the same time a limited deformation of the outer glazing panes or a pivoting movement around<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the concerned protrusion is still possible in the space available in the adjacent slots, at least if an adhesive material is applied, which is not too stiff and therefore suitable for this purpose.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In that way, it is possible to realize a glazing panel in which the stiffness and the structural strength of both outer glazing panes as well as of the spacer frame structure and the binding adhesive, work together and add to the total strength of the glazing panel, so to form an exceptionally strong glazing panel suitable for building.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the traditional known glazing panels this is not the case, since in those glazing panels the glazing panes are kept together by means of a thin wall tubular spacer frame made of metal or a synthetic material in which a desiccant is provided, while the space between the glazing panes at their outer border is sealed by means of a soft component such as polyurethane, silicon or polysulfide or the like.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The joining of the known glazing panes is thermally insulating and damp tight, but the glazing panes at both sides of the spacer frame have a rather independent behavior from a mechanical or dynamical point of view.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Actually, glass has a very high strength and stiffness, these interesting physical characteristics being completely neglected for load bearing functions in the present known glazing panels.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A glazing panel according to the invention can be mounted without using any additional outer window frame or other supporting structure and has therefore a lot of advantages such as maximal transparency and as a consequence maximal sun light penetration, a very high thermal insulation, visual uniformity between fixed glazing panels and panels that can be opened and closed, as well as visual uniformity between glazing panels used at varying positions in a building, as for example in a front side, a roof or an inside wall and so on.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">A preferred embodiment of a glazing panel according to the invention is a self-supporting glazing panel, having sufficient structural strength for bearing at least the weight of the glazing panes of the glazing panel as well as for supporting a wind load of 1600 Pa applied perpendicular to a surface of one of the outer glazing panes, without the need of an outer supporting sash frame for supporting the glazing panel.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As is known in the domain of building, a glazing panel or window that withstands a wind load of about 1600 Pa is suitable for being applied in normal situations on buildings which are subjected to normal wind loads, such as glazing panels for buildings in cities at a height below certain heights.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Additionally, in a still more preferred embodiment of a glazing panel according to the invention, the spacer frame structure has an outer border which fits within the outer<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> border of the outer glazing pane with the largest dimensions.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Such an embodiment of a glazing panel according to the invention provides maximum transparency and is actually a real structural glazing panel that does not need any outer structural or load bearing support.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The present invention also relates to an assembly of a multitude of glazing panels according to the invention wherein adjacent glazing panels are connected to one another by connecting spacer structure frames of adjacent glazing panels, in order to form an assembly which behaves as a single, self-supporting structural glazing panel and this without the need of enclosing the outer borders of the glazing panels in an additional outer supporting frame.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Such an assembly according to the invention is very suitable for realizing curtain walls or other building structures in a very simple way, the glazing panels being capable of withstanding the loads without the need of other load bearing elements or with just a minimal amount or very light outer frame structures, such as profiles or joint structures for making the assembly wind and rain tight etc...</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The invention provides therefore also in a complete new way of building with glazing panels, wherein the strength of the glass is used to a maximum.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">With the intention of better showing the characteristics of the invention, hereafter, as example without any
