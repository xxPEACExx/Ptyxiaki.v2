After the moulding, properly formed elements are separated from production waste, and the production waste is taken to a mill, where it is ground to obtain secondary material, which is then transported form the mill, through the branches of transport line to feeders installed in the branches of the raw material supply line, where the content of secondary material in the raw material (supplied to the moulding station for elements attached to a given branching of the raw material supply line) is adjusted.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">One of popular elements produced from foamed polystyrene is a flat board, used for example as insulation construction material for thermal insulation of external walls of the buildings. They are usually produced by inputting preliminarily extended polystyrene grains into a mould which is repeatedly larger than the planned boards, in which the polystyrene grains are expanded, forming a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> styrofoam block. The block is cut into boards of a desired size.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Boards for thermal insulation of buildings are exposed to negative atmospheric conditions during utilisation. Particularly negative conditions are present in the area between the board and a wall, which provides conditions for fungi, plait and bacteria development. It would be preferable to develop a board, with which the level of fungi, plait and bacteria development between the board and a wall would be reduced.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">There are known coating agents based on the nanoparticles of metals, usually silver, which are used to inhibit the development of fungi, plait and bacteria. However, these agents are usually used to be absorbed by fabrics or mixed with moulded products in a moulding batch. Popular agents cannot be used for coating styrofoam boards due to their low absorbability, which results in low adhesiveness of these agents to walls or even falling off.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The aim of the invention is to develop a method for manufacturing of foamed polystyrene boards coated with an agent inhibiting the growth of fungi and plait, which guarantees better adhesiveness of the agent to the board surface.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The object of the invention is a method for manufacturing of foamed polystyrene boards, whereby raw polystyrene grains are preliminarily expanded in an expander, and then seasoned, after which the seasoned grains are input to a mould, where under raised temperature and pressure, a block is formed. The block is cut into boards of a desired shape and size, and the cut boards are sprayed with a bactericidal colloid consisting of 1% by weight of silver nanoparticles having a diameter of 50 nm in polymer shell, 93% to 97% of alcohol with average boiling point 65°C to 90°C, 0.1% to 1% of surfacants, 0.2% to 2% of wetting agents, 0.5% to 1,5% of silanes, 0.2% to 1.5% of quelanting agents, 0.5% to 1.5% of substances with boiling point below 40°C and 0.1% to 0.5% of substances reducing viscosity of the whole colloid to a value below 1,0 cP. The colloid is sprayed in the amount of 15 to 35 ml/m<sup>2</sup>, after which the board is dried until evaporation of colloid's solvent.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">This invention allows to obtain foamed polystyrene boards, coated with an agent inhibiting the development of fungi, plait and bacteria on the board characterised by its high adhesiveness to the board surface.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The invention is presented by means of an exemplary embodiment on a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> drawing, in which <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> presents a diagram of a technological line for carrying out the method according to the invention.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Raw material in form of expandable polystyrene grains is supplied from a tank 101 to an expander 102, where the grains are expanded under raised temperature and pressure, according to technical specification for a given type of grains. Afterwards, the expanded grains are seasoned in a silo 103 to obtain parameters necessary for appropriate moulding of the elements. After seasoning, grains are transported from the silo 103 to a block forming mould 104, where, under appropriate temperature and pressure, the final expansion of the grains is performed; the grains are integrated and take the shape of a block, limited by the walls of the mould 104. Thus moulded blocks are then supplied to a saw-cutting station 105, where they are cut into boards of desired shape and size. Next, the boards are transported to a spraying tunnel 106, where the are sprayed with bactericidal colloid from a tank 107.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The bactericidal colloid in the tank 107 consists of 1% by weight of silver nanoparticles having a diameter of 50 nm in a polymer shell, 93% to 97% of alcohol with average boiling point 65°C to 90°C, 0.1% to 1% of surfacants, 0.2% to 2% of wetting agents, 0.5% to 1,5% of silanes, 0.2% to 1.5% of quelanting agents, 0.5% to 1.5% of high volatility substances with boiling point below 40°C and 0.1% to 0.5% of substances reducing viscosity of the whole colloid below 1,0 cP.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The applied alcohol can be for example ethanol or propanol. Low boiling point (below 80° C) quick and total evaporation of a medium, in which nAg is dispersed.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">One of the surfactant which can be applied is for example 15-S-5 by Dow Chemical Company. As the wetting agent there can be used for example secondary alcohol ethoxylate. Application of surfactants and wetting agents facilitates the reduction of colloid surface tension and its uniform application on the board surface.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Silanes increase the adhesiveness of the nanosilver to the base.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Quelanting agents, electrostatic (i.e. ion, for example carboxylic, amine or sulfone) shells facilitate dispersion of nanosilver in the colloid.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As a high volatility substance there can be used for example acetone. It helps generating evaporation centres and increases evaporation of alcohol, which<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> is the main solvent of the solution.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As the substances reducing viscosity there can be used for example BYK W966 by BYK-Chemie GmbH (Wesel, Germany), which results in a more effective application of the colloid on the surface.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Bactericidal colloid from the tank 107 is sprayed equally on the whole surface of the boards (15 to 35 ml/m<sup>2</sup> depending on the material and desired final concentration of nAg) in the spraying tunnel using spray nozzles.
