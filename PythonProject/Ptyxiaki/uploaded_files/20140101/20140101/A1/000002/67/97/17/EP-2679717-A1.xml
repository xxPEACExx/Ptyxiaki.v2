A drainage pump 63 is connected to the filter case 83, and a drainage hose 66 arranged from the interior of the washing machine casing 41 to the upper side of the exterior is connected to the discharge side of the drainage pump 63. When required such as a time of finishing the wash step and a time of finishing the rinsing step, by drive of the drainage pump 63, the washing water in the water tank 42 flows into the filter case 83 via the drainage tube 64 connected to the recessed portion 71 in the bottom of the water tank 42. After passing through the lint filter 65 in the filter case 83, the washing water is drained to the exterior of the drum-type washing machine through the drainage pump 63 and the drainage hose 66.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The other end of the drainage tube 64 is connected to a water<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> level detection tube 87, and the drainage tube 64 and the water level detection tube 87 are integrated with each other. An inclination portion 86 is provided in the vicinity of the lower side of the drainage port 85 of the water level detection tube 87, and thereby, a diameter of the water level detection tube 87 is formed to be smaller than a diameter of the drainage tube 64. One end of the water level detection tube 87 communicates with an opening 88 of an air trap 74. It should be noted that the drainage tube 64 is preferably made of a soft material such as a rubber material in consideration with a connection property to other members, prevention of leakage from a connection point, and a vibration absorption property of the water tank unit 49 at the time of the spin-drying step.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The air trap 74 is integrated with the water tank 42 in a side wall part of an outer periphery on the rear side of the bottom of the water tank 42. An air tube 75 is connected to this air trap 74, and a water level detector 76 such as a pressure sensor or the like is provided on the inner side of the upper part of the washing machine casing 41 so as to be connected to the air trap 74 via the air tube 75. When the water is supplied to the interior of the water tank 42, the air in the air trap 74 is compressed in accordance with a water level of the supplied water, and air pressure is transmitted to the water level detector 76 through the air tube 75. Thereby, the water level detector 76 can detect a plurality of water levels in the water tank 42 from a change in the air pressure.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">It should be noted that the filter case 83 is arranged in a right lower part on the front surface of the washing machine casing 41 for handleability of the filter grip 84. The drainage port 85 is provided on the right side of a vertical center of the water tank 42 when seen from a front in order to efficiently arrange the drainage tube 64. It should be noted that a piping<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> structure of the bottom will be described later with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The water circulation passage 56 is a passage for circulating the water in the water tank 42 in order to circulate the water in the water tank 42 in accordance with need such as a time of a pre-wash step, the time of the wash step, and the time of the rinsing step, so as to prevent early dissolution or leaning of the detergent and improve functions of wash and rinsing.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In this water circulation passage 56, the drainage tube 64 and the lint filter 65 also used for the drainage passage 55 are connected to an inflow side passage 68 of a circulation pump 67. A discharge side passage 69 of the circulation pump 67 communicates with the interior of the water tank 42 at jet ports 70 on the inner side of the front surface of the water tank 42. By driving the circulation pump 67, the washing water in the water tank 42 is guided to the inflow side passage 68 going toward the circulation pump 67 through the drainage tube 64 and the lint filter 65. After that, the washing water is discharged into the rotary drum 43 as circulated water from the jet ports 70 in the direction shown by a solid arrow through the circulation pump 67 and the discharge side passage 69. The circulated water discharged into the rotary drum 43 is utilized as the washing water, and circulated again in the water circulation passage 56. It should be noted that the water tank 42 has the circular opening on the front surface, the plurality of jet ports 70 is provided along a circumference of this opening edge, and the circulated water is discharged into the rotary drum 43 from all directions of the circumference of the opening edge.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">A hot water heater (heating portion) 72 for heating the washing water is arranged in the recessed portion 71 formed in the bottom of the water<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> tank 42. For example, a sheathed heater or the like is used as such a hot water heater 72 and arranged so as to extend in the horizontal direction in the recessed portion 71. By discharging the washing water in the water tank 42 heated by this hot water heater 72 into the rotary drum 43 through the plurality of jet ports 70 as described above, the washing water is sprinkled on the clothing, and this washing water is circulated again. Since the heated washing water is sprinkled on the clothing, activation of the detergent is increased in accordance with an increase in molecule activities of the washing water. Thus, a washing ability can be increased and wash non-uniformity can be reduced. In the vicinity of the hot water heater 72, a temperature detector 73 for detecting a water temperature such as a thermistor is provided.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">An upper part on a rear surface of the detergent accommodating portion 61 provided on the inner side of the upper part of the washing machine casing 41 and an upper part of the water tank 42 are connected by a coupling hose 77. The coupling hose 77 plays a role of evacuating the air in the water tank 42 pressurized by a step operation action.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In a rear part on an upper surface of the water tank 42, a vibration detector 78 for detecting vibration of the water tank unit 49 is arranged. For example, a multiaxis acceleration sensor is used as the vibration detector 78, and detects not acceleration in one direction but vibration in the three-axis directions of the front and rear direction (X axis direction), the left and right direction (Y axis direction), and the up and down direction (Z axis direction) when seen from the front surface side of the drum-type washing machine, so as to control an operation of the drum-type washing machine. This is because actual vibration of the water tank unit 49 cannot always be limited to one<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> direction, and thus the multiaxis acceleration sensor is used for detection with high precision.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">A user selects modes such as an operation course and various functions in the operation of the drum-type washing machine by making an input to an input setting portion 80 from an operation panel 79 provided in the upper part of the front surface of the washing machine casing 41. A control device 81 is arranged on the inner side of the upper part of the washing machine casing 41, and the control device 81 displays a display corresponding to information inputted through the input setting portion 80 on a display portion (not shown) on the operation panel 79 so as to notify the user.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a perspective view of major parts when the piping structure such as the drainage passage 55 in the bottom of the water tank 42 of the drum-type washing machine in the embodiment of the present invention is seen from the lower side.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, when seen from the front surface side of the drum-type washing machine, the drainage port 85 of the water tank 42 is arranged on the right side of the vertical center of the water tank 42, and the filter case 83 coupled to the one end of the drainage tube 64 which is connected to the drainage port 85 is arranged in the right lower part on the front surface side of the washing machine casing 41. On the left and right sides of the filter case 83, the circulation pump 67 connected to the discharge side passage 69 and the drainage pump 63 connected to the drainage hose 66 are arranged. The air trap 74 formed on the rear side of the drainage port 85, the water level detection tube 87, the drainage port 85, the drainage tube 64, and the case connection port 89 of the filter case 83 are substantially horizontally arranged.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Operations of the drum-type washing machine of the present embodiment formed as above will be described below.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The water tank 42 and the air trap 74 are integrally formed from a reinforced plastic material such as polypropylene containing glass (for example, formed by integral molding or the like). Therefore, in the wash step and the rinsing step, the air pressure in the air trap 74 is stabilized, so that variation in the water level detected by the water level detector 76 is suppressed.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In a drainage step, the washing water with which the water tank 42 and the drainage passage 55 are filled is drained at once from the drainage hose 66 to the exterior by drive of the drainage pump 63. At this time, a strong water flow from the drainage port 85 to the filter case 83 via the drainage tube 64 is generated. Since the air trap 74, the water level detection tube 87, the drainage port 85, the drainage tube 64, and the case connection port 89 of the filter case 83 are substantially horizontally arranged, the water flow is straightened so as to come into the filter case 83. Since the inclination portion 86 is provided in the vicinity of the lower side of the drainage port 85 in the water level detection tube 87, the water level detection tube 87 has a smaller diameter than the drainage tube 64. Therefore, the water in the drainage tube 64 is suppressed from flowing into the water level detection tube 87. Thus, foreign substances such as lint contained in the washing water in the water tank 42 cannot easily be reversed so as to flow into the air trap 74, so that a change in the air pressure due to accumulation of lint and the like over time and consequent instability of the water level are suppressed.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The drainage tube 64 is preferably formed from a soft material<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> such as a rubber material. By using a soft material for the drainage tube 64, a task for connection to the drainage port 85, connection to the opening 88 of the air trap 74, or connection to the case connection port 89 is easily performed, and water leakage from the connection point can be prevented.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">As described above, according to the present embodiment, since the air trap 74, the water level detection tube 87, the drainage port 85, the drainage tube 64, and the case connection port 89 of the filter case 83 are substantially horizontally arranged, at the time of draining the washing water in the water tank 42, the water flow from the drainage port 85 of the bottom of the water tank 42 toward the case connection port 89 of the filter case 83 through the drainage tube 64 can be straightened. Further, in the water level detection tube 87 providing communication between the drainage tube 64 and the opening 88 of the air trap 74, the inclination portion 86 is provided in the vicinity of the lower side of the drainage port 85 and the water level detection tube 87 has a smaller diameter than the drainage tube 64. Thus, the water flow cannot easily come into the air trap 74. Therefore, the foreign substances such as lint contained in the washing water cannot easily flow into the air trap 74, so that the air pressure in the air trap 74 is stabilized. Thus, the water level of the water tank 42 can be stably detected by the water level detector 76.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">It should be noted that a case where the rotation center of the rotary drum 43 is arranged in the horizontal direction in the drum-type washing machine is described above as an example.
