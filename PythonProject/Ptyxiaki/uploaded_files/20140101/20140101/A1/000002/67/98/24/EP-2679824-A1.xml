In the casing, which accommodates the components therein, end lids, which are called head, are provided at both ends in the axial direction of the casing. The heads are provided so as to confine the components from both ends in the axial direction of the casing. O-rings for preventing leakage of compressed fluid are provided between the outer circumferential surfaces of the heads and the inner circumferential surface of the casing (see, for example, PTL 1).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As a seal structure using O-rings, PTL 1 discloses a structure in which the O-ring is provided by forming a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> recessed part on the outer circumferential surface of the head, providing a ring-shaped thin O-ring-retaining ring in this recessed part, and providing an O-ring groove on the outer circumference of the O-ring-retaining ring. In addition, an O-ring groove is also provided on the end surface of the O-ring-retaining ring (the surface orthogonal to the axial direction of the compressor), thereby providing a seal structure for sealing a gap formed with respect to the side surface of the recessed part that is provided on the outer circumferential surface of the head (the surface orthogonal to the axial direction of the compressor).</p><heading id="h0003">{Citation List}</heading><heading id="h0004">{Patent Literature}</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004"><ul><li>{PTL 1} Japanese Examined Patent Application, Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPS586079B"><text>S58-6079</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">{Summary of Invention}</heading><heading id="h0006">{Technical Problem}</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, with the invention described in PTL 1, when pressure is applied to the O-ring-retaining ring in the axial direction of the compressor, and the O-ring provided on the end surface of the O-ring-retaining ring is pushed towards the side surface of the recessed part, there is a risk that the O-ring-retaining ring cannot move outward in the radial<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> direction of the head due to the pushing force acting on the O-ring-retaining ring in the axial direction of the compressor.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In addition, because the O-ring-retaining ring is thin, there is a problem in that it is difficult to process the O-ring grooves for fitting the O-ring on the outer circumferential surface or the side surface of the O-ring-retaining ring.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention has been made in light of the above-described circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide a compressor having a seal structure capable of providing an effective seal with simple structure.</p><heading id="h0007">{Solution to Problem}</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">In order to solve the problems described above, a compressor according to the present invention employs the following solutions.<br/>
Specifically, a compressor according to the present invention includes a substantially tubular compressor casing; a substantially circular lid that is provided inside an inner circumferential surface of the compressor casing so as to close off an end of the compressor casing; a space that is enclosed by the lid and the inner circumferential surface of<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the compressor casing and that accommodates a blade; and a seal member that is provided to extend in a circumferential direction on an outer circumferential surface of the lid which is adjacent to the space, wherein a slit part is provided in the lid so as to be located radially inside the outer circumferential surface where the seal member is located, the slit part is configured to extend in an axial direction of the lid from the space side of the lid.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The slit part is provided on the space side of the lid forming the space, and the slit part is located radially inside the outer circumferential surface where the seal member is provided, so as to extend in the axial direction of the lid. With the aforementioned configuration, when internal pressure is generated in the space, the internal pressure is applied inside the slit part, and a force is applied outward in the radial direction of the compressor casing to the outer circumferential portion of the lid that is sandwiched between the seal member and the slit part. Thus, even when the casing is expanded radially outward due to the internal pressure, causing the inner diameter of the compressor casing to be increased, it is possible to bring the seal member into contact with the inner circumferential surface of the compressor casing. Therefore, it is possible to prevent leakage through the gap between the inner circumferential<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> surface of the compressor casing and the outer circumferential surface of the lid.<br/>
The radial position relative to the outer circumferential surface, where the slit part is provided, and the size of the slit part extending in the axial direction are set such that, considering a given internal pressure (for example, an internal pressure during rated operation) is applied to the slit part, the outer circumferential portion of the lid sandwiched between the seal member and the slit part is capable of being deformed outward in its radial direction.</p><heading id="h0008">{Advantageous Effects of Invention}</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The slit part is provided on the space side of the lid forming the space, and the split part is located radially inside the outer circumferential surface where the seal member is provided, so as to extend in the axial direction of the lid.

These O-ring grooves 20a, 20b, and 20c are provided with O-rings 11a, 11b, and 11c, respectively.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">A slit part 13 is provided on the non-drive-end head 20, radially inside the outer circumferential surface, where the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> O-ring 11c is provided, so as to extend in the axial direction from the space 14 side of the non-drive-end head 20. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the slit part 13 is formed so as to have an L-shaped cross-section in the axial direction of the non-drive-end head 20. The outer circumferential portion (hereinafter referred to as "arm portion") 20d of the non-drive-end head 20, which is formed by extension of the L-shaped slit in the main axis thereof and the outer circumferential surface of the non-drive-end head 20, is provided with the O-ring groove 20c housing the above-mentioned O-ring 11c on the outer circumferential surface thereof.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A case in which the internal pressure is applied to the space 14 shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> will be described below.<br/>
Due to the internal pressure in the space 14, the space 14 side of the casing 5 is expanded radially outward. At the same time, because the slit part 13 is provided on the non-drive-end head 20 so as to have an opening in the end surface on the space 14 side of the non-drive-end head 20, the internal pressure is also applied to the slit part 13. Therefore, a force is applied to the arm portion 20d outwardly in the radial direction of the non-drive-end head 20 (upward in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>).</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As described above, due to the additional outward force<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> applied to the arm portion 20d, the O-ring 11c provided at the upper side (outer circumference side) of the arm portion 20d is further brought into contact with the inner circumferential surface side of the casing 5. Therefore, even when the internal pressure is applied to the space 14, causing the casing 5 to expand, it is possible to maintain airtight condition by ensuring squeezing of the O-ring 11c by bringing the O-ring 11c into contact with the inner circumferential surface of the casing 5.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As described above, the following advantages and effects can be achieved by the compressor 1 according to this embodiment.<br/>
The slit part 13 is provided on the space 14 side of the non-drive-end head (lid) 20 forming the space 14, radially inside the outer circumferential surface, where the O-ring (seal means) 11c is provided, so as to extend in the axial direction of the non-drive-end head 20. By the above-mentioned configuration, when the internal pressure is generated in the space 14, the internal pressure is also applied inside the slit part 13, and a force is applied to the arm portion (the outer circumferential portion of the non-drive-end head 20) 20d, which is sandwiched between the O-ring 11c and the slit part 13, outwardly in the radial direction of the casing (compressor casing) 5. Thus, even when the casing<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> 5 is expanded radially outward due to the internal pressure, causing the inner diameter of the casing 5 to be increased, it is possible to bring the O-ring 11c into contact with the inner circumferential surface of the casing 5. Therefore, it is possible to prevent leakage of the gas through the gap between the inner circumferential surface of the casing 5 and the outer circumferential surface of the non-drive-end head 20.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In this embodiment, the slit part 13 is described as having an opening in the end surface on the space 14 side of the non-drive-end head 20 and to extend in the axial direction of the non-drive-end head 20. However, the slit part 13 of the present invention is not limited to this embodiment, and as illustrated in modification 1, the slit part 13 may have an opening in the outer circumferential surface of the non-drive-end head 20, in the vicinity of the space 14 side.<br/>

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, the slit part 23, which extends toward the radial inside of the non-drive-end head 20 from the outer circumferential surface of the non-drive-end head 20, then extends below the O-ring groove 20c (in the axis direction of the non-drive-end head 20) such that the cross-section in the axial direction of the non-drive-end head 20 has an L-shape and such that the main axis of the L-shape lies along the axial direction of the non-drive-end head 20.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, a case in which internal pressure is applied to the space 14 will be described.<br/>
Due to the internal pressure in the space 14, the space 14 side of the casing 5 is expanded radially outward.

<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> -->Due to the internal pressure in the space 14, the space 14 side of the casing 5 is expanded radially outward. At the same time, because one end of the through portion 31 has the opening in the end surface on the space 14 side of the non-drive-end head 20, and the other end of the through portion 31 has the opening in the space 33, the internal pressure is applied to the space 33.
