This device can be used, for example, in the installation of optical access networks. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005"> An optical network of the type known as FTTP ("Fibre To The </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Premises) or FTTH ("Fibre To The Home") is an optical access network which supplies a number of end users with broadband or ultra-wideband communications services, in other words services which require data transmission speeds of several hundreds of Mbit/s or even higher speeds. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> Typically, an FTTP or FTTH optical network comprises a control cabinet, a series of line joints, a termination or extraction joint and a distribution box. The distribution box is typically positioned in the basement of the building in which the end users live. An optical cable, which will be referred to hereafter as a "riser cable", emerges from the distribution box and runs vertically inside the building from the basement to each floor. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> On each floor of the building, an access window can be cut in the sheath of the riser cable and one or more optical fibres can be extracted from it. Each extracted optical fibre can then be routed towards the apartment of a user living on the floor in question. At any intermediate point between the access window and the user's apartment, the extracted optical fibre can be joined to a user's optical cable (also known as a "drop cable"). The joints between the optical fibres extracted from the riser cable on one floor of the building and the optical fibres of the drop cables installed on this floor are typically housed in suitable transition boxes. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 The free end of each user cable is typically located in the user's apartment in a suitable termination box, in such a way that the user can connect it directly to his devices which use broadband services (such as a PC and a set-top box). </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> The control cabinets, the line or extraction joints, the distribution boxes, the transition boxes and the termination boxes can each include a surface having guide elements shaped so as to help the operator to arrange any excess length of optical fibres in an orderly way on the surface. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> In particular, the guide elements generally comprise a substantially cylindrical spool around which the operator can wind the excess length of the optical fibres. The radius of the spool is greater than the minimum bend radius of the optical fibres, which depends on the type of fibre. The spool not only serves to store the fibres, but also ensures that, if the optical fibres are subject to traction, they do not become bent with a bend radius which is less than the minimum radius. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> US 6 612 515 describes a spool comprising a centre post and a plurality of upper and lower fins which extend perpendicularly to the axis of the centre post. The spool can be connected removably to a spool support tray. The excess fibre is wound around the main body of the spool and is held in position by the fins. The spool is then connected to the tray and any length of fibre which is not wound around the spool is housed on the tray. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> The spool described in US 6 612 515 has a number of drawbacks. The present applicant has observed that, in order to install a distribution, transition or termination box quickly and efficiently, the operator must first gather up the excess length of all the optical fibres to be housed in the box into a single winding, and must then arrange the winding around the spool. Thus the installation of the boxes is much 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 quicker than the operation of winding the excess lengths of optical fibre around the spools one by one. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> However, this operation may be complicated and may not be repeatable when the addition of other optical fibres is required. This is because fins projecting towards the spool can be provided around the spool, in such a way that a passage is created between the spool and the end of each fin. The fins serve to retain the optical fibres against the surface around the spool, and to prevent them from falling out. In order to arrange the optical fibre winding around the spool, the operator must therefore pass the winding through the passages between the spool and the fins, in such a way that the optical fibres arranged on the surface around the spool lie under the fins. If the passages between the spool and the fins are narrow, however, the operation of passing the winding of the excess length of all the optical fibres through the passages around the spool in a single manoeuvre may not be easy. It requires a high level of dexterity in the operator and there is a risk that some optical fibres may be bent or broken. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> Although the possibility of separating the spool described in US 6 612 515 from the tray may facilitate the winding of the optical fibres around it, the Applicant has observed that this spool has a highly complex structure, with the disadvantage that it is difficult and costly to manufacture. It is also bulky and therefore less suitable for use in boxes for FTTP or FTTH networks, where the size of the box is a crucial parameter. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"> In view of the above, the object of the present invention is to provide a device for housing lengths of optical fibres comprising a spool which facilitates the arrangement of the optical fibres around the spool. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> In the remainder of the present description and in the claims, the expression "device for housing optical fibres comprising a spool" denotes any device having a surface adapted to receive lengths of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 optical fibres and a spool around which the lengths of optical fibres can be wound. By way of non-limiting example, the device can be a portion of a control cabinet, a line or extraction joint, a distribution box, a transition box or a termination box. In particular, the device can be the base or cover of a distribution box, a transition box or a termination box. Alternatively, the device can be a joint support tray or "organizer", which can, if necessary, be connected to the base of a distribution box, a transition box, a termination box, a line or extraction connection, or a control cabinet. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017"> The present invention proposes a device for housing lengths of optical fibres, comprising a fibre support surface, a spool projecting from the fibre support surface, a fin projecting towards the spool and a passage between the free end of the fin and the spool. According to the present invention, the spool interacts with the support surface so that the passage widens when the spool is pushed towards the fibre support surface to facilitate the housing of a portion of the lengths of optical fibres. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018"> In preferred embodiments, the spool comprises two or more lobes. The device facilitates the arrangement of the optical fibres around the spool because the lobes of the spool are movable. Additionally, the device has no detachable parts, and has a very simple structure and small overall dimensions. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019"> According to one aspect of the present invention, a device for housing lengths of optical fibres comprises: </p><p id="p0020" num="0020"> - a fibre support surface; </p><p id="p0021" num="0021"> - a spool projecting from the fibre support surface; </p><p id="p0022" num="0022"> - a fin projecting towards the spool; and </p><p id="p0023" num="0023"> - a passage between a free end of the fin and the spool, </p><p id="p0024" num="0024">characterized in that the spool interacts with the fibre support surface so that the passage widens when the spool is pushed towards the fibre

The joint housing portion 2 and the fibre housing portion 3 are separated from each other by two partitions 5. The outer wall 4 and the partitions 5 can have straight portions and curved portions. The curved portions preferably have a bend radius greater than a minimum bend radius, which depends on the type of optical fibre to be housed in the device 1 . For example, for optical fibres of the type defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.652D, the minimum bend radius to which optical fibres can be subjected with acceptable bend losses is 30 mm. </p><p id="p0053" num="0053"> The joint housing portion 2 preferably comprises a number of adjacent joint support elements 200, each of which can house a corresponding joint between optical fibres. </p><p id="p0054" num="0054"> The fibre housing portion 3 comprises a fibre support surface 300 and a spool 302 positioned substantially in the centre of the fibre support surface 300. </p><p id="p0055" num="0055"> The fibre support surface 300 is preferably substantially rectangular in shape with rounded corners, or elliptical in shape.

 The spool 302 preferably takes the form of a cylinder having an axis X substantially perpendicular to the fibre support surface 300 and a cross section having rotational symmetry about the axis X. In the remainder of the present description and in the claims, the expression "axis which is substantially perpendicular to the fibre support surface" indicates an axis whose direction forms an angle of not more than 20° with a line perpendicular to the surface. </p><p id="p0056" num="0056"> More specifically, in this first embodiment, the spool 302 comprises four lobes 304 having the same shape (the angle of rotation of the rotational symmetry is therefore 90°). As shown in Figure 4, the spool 302 is in the shape of a cloverleaf with four petals extending from the axis X. </p><p id="p0057" num="0057"> With reference to Figures 2, 3 and 4, each lobe 304 preferably comprises an upper surface 306 and an outer lateral wall 308. The upper surface 306, shown in broken lines in Figure 4, is substantially in the shape of a circular sector with a central angle of 90°. The vertex of the circular sector faces the axis X of the spool 302. In the embodiment shown in the various drawings, the upper surface 306 of each lobe 304 is delimited by an edge 310 opposite the vertex and two edges 31 1 at a right angle to each other. The edge 310 is shaped substantially in the form of an arc of a circle. It preferably comprises a central bend 312. The upper surface 306 can be solid or, as shown in Figures 1 - 7, can have an opening. The opening is such that a strip following the edges 310 and 31 1 is formed. </p><p id="p0058" num="0058"> The outer lateral wall 308 of each lobe 304 projects downwards from the edge 310 in a direction substantially perpendicular to the upper surface 306.

 In other words, the four lobes 304 are arranged on the fibre support surface 300 at a certain distance from each other. Their upper surfaces 306 are arranged substantially parallel to the fibre support surface 300 and at a certain height above it. </p><p id="p0060" num="0060"> Under each lobe 304, the fibre support surface 300 preferably has a corresponding opening 314 (shown in Figure 5) having substantially the same shape as the upper surface 306 of the lobe 304 and a slightly greater size. This enables each lobe 304 to be retracted into the fibre support surface 300, thus engaging the corresponding opening 314 located below it, as described more fully below. Each opening 314 in the fibre support surface 300 is delimited by a curved side with a central bend and by two sides at a right angle to each other, joined by a small curved connecting line. </p><p id="p0061" num="0061"> The four openings 314 define four arms 316 and a lobe support surface 318 on the fibre support surface 300 (as shown in Figure 5). The lobe support surface 318 is substantially circular and is located between the four vertices of the lobes 304 (namely, substantially on the axis X of the spool 302), while the four arms 316 extend radially from the lobe support surface 318 in directions which are substantially perpendicular to each other, thus laterally delimiting the openings 314. The arms 316 substantially form the bases of the channels 313. </p><p id="p0062" num="0062"> Each lobe 304 is preferably connected at its vertex to the lobe support surface 318 and projects from this surface. </p><p id="p0063" num="0063"> Preferably, the fibre housing portion 3 also comprises one or more fins 320, 322 (Figures 1 - 4). In particular, in the embodiment shown in the drawings, the fibre housing portion 3 comprises two first fins 320 and two second fins 322. The first fins 320 extend from the short sides of the fibre housing portion 3 towards the spool 302, preferably towards the axis X of the spool 302. Similarly, the second fins 322 extend from

 the long sides of the fibre housing portion 3 towards the spool 302, preferably towards the axis X of the spool 302. </p><p id="p0064" num="0064"> Each fin 320, 322 is aligned with the central bend 312 in the edge 310 and in the outer lateral wall 308 of a corresponding lobe 304, along a radial direction of the spool 302. Additionally, each fin 320, 322 preferably has a free end terminating in the proximity of the central bend 312. Thus each lobe 304 and the end of the fin 320, 322 facing it form a U-shaped passage 324. </p><p id="p0065" num="0065"> The fins 320, 322 are flat and extend parallel to the fibre support surface 300. Additionally, the fins 320, 322 are preferably located at substantially the same height as the upper surfaces 306 of the lobes 304 relative to the fibre support surface 300. In other words, the fins 320, 322 are substantially aligned with the upper surfaces 306 of the lobes 304. Preferably, openings shaped in the same way as the fins 320, 322 are provided in the fibre support surface 300 (Figure 5). </p><p id="p0066" num="0066"> The device 1 preferably has a width of between 10 cm and 20 cm and a length of between 5 cm and 15 cm. </p><p id="p0067" num="0067"> The device 1 is preferably made in one piece by moulding from a plastic material. The plastic material used can be, for example, ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene). </p><p id="p0068" num="0068"> When an operator wishes to use the device 1 to house, for example, the excess length of optical fibre required to join the optical fibres of a riser cable and the optical fibres of a user cable, he initially places the joints in the joint support elements 200 and then gathers the excess lengths of the joined optical fibres into a single winding 6. The operator then pushes gently (using one or more fingers, for example) on the upper surface 306 of one of the lobes 304 of the spool 302, near its edge 310. At the same time, the operator can move the winding 6 towards the edge 310, as shown in Figure 6. Under this pressure, the lobe 304 is partially retracted into the fibre support surface 300, 
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"/>-->
 engaging at least part of the underlying opening 314. Thus the edge 310 of the lobe 304 moves away from the free end of the fin 320 (or 322) facing the lobe 304, so that the corresponding passage 324 widens. </p><p id="p0069" num="0069"> The movement of the lobe 304 relative to the fibre support surface 300 is made possible by various factors (considered individually or in combination with each other). The shape of the lobes and the manner in which they are connected to the fibre support surface 300 are important factors. The material used and the thicknesses also help to make the lobes flexible with respect to the fibre support surface 300. The arms 316 and the lobe support surface 318 have the practical effect of connecting the spool 302 (in other words, each lobe 304 of the spool 302) in an elastic way to the fibre support surface 300. When a lobe of the spool 302 is subjected to pressure by the operator, the arms 316 and the lobe support surface 318 bend slightly so as to allow the lobe 304 to be retracted into the underlying opening. Since all the lobes 304 are rigidly connected to the lobe support surface 318, all the lobes 304 move substantially in a combined way when one of them is pushed, as shown in Figure 6. </p><p id="p0070" num="0070"> By continuing to push on the lobe 304 (which is therefore kept in the retracted position), the operator can then conveniently pass the whole winding of fibres 6 through the widened passage 324, thus placing the fibres under the fin 320 (or 322). When the operator releases his pressure on the edge 310 of the lobe 304, the elastic return action of the arms 316 causes the lobe to return to its original position (in other words, above the corresponding opening 314). </p><p id="p0071" num="0071"> The operator can then repeat the operation for the other three lobes 304. Whenever a lobe 304 is pushed, it is retracted into the fibre support surface 300, thus engaging the underlying opening 314 and widening the corresponding passage 324. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="13"/>-->
 When the operator has completed the operation for all four lobes 304, the winding of fibres 6 then rests entirely on the fibre support surface 300 around the spool 302 under the first fins 320 and the second fins 322, as shown in Figure 7. </p><p id="p0072" num="0072"> The joints can be placed in the joint support elements 200 after the fibre winding 6 has been arranged around the spool 302. The operator can then carry out any subsequent steps of the installation of the device 1 . </p><p id="p0073" num="0073"> The first fins 320 and the second fins 322 advantageously retain the optical fibres loosely around the spool 302, substantially on the fibre support surface 300, especially when the device 1 is kept in a vertical or inverted position. This function of the fins 320, 322 is aided by the shape of the passages 324, which have a curvature opposite to the curvature of the fibres of the winding 6. </p><p id="p0074" num="0074"> The device 1 thus facilitates the arrangement of the optical fibres around the spool 302, since it is simply necessary to exert a gentle pressure on the edge 310 of each lobe 304 in order to widen the passages 324 between the spool 302 and the fins 320, 322, thus allowing the whole winding of optical fibres 6 to pass through in a single operation. This operation is extremely simple and also minimizes the risk of damage or breakage of the fibres caused by a hasty or unskilled operator. </p><p id="p0075" num="0075"> The device 1 can also be made in one piece, without separate parts which may be lost or damaged.
