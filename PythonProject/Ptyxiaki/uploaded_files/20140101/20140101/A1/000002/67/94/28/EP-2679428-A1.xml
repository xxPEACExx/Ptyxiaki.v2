For example, in patent document 1 (<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2008049952A"><text>JP-A No. 2008-49952</text></patcit>), there is described a structure configured in such a way that an inclined surface leading from a lead-in opening to an open portion is formed in an opening forming member so as to guide the fuel nozzle to the open portion.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, there are fuel nozzles that have a large diameter portion in the middle of their lengthwise direction, such as fuel nozzles with a structure where a helical spring is attached to the outer periphery of a tubular fuel nozzle body. It is necessary for the smallest diameter section of the inner diameter of the inclined surface (guide surface) to be given a size considering the large diameter section (spring section) in the middle of the fuel nozzle. However, when the smallest diameter section of the inclined surface is made larger, it becomes difficult for the fuel filler structure to highly demonstrate the action of guiding the distal end of the fuel nozzle to the fuel fill inlet.</p><heading id="h0003">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0004">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">In consideration of the above-described circumstances, it is a problem of the present invention to obtain a fuel tank fuel filler structure with which even a fuel nozzle having a large diameter portion can be inserted easily into a fuel fill inlet and which can highly demonstrate the action of guiding the fuel nozzle to the fuel fill inlet.</p><heading id="h0005">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In a first aspect of the present invention, a fuel tank fuel filler structure includes: a fuel fill inlet member that is equipped with a fuel fill inlet into which a fuel nozzle for fueling a fuel tank is inserted; an opening-and-closing valve that is capable of opening and closing the fuel fill inlet; a rotational member for attaching the opening-and-closing valve to the fuel<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> fill inlet member in such a way that the opening-and-closing valve is rotatable between a closed position in which the opening-and-closing valve closes the fuel fill inlet and an open position in which the opening-and-closing valve opens the fuel fill inlet as a result of being pushed by the fuel nozzle; a guide member that guides the fuel nozzle to the opening-and-closing valve at a time of insertion of the fuel nozzle into the fuel fill inlet; and an interlock member that allows the guide member to move interlockingly with the rotation operation of the opening-and-closing valve in such a way as to enlarge an insertion region of the fuel nozzle when the opening-and-closing valve is in the open position.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the fuel tank fuel filler structure of the first aspect, the opening-and-closing valve is rotatably attached by the rotational member with respect to the fuel fill inlet member. Normally, the fuel fill inlet is closed by the opening-and-closing valve, but at the time of insertion of the fuel nozzle into the fuel fill inlet, the opening-and-closing valve is pushed by the fuel nozzle and rotates to the open position so that the fuel fill inlet is opened. Further, at the time of insertion of the fuel nozzle into the fuel fill inlet, the fuel nozzle is guided to the opening-and-closing valve by the guide member.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The guide member is configured in such a way that it moves interlockingly, because of the interlock member, with the rotation operation of the opening-and-closing valve, and when the opening-and-closing valve is in the open position, the guide member enlarges the insertion region of the fuel nozzle. Because of this, even a fuel nozzle having a large diameter portion can be inserted easily into the fuel fill inlet compared to a configuration where the guide member does not enlarge the insertion region of the fuel nozzle.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Additionally, in this way, by allowing the guide member to move in such a way that it enlarges the insertion region of the fuel nozzle at the time of insertion of the fuel nozzle into the fuel fill inlet, in a normal state the guide member can be placed in a position near the fuel fill inlet. Consequently, the action of guiding the fuel nozzle to the opening-and-closing valve (the fuel fill inlet) becomes higher compared to a configuration where the guide member is not moved to a withdrawal region like this.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In a second aspect of the present invention, in the first aspect, with respect to a fuel nozzle where a large diameter portion is configured in the middle of its lengthwise direction, at the time of insertion, the interlock member allows the guide member to move interlockingly with the rotation operation of the opening-and-closing valve in such a way that the guide member becomes positioned in a withdrawal region withdrawn from a passage region of the large diameter portion.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the second aspect, in this way, with respect to a fuel nozzle where a large diameter<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> portion is configured in the middle of its lengthwise direction, the interlock member allows the guide member to move interlockingly with the rotation operation of the opening-and-closing valve in such a way that the guide member becomes positioned in the withdrawal region withdrawn from the passage region of the large diameter portion. The guide member does not interfere with the large diameter portion of the fuel nozzle when the opening-and-closing valve is in the open position, so the insertion of the fuel nozzle into the fuel fill inlet becomes even easier.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In a third aspect of the present invention, in the first or second aspect, the guide member is disposed on the opening-and-closing valve.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the third aspect, by disposing the guide member on the opening-and-closing valve, it becomes possible to have the operation of allowing the guide member to move to the withdrawal region interlockingly with the opening-and-closing valve be performed by a simple configuration.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In a fourth aspect of the present invention, in the third aspect, the guide member has a rotational shaft that is disposed on the opening-and-closing valve in a site separated from a center of rotation of the opening-and-closing valve and a guide plate whose one end is rotatably supported on the rotational shaft, and the interlock member has a biasing member that biases the guide plate toward the withdrawal region in a state where the opening-and-closing valve is in the open position.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the fourth aspect, the one end of the guide plate is supported by the rotational shaft in a site separated from the center of rotation of the opening-and-closing valve. When the rotational shaft reaches the withdrawal region in the open position of the opening-and-closing valve, the one end side of the guide member also moves to the withdrawal region. Further, the guide plate is biased toward the withdrawal region by the biasing member. Consequently, when the opening-and-closing valve is in the open position, the guide plate can be reliably maintained in the withdrawal region.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As the guide member, it suffices simply to dispose the rotational shaft and the guide plate, so the structure can be simplified.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In a fifth aspect of the present invention, in the fourth aspect, the fuel tank fuel filler structure further includes a sliding surface that is disposed on the fuel fill inlet member along an insertion direction of the fuel nozzle and is for allowing the guide plate biased by the biasing member to slide on the sliding surface and for returning the guide plate to an initial position in accompaniment with an operation where the opening-and-closing valve returns from the open position to the closed position.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the fifth aspect, when the opening-and-closing valve returns from the open position to the closed position, the guide plate can slide on the sliding surface and return to the initial position (that is, a position of the guide plate in which the guide plate is capable of guiding the fuel nozzle to the opening-and-closing valve). Because the guide plate slides on the sliding surface, it becomes possible to allow the guide plate to stably move interlockingly with the rotation operation.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In a sixth aspect of the present invention, in the fifth aspect, the fuel tank fuel filler structure further includes a restricting member that restricts the guide plate from moving further outward in a radial direction than the sliding surface when the guide plate has moved further toward a far side of the fuel fill inlet than the sliding surface and has separated from the sliding surface.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the sixth aspect, even when the guide plate moves to the far side of the fuel fill inlet and separates from the sliding surface, the guide plate is prevented by the restricting member from moving further outward in the radial direction than the sliding surface. Consequently, when the opening-and-closing valve returns from the open position to the closed position, inadvertent catching of the guide plate on the fuel fill inlet member can be prevented.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In a seventh aspect of the present invention, in the first aspect or the second aspect, the guide member is disposed on the fuel fill inlet member.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the seventh aspect, by disposing the guide member on the fuel fill inlet member, the degree of freedom of the shape and operation of the guide member becomes higher. Advantageous Effects of Invention</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The present invention is given the above-described configurations, so even a fuel nozzle having a large diameter portion can be inserted into the fuel fill inlet, and the action of guiding the fuel nozzle to the fuel fill inlet can be highly demonstrated.</p><heading id="h0006">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0023" num="0023"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a front view shown from outside showing a fuel tank fuel filler structure of a first embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view, taken along line 2-2 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, showing the fuel tank fuel filler structure of the first embodiment of the present invention in a state where a flapper valve is in a closed position;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view, taken along line 3-3 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, showing the fuel tank fuel filler structure of the first embodiment of the present invention in a state where the flapper valve is in the closed position;<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view, taken along line 4-4 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, showing the fuel tank fuel filler structure of the first embodiment of the present invention in a state where the flapper valve is in the closed position;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing the fuel tank fuel filler structure of the first embodiment of the present invention in a state where a fuel nozzle is in the middle of being inserted;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing the fuel tank fuel filler structure of the first embodiment of the present invention in a state where the fuel nozzle is in the middle of being inserted;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing the fuel tank fuel filler structure of the first embodiment of the present invention in a state where the fuel nozzle has been inserted as far as a predetermined position;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8A</figref> is an explanatory view showing the relationship between a guide tube portion in the fuel tank fuel filler structure and the fuel nozzle;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8B</figref> is an explanatory view showing the relationship between the guide tube portion in the fuel tank fuel filler structure and the fuel nozzle;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> is an explanatory view showing the relationship between the guide tube portion in the fuel tank fuel filler structure and the fuel nozzle;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10A</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a fuel tank fuel filler structure of a second embodiment of the present invention in a state where the flapper valve is in the closed position;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10B</figref> a cross-sectional view showing the fuel tank fuel filler structure of the second embodiment of the present invention in a state where the fuel nozzle has been inserted as far as the predetermined position;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11A</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a fuel tank fuel filler structure of a third embodiment of the present invention in a state where the flapper valve is in the closed position;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11B</figref> a cross-sectional view showing the fuel tank fuel filler structure of the third embodiment of the present invention in a state where the fuel nozzle has been inserted as far as the predetermined position;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12A</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a fuel tank fuel filler structure of a fourth embodiment of the present invention in a state where the flapper valve is in the closed position;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0012">FIG 12B</figref> a cross-sectional view showing the fuel tank fuel filler structure of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> fourth embodiment of the present invention in a state where the fuel nozzle has been inserted as far as the predetermined position;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 13A</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a fuel tank fuel filler structure of a fifth embodiment of the present invention in a state where the flapper valve is in the closed position;
