Since the Co-Si based Colson alloy is provided by producing a precipitate compound of Co and Si, it requires solution treatment at high temperature and aging. Therefore, a firm oxide film is formed on the surface, which degrades solder wettability. Also, the Colson alloy may be stress relief annealed after final rolling, which may further grow the oxide film. For this reason, acid pickling is conducted after a final heat treatment, and the oxide film is dissolved and further removed by buffing (hereinafter referred to as a "buffing with acid pickling").<br/>
In view of the above, a copper alloy material having improved solder wettability by specifying surface roughness Ra of 0.2 µm or less and Rt of 2 µm or less (Patent Literature 1).<br/>
In addition, when the above-described buffing with acid pickling is conducted, ridged concave-convex is generated by buffing on the surface, thereby degrading the solder wettability. Therefore, a copper alloy material is developed by conducting acid pickling or degreasing before finish rolling, thereby improving the solder wettability (Patent Literature 2). By conducting acid pickling or degreasing before final rolling, a peak position in a frequency distribution graph representing concave-convex components on the surface will appear at a plus side (at a convex component side) of a mean line for the roughness profile (0 position in the frequency distribution graph), and solder wettability and plating property will be improved.</p><heading id="h0003">Prior Art Documents</heading><heading id="h0004">[Patent Literature]</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003"><ul><li>[Patent Literature 1] International Publication <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO201013790A"><text>WO 2010/13790</text></patcit><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></li><li>[Patent Literature 2] Japanese Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP4413992B"><text>4413992</text></patcit> (paragraph 0013)</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Problems to be solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, in the case of the technology described in Patent Literature 1, even if the solder wettability is good, the oxide film on the surface of the material is not completely removed and acid pickling and grinding are conducted before the final rolling. Thus, once foreign matters are pushed by rolling, pin holes (partial areas where solder is not attached) may be generated. When the number of the pin holes increases, soldering may be imperfect. In particular, when the pin holes are generated at a soldered area where terminals are molded using the Colson alloy, soldering may be imperfect.<br/>
In the case of the technology described in Patent Literature 2, acid pickling or degreasing is needed before the finish rolling, which makes the process complicated and also makes productivity poor. In addition, the oxide film of the Co-Si based Colson alloy is quite firm, and is therefore not removed easily only by acid pickling. In the technology described in Patent Literature 2, only acid pickling is conducted after a heat treatment and no grinding is conducted, or no acid pickling and no grinding are conduced. It is considered that the oxide film on the surface of the material is not completely removed, and the pin holes may be easily generated.<br/>
Accordingly, the present invention is made to solve the above-described problems. An object thereof is to provide a Co-Si based copper alloy plate having excellent solder wettability and less pin holes generated when soldering.</p><heading id="h0006">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Through intense studies by the present inventors, it is found that the excellent solder wettability is attained and the number of the pin holes decreases by conducting the buffing with acid pickling for a sufficient number of times using a relatively fine textured buff (grinding grains) after the final heat treatment such that the oxide film on the surface of the material and the foreign matters pushed by the rolling are removed and a smooth surface having predetermined anisotropy is provided.<br/>
In order to achieve the above-described object, the present invention provides a Co-Si based copper alloy plate, comprising: Co: 0.5 to 3.0% by mass, Si: 0.1 to 1.0% by mass and the balance Cu with inevitable impurities, wherein the Co-Si based copper<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> alloy plate satisfies the relationship {(60 degree specular gloss G(RD) in a rolling direction) - (60 degree specular gloss G(TD) in a direction transverse to rolling direction)} =&gt; 90%.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Preferably, a surface roughness Ra(RD) in a rolling direction is &lt;= 0.07 µm.

<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> -->In addition, the surface roughness Ra is arithmetic mean roughness specified in JIS-B0601 (2001), and the surface roughness Rz is a maximum height roughness specified in the same JIS.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a technical idea of the present invention will be described. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> shows an example of a production process of a Co-Si based copper alloy plate according to the present invention.<br/>
First, when a copper alloy plate 2 after final heat treating is placed into a pickling tank 4 and is acid pickled, an oxide film is dissolved and thinned almost uniformly in a rolling direction (RD) and a direction transverse to rolling direction (TD). Therefore, a 60 degree specular gloss G(RD) in a rolling direction and a 60 degree specular gloss G(TD) in a direction transverse to rolling direction are almost same after pickling, and a difference {G(RD) - G(TD)} nearly equals to 0 (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(a)</figref>).</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Next, a buff 6 is used to grind the copper alloy plate after acid pickling. Grinding mark flaws by buffing are left on a material. In the rolling direction (RD) that is a rotation direction of the buff 6, as the grinding on a surface of the material proceeds, the oxide film that is not completely dissolved upon acid pickling disappears from the surface of the material, the surface of the material becomes smooth and the G(RD) becomes great. On the other hand, even if grinding of the surface of the material proceeds in the direction transverse to rolling direction (TD), the grinding mark flaws by buffing are formed on the surface of the material in the TD direction. A degree of smooth is not largely changed, and the G(RD) is not largely changed. It results in {G(RD) - G(TD)} &gt; 0. It is found that when {G(RD) - G(TD)} =&gt; 90%, the buffing proceeds to sufficiently remove the oxide film, improve the solder wettability and the pin holes generated when soldering are decreased. An upper limit of {G(RD) - G(TD)} is not especially limited, but is practically 400% or less.<br/>
The 60 degree specular gloss reflects a state of the surface of the material having a predetermined area. On the other hand, the surface roughness (such as Ra) reflects a state of the surface of the material on a predetermined straight line. It is therefore considered that the 60 degree specular gloss reflects the state of a locally existing oxide film and foreign matters on the surface of the material better than the surface roughness.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> -->The buff 6 is hollow cylindrical, and grinding grains are attached to the surface thereof. By rotating the buff 6 in a forward direction, i.e., a threading direction of the copper alloy plate 2 (from left to right in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>), the grinding grains of the buff 6 grinds the surface of the copper alloy plate 2. Accordingly, a degree of the oxide film removal by the buffing process can be adjusted by a grain size (count) of respective grinding grains, a threading number of the copper alloy plate 2, a threading speed (line speed), a rotation number of the buff 6 and the like.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Also, the surface roughness Ra (RD) in the rolling direction is preferably 0.07 µm or less. If the Ra (RD) is less than 0.07 µm, the zero cross time may be decreased.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to the present invention, a peak position in the frequency distribution graph of concave-convex components on the surface in the direction transverse to rolling direction can be specified. Here, the frequency distribution graph of the concave-convex components on the surface is identical with that described in Patent Literature 2, and is a plot where a horizontal axis represents a height from a mean line for the roughness profile and a vertical axis represents a frequency (measurement data numbers). According to the present invention, the horizontal axis is at 0.05 µm intervals (increments in between) for the mean line for the roughness profile and the measurement data numbers at the intervals are summed up as the frequency to generate the plot. The "mean line for the roughness profile" is specified in JIS-B0601.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Specifically, the frequency distribution graph is created as follows: (1) Firstly, "the height from a mean line for the roughness profile" is measured along a direction transverse to rolling direction of a sample. In other words, there are provided data of the height from the mean line for the roughness profile (hereinafter referred to as "measurement data" as appropriate) per surface position. The peak position or the like is determined from the resultant measurement data, and the measurement data is numerically treated to calculate Ra and Rz. (2) The height from the "mean line for the roughness profile" is delimited at 0.05 µm intervals. (3) The measurement data numbers (frequency) are counted at the 0.05 µm intervals.<br/>
To provide the measurement data, measurement is made at an evaluation lenghth of 1.25 mm, a cut off value of 25 mm (in accordance with JIS-80601) and a scan speed of 0.1 mm/sec. For the measurement, a surface roughness meter manufactured<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> by Kosaka Laboratory Ltd. (Surfcorder SE3400) is used. The measurement data numbers are 7500 points at an evaluation lenghth of 1.25 mm.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Also, the method of measuring the peak position is identical with that described in Patent Literature 2. The resultant measurement data is categorized as follows: When the height from "the mean line for the roughness profile" is more than 0, the data is categorized as upper (plus) components. When the height is less than 0, the data is categorized as lower (minus) components. Thus, the frequency distribution is plotted. The height (µm) from "the mean line for the roughness profile" is replotted on the horizontal axis. The measurement data numbers are replotted as the frequency summed up at 0.05 µm intervals on the vertical axis. Thus, <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">3</figref> are provided (corresponding to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> in Patent Literature 2). In <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">3</figref>, at the height from "the mean line for the roughness profile" of the horizontal axis of 0 µm, a line is drawn to determined that the peak position of the frequency is a concave component (at a minus side), a convex component (at a plus side) or (0).<br/>
Here, the "peak position" is determined as follows: Firstly, from the graphs (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">3</figref>) of a height from "the mean line for a frequency-roughness curve", the frequency having the highest value is denoted as P1 and the frequency having the second highest value is denoted as P2. (1) When P1 and P2 are in the minus side or when P2/P1 &lt; 99% and P1 is in the minus side, the peak position of the frequency is a concave component (at a minus side). (2) When P1 and P2 are in the plus side or when P2/P1 &lt; 99% and P1 is in the plus side, the peak position of the frequency is a convex component (at a plus side). (3) When P2/P1 =&gt; 99% (except that both P1 and P2 are in the minus side and both P1 and P2 are in the plus side), the peak position of the frequency is 0.<br/>
Here, a line wherein the height from the mean line for the roughness profile being 0 µm is the mean line for the roughness profile.<br/>
When the peak positions measured three times may be in plus and minus and the peaks are in the upper (plus) components two times, they are considered as in the convex component side.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> is a graph replotted by the frequency (%) on the vertical axis and the height (µm) from the mean line for the roughness profile on the horizontal axis about actual measurement data in Example 4 described later.<br/>

In <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, the peak position in the frequency distribution graph of the concave-convex components on the surface is at the plus side (a convex component side) of the mean line for the roughness profile. In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, the peak position is at the minus side (a concave component side) of the mean line for the roughness profile. In other words, according to the present invention (for example, <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> and Example 4), even when the peak position is in the minus side (the concave component side), a wetting property is good. The wetting property does not depend on the peak position. In Example 18, the peak position is in the plus position because an acid pickling solution is changed upon acid pickling.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The method of measuring the surface roughness Ra, Rz is identical with that described in Patent Literature 2 and measurement is made at an evaluation length of 1.25 mm, a cut off value of 25 mm (in accordance with JIS-80601) and a scan speed of 0.1 mm/sec.

An acid pickling solution used for the acid pickling before the buffing was a solution of dilute sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid or dilute nitric acid at a concentration of 20 to 30% by mass at pH = 1 or less. An immersion time in the acid pickling was 60 to 180 seconds. A buffing material used for the buffing was alumina grinding grains, and a nylon non-woven cloth containing the alumina. Buff materials having different buff texture roughnesses (counts of grinding grains) were used. The count of the grinding grains represents the grinding grains by the number of mesh per inch, and is specified by JIS R6001. For example, when the count is 1000, an average size of the grinding grains will be 18 to 14.5 µm.

for a sufficient number of times using a relatively fine textured<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> buff (grinding grains) after a final heat treatment (stress relief annealed), the solder wettability was excellent, and the pin holes are decreased. In each Example, {(60 degree specular gloss G(RD) in a rolling direction) - (60 degree specular gloss G(TD) in a direction transverse to rolling direction)} =&gt; 90%. It is considered that the oxide film on the surface of the material and the foreign matters pushed are sufficiently removed and the surface becomes smooth.<br/>
The buffing with acid pickling in each Example was conducted under the conditions: grinding grains of 2000 counts or more, threading time of two or more, threading speed of 10 mpm or less, and rotating number of 1200 rpm or more. It should be appreciated that these optimum ranges are changed depending on a production apparatus.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">On the other hand, in each of Comparative Examples where the buffing with acid pickling was conducted insufficiently, the oxide film on the surface of the material and the foreign matters pushed are not sufficiently removed. Therefore, in each Comparative Example, {(60 degree specular gloss G(RD) in a rolling direction) - (60 degree specular gloss G(TD) in a direction transverse to rolling direction)} &lt; 90%. The pin holes are increased, and the solder wettability was degraded when the oxide film was remained largely.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">A cause of degradation may be that when the buffing with acid pickling was conducted in Comparative Examples 1, 2, 15, 17 and 19, the threading speed exceeded 20 mpm.<br/>
The cause of degradation may be that in Comparative Examples 3, 5, 8 and 20 the threading time was less than two. Notably, in Comparative Example 20, the buffing with acid pickling was conducted using the above-described method A after the final rolling.<br/>
The cause of degradation may be that in Comparative Example 13 no buffing was conducted although acid pickling was conducted.<br/>
In Comparative Examples 6 and 7 where the count of the grinding grains used in the buffing with acid pickling was 4000, the grinding grains were too fine to grind, and it is thus considered that Ra(RD) is not so decreased.<br/>
The cause of degradation may be that, in Comparative Examples 11 and 12, the rotating number in the buffing with acid pickling was less than 1200 rpm.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> -->In Comparative Examples 9 and 10, the grinding grains were coarse and the surface after the buffing with acid pickling became roughened, {(60 degree specular gloss G(RD) in a rolling direction) - (60 degree specular gloss G(TD) in a direction transverse to rolling direction)} &lt; 90%, the pin holes are increased and the zero cross time was bad. It is considered that, since the count of the grinding grains used in the buffing with acid pickling was 500, the grinding grains were too coarse.<br/>
The cause of degradation may be that, in Comparative Examples 4, 14, 16, 18 and 21 where no buffing with acid pickling was conducted after the final rolling, the oxide film on the surface and the foreign matters pushed were not removed and the rolled surface was left as it is. Comparative Example 21 was similar to each Example except that the roughness of the mill rolls of the final rolling was finer.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In Comparative Examples 16 and 18, the treatment (acid pickling or degreasing) was conducted before the finish rolling and no buffing with acid pickling was conducted. As a result, the peak position was at the plus side (at the convex component side) of the mean line for the roughness profile (0 position in the frequency distribution graph representing the concave-convex components on the surface). In other words, these Comparative Examples show the copper alloy plate described in Patent Literature 2.<br/>
In Comparative Examples 4, 13, 16 and 21, the zero cross time exceeded 2.0 sec and the solder wettability was degraded. It is considered that, since no acid pickling and no buffing were conducted, the oxide film remained on the surface of the metal (Comparative Example 16 corresponds to the conditions described in Patent Literature 2).</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977211" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A Co-Si based copper alloy plate, comprising:
