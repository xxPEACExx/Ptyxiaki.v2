Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a connector, and more particularly to a needle-free syringe adapter that has superior hermetic characteristics to prevent backflow of liquid medicine and injection of air.</p><heading id="h0003">2. The Prior Arts</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Needle syringes are common medical implements for injection liquid medicine into patients. However, the needle syringes are dangerous and need recycle procedures that increase the cost of medical treatment.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Therefore, a needle-free syringe has been developed and may be connected to an adapter that is mounted on a cannula. The needle-free syringe has low hazard and may be reused to lower the cost of medical treatment.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A conventional connector for a needle syringe has a considerable vacant space and has an unsatisfied hermetic characteristic so that an appreciable amount of liquid medicine and air easily remain in the connector after an injection procedure is implemented. When the connector is connected to a needle-free syringe for another injection procedure, the aforementioned remaining liquid medicine and air are injected into the patient's blood vessel by a positive pressure difference between the adapter and the patient's inside. The patient's blood vessel is expanded inadvertently and causes pain. When the injection procedure is finished and the needle-free syringe is disconnected from the adapter, the blood and the liquid medicine in the blood vessel flow reversely backwards into the inner space of the adapter due to the negative pressure. Therefore, the inadvertent expansion during the aforementioned injection procedure makes patients feel pain. The reverse flow of the blood and the liquid medicine into the adapter repeatedly mixes new liquid medicine in subsequent injection procedures to lower the curative effect of the liquid medicine and probably cause drug allergy.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US8277424B"><text>US patent No. 8,277,424</text></patcit> disclosed a needle-less syringe adapter. The piercing conduit has a planar top end and a planar bottom end. When the piercing conduit is inserted and assembled into the resilient valve, the resilient valve is easily scratched and even damaged by the planar top and bottom ends of the piercing conduit. Furthermore, the resilient valve is repeatedly extruded and contracted in the process of assembly and disassembly with the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> piercing conduit, so that the resilient valve is easily deformed even loosened from the piercing conduit.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">To overcome the above shortcomings, the present invention provides a needle-free syringe connector to mitigate or obviate the aforementioned problems.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">A primary objective of the present invention is to provide a needle-free medicine injection connector that has superior hermetic characteristics to prevent backflow of the liquid medicine and injection of air which causes patient's pain feeling.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">To achieve the above objectives, a needle-free medicine injection connector according to the present invention comprises: a covering part with an injection port, at least one air vent provided on the covering part, a positioning notch and a groove configured on an out surface of the covering part; a connecting part with an inner cavity, the cavity having a bottom, a piercing passage defined through the connecting part, a hole defined at a side of the bottom, the connecting part having a positioning projection for engagement with the groove of the covering part, wherein the connecting part has a protruding part for engagement with the positioning notch of the covering part for preventing the connecting part from slippage or coming off when a syringe is attached with the injection port; and a valve unit installed in the cavity of the connecting part, the valve unit comprising a piercing conduit member and a resilient valve composed of a top half valve and a bottom half valve.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The top half valve has a first resilient part. One end of the first resilient part has a top surface, and a top slit is defined on the top surface of the top half valve. The top surface of the top half valve has a rim for sealing the injection port. The other end of the first resilient part has a first engaging portion having a first passage defined there through and communicated with the top slit. The first engaging portion of the top half valve has a first mounting part.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The bottom half valve has a second resilient part. One end of the second resilient part has a base, and a bottom slit is defined on the base of the bottom half valve. The other end of the second resilient part has a second engaging portion having a second passage defined there through and communicated with the bottom slit. The second engaging portion of the bottom half valve has a second mounting part.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The piercing conduit member is installed between the top half valve and the bottom half valve, the piercing conduit member has a main positioning part disposed between a first engaging portion of the top half valve and a second engaging portion of the bottom half valve, a flowing passage is defined through the piercing conduit member, the flowing passage<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> has two openings at both ends thereof, a first opening at one end and a second opening at the other end thereof, the second opening is connected to the hole of the bottom of the connecting part.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">When the needle-free syringe is not inserted into the injection port, the top half valve of the resilient valve seals the top injection opening. The top and bottom slits of the resilient valve are both closed and no air leakages. The close state could prevent air or medicine backflow to patient's body. When the needle-free syringe is inserted into the top injection port of the covering part and compresses the top of the resilient valve, the top slit of the resilient valve is pierced and opened by the piercing conduit member and the flow passage of the piercing conduit member communicates with the needle-free syringe.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">When the injection procedure is finished and the needle-free syringe is removed, the top and bottom slits recover to the close state. The compressed top half valve and the bottom half valve recover to its original position along with the piercing conduit member.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Before the connection of the needle-free syringe, the resilient valve hermetically closes the top and bottom slits to prevent ambient air or liquid medicine and blood of the patient's blood vessel from flowing into the resilient valve. After the removal of the needle-free syringe, the compressed resilient valve recover fast along the slope of the piercing conduit member to immediately close the top and bottom slits to prevent any reverse flow of air, liquid medicine and blood. Therefore, the needle-free syringe adapter reduces the patient's pain which caused by either negative or positive pressure. In addition, it prevents the possibility of patient's contamination.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">When a user inserts a syringe into the injection port of the covering part and compresses the top surface, the top half valve of the resilient valve compresses the bottom half valve subsequently. In the meantime, the first resilient part and the second resilient part contract and make both of the top half valve and the bottom half valve shorter.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Under this situation, the openings of the piercing conduit member would come out of the top slit and the bottom slit through the first passage and the second passage. Therefore the second opening would connect the hole of the covering part. When this situation is present, an interflowing state is constructed among the needle-free syringe, the piercing conduit member, and the covering part's passage.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Under this connective state, the user can inject medicine into catheter from the syringe and through the piercing conduit member, and make the dosed medicine effect better.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">The present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art by reading the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment thereof, with reference to the attached drawings, in which:</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a needle-free medicine injection connector in accordance with the present invention;</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is an exploded perspective view of the needle-free medicine injection connector of the present invention ;</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the needle-free medicine injection connector of the present invention;</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a syringe inserted into the needle-free medicine injection connector of the present invention; and</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> is a perspective view of the piercing conduit member of the needle-free medicine injection connector in accordance with the present invention.</p><heading id="h0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p0024" num="0024">The accompanying drawings are included to provide a further understanding of the invention, and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification.

The resilient material could be silicon or other resilient objects. The piercing conduit member (33) mentioned above is relatively made from hard material.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">When the present invention is set on the infusion set's catheter or the cap of Intravenous drip tube, the hospital personnel would be ready to inject medicine into patient with the present invention. Hospital personnel would connect the needle-free syringe (9) with the injection part (10) of the covering part (1), then the injector (90) compress the top surface (312) of the top half valve; the top half valve (31) would compress the bottom half valve (32) subsequently. As a result, first resilient part (311) of the top half valve (31) and the second resilient part (321) of the bottom half valve (32) contract and shorten under pressure and. In the meantime, the first opening (3301) of piercing conduit member (33) would drill through top slit (3120) along first passage (3130); the second opening (3302) of piercing conduit member (33) would drill through bottom slit (3230) along second passage. At this point, the second opening (3302) connects the hole (230) at the bottom part (23).</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Therefore, a connective state is constructed by injector (90) of needle-free syringe (9), flowing passage (330) of piercing conduit member (33) and connecting part (2). At this moment, user could inject medicine into the injection port (10) from needle-free syringe (9), making liquid medicine flow to catheter through flowing passage (330) of piercing conduit member (33) and conduit (231) of connecting part (2).</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">When the injector (90) screws onto the injection part (10) of the covering part (1), the air inside covering part (1) exhaust from air vent (100). On the contrary, when injector (90) is detached from injection part (10), the air outside flow in through air vent (100). Under this structure, no positive or negative air pressure would occur whether attachment or detachment of injector (90) of syringe. In addition, there are indentations (not specified) along the first engaging portion (313). The indentation allows air to flow fluently inside covering part, preventing the first engaging portion (313) from rough motion caused from jammed air.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">With reference to the structure, it is very easy to assemble and disassemble the present invention. Because the flowing passage (330) of piercing conduit member (33) is straight, the injection is very smooth and hard to have jam, dysfunction or influent flow. Also it<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> is easy to clean the present invention with little water, and it is suitable for repeating use which makes the medical cost to decrease.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Before the needle-free syringe (9) is connected with present invention, the top half valve (31) and the bottom half valve (32) remain the original form and are not deformed by outer force. Top slit (3120) bottom slit (3230) remain airtight state which effectively prevent the backflow of medicine or blood inside patient's blood stream. After the needle-free syringe (9) is removed from the present invention, the vertically compressed top half valve (31) and bottom half valve (32) would come back to their original from along the piercing conduit member (33). Therefore the top slit (3120) and bottom slit (3230) get back to closure and airtight state. As a result of the technology of no backflow, the present invention could significantly reduce pain feeling for patients.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In addition, the first passage (3130)'s inner surface has contractive effect to prevent medicine from infiltrating into the first resilient part (311)'s inter space.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">By means of the above mentioned special design of the valve unit (3), residual of inner air, medicine or back flow could be reduced to the minimum degree. In addition, effective element of negative or positive pressure could be minimized to even zero to reduce the possibility of patient's infection.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In summary, the content of technology of the present invention conforms to the requirement of new patent, and it is practically used in medical industry now. Before the application, the present invention's technical feature is not published or used publicly. Further, the present invention effectively resolves the mid-term and long-term problem of previous medical technology, and it also meets needs of related users.
