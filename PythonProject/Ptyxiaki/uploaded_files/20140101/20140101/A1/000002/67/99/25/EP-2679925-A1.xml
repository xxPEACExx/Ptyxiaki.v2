The triplex cable includes a power wire, a communication wire and a shared wire for power and communication (also collectively called indoor and outdoor wires). The outdoor unit and each of the indoor units transmit and receive a voltage signal based on the potential difference between the communication wire and the shared wire of the triplex cable to communicate with each other, and they receive AC power via the power wire and the shared wire to perform air conditioning.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">This use of the triplex cable simplifies and avoids laying a dedicated communication wire separately.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In such a system using the triplex cable, a measure to prevent miswiring of the cable is essential. In the air conditioning system disclosed in the above Patent Literature 1, a communication circuit in the outdoor unit and each of the indoor units includes a high-voltage photo coupler. With the photo coupler, the communication circuit can be produced at low cost.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a schematic configuration of a conventional air conditioning system 101 that uses a triplex cable. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref>, a power wire 2 and a shared wire for power and communication (a shared wire) 4, which are<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> connected to an alternating-current power source (AC power source) 1, and a communication wire 3 are integrated into one triplex cable 5.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">To this triplex cable 5 are connected, in parallel, an outdoor unit 30 and a plurality of indoor units 31.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">To one of the indoor units 31 is connected a remote controller 32 via a remote control wire 13, which is a duplex cable. The remote control 32 is directly connected to only one of the indoor units for simplifying laying work. The remote controller 32 communicates with the indoor unit 31 via the duplex remote controller wire 13. The remote controller 32 may have a built-in DC power source for operation or may receive DC power from the indoor unit 31.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Due to configurational restriction of the communication circuit such as use of a high-voltage photo coupler, communication between the outdoor unit 30 and each of the indoor units 31 is performed, for example, according to the procedure illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11A</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11A</figref>, in this communication procedure, the communication master is the outdoor unit 30, and the indoor units 31 are slaves. As a modulation system (serial transmission system) of data to be transmitted, various systems are used, such as a baseband system, for example, an AMI (Alternate Mark Inversion) code, an NRZ (Non Return to Zero) code and a Manchester code.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">More specifically, communication is always performed in the form of a response of the indoor unit 31 to a request from the outdoor unit 30, that is, in the form of polling from the outdoor unit 30. The outdoor unit 30 performs polling for each of the indoor units 31 in a predetermined order. This polling is repeated.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">If the indoor units 31 communicate with each other, the outdoor unit 30 relays the communication. An indoor unit 31 transmits transmission data for another indoor unit 31 to the outdoor unit 30 in the form of a response to a request from the outdoor unit 30. The outdoor unit 30 transmits a request to the other indoor unit 31 that is the destination, the request including the transmission data included in the response.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11B</figref> illustrates a path of data to be transmitted from the remote controller 32 to an indoor unit 31 that is not directly connected to the remote controller 32.

Therefore, an indoor unit cannot transmit data to the outdoor unit before the indoor unit has a polling turn. Thus, it is difficult for an indoor unit to quickly notify the outdoor unit of, for example, a failure of the indoor unit, depending on timing.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Communication between indoor units and communication between a remote controller and an indoor unit are always performed via the outdoor unit, which at least doubles the communication volume and increases communication traffic, thereby increasing time until completion of communication.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In a conventional air conditioning system, such a background makes it difficult to realize cooperative control of a plurality of indoor units.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In addition, in the conventional air conditioning system, if a remote controller is used to operate an indoor unit that is not directly connected to the remote controller, the path for operation command data to be transmitted from the remote controller to the indoor unit is long, which takes time until the operation command has reached the indoor unit. Therefore, there is an inconvenience of a slow response speed of the system. For example, the indoor unit starts its operation in a few seconds after<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> pressing a power button.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The present invention was made in view of the above circumstance, and has an objective to provide an air conditioning apparatus and an air conditioning system that still use one triplex cable to perform supply of AC power and data communication and also permit rapid communication between air conditioning apparatuses.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">In order to achieve the above objective, an air conditioning apparatus according to the present invention is connected to a triplex cable that includes a power wire, a communication wire and a shared wire for power and communication, and includes a modulator, a demodulator, a connector and a controller. The modulator modulates a voltage signal corresponding to inputted transmission data and outputs the signal as a voltage signal between the communication wire and the shared wire for power and communication. The demodulator demodulates a voltage signal based on the potential difference between the communication wire and the shared wire for power and communication and outputs the signal as a demodulated signal. The connector comprises a high-voltage capacitor and connects the communication wire and the shared wire for power and communication to the modulator and the demodulator via the high-voltage capacitor that withstands voltages up to a predetermined level. The controller receives, as incoming data, serial data corresponding to a voltage signal demodulated in the demodulator if the serial data includes an address of the air conditioning apparatus, monitors a demodulated signal outputted from the demodulator; and outputs the transmission data that includes a destination address to the modulator if the controller determines that no signal is being transmitted through the communication wire.</p><heading id="h0008">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the present invention, the connector connects the modulator and demodulator to the communication wire and shared wire for power and communication<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> via a high-voltage capacitor. This prevents the failure of the apparatus due to miswiring of the triplex cable.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Further, the controller monitors a signal demodulated in the demodulator, transmits transmission data that includes a destination address via the communication wire or the like while a signal is not being transmitted through the communication wire, and receives incoming data corresponding a signal transmitted through the communication wire if the incoming data includes the address of an apparatus to which the controller belongs. This permits one-on-one communication between air conditioning apparatuses without a relay unit. As a result, in a connection configuration in which supply of AC power and data communication are performed with the use of one triplex cable, fast communication can be performed.</p><heading id="h0009">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a schematic configuration of an air conditioning system according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a detailed configuration of the air conditioning apparatus in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref> is transmission data before modulation; <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3B</figref> is a modulated signal; <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3C</figref> is incoming data after demodulation;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are circuit diagrams of a connector in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram for explaining communication operation of the air conditioning system in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a schematic configuration of an air conditioning system according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> are circuit diagrams of a remote controller wire connector in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a schematic configuration of a remote controller;<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a schematic configuration of an air conditioning system according to Embodiment 3 of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a schematic configuration of a conventional air conditioning system;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11A</figref> is a diagram illustrating communication procedure of a conventional air conditioning system; and <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11B</figref> is a diagram for explaining a path of data transmitted from a remote controller.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010">Description of Embodiments</heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to drawings.</p><heading id="h0011">Embodiment 1</heading><p id="p0023" num="0023">Embodiment 1 of the present invention will be described.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a schematic configuration of an air conditioning system 100 in the present embodiment.
