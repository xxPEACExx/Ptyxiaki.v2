a hydraulic shock absorber in an outer cylinder integrated with a main shaft is combined with a coil spring. Among such suspensions, there is a type in which when the strut assembly rotates together with the coil spring in the steering operation, the piston rod of the strut assembly rotates, and there is another type in which the piston rod does not rotate. In either type, there are cases where, instead of a rolling bearing, a synthetic resin-made thrust sliding bearing is used between a mechanism for mounting the strut assembly to the vehicle body and an upper spring seat member of the coil spring, so as to allow smooth rotation of the strut assembly.</p><heading id="h0003">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT

surface of the inner cylindrical portion of the upper casing and the large-diameter cylindrical inner surface of the inner surface of the cylindrical portion of the lower casing.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the synthetic resin-made thrust sliding bearing in accordance with the present invention, the outer elastic seal member is in contact with the small-diameter cylindrical outer surface of the outer surface of the cylindrical portion of the lower casing at its inner elastically deformable lip portion formed integrally on the cylindrical inner surface in such a manner as to project diagonally inwardly and upwardly from that cylindrical inner surface, and is also in contact with the truncated cone-shaped inner surface of the inner surface of the outer cylindrical portion of the upper casing at its outer elastically deformable lip portion formed integrally on the cylindrical outer surface in such a manner as to project diagonally outwardly and downwardly from that cylindrical outer surface, and is further contact with the annular stepped surface of the outer surface of the cylindrical portion of the lower casing at its annular lower surface. The inner elastic seal member is in contact with the intermediate cylindrical inner surface of the inner surface of the cylindrical portion of the lower casing at its outer elastically deformable lip portion formed integrally on the cylindrical inner surface in such a manner as to project diagonally outwardly and upwardly from that cylindrical outer surface, is also in contact with the small-diameter cylindrical outer surface of the outer surface of the inner cylindrical portion of the upper casing at its inner elastically deformable lip portion formed integrally on the cylindrical<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> inner surface in such a manner as to project diagonally inwardly and downwardly from that cylindrical inner surface, and is further in contact with the lower annular stepped surface of the inner surface of the cylindrical portion of the lower casing at its annular lower surface. Therefore, even under severe conditions, it is possible to effectively prevent the ingress of dust, muddy water and the like into an annular space, which is located between the annular lower surface of the upper annular plate-like portion and the annular upper surface of the cylindrical portion of the lower casing to accommodate the annular plate-like portion of the thrust sliding bearing piece, through the annular gap between the annular lower end surface of the outer cylindrical portion of the upper casing and the annular upper surface of the lower annular plate-like portion of the lower casing and through the annular gap between the annular lower end surface of the inner cylindrical portion of the upper casing and the lower annular stepped surface of the cylindrical portion of the lower casing, thereby making it possible to reduce the generation of abnormal noise due to the ingress of dust, muddy water and the like.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the present invention, the inner surface of the outer cylindrical portion of the upper casing may have a cylindrical inner surface which is continuously connected at an annular upper end thereof to the annular lower end of the truncated cone-shaped inner surface and is continuously connected at an annular lower end thereof to the annular inner edge of the annular lower end surface of the outer cylindrical portion of the upper casing, or the inner surface of the outer cylindrical portion of the upper casing may have an upwardly truncated conical surface continuously connected to the annular lower end of the truncated cone-shaped inner surface at a large-diameter annular upper end thereof and having a small-diameter annular lower end smaller in diameter than the large-diameter annular upper end, and a downwardly truncated conical surface<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> continuously connected to the small-diameter annular lower end of the upwardly truncated conical surface at a small-diameter annular upper end thereof and having a large-diameter annular lower end larger in diameter than the small-diameter annular upper end.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In addition, in the present invention, each of the outer elastic seal member and the inner elastic seal member may include an elastic seal body having corresponding ones of the elastically deformable lip portions and a metal core embedded in the elastic seal body.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In a preferred example, the lower casing may have a plurality of projecting portions formed integrally on the annular upper surface of its cylindrical portion and spaced apart from each other in the direction about the axis, and the annular plate-like portion of the thrust sliding bearing piece may have a plurality of recessed portions or notches for receiving respective ones of the plurality of projecting portions of the lower casing. In consequence of this, the thrust sliding bearing piece concerning the rotation about the axis becomes fixed with respect to the lower casing and becomes rotatable with respect to the upper casing, with the result that the upper casing becomes rotatable with respect to the lower casing about the axis of the upper casing.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In another preferred example, the annular lower surface of the outer elastic seal member may have at least one elastically deformable annular projecting surface, and the annular lower surface of the inner elastic seal member may have at least one elastically deformable annular projecting surface. If such elastically deformable annular projecting surfaces are provided, the sealability of the annular lower surface of<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the outer elastic seal member and the annular lower surface of the inner elastic seal member can be improved by the elastic deformation of these annular projecting surfaces, so that the ingress of dust, muddy water and the like into the annular space accommodating the annular plate-like portion of the thrust sliding bearing piece can be prevented more effectively, thereby making it possible to more satisfactorily reduce the generation of abnormal noise due to the ingress of dust, muddy water and the like.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In addition, in the present invention, the outer surface of the cylindrical portion of the lower casing may have a radially projecting cylindrical outer surface continuously connected to the annular upper surface of the cylindrical portion at an annular upper edge and having a larger diameter than the small-diameter cylindrical outer surface with which the inner elastically deformable lip portion of the outer elastic seal member is in contact, while the small-diameter cylindrical outer surface, with which the inner elastically deformable lip portion of the outer elastic seal member is in contact, may be disposed in the axial direction between the radially projecting cylindrical outer surface and the annular stepped surface with which the annular lower surface of the outer elastic seal member is in contact, whereas the inner surface of the cylindrical portion of the lower casing may have an axially projecting annular stepped surface which is continuously connected to the annular upper edge of the large-diameter cylindrical inner surface of the cylindrical portion at an annular inner edge thereof and which is closer to an annular lower end surface of the inner cylindrical portion of the upper casing in the axial direction than the lower annular stepped surface with which the annular lower surface of the inner elastic seal member is in contact, while the lower annular stepped surface, with which the annular lower surface of the inner elastic seal member is in contact, may be disposed in the radial direction between the axially<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> projecting annular stepped surface and the intermediate cylindrical inner surface.
