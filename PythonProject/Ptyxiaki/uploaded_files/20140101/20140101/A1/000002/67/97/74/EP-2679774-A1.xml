In particular embodiments, the transition duct includes a heat shield that extends at least partially across a downstream end of the transition duct.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Turbine systems are widely used in fields such as power generation. For example, a conventional gas turbine system includes a compressor, one or more combustors, and a turbine. In a conventional gas turbine system, compressed air is provided from the compressor to the one or more combustors. The air entering the one or more combustors is mixed with fuel and combusted. Hot gases of combustion flow from each of one or more combustors through a transition duct and into the turbine to drive the gas turbine system and generate power.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In certain combustor designs, a frame may surround an aft end of the transition duct. The frame may generally include a downstream end having an inner portion, an outer portion, and a pair of side portions. The frame downstream end may be positioned adjacent to the turbine. As a result, the frame downstream end may be exposed to extreme thermal stresses caused by the hot gases flowing from the transition duct into the turbine. In particular, as the hot gases flow from adjacent transition ducts, a hot gas recirculation zone may be formed downstream from the transition ducts downstream ends in a volume that extends between the adjacent transition ducts. As a result, a portion of the hot gases flowing into the turbine may be focused on the downstream ends of the adjacent transition ducts frames, causing high temperatures and consequent high thermal stresses.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Current methods to reduce the temperatures and thermal stresses and to enhance the mechanical life of the frame, particularly downstream end of the frame, includes machining cooling passages through the frame downstream end so that a cooling<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> medium such as the compressed air from the compressor may flow through the passages to cool the frame. There is a desire for a transition duct that includes a heat shield to shield at least a portion of the frame downstream end from the hot gases would be useful, since it would reduce frame temperature and thermal stresses and reduce or eliminate the need for machined cooling passages.</p><heading id="h0003">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Aspects and advantages of the invention are set forth below in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">One aspect of the present invention is a transition duct for a gas turbine.

In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit thereof. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment may be used on another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Various embodiments of the present invention include a transition duct for a combustor of a gas turbine. The transition duct generally includes a tubular body having a forward end, an aft end and a frame that at least partially surrounds the aft end. The frame generally includes a downstream end. In particular embodiments, the frame includes a slot that extends through a side portion of the frame, and a heat shield at least partially disposed within the slot. The slot may include a downstream surface that is generally adjacent to the frame downstream end. The heat shield may include an outer surface and an inner surface. The slot inner surface generally contours around a portion of the slot downstream surface, the frame side portion and may be generally adjacent to at least a portion of the frame downstream end. In particular embodiments, a plurality of spacers may extend from the heat shield inner surface towards the frame downstream end, the frame side portion and/or the slot downstream surface, thus allowing a portion of a compressed working fluid to flow between the heat shield and the frame downstream end, thereby reducing thermal stresses on the frame side portion and the downstream end. In addition, the heat shield provides a protective barrier between hot gases of combustion and the frame downstream end, thereby resulting in improved mechanical life of the transition duct. Although exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described generally in the context of a transition duct incorporated into a combustor of an industrial gas turbine for purposes of illustration, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that embodiments of the present invention may be applied to any transition duct and are not limited to an industrial gas turbine combustor unless specifically recited in the claims.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> provides a schematic of an exemplary gas turbine, and <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> provides a cross section of a combustor of the gas turbine as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a gas turbine 10 generally includes a compressor 12, a plurality of combustors 14 downstream from the compressor 12 and a turbine section 16 downstream from the plurality of combustors 14. The plurality of combustors 14 may be arranged in an annular array about an axial centerline of the gas turbine 10. The turbine section 16 may generally include alternating stages of stationary vanes 18 and rotating blades 20.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The rotating blades 20 may be coupled to a shaft 22 that extends through the turbine section 16. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1 and 2</figref>, each of the plurality of combustors 14 may include an end cover 24 at one end and a transition duct 26 at the other end. One or more fuel nozzles 28 may extend generally downstream from the end cover 24. A combustion liner 30 may at least partially surround and extend generally downstream from the one or more fuel nozzles 28. The transition duct 26 may extend downstream from the combustion liner 30 and may terminate adjacent to a first stage of the stationary vanes 18. A casing 32 generally surrounds each of the plurality of combustors 14.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In operation, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a working fluid 34 such as air enters the compressor 12 and, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1 and 2</figref>, the working fluid flows into the combustor casing 32 as a compressed working fluid 36. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, a portion of the compressed working fluid 36 flows across the transition duct 26 and through an annular passage 38 at least partially defined between the combustion liner 30 and the casing 32 before reversing direction at the end cover 24. At least some of the portion of the compressed working fluid 36 is mixed with fuel from the one or more fuel nozzles 28 within a combustion chamber 40, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1 and 2</figref>, that may be at least partially defined inside the combustion liner 30. The compressed working fluid 36 and fuel mixture is burned to produce a rapidly expanding hot gas 42. The hot gas 42 flows from the combustion liner 30 through the transition duct 26 and into the turbine section 16 where energy from the hot gas 42 is transferred to the various stages of rotating blades 20 attached to the shaft 22, thereby causing the shaft 22 to rotate and produce mechanical work. The remaining portion of the compressed working fluid 36 may be utilized primarily for cooling various components within the plurality of the combustors 14 and the turbine section 16 of the gas turbine 10.
