A different orientation of a folding line, like transverse with respect to the wall element direction is not possible.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In general, the traditional shape of a honeycomb surface is based on a 2D shaping. Traditional products are flat panels or similar products. In the development of lightweight products, the need for 3D honeycomb is emerging though still not yet answered by the industry.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0002"><b>Summary of the invention</b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">The invention aims to be able to realize a 3D formability in all directions for a core according to the introductory portion of claim 1 while maintaining the size of the cells, which allows an optimal support for the skin materials that are to be applied on to the core, also honeycomb grid, to form a panel.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In known applications the honeycomb structure is able to support a 2D grid with maintaining the size of the support. Then a 3D applications is not possible because due to the coupling between the wall element section and the bonded wall element section, the known honeycomb will tear upon double curved bending.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Another object of the invention is to improve the glue bond to allow a better handling in the production of the panel parts in which the honeycomb is applied.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Yet another object of the invention is to provide a continuum in form to be able to absorb shear stresses to a level which are around as high as with standard 2D honeycomb with twice the weight.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Yet another object of the invention core is to provide a cellular core, wherein a problem is at least partly solved.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Yet another object of the invention is to provide an alternative cellular core. According to a first aspect of the invention this is realized with a cellular core having, in an expanded state, a bonding surface area suitable for sandwich type construction, wherein the cellular core comprises a plurality of elongate planar rectangular wall elements which define the depth and height of said core and extend in a core plane in a wall element direction, and wherein, in the expanded state of the cellular core, arrays of closed cells are formed between two adjacent wall elements, and wherein a respective cell is formed by wall element sections and bonded wall element sections of the two adjacent wall elements, wherein the wall element section is configured such that said wall element section is pliable for enabling bonded wall element sections of the expanded core to change their mutual position upon bending of the expanded cellular core.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The wall element section being pliable ensures to maintain the bonding surface area, also referred to as the support grid, formed for the skin material. When the core is curved, the wall element sections ply which enables to curve the core along a folding line which extends transverse with respect to the wall element direction. In contrast, in<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> known cores, folding along a line transverse with respect to the wall element direction is not possible or if forced causes wall element sections to buckle and/or sharply fold which causes a gap left open relative to the desired support grid. The wall element section being pliable enables bonded wall element sections of the expanded core to change their mutual position upon bending of the expanded cellular core. The bonded wall element sections being able to change their mutual position helps even more to facilitate the core to take a double curved position because the bonded sections are relatively free to orient themselves with respect to the curvature. This also aids in maintaining the desired support grid. In contrast, in known cores, the bonded wall element sections extend in line, parallel with respect to the wall element direction. The expression "the wall element section being pliable" has to be interpreted such that the wall element section plies under compressive load. The ply formed in the wall element section is a continuous curve. The deformation is in the elastic domain. Plying is distinct from wrinkle formation which is characterized by deformation in the plastic domain and sharp folding seams being formed in the wall element section.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to a further aspect of the invention the ratio of the tensile strength of a wall element section and the buckling resistance of said wall element section is such that said wall element section is pliable for enabling bonded wall element sections of the expanded core to change their mutual position upon bending of the expanded cellular core. The tensile strength of a wall element section needs to be such that material transport within the core upon bending of the expanded core is possible.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to a further aspect of the invention, the ratio of the bending strength of a wall element section and the tensile strength of a bonded wall element section is such that in the expanded state the core is deformable in the wall element direction and in a direction transverse to the wall element direction.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to a further aspect of the invention, the ratio of the tensile strength of a wall element section and the tensile strength of a bonded wall element section is such that in the expanded state the core is deformable in the wall element direction and in a direction transverse to the wall element direction. The tensile strength of the wall element sections facilitates material transport within the core such that deformation in the wall element direction and in a direction transverse to the wall element direction is possible. Upon deformation, the bonded wall element section is free and may choose another angular position relative to a z-axis which is transverse to the core plane.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> Note : "deformable" is related to folding within elastic conditions, following the Euler equation always below the level were the deformation turns irreversible.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In an embodiment of the cellular core, the core is substantially equally deformable in the wall element direction and in a direction transverse to the wall element direction.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Relative to the centre of the core, deformation is possible towards all the 4 quadrants or any combination thereof, the quadrants being determined by the wall element direction and the direction transverse to the wall element direction of deformation. In contrast, in a prior art core, relative to the centre of the core, deformation is only possible in the direction transverse to the wall element direction.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to a further aspect of the invention, the ratio of the tensile strength of a wall element section and the buckling or folding resistance of said wall element section is such that double curved bending of the cellular core in expanded state is facilitated within the elastic deformation area. Bending means that the core deforms out of its core plane in the z-direction.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In an embodiment of the cellular core according to the invention, the tensile strength and the bonding strength of said bonded wall element section is mainly determined by a bonding means.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In an embodiment of the cellular core, the bonding means comprises an adhesive based on a component or a mixture of components selected from the group, PVA, PVAc, Starch, PUR, hotmelt, hotmelt PUR, UF, resin based and sugar glue types.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In an embodiment of the cellular core, the bonding means provides a bonding cohesion which is higher than the tear or tensile strength of the wall element section. This even more enables material transport within the core upon bending of the expanded core.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In an embodiment of the cellular core, the ratio of the tensile strength of a wall element section and the tensile strength of a bonded wall element section is at least 2. Alternatively or additionally, the ratio is at least such that the wall element is section is bending without influencing the bonded wall element section.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In an embodiment of the cellular core, the ratio of the tensile strength (as expressed in N) of a wall element section and the buckling resistance (as expressed in N) of said wall element section is higher than 1. Alternatively or additionally the ratio is such that a pulling strength (N) of the wall element section on the pulled side, is substantially higher than the buckling resistance (N) of the wall element section on the compressed<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> side, so that the buckling will always take place in all deformation scenario's on the compressed side of the wall element section within the elastic deformation conditions.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The present invention further relates to a panel comprising a cellular core according to any of the preceding claims as well as cover sheets on opposite sides of the cellular core, said cellular core comprising a plurality of elongate planar rectangular wall elements consisting of fibrous material, such as cardboard, which extend in a wall element direction and which are arranged in series next to each other, said wall elements each having alternating bonded wall element sections and free wall element sections, said wall elements being in a state expanded transversely with respect to the wall element direction and defining arrays of cells between two adjacent wall elements, wherein each cell is formed by free wall element sections and bonded wall element sections of adjacent wall elements, and the longitudinal edges of said expanded wall elements defining opposite bonding surface areas bonded to the respective cover sheet.

This is shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">fig. 5</figref> wherein it is clear that bonded wall element sections 7 are oriented quite randomly. This is in contrast with known cores wherein bonded wall element sections 7 cannot (mutually) rotate around their longitudinal axis. In addition, the bonded wall element sections 7 have freedom to orient towards the bonding surface area which is all the more beneficial in terms of allowable compression load for a curved panel (not shown) comprising the core 1. Thus, upon bending of the core 1, the bonded wall element sections 7 themselves hardly deform however may choose another inclination compared to the x direction.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">With this invention therefore a substantial step forward has been made in 3D shaping while maintaining the support grids for the skin materials (not shown).</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The free wall element section 6 is configured such that the ratio of the tensile strength of a free wall element section 6 and the buckling resistance of said free wall element section 6 is such that said wall element section is pliable for enabling bonded wall element sections 6 of the expanded core 1 to change their mutual position upon bending of the expanded cellular core 1. The free wall element section 6 being pliable has to be interpreted such that the free wall element section 6 plies under compressive load which is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">fig. 7</figref>. The ply 8 formed in the free wall element section 6 is a continuous curve. The deformation is in the elastic domain.

The bonding means (not shown) is an adhesive based on a component selected from the group, PVA, PVAc, Starch, PUR, hotmelt, hotmelt PUR, UF or sugar glue types, or a mix of any of these components. The adhesive realizes a bonding cohesion between the two bonded wall element sections 7 which bonding cohesion is higher than the tear or tensile strength of the free wall element section 6, usually paper, itself. The ratio of the tensile strength of a free wall element section 6 and the tensile strength of two bonded wall element sections 7 is between 1 to 2 or is such that the free wall element section 6 is buckling without influencing the bonded wall element section 7.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The ratio of the tensile strength of a free wall element section 6 and the buckling resistance of said free wall element section 6 is between 1 to 2 or such that the pulling strength of the, here paper, of the free wall element section 6 on the pulled side, is substantially higher than the buckling force of the free wall element section 6 on the compressed side, so that the buckling will always take place in all deformation scenario's of the core 1 on the compressed side of the free wall element section 6.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In use, the core 1 is bending in its desired double curved shape.
