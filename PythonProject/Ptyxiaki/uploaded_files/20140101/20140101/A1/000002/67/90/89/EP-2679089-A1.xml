It also relates to a library of chromosome substitution lines and/or introgression lines, and to the use of the libraries of chromosome and introgression lines thus obtained for accelerated plant breeding.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>BACKGROUND</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Plant breeding aims at combining as many advantageous and attractive traits as possible in the same plant genome, with the goal of obtaining an elite plant line or variety. Thereby a plant breeder can take advantage of the genetic variation that occurs within the relevant crop species or within wild (uncultivated and undomesticated) relatives of the same species or genus.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">He can also induce genetic variation in the genome of a plant species of interest by means of mutagenesis by chemical, physical or other means, and search for phenotypic variation that results from the induced genetic variation.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">If he is willing and able to apply a transgenic approach, he can also choose to introduce one or more transgenes into the genome of a crop plant. These transgenes may correspond to genes, gene clusters or intergenic sequences that occur naturally in the same plant species or in a plant species that can be crossed therewith to give rise to fertile offspring. This is known as cisgenesis. Alternatively, they may correspond to synthetic genes or to DNA-fragments from organisms that cannot naturally cross with the plant species of interest, such as plants from another family, or organisms from different taxa, such as<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> animals, fungi, viruses or bacteria. This is called transgenesis. These DNA-sequences are either introduced unchanged into the genome of the plant species of interest, or they are altered in some way, for example by recombinant technology with or without mutagenesis.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Transgenic technologies allow researchers to combine multiple DNA-constructs into the genome of the same plant, and thus to stack or pyramid different traits. This approach can ultimately result in the creation of plants that harbor a multitude of selected traits, by combinatorial stacking/pyramiding of transgenes encoding these traits. However, such transgenic approaches have a number of disadvantages.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The effect and/or functionality of a given transgene often depends strongly on the exact position in the plant genome into which it has been inserted. For any genetically modified lead to receive approval for commercial use and animal and/or human consumption, it needs to undergo very extensive regulatory procedures, which are immensely expensive and time-consuming. Authorization will often only be granted for a specific transgenic insertion event in a given genome. The stacking of multiple transgenes only makes this process more costly, tedious and complex. Also, in important parts of the worldwide food market, transgenic food is not allowed for human consumption.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A plant breeder who does not wish to produce or market transgenic plants will typically rely on classic breeding techniques in order to combine multiple traits of interest in a plant species. The breeding process encompasses a first step of mixing the genomes of two plants by means of crossing, which plants each comprise interesting genetic traits. Subsequently, the presence of the traits of interest needs to be traced among the progeny of the cross<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> of these two plants, which is typically done on the basis of phenotypical analysis and/or genomic testing, such as DNA-marker analysis, Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) detection, DNA-sequencing, etc.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Because the entire genomes of the original plants have been mixed in the F1 product and recombined during meiosis, the various traits of the original parent plants will have been shuffled, and they segregate in the F2 progeny of the cross. The breeder then wishes to fix as many commercially attractive traits as possible in a single plant, while at the same time eliminating as many undesired traits as possible. His goal is the creation of a marketable, commercially attractive product that is competitive and successful in the market, due to e.g. a novel combination of various interesting phenotypical traits.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">To achieve this goal, he needs to repeatedly cross the F1 plants derived from the cross of a parent plant and a donor plant back to the parent plant, and in every generation again select for individuals that harbor all of the desired traits, or as many as practically possible. This process is very time-consuming, as it usually takes at least six backcross generations and large progeny populations to obtain a line that is largely homozygous and resembling the parent plant, and into which one or more desired traits from the donor plant have been introgressed and fixed.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">While some crops, such as lettuce, have a relatively short life cycle, other crops, such as carrot, require two years to produce seed. The generation of a new commercial line can thus easily take up to about 12 to about 20 years in such crops. Also, in the process of selection and subsequent back-crossing, nearly all of the genetic variation that was present in the genome of the donor plant<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> or accession is lost, because the breeder specifically selects for one or a few traits of interest which he had initially identified, mostly phenotypically, in that donor accession. If the population size of each subsequent backcross generation is limited (e.g. due to limited availability of growth space for the plants), the plant breeder will inevitably fail to notice and appreciate other potentially interesting traits that may be contributed by the genome of the donor accession. Classical breeding thus faces the problem of under-exploitation of the vast body of genetic variation that is present in e.g. wild accessions and uncultivated relatives of crop plants.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is an object of the present invention to provide an efficient method for producing non-transgenic plants with genomes into which selected genomic fragments, in particular full chromosomes or parts thereof from other genomes have been introduced. It is a further object of this invention to provide a fast, non-transgenic alternative to classical breeding, wherein hybrids can be efficiently constructed with genomic contributions from more than two parents, and wherein the breeding process can be perpetuated by means of a toolbox which represents as much genetic variation as desired from a given plant species. This toolbox comprises collections of plant lines that each carry a different subset of chromosomes or chromosomal fragments, derived from one or more donor plants. In this application such collections are also referred to as libraries.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Reverse Breeding technology, as described and claimed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO03017753A"><text>WO03/017753</text></patcit>, allows the efficient production of homozygous plants from a heterozygous starting plant. This technology relies on the partial or complete suppression of meiotic recombination to allow the heterozygous starting plant to produce spores in which the chromosomes from the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> parents of that heterozygous starting plant have not been recombined. The parental chromosomes are thus transmitted to the spores and to the next generation in their entirety, without cross-overs with their sister chromatids. The difference between meiosis in the presence and absence of meiotic recombination is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002"><b>Figure 1</b></figref><b>.</b></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">From the spores obtained by the partial or complete suppression of meiotic recombination, haploid plants can be regenerated by means of e.g. androgenesis or gynogenesis protocols, or through the use of haploid inducer systems. The genome of these haploid plants is subsequently doubled. Genome doubling, which may occur spontaneously, or through the addition of mitosis-blocking chemicals such as colchicine, oryzalin or trifluralin, leads to the formation of doubled haploid plants (DH plants, DHs), which are able to produce seeds. In this manner the haploid lines are immortalized.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The DHs resulting from this method have a fully homozygous genome that consists of intact chromosomes that were inherited from the parents of the heterozygous starting plant, without the occurrence of recombination. There are various possible combinations of the original parental chromosomes, and the number of different DH lines depends entirely on the chromosome number of the plant species. Aneuploidy can occur at this stage, as the chromatids migrate randomly to one of the two cell poles during cytokinesis at the end of meiosis. When the resulting spore is euploid, i.e. contains the full complement of haploid chromosomes (n) typical for the species' genome, there are 2<sup>n</sup> possible combinations of the parental chromatids. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003"><b>Figure 2A</b></figref><b>.</b></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Either the DHs correspond exactly to one of the two parents of the heterozygous starting plant, or their<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> genome consists of one or more chromosomes of the first parent combined with the remaining chromosome set of the second parent, to reach the full haploid chromosome number of the species. Such DHs are chromosome substitution lines, in which, when compared to one of the original parents of the heterozygous starting plant, at least one chromosome has been substituted with the intact corresponding chromosome from the other parent, without the occurrence of cross-over. A complete chromosome substitution library comprises all chromosome substitution lines that can be obtained from a given heterozygous starting plant, and hence all possible combinations of chromosomes from both parental lines of that heterozygous plant.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A complete chromosome substitution library can e.g. be obtained directly from a given heterozygous starting plant by means of the partial or complete suppression of meiotic recombination (as in Reverse Breeding), or alternatively, especially when the chromosome number of the species is large, two rounds of partial or complete suppression of meiotic recombination (resembling two rounds of Reverse Breeding) can be required to obtain all possible chromosome substitution lines.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the latter case, two different chromosome substitution lines, obtained through the partial or complete suppression of meiotic recombination, can be crossed, to give rise to a hybrid plant in which some of the chromosomes are present in a homozygous state, while other chromosomes are present in a heterozygous state. Application of the partial or complete suppression of meiotic recombination in this new hybrid plant results in the creation of additional chromosome substitution lines. This way of using meiotic recombination suppression in multiple steps reduces the number of heterozygous chromosomes and therefore increases<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> very significantly the probability for obtaining desired unique karyotypes (specific combinations of the parents).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The inventors now contemplated that the technology of reverse breeding can be used to introduce interesting chromosomes or chromosomal fragments from one or more donor plants into an elite line or elite hybrid plant, by providing a method for genetically modifying the genome of a hybrid plant by replacing one or more of its chromosomes or chromosome fragments with the corresponding chromosome or chromosome fragment of one or more donor parents, comprising:
<ol><li>a) crossing one of the parents of the hybrid plant with one of the donor parents, to obtain a first F1 population, allowing the F1 to produce spores while suppressing recombination, producing doubled haploids of the spores, to obtain a first population of chromosome substitution lines,</li><li>b) optionally crossing the other parent of the hybrid plant with the same or another donor parent, to obtain a second F1 population, allowing the F1 to produce spores while suppressing recombination, producing doubled haploids of the spores, to obtain a second population of chromosome substitution lines, and</li></ol>
either:
<ul><li>c1) producing a modified hybrid plant that has acquired one or more intact chromosomes of the donor parent(s), by selecting one individual of the first or the second population and crossing this individual with an individual of the other population or with a parent of the hybrid plant;</li></ul>

When these libraries are large enough, they can essentially harbor the entire genome of the one or more donor accessions, such that essentially all<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> genetic variation present in the one or more donor accessions is fixed in the genome of elite parental lines from a breeding program.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The method of this invention generally enables the creation of hybrids that are composed of selected genomic fragments which are derived from more than two parental lines, i.e. "multiparental hybrids", as for example illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008 f0009"><b>Figure 4</b></figref><b>.</b> Such "higher order hybrids" (ternary hybrids or tribrids, multibrids) provide maximal flexibility and selectivity to a plant breeder, and this method thus allows him to compose and design a plant genome by using large introgression libraries as a versatile toolbox, and as a virtually inexhaustible source of genetic variation in a given species or genus.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A donor plant either belongs to the same species as the parental lines, or to a species that can be successfully crossed with the parental lines to give viable and fertile offspring. The donor plant can either be a cultivated variety or a parental (inbred) line, or a wild accession, a genebank accession, or a transgenic plant, as is illustrated in the examples.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In angiosperms, a spore can be either a microspore or a megaspore. Both spore types are produced in the flowers, and microspores develop into the male gametophyte generation (pollen grain), whereas megaspores develop into the female gametophyte generation (embryo sac). Spores are typically the product of meiosis, and they are usually haploid, unless e.g. first division restitution or second division restitution occurs during meiosis, in which case the spores are diploid.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">A substitution line (also referred to as "chromosome substitution line" in this application) is a line that harbours in its genome at least one chromosome<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> from another line or plant. One or two copies of the original chromosome or chromosomes has/have been replaced by the corresponding copy or copies of that chromosome or chromosomes from another line or plant. A population of chromosome substitution lines comprising individual chromosome substitution lines that each harbour a different combination of chromosomes from two parental origins is termed a chromosome substitution library. A complete chromosome substitution library comprises all possible combinations of parental chromosomes.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">One can e.g. create chromosome substitution lines from two hybrids, which were obtained by crossing each of the two parental lines of an elite hybrid with a third plant, a "donor plant", which third plant harbours a trait of interest that was absent from the parental lines and their hybrid. If it is known on which chromosome of the donor plant the trait of interest resides and/or the presence of the trait can be identified by means of e.g. molecular markers or a detectable phenotype, it is possible to create specific chromosome substitution lines for each of the two parental lines, which comprise in their homozygous genome all chromosomes of the parental line, but one chromosome of the donor plant.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">From each chromosome substitution library a chromosome substitution line can then be selected, harbouring the donor plant's chromosome harbouring the desired trait. These chromosome substitution lines are identical to the parental lines, except for one chromosome which was contributed by the donor plant. The crossing of such two chromosome substitution lines will result in the exact reconstruction of the elite hybrid plant, with the exception of one chromosome pair. In contrast to the original elite hybrid plant the reconstructed or corrected<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> hybrid plant is homozygous for the selected chromosome of the donor plant, and lacks the corresponding chromosomes from its two parental lines. This is illustrated in <b>Example 1.</b></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Alternatively, one can choose to replace a chromosome copy from only one of the parental lines in the elite hybrid with that of a donor plant. This strategy enables the targeted and controlled improvement of elite hybrid plants, by substituting one or more chromosomes with an improved version thereof, without the transgenic introduction of foreign DNA. This is illustrated in <b>Example 3.</b></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">This approach can be taken to a higher level of complexity, by creating chromosome substitution lines between the individual parents of an elite hybrid and two different donor lines. In this manner, it is possible to substitute multiple chromosomes of the elite hybrid plant with chromosomes from different origins, and hence to bring sets of chromosomes together that can never occur in nature.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Through application of the current invention it is possible to create multiple chromosome substitution libraries in parallel, and to subsequently combine the individual chromosome substitution lines of different libraries with each other, to compose or design new genetic combinations. One can thus choose which chromosomes from the different genetic backgrounds are combined together in a chromosome set, in order to make up the complete chromosome set that constitutes the full genome of the species.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In the post-genomics era, it is becoming increasingly feasible to locate and positively identify the genomic variation that underlies agronomically important traits. Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping, marker development and genome sequencing in combination with<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> association studies allow researchers to determine on which chromosome the genomic information leading to a particular phenotypic trait is encoded, and to narrow down this localization to a specific chromosome arm, to a chromosomal region, and ultimately to single loci and/or, in the case of SNPs, single nucleotides.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">It is therefore also possible to refine the approach outlined above to the subchromosomal level, and to specifically create plant lines and hybrids that contain one or more selected introgression fragments from one or more donor plants in their genome, without any other genomic contribution from the donor plant(s). The advantages of this approach are enormous, as one can efficiently introduce genomic fragments harbouring desired genetic material into elite hybrid plants, without the complication of segregation of the traits that were already present in that elite hybrid, which is what would inevitably occur when the hybrid were to be crossed with the donor plant in order to introduce the desired genetic material from the donor plant by classical breeding, during which the parental genomes are typically mixed and recombined entirely.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In order to introduce chromosomal fragments from a specific chromosome of a donor plant into the hybrid of two parental lines, according to the present invention, one can first create a chromosome substitution line of one of the said parental lines, in which one of the chromosomes has been replaced by that of the donor plant. When this homozygous (Doubled Haploid) chromosome substitution line is subsequently backcrossed to the parental line from which it was derived, the resulting F1 plant is homozygous for all chromosomes, except for the chromosome that had been contributed by the donor plant. For the latter chromosome the F1 plant is heterozygous, harbouring in its genome one<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> copy derived from the parental line and one copy derived from the donor plant.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">When this F1 plant is then allowed to produce spores without suppression of chromosome recombination during meiosis, and a DH population is created from these spores, this DH population will constitute a homozygous introgression library. Random recombination between the non-sister chromatids will occur for the one chromosome that was present in a heterozygous state, while recombination has no detectable effect on the other chromosomes, which are all present in a homozygous state. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004"><b>Figure 2</b></figref><b>B.</b></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Because meiotic recombination occurs randomly during formation of the spores, and one or more recombination events may occur in each spore, a nearly infinite number of different DHs can be generated in this manner. These individual DHs will differ from each other and from the original parental line in the degree of introgression of the one chromosome from the donor plant into the parental line's genome.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">This introgression may consist of a single chromosome fragment of the donor plant, or of multiple chromosome fragments of the donor plant, depending on the number of cross-over events that had occurred during the meiosis that gave rise to each individual spore. The size of the introgressed fragments may differ greatly, and it may range from very small fragments when two cross-over events occurred in close vicinity of each other, up to the entire chromosome when no cross-over had occurred. This approach also allows the mapping of cis-epistatic interactions within a chromosome.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">An introgression line thus comprises one or more chromosomal fragments from a donor plant, in the genomic<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> context of another plant. A population of introgression lines comprising individual introgression lines that each harbour a different set of introgression fragments from a donor plant is termed an introgression library. The larger the population size is, the more complete an introgression library becomes, but in theory there is a nearly infinite number of introgression lines possible for any given chromosome. In the context of the present invention, introgression libraries are made per individual chromosome, and not randomly genome-wide. This is an important difference with introgression libraries as known in classical plant breeding. The introgression library of the invention thus preferably comprises lines in which only one of the chromosomes has obtained one or more introgression fragments of the donor. A complete introgression library comprises a set of introgession lines for each chromosome. Within each set all the other chromosomes remain constant and variation occurs only in the one chromosome belonging to the set.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">This method allows the creation of plant genomes which are nearly identical to the genome of a parental line, but into which a specific chromosomal fragment from a donor plant has been introduced, in a fast, efficient and non-transgenic manner. By using molecular markers, genome sequencing and/or phenotypic analysis, it is possible to identify individual plants in such a homozygous introgression library, whose genome comprises a chromosome fragment from the donor plant which harbours a trait of interest. Thus, a desired trait can specifically be introduced into the genome of a parental line or an elite hybrid plant, without the need for a transgenic approach or time-consuming and repetitive back-crossing. The genome of the parental line or hybrid plant is essentially<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> "corrected", by replacing part of the genome with a corresponding part from another plant, while keeping the rest of the genome unchanged.

This way, one can effectively "design" a plant genome, by introgressing selected chromosome fragments from different germplasm into elite parental lines, without mixing the entire genomes and thereby losing the combination of all other desired traits and genomic features that were already present in the parental lines. This method allows the efficient pyramiding of traits in plant genomes, without the need for repetitive back-crossing to fix the traits, as is the case in classical plant breeding, and without rendering the end products transgenic, as is the case when applying transgene technology.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">In addition, when applying the method of the present invention the traits derived from the one or more donor accessions are introduced into the parental lines' genome in precisely the same genomic context and location as where they occurred in the donor plant(s). This is in contrast with transgene technology, wherein the integration site of the transgene is typically random and cannot be chosen. Such random insertion may lead to e.g. the disruption of endogenous genes in the parental line's genome and hence to additional undesired and unpredictable phenotypical effects, and generally the random nature of transgene insertion is a serious drawback of the transgene technology. When applying the method of the present invention, the chromosome fragments of the one or more donor plants essentially replace the corresponding chromosome<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> fragments in the parental line(s), such that the genomic context is conserved.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">In (homozygous) chromosome substitution libraries and (homozygous) introgression libraries the genetic variation from any number of donor lines can be fixed and adequately maintained for future use, in the genomic context of a parental line that is known to be suitable for the production of elite hybrids. This approach thus solves an important problem that exists in classical breeding, namely the fact that most of the natural variation that resides in the genome of donor plants (such as wild accessions) remains underexploited, unnoticed and unappreciated during the breeding process, because the breeder necessarily focuses his attention on predetermined traits of interest, and other genetic variation that is not closely genetically or physically linked to those predetermined traits is lost during the breeding process.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">This is especially a problem for genetic variation that only results in a detectable phenotype when it is present in a homozygous state (e.g. recessive mutations), and that would be obscured by the presence of other, dominant allelic variants. The creation of homozygous chromosome substitution libraries and/or homozygous introgression libraries results in a large toolbox wherein such recessive traits can be assessed without any interference from dominant alleles from a different genetic background. If a specific homozygous introgression line exhibits a phenotype that was absent from the parental line from which it had been created, the genetic basis of that phenotype can be traced back to one of the introgression fragments that had been contributed to the plant's genome by the donor plant. Herein there is no risk that the trait will be lost or obscured again in the next generation, because<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> the introgression line is a fully homozygous DH-line, which can produce seeds, and whose offspring through selfing will be essentially clones. This approach thus makes it possible to exploit the genome of a plant species in a much more efficient manner, and to optimally use the genetic variation that is present within a species or within a group of related species, to optimise the genetic features of plants of commercial interest that belong to that species or group of related species, such as vegetables, fruit trees, ornamental plants and field crops.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">When applying the method of the present invention it is possible to e.g. identify a mutation or other genetic feature in the genome of an individual plant of a given species of interest, such as a parental line, or a wild uncultivated relative, or a mutagenised plant, or a transgenic plant, and to specifically and very efficiently introduce this mutation or genetic feature into an elite line of that species.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">The present invention can be applied to all plant species that can be transformed and from which Doubled Haploid plants can be made.

After chromosome duplication (2n to 4n), genome-wide cross-over events occur randomly (meiotic recombination), resulting in the reshuffling of the chromosomes that were contributed to the hybrid genome by the two parental lines of the hybrid plant. During spore formation haploid chromosome sets (n) are formed, and when DHs are formed from these spores their genome is subsequently doubled. The end result is a population of RIL-like DHs (of which only two examples are shown here), in which a recombined genome is genetically fixed. Panel B, on the other hand, shows the consecutive steps in the formation of DHs from an F1 hybrid plant, in the absence of meiotic recombination. No reshuffling of the two parental genomes occurs, and the spores contain random and usually novel combinations of intact parental chromosomes. When DHs are formed from these spores their genome is doubled, and the end result is a population of homozygous chromosome substitution lines (or a homozygous chromosome substitution library). On the figure only two examples are shown.

When the DHs are backcrossed to one of the parental lines of the hybrid plant from which they were derived, this results in chromosome substitution lines which are heterozygous for one chromosome, but homozygous for the other chromosomes. Panel B illustrates how such a chromosome substitution line can be used to generate an introgression library for one chromosome. Importantly, meiotic recombination is allowed to proceed normally at this stage. The end result in this figure panel is a population of spores, wherein each individual spore contains the genome of the first parent of the hybrid plant, with one or more introgression fragments from the second parent of the hybrid plant in one of its chromosomes.

Panel A illustrates the plants that are essentially used in the method of the invention: two parental lines of a hybrid, and a third line (depicted in a frame) which is defined in this application as a donor plant, donor accession or donor parent. Panel B shows how one of the parental lines is crossed to the donor plant, giving rise to an F1 hybrid plant. In panel C this F1 hybrid plant is used for the creation of homozygous chromosome substitution lines, through the creation of DHs from the spores formed by this F1 hybrid in the absence of meiotic recombination, as illustrated in detail in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">2</figref>. In panel D one of the homozygous chromosome substitution lines, which corresponds to a "corrected" version of the first parental line of panel A, is crossed to the second parental line of panel A. The F1 of this cross corresponds to a corrected version of the hybrid plant of<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> panel A. For one of its chromosomes one copy has been contributed by the donor plant, instead of by the first parental line. Panel E shows an alternative approach, wherein the procedure illustrated in panels B and C has (in parallel) also been performed on the second parental line of panel A. This resulted in the creation of chromosome substitution lines for both parental lines and (in this case) the same donor plant. In panel E, two homozygous chromosome substitution lines from different substitution libraries are crossed to each other, to give rise to a corrected version of the hybrid plant of panel A. For one of its chromosomes both copies have been contributed by the donor plant, instead of by the first and second parental line. Many alternatives are possible, e.g. wherein more than one donor plant is used, and/or wherein the two parental lines of panel A are "corrected" at different chromosomes (panel F), etc. If the chromosome substitution line of panel D is crossed to the first parental line of panel A (instead of to the second parental line), the situation of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 2B</figref> is achieved: a "corrected" version of the first parental line, wherein one of the copies of one of the chromosomes has been replaced by a chromosome copy contributed by the donor plant. The procedure of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 2B</figref> can then also be applied in this case: when at this stage meiotic recombination is allowed to proceed in an unsuppressed manner, this will lead to the creation of an introgression library. The individual DHs of this library may then possess one or more fragments of the corresponding chromosome of the donor plant.

When these two DHs are crossed to each other, this results in an F1 which corresponds to a corrected version of the original F1 hybrid that would result from crossing the first parental line to the second parental line. The corrected hybrid harbours a chromosome copy contributed by the first donor plant for one of its chromosomes, and a chromosome copy contributed by the second donor plant for another of its chromosomes. In panel B the first and second parental lines have both acquired (through application of the method of the present invention) a chromosome from the second donor plant, and the result of crossing the two modified parental lines is a hybrid that is homozygous for the chromosome that had been contributed by the second donor plant. Panel C illustrates how this approach can be taken to an even higher level of complexity, wherein every chromosome of a hybrid has been contributed by a different plant. The hybrid of panel C essentially has genomic contributions from no less than six parents (two parental lines and four different donor plants), which is not feasible in a fast and efficient manner when using any previously known methodology.

From each accession a T0 plant was selected that harboured the transgenic construct in a heterozygous single-copy state (hemizygous). Molecular analysis and DNA-sequencing revealed that the transgene was inserted in chromosome II in the selected Col-0 plant, and in chromosome IV in the selected Ler plant. The transgene acts in a dominant fashion at the sporophytic level, such that meiotic recombination is suppressed during spore-formation in plants that harbour at least one copy of the transgene.<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --></p><p id="p0082" num="0082">Subsequently, two chromosome substitution libraries were created, respectively for the Col-0 and Ler accessions: in the genome of Col-0 and Ler plants, one or more chromosomes were replaced by the corresponding chromosome or chromosomes from the genome of the Cvi donor accession. This was achieved by first (in parallel) crossing the transgenic Col-0 T0 plant with a Cvi plant and crossing the transgenic Ler T0 plant with a Cvi plant, and allowing the resulting hybrids to form spores in the absence of meiotic recombination. For this purpose progeny plants were selected that harboured the RNAi-construct against <i>DMC1</i> in their genome, i.e. plants that had inherited the Col-0 or Ler chromosome copy harbouring the transgene. Because the original transgenic Col-0 and Ler plants were hemizygous for the transgene, also Col-0 x Cvi and Ler x Cvi progeny was obtained that lacked the transgene, but in this example only progeny plants were selected that possessed the transgene, in order to suppress meiotic recombination during spore formation.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">The presence of the transgene suppressed meiotic recombination, such that the selected Col-0 x Cvi and Ler x Cvi hybrid plants produced microspores in which the parental chromosomes had not recombined.

The genome of the individual DH plants of these populations consisted of combinations of - in one case - intact, unrecombined Col-0 and Cvi chromosomes, and of - in the other case - intact, unrecombined Ler and Cvi chromosomes. Only spores with a correct haploid chromosome number (n = 5 for Arabidopsis) were selected, and aneuploid spores were excluded from the further steps of the experiment. It is possible to identify balanced spores, for example by means of flow cytometry, or morphologically by visually selecting spores having a size that corresponds to the normal spore size of the species, which is indicative of an equal distribution of all chromosomes during spore formation.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">By means of molecular markers capable of differentiating between the different accessions of which each DH was composed, the genomic constitution of each of the DHs was examined, in order to identify the origin of each of the five chromosomes in every individual DH plant.

<ul><li>the production of two chromosome substitution libraries in parallel, through transformation with a suitable transgenic construct for the suppression of meiotic recombination, crossing (one generation), and a DH-step;</li><li>the selection of suitable individuals from the substitution libraries,</li><li>one backcross generation followed by a DH-step, and</li><li>selection, and crossing of selected lines.</li></ul></p><p id="p0111" num="0111">This process is thus much faster than an initial cross followed by six or more backcross generations, the selection of suitable lines and another cross to obtain a hybrid (in total at least eight generations from seed to seed), which would be required in the classical breeding approach.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">Depending on the speed and efficiency of the available protocol for transformation and DH-production in a given species, the method of the invention can be very fast, as one does not always need to wait for seed production after crossing, but merely for the production of spores, which are to be used for DH-production. Especially when a very efficient DH-protocol is available (such as a haploid-inducer system), the method of the invention can be very fast.</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">Apart from the speed, another clear advantage of the method of the invention is the fact that the genomic contributions of the donor plant(s) can be fixed and<!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --> perpetuated in homozygous form in chromosome substitution and/or introgression libraries, such that they remain available in a stable manner in the genomic background of the parent line(s), where they can be used for future screens and exploitation in breeding. It is also a significant improvement over the prior art that introgression libraries can be made per individual chromosome, which is impossible when using classical breeding methods.</p><heading id="h0012"><b>EXAMPLE 5</b></heading><heading id="h0013"><i>Specific transfer of a transgene in maize, while maintaining the exact insertion position of the transgene</i></heading><p id="p0114" num="0114">In this example a transgene is introduced into an elite maize line, without directly transforming it into that line. The transgene is first introduced into a maize line that is easily transformable, and the best of many independent transgenic events can be selected for transfer into an elite maize line. Hereby the exact genomic insertion position of the transgene is maintained.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">Genetically modified maize plants of the A188 genotype were obtained by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, using the protocol described by <nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>Ishida et al (Nature Protocols 2, 1614-1621; 2007</text></nplcit>). The transgene used in this experiment was a GFP marker (Green Fluorescent Protein) with a nuclear localisation signal, operably linked to a strong ubiquitin promoter. This construct enables high levels of GFP expression throughout transformed maize plants, which is easily detectable due to the accumulation of the fluorescent GFP protein in the nuclei of cells.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">From among the transformed A188 maize plants obtained in this experiment an individual was chosen that contained a single copy of the transgene in its genome, on<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> chromosome VIII. In a first step, this selected transgenic line was crossed to elite line B73, which contained in its genome an RNAi construct targeting the <i>DMC1</i> gene (also on chromosome VIII, single copy insertion, hemizygous). The latter transgene acted in a dominant fashion, such that meiotic recombination during spore formation was suppressed in the resulting hybrid progeny.</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">From the F1 progeny plants of this cross microspores were collected, and these were used for DH production, with a method known to the person skilled in the art.</p><p id="p0118" num="0118">From among the resulting DH plants, which corresponded to chromosome substitution lines, an individual was selected that possessed all chromosomes from B73, except for chromosome VIII, which was derived from A188. This plant was back-crossed to a wildtype B73 plant lacking the RNAi construct targeting <i>DMC1,</i> to give rise to progeny plants that were heterozygous for chromosome VIII (one copy derived from B73 and the other from A188, harbouring the GFP-transgene), but that fully corresponded to wildtype B73 with respect to the other nine chromosomes (n = 10 for maize).</p><p id="p0119" num="0119">In the absence of the RNAi construct targeting <i>DMC1,</i> meiotic recombination was allowed to occur during spore formation in these progeny plants. Their spores were used for the production of DH plants (as described above), and in these DHs all chromosomes except for chromosome VIII were exclusively derived from the B73 background, whereas chromosome VIII was essentially derived from B73, with random introgression fragments from the A188 line.</p><p id="p0120" num="0120">From among this DH population homozygous individuals could be selected which contained only a relatively small fragment of A188 DNA on chromosome VIII, while still possessing the GFP transgene (which could be<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> easily detected with the help of molecular markers). In this manner the transgene was effectively transferred from an A188 maize plant to the B73 elite line, without the need for transforming B73 directly with this construct, and without mixing the B73 genome with that of A188. This would have necessitated multiple rounds of backcrossing to B73 to obtain progeny plants that would closely resemble B73 again.</p><p id="p0121" num="0121">This approach allowed the large-scale production of transgenic lines in the easily transformable A188 background, and the selection of the best transgenic insertion event, which was subsequently transferred into B73, which is far less amenable to transformation, at exactly the same genomic location as in A188.</p><p id="p0122" num="0122">It is clear that this method could also be used for other transgenes, for example transgenes conferring resistance to herbicides or herbivoric animals, conferring disease resistance or increased tolerance to adverse conditions, providing higher yield, etc.</p><p id="p0123" num="0123">Similarly, using this method it is also possible to remove transgenes from the genome of a transgenic plant, without affecting the composition of the rest of its genome. The chromosome region or the entire chromosome containing the transgene is thereby replaced by a corresponding wildtype fragment from another line. Very specifically one chromosome can be "corrected" independently from the rest of the genome, and this correction generally entails the replacement of a full chromosome or of a chromosomal fragment.<!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --></p><heading id="h0014"><b>EXAMPLE 6</b></heading><heading id="h0015"><i>Efficient breeding for heterosis in maize</i></heading><p id="p0124" num="0124">Heterotic effects can increase the yield of hybrids quite significantly. They encompass the phenotypic outperformance of both parental lines by the F1 hybrid plant that results from their cross. Even though the molecular or genetic nature of heterosis is still unknown, empirical studies have provided valuable information in crops. For example in maize, various heterotic groups have been identified on the basis of pedigree information or molecular marker analysis, such as SSR (Simple Sequence Repeat) or SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) markers. Examples of such heterotic groups are Flint, Lancaster, Stiff Stalk, and Iodent (<nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>Van Inghelandt et al, 2010; Theor. Appl. Genet. 120: 1289-1299</text></nplcit>), or Dent (<i>Zea mays</i> indentata<b>)</b>, Flint (<i>Zea mays</i> indurata)and Sweet (<i>Zea mays</i> rugosa or <i>Zea mays</i> saccharata). Each heterotic group comprises a number of inbred lines with a certain degree of genetic similarity to each other. In order to get heterotic effects in the next generation, one typically needs to cross inbred lines from different heterotic groups with each other.</p><p id="p0125" num="0125">Generally the creation of a new maize hybrid exhibiting heterosis comprises the improvement of parental lines of two different heterotic groups, and the subsequent crossing of those parental lines to obtain F1 hybrid seed. The improvement of parental lines encompasses classical plant breeding and/or transgenesis or cisgenesis, and in each hybrid genome contributions from only two heterotic groups can be brought together.</p><p id="p0126" num="0126">When applying the method of the current invention, it is however possible to bring more than two heterotic groups together in a single hybrid. What is needed is<!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --> information on the chromosome regions that contribute to the heterotic nature of a group, such that these regions from an inbred line from one heterotic group can be specifically transferred into the genome of an inbred line from another heterotic group. This is similar to the approach described in <b>Example 5</b>, using chromosome substitution and/or introgression libraries.</p><p id="p0127" num="0127">In this manner, an inbred line from a first heterotic group is specifically improved to also contain heterotic genomic regions from a second heterotic group. In a next step, this improved inbred line can be crossed to an inbred line from a third heterotic group, which can in itself also have been improved, using the method of the current invention, to contain genomic material from more than one heterotic group. The genetic basis for heterosis is thereby brought together in cis and/or trans, within the same chromosome set. The result of this approach is the creation of hybrid maize plants that harbour the genetic material of not two, but of three or even more heterotic groups at once. This offers powerful new possibilities for increasing, for example, hybrid yield in maize.</p><heading id="h0016"><b>EXAMPLE 7</b></heading><heading id="h0017"><i>Specific transfer of a virus resistance into a melon hybrid</i></heading><p id="p0128" num="0128">Cucurbit Yellow Stunting Disorder Virus (CYSDV) is a closterovirus that is transmitted by the whitefly <i>Bemisia</i> tabaci, and that affects cucurbit crops such as melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>).

To overcome this problem and to be able to accomplish an<!-- EPO <DP n="53"> --> almost perfect hybrid reconstruction, an introgression library was produced in the next step of the experiment, to limit the genomic contribution of the TGR-1551 line to a chromosomal fragment comprising the resistance trait.</p><p id="p0135" num="0135">For this purpose, the selected DH plants were subsequently backcrossed to the father line of the elite melon hybrid.

These DH plants effectively constituted a non-transgenic introgression library for the chromosome harbouring the CYSDV resistance trait from the TGR-1551 line, in the genetic background of the father line of the elite melon hybrid.
