Particularly in polyamide used for applications such as bottles, sheets, films, fibers and the like, attentions are<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> paid to mixing of foreign matters. Due to that the molded and processed products are transparent and thin, that a high level and delicate mold processing technology is required and that foreign matters are very highly likely to damage the performances of the molded and processed products, mixing of foreign matters brings about the inferior appearance, an increase in a rate of generating defects such as breaking and the like attributable to foreign matter-generating sites and a reduction in the productivity.<br/>
Foreign matters originating in polyamide include powders called a fine, thin films called a froth, yellowed matters and carbides produced by thermal degradation, gelatinous matters and the like. It is the best countermeasure to inhibit the above foreign matters from being produced, but when they are inevitably produced, they have to be separated and removed from the pelletized products. The powders and the thin films are usually removed by wind selection, and the yellowed matters and the carbides can be removed by a screening equipment using an optical sensor. Various separating equipments are commercially available, and the sure removing effects can be expected.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">On the other hand, gels are estimated to be produced due to that the molecules are damaged (the polymer molecules are degraded by radicals generated) during polymerization and mold processing to bring about abnormal reactions (turned into<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> three-dimensional polymers) such as growing of non-linear molecules and the like and that they are turned into an extremely high molecular weight as compared with those of other polyamide molecules. Accordingly, a thermal history has to be reduced to the utmost in the production step in order to obtain polyamide containing less gels, and measurements such as setting a balance of end group concentrations and adding a heat stabilizer or an antioxidant are carried out. However, some of the above additives show a catalytic effect to amidation reaction, and on the contrary, they expedite excessive polymerization reaction to bring about an increase in gels in a certain case. Accordingly, the reaction is carried out usually while maintaining a balance between promotion of the reaction and inhibition of forming gels by adding a specific amount of an alkali compound having further a reaction inhibitory effect.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Gels produced in a melt polymerization step can be removed by a filter and the like, but the gels are turned into fine particles by a flow pressure and pass through the filter in many cases. Further, gels are likely to be produced as well in solid phase polymerization carried out in producing high viscosity products, and therefore it is almost impossible to completely remove them.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Further, gels can be produced as well in melting in mold<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> processing other than during production of polyamide. Even when used are polyamides in which a marked difference in a production amount of gels is not observed in evaluating a quality of the polyamides after production thereof, the difference is exerted in mold processing in a certain case, and a cause thereof is estimated to be attributable to that an excessive thermal history is applied to a part of the polymer in staying parts thereof such as screw grooves, a filter, a die and the like in mold processing. It can be found from the above matters that it is important for obtaining finally mold processed articles having less gels to produce polyamide having further less gels and a higher grade and design a mold processing apparatus having very small staying parts.<br/>
It is necessary for producing polyamide having further less gels to inhibit a thermal history in the production, set a balance between an effective concentration of an end group and an amount of a stabilizer and remove produced gels as well in melt polymerization and solid phase polymerization, but the effects thereof have been limited. Further, in designing a mold processing apparatus, it is possible to reduce formation of gels by subjecting, for example, metal parts which are brought into contact with the resin to plating treatment, but it is difficult in terms of constitution of the apparatus to completely eliminate the staying parts. Further, the respective molding apparatuses have to be subjected to the treatment, and it is lacking in the possibility thereof in<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> terms of the versatility and the cost. Particularly in polyamide comprising a diamine component in which xylylenediamine is a principal component, radicals are liable to be produced in a benzylmethylene site of xylylenediamine, and production of gels provides more serious problems than in other polyamides.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Various methods for inhibiting gels of the polyamides described above from being formed are proposed. One of them includes a method in which an antioxidant and a reaction inhibitor are added, as described above, and in which a blend amount ratio of the respective additives is regulated, and disclosed are a method in which a phosphorus base compound as an antioxidant and an alkali metal salt as a reaction inhibitor are added in a fixed balance to thereby inhibit gels from being formed (refer to patent documents 1 and 2) and a method in which the contents of pyrophosphoric acid and other phosphorus base compounds in polyamide are regulated to inhibit formation of gels and generation of clogging a filter by adding the phosphorus base compounds (refer to patent documents 3 and 4). However, in the above methods in which the additives are blended in melt polymerization, increasing an addition amount of an alkali compound for the purpose of further increasing a gelation inhibiting effect results in increasing, as described above, a heat history due to a reduction in a polymerization speed and is likely to rather<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> deteriorate a quality of the molded articles.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Proposed is a method which does not depend on an adding step, for example, a method in which 50 to 1000 ppm by weight of a phosphorus compound and a phosphinic compound or a phosphorous acid compound and 1 to 5 times mole of an alkali compound based on a concentration of phosphorus atoms contained are added to a molten resin before or after polymerization to thereby inhibit gels from being formed (refer to a patent document 5), but since a molding method described therein is conventionally carried out in spin molding and limited to processing under installation of a melt polymerization apparatus, it does not correspond to a method for obtaining practically and generally a good appearance and an excellent performance in an application for packaging materials such as films and the like.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">On the other hand, proposed is a method in which a gelation inhibiting effect is obtained by blending an additive in mold processing of a film and the like. Disclosed is, for example, a method in which gels are inhibited from being formed by blending 0.0005 to 0.5 part by mass of at least one selected from a lubricant, an organic phosphorus base stabilizer, a hindered phenols compound and a hindered amines compound in subjecting polyamide to mold processing (refer to a patent document 6). However, the results described in the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> examples thereof are poor in effects when observing from the practical aspects, and in addition thereto, specific grounds of inhibiting formation of gels by the respective additives are scarcely referred to. Further, whitening and irregularities are likely to be generated on the molded articles in a certain case by short mixing or the excess addition amounts. Also, disclosed is a method in which fish eyes are inhibited from being formed by adding 0.001 to 0.015 part by mass of a higher fatty acid metal salt and a polyhydric alcohol compound for the purpose of enhancing a lubricity of polyamide to inhibit shearing heat from being generated in mold processing (refer to a patent document 7). However, addition of the higher fatty acid metal salt in a fixed amount or more is likely to reduce a print characteristic of polyamide and an adhesive property thereof with other films, and it is likely to damage performances thereof in applications for packaging materials in a certain case.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><ul><li>Patent document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2005194328A"><text>194328/2005</text></patcit></li><li>Patent document 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2005194330A"><text>194330/2005</text></patcit></li><li>Patent document 3: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2007092053A"><text>92053/2007</text></patcit></li><li>Patent document 4: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2007092054A"><text>92054/2007</text></patcit></li><li>Patent document 5: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP49038950A"><text>38950/1974</text></patcit></li><li>Patent document 6: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP2001164109A"><text>164109/2001</text></patcit></li><li>Patent document 8: Japanese Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="JP3808847B"><text>3808847</text></patcit></li></ul></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Regardless of the methods described above, conventional gelation inhibiting methods require a balance of a blend ratio of an antioxidant to a reaction inhibiting agent, and the respective addition amounts are limited.

However, a use amount thereof in the polymerization of the polyamide is limited from the viewpoint of a balance with the phosphorus base compound. Intense researches on the above matter repeated by the present inventors have resulted in finding that gels can be inhibited from being formed in the mold processing by adding the alkali compound (A) in the mold processing after polymerizing the polyamide to elevate a concentration of the alkali compound; an amount of the gels formed is small even if a staying situation of the molten polyamide continues over a long period of time; and a good molded article in which less gels are mixed is obtained.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">On the other hand, there has been the problem that when the alkali compound is kneaded directly with the polyamide in the mold processing, the alkali compound is deposited on the molded article as a non-molten matter due to an inferior dispersibility of the alkali compound into the polyamide. Accordingly, the present inventors have found that making use<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> of the master batch containing the alkali compound (A) having a specific particle size distribution makes it possible to satisfactorily disperse and melt the alkali compound into the polyamide and prevents a filter from being clogged in both cases of production and mold processing of the master batch even under the presence of the alkali compound having a high concentration and that a molded article on which whitening and irregularities are not generated and which is excellent in an appearance is obtained.

When the moisture content is less than 0.1 % by mass, the alkali compound (A) is insufficiently molten and dispersed in the polyamide (X), and a rise in the resin pressure in the molding and generation of irregularities in the molded article are likely to be brought about. When the moisture content is larger than 0.8 % by mass, a large amount of steam is generated in the step (b) to turn the alkali compound (A) in the input port into a sherbet form by the steam in a certain case, and a supplying amount of the alkali compound (A) is likely to become instable.</p><heading id="h0010">&lt;Step (c)&gt;</heading><p id="p0056" num="0056">The step (c) is a step in which the master batch obtained in the step (b) described above is added to the polyamide (X) obtained in the step (a) to obtain the polyamide resin composition.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> -->A molded article obtained by subjecting the polyamide (X) as it is to mold processing is excellent in properties and an appearance immediately after starting molding, but gelatinous substances mixed in are increased as the mold processing work is carried out over a long time to make the quality of the product instable in a certain case. Particularly in a case of a film and the like, breaking is brought about due to gels, and the equipment can not help being stopped, so that the production efficiency is deteriorated. This is estimated to be caused due to that the polyamide continues staying locally in a space of a melt kneading part through a dice, whereby it is excessively heated and turned into gels and that the gels formed flow out. In contrast with this, the master batch containing the alkali compound (A) is added to the polyamide (X) in the present invention in order to prevent gelation generated in the mold processing.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The present inventors have found from measurement of a molecular weight by gel chromatography that when polyamide is continuously heated under applied pressure and low oxygen in a molten state, the polyamide is advanced in polarization into a low molecular weight part and a high molecular weight part and that among them, the more the high molecular weight component is increased, the more the production amount of gels is increased. Further, they have found that the high molecular weight component is decreased by adding the alkali compound<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> (A) to the polyamide. The reason therefor is estimated to be attributable to that progress of amidation brought about particularly during molding of the polyamide resin composition is retarded by addition of the alkali compound (A) and that it inhibits resultingly an increase in the molecular weight component and the gelation.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">In the step (c), a blend ratio (the master batch/the polyamide (X))) of the master batch to the polyamide (X) is preferably 0.5 to 20 parts by mass/99.5 to 80 parts by mass, more preferably 0.7 to 12 parts by mass/99.3 to 88 parts by mass and further preferably 1 to 6 parts by mass/99 to 94 parts by mass from the viewpoints of the stable moldability, the molded article having a good appearance and inhibiting formation of gels. A blend ratio of the master batch/the polyamide (X) described above means a blend ratio based on total 100 parts by mass of the master batch and the polyamide (X). If a blend ratio of the master batch/the polyamide (X) exceeds 20 parts by mass/80 parts by mass, a mixing proportion of the polyamide originating in the master batch having a heat history is increased, whereby the product is likely to be yellowed or molding is likely to be difficult due to a reduction in the viscosity. Further, if a large amount of moisture is contained in the master batch, the molded article is likely to be whitened due to acceleration of the crystallization speed to damage an appearance thereof in a<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> certain case or the secondary processability such as stretching and the like is likely to be damaged. On the other hand, if a blend ratio of the master batch/the polyamide (X) is 0.5 part by mass/99.5 parts by mass or more, gels can be inhibited from being formed in the mold processing.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">A mole concentration P of a phosphorus atom contained per g of the polyamide resin composition of the present invention is 0.03 µmol/g or more and less than 0.32 µmol/g, preferably 0.06 to 0.26 µmol/g and more preferably 0.1 to 0.2 µmol/g from the viewpoints of enhancing the processing stability in the melt processing and preventing the polyamide from being colored. If P is less than 0.03 µmol/g, the polyamide is liable to be colored during the polymerization, and gels tend to be formed. Also, if P is too high, the polyamide is observed to be improved in coloring, but gelation reaction of the polyamide is accelerated, and the resin pressure is elevated in the mold processing in a certain case by clogging of a filter which is considered to be attributable to a thermally modified product of the phosphorus atom-containing compound (B).</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">A sum (hereinafter referred to as "a total mole concentration of an alkali metal atom and an alkaline earth metal atom") M of values obtained by multiplying a mole concentration of an alkali metal atom and a mole concentration<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> of an alkaline earth metal atom each contained per g of the polyamide resin composition of the present invention by valencies thereof respectively is 2.2 to 26.1 µmol/g, preferably 4.3 to 19.5 µmol/g and more preferably 6.5 to 13.0 µmol/g from the viewpoint of preventing gelation caused in the mold processing. Controlling M to 2.2 µmol/g or more is estimated to retard an increase in a molecular weight of the polyamide by heat to make it possible to inhibit gels from being formed. On the other hand, if M exceeds 26.1 µmol/g, the inferior molding is brought about in a certain case by a reduction in the viscosity. In addition thereto, coloring and whitening are brought about in some cases, and the non-molten alkali compound (A) is deposited in a certain case.<br/>
As described above, the alkali metal salt is used as the phosphorus atom-containing compound (B) in a certain case. Further, as described later, in the production of the polyamide resin composition of the present invention, the alkali metal compound (C) is added, if necessary, in the polycondensation of the polyamide, and the master batch is added after the polycondensation of the polyamide. Accordingly, M is a sum of values obtained by multiplying the mole concentrations of all of an alkali metal atom and an alkaline earth metal atom each contained per g of the polyamide resin composition by valencies thereof respectively.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In the present invention, a value (M/P) obtained by<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> dividing a total mole concentration M of an alkali metal atom and an alkaline earth metal atom each contained per g of the polyamide resin composition of the present invention by a mole concentration P of a phosphorus atom contained per g of the polyamide resin composition of the present invention is exceeding 5 and 200 or less, preferably 20 to 150 and more preferably 35 to 100 from the viewpoints of preventing gelation brought about in the mold processing, enhancing the processing stability in the melt molding and preventing the polyamide from being colored. If M/P is 5 or less, an effect of inhibiting the amidation reaction by adding the master batch is short in a certain case, and gels in the polyamide is increased in some cases. On the other hand, if M/P exceeds 200, the inferior molding is caused in a certain case by a reduction in the viscosity. In addition thereto, coloring and whitening are brought about in some cases, and the non-molten alkali compound (A) is deposited in a certain case.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">As described above, the same compound as the alkali metal compound (C) which can be added in producing the polyamide (X) is also shown as the example of the alkali compound (A) contained in the master batch obtained in the step (b).

Accordingly, a role of preventing gels from being formed in the mold processing can not be played by increasing an amount of the alkali metal compound (C) added in forming the polyamide (X) from the monomers by melt polymerization. In contrast with this, the master batch containing the polyamide (X) and the alkali compound (A) is added to the polyamide (X) in the step (c) in the present invention to thereby make it possible to prevent effectively gels from being formed in the mold processing.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">In the polyamide resin composition of the present invention which is produced by the process described above, gels can be inhibited from being formed in the melt polymerization for the polyamide, and gels can be inhibited as well from being formed in the mold processing of the resin composition obtained to make it possible to carry out the production stably for long time.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In the present invention, an effect of inhibiting gels of the polyamide resin composition from being formed is evaluated by comparing a gel ratio of the polyamide heated at a fixed temperature for a fixed time in a molten state at a high pressure under the estimation of a state to which the polyamide is exposed in molding. When the resin heated under applying pressure is dipped in hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> for 24 hours, the resin which is not gelatinized is completely dissolved therein, but the resin which is gelatinized remains in the form of an insoluble component of a swollen state. The gel ratio is calculated from the above insoluble component. The gel ratio referred to in the present invention means a value determined in terms of a percentage by dividing a weight of a residue obtained by filtrating the above insoluble component under vacuum by a membrane filter and then drying it by a denominator which is a weight of the resin weighed in advance before dipping in HFIP.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">A gel ratio of the polyamide resin composition of the present invention is smaller than a gel ratio of a polyamide resin composition produced without adding the master batch after polymerizing the polyamide.

<!-- EPO <DP n="70"> -->In contrast with this, in Examples 1 to 11 in which the master batch was added, a fish eye number of the films was small, and the gel ratio was low. Less gels were formed in the mold processing.<br/>
On the other hand, in Comparative Example 1 in which a total mole concentration of an alkali metal atom and an alkaline earth metal atom contained in the master batch was low, not only the film was yellowed, but also whitening was brought about to deteriorate notably the appearance. Further, in Comparative Example 2 in which a contained number of the particles of the alkali compound (A) having a particle diameter of 80 µm or more in the master batch was large and Comparative Example 3 in which an average particle diameter of the alkali compound (A) was large, it was confirmed that when carrying out mold processing by using the respective master batches, the resin pressure was elevated as time passed, and in addition thereto, it was confirmed as well that irregularities were formed on the film. Also, when sodium acetate having an average particle diameter of 80 µm was dry-blended as the raw material alkali compound directly with the polyamide without making use of the master batch in Comparative Example 4, irregularities were observed as well to be formed.

Further, in molding the master batch 10, a melt viscosity of the resin was reduced since the raw material alkali compound (A) was excessively contained as compared with the polyamide (X), and pelletization thereof by a pelletizer was difficult, so that it was not suited to subsequent mold processing.</p><heading id="h0050">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading><p id="p0111" num="0111">The polyamide resin composition prepared by making use of the master batch of the present invention is excellent in a gas barriering property and a transparency and has a good color tone.
