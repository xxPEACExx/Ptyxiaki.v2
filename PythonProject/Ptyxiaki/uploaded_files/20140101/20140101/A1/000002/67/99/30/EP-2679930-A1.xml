Further, the present invention is suitable for application to a refrigerating cycle system such as an air-conditioning water-heating system intended for a new-generation housing high in ecological (environmental responsiveness) effect, and is suitable for application to a refrigerating cycle system provided with a scroll compressor capable of carrying out an operation in a wide range, and efficiently performing a capacity-control even in an ultrasmall capacity-operation mode, in particular.</p><heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">From the standpoint of reducing energy consumed in common housing, that is, energy consumed by an air-conditioner, and energy consumed by a water heater, there has lately been seen an increasing tendency toward the use of material high in heat-insulating properties as a heat-insulating material in a building. Furthermore, there exists a concept of implementing a fossil-fuel zero-use housing whereby<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> integrated power consumption for one year is zeroed by the installation of solar power generator, and soar heaters.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Under this concept, a refrigerating cycle system, such as an air-conditioner, a water heater, and so forth, is in use. For example, in the case of a scroll compressor, it is required that a capacity-control in a wide range can be realized by use of one unit. More specifically, in a cooling operation by use of an air-conditioner, a room air-temperature is generally high at the time of starting the operation, so that there is the need for a quick operation. In such a case, a high-speed operation (high-speed rotation) large in volume is executed at a startup, however, when the interior is cooled to some extent, and the operation shifts to a steady operation state, a low-speed operation (low-speed rotation) small in volume is executed. In a low-speed operation in the steady operation state, the operation will be carried out at a very low rotation speed assuming the case where an air-conditioning machine is installed in a building provided with a highly heat-insulating material, using latest energy-saving techniques, in particular.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, if an excessively low-speed rotation is executed in the scroll compressor, this will structurally<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> cause occurrence of rupture of an oil film at a plain bearing to thereby render the plain bearing susceptible to damage, rendering it difficult to perform stable operative actions since smooth motor-driving for rotating a crankshaft is prevented because of the low-speed rotation, and so forth. Accordingly, at the time of a mall-capacity operation, a general practice is adopted whereby the rotation speed is maintained to some extent in order to perform a capacity-control, and if, for example, the indoor is cooled to some extent, the scroll compressor is stopped while if a room air temperature rises, the scroll compressor is started again, this operation pattern being repeated.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, the operation pattern for repeating stop and startup at the time of the mall-capacity operation is not only poor in efficiency but also incapable of performing comfortable air conditioning, there has been proposed a technique for devising a new capacity-control. In the case of executing a capacity-control with the use of the scroll compressor, there are generally adopted techniques including a technique for controlling a rotational speed by a motor rotation, a technique whereby a structure is partially modified to keep a rotation speed constant to thereby perform a control for rendering a discharge rate variable, or a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> technique for using these techniques in combination. Well known techniques for rendering a discharge volume variable include, for example, a scroll-type machine (refer to Patent Document 1) provided with a capacity-adjustment mechanism structured such that sealing in the axial direction of the crankshaft is released to stop compression, and an air-conditioner (refer to Patent Document 2) with a scroll compressor mounted therein, the scroll compressor provided with a capacity-adjustment mechanism whereby a refrigerant gas in the middle of compression is discharged toward a suction side to thereby delay the start of the compression.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In Patent Document 1, a high-pressure chamber, a discharge chamber, a low-pressure suction pipe that are formed between outer-shell connected fittings provided on one end side of the compressor, and a piston connected to a non-orbiting scroll are connected with each other via piping with a solenoid valve interposed therebetween, respectively, so that when the solenoid valve is turned ON (opened) by pulse width modulation (PWM) control, the high-pressure chamber is communicated with a low pressure suction pipe inside the piping, whereupon the non- orbiting scroll moves toward the crankshaft side, whereupon sealing is released in the axial direction of the crankshaft, thereby preventing compression. Then, when<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the solenoid valve is turned OFF (closed), the high-pressure chamber is connected with the discharge chamber inside the piping, whereupon the non- orbiting scroll moves toward the crankshaft side, on the opposite side of the outer-shell connected fittings, whereupon sealing is executed in the axial direction of the crankshaft, thereby performing a normal compression action.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The scroll-type machine according to Patent Document 1 is operated by turning the solenoid valve OFF (closed) at the time of a normal capacity-control while the solenoid valve is turned ON (open) at the time of the small capacity-control, and the refrigerant gas is returned to the suction pipe on the low pressure side to thereby adjust the discharge volume of the refrigerant gas, enabling capacity-control in a wide range of 0 to 100% to be implemented. As a result, this will enable a compression action at a small-capacity-control (the ultrasmall capacity-operation mode) corresponding to the case of an ultra-low speed operation at not higher than a low-limit set value of a motor rotational speed that cannot be actually realized owing to a problem of the rupture of the oil film at the sliding bearing, described as above, and torque change (in a drive signal to a motor, frequency is on the order of 5Hz), however, frequency in actual designing is set to a value higher<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> than that, to a range of about 15 to 20Hz). The refrigerant gas subjected compression is guided to a refrigerating cycle via a discharge pipe, thereby enabling refrigerant gas to be slowly circulated.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In Patent Document 2, there are provided the scroll compressor having a bypass port, a flow path where the bypass port is open to a suction pressure atmosphere, a control valve for opening/closing the flow path, and a control means for opening/closing the control valve according to a plurality of control patterns based on short-period time allocation that is set according to an operation load of the air-conditioner.<br/>
In the case of the air-conditioner with the scroll compressor mounted therein, according to Patent Document 2, the refrigerant gas in the middle of compression is discharged into a suction chamber, and a containment volume upon suction completion is reduced, thereby enabling capacity-control by 60% to be realized. Further, an operation with a capacity-control in a range of 60 to 100% by stages is realized by opening/closing the control valve for discharging the refrigerant gas in the middle of compression into the suction chamber according to the plural control patterns based on the short-period time allocation.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPHEI81996334094B"><text>Hei8(1996)-334094</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JPHEI111999324951B"><text>Hei11(1999)-324951</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">In a capacity-control operation using a compressor for variably controlling a discharge volume, a discharge pressure, and a suction pressure undergo change due to the opening/closing of a control valve for capacity-control, such as the solenoid valve, and so forth. If ON (opening) - OFF (closing) cycle (a duty period)) is large at the time of a pulse width modulation control (hereinafter referred to as PWM control), in particular, change in a suction pressure is large, and if this capacity-control scheme is applied to an air-conditioner, a blow-off temperature will undergo variation, and comfortability can be no longer maintained. Furthermore, in the case of the capacity-control scheme described as above, losses occur at the time of the opening/closing of the control valve, so that if the duty period is rendered shorter, the losses will increase although the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> variation decreases, thereby causing deterioration in efficiency.<br/>
With the one according to Patent Document 1, capacity-adjustment is performed by subjecting the solenoid valve to the PWM control to be turned ON/OFF, and the capacity-control in a wide range can be performed. However, in Patent Document 1, it is simply described that the solenoid valve is subjected to the PWM control to vary an ON - OFF time (a duty period) for the purpose of adjustment to a target capacity, thereby effecting the capacity-control, however, no consideration is given to enhancement in comfortability while suppressing deterioration in efficiency.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the case of the one according to Patent Document 2, a load state of a refrigerating cycle is detected on the basis of respective signals from a temperature sensor, and a pressure sensor, provided at the condenser, and the evaporator, respectively, thereby switching between a capacity-control operation, and a full-load operation. In the capacity-control operation, a bypass operation is executed according to predetermined time allocation.

With the capacity-adjustment mechanism for executing an ultrasmall-capacity control in the ultralow-load operation mode, the solenoid valve 12 provided in the bypass piping 11 is controlled so as to in the open (ON) state, and the closed (OFF) state by the pulse width modulation (PWM) control, thereby performing a capacity-adjust operation.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">At the time when the solenoid valve 12 is in the open state, a check valve 121 (refer to <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10</figref>) provided at an outlet of the compressor 1 is closed, and a discharge refrigerant gas passes through the bypass piping 11 to flow to a low-pressure side connection piping (a suction pipe). For this reason, the refrigerant does not flow toward the four-way valve 5, and a flow rate of the refrigerant in the refrigerating cycle decreases, thereby causing a decrease in capacity. On the other hand, if the solenoid valve 12 is set in the closed state, it is possible to cause the discharge refrigerant gas from the compressor to flow toward the four-way valve 5.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Accordingly, at the time of an operation in the ultralow-load operation mode, when the capacity-adjustment mechanism is activated, the solenoid valve 12 is caused to make a repetitive action so as to be in the open state, or the closed<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> state to thereby repeat opening/closing of the bypass piping 11, rendering it possible to execute capacity-adjustment.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Now, the state of change in an evaporating pressure at the time when the solenoid valve 12 is under the PWM control is described hereinafter with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. If the PWM control signal is turned ON (the solenoid valve 12 is in the open state), the evaporating pressure rises. Further, if the PWM control signal is turned OFF (the solenoid valve 12 is in the closed state), the evaporating pressure falls. Thus, as the solenoid valve 12 is turned ON/OFF, variation (change) in the evaporating pressure is repeated.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">At the time of a capacity-adjustment operation making use of the bypass piping 11, a variation width of an evaporating pressure is defined ΔP1. Further, at the time of the capacity-adjustment operation, the evaporating pressures as a whole rises, and a mean pressure of various evaporating pressures rises by ΔP2 against the evaporating pressure prior to the capacity-adjustment operation. If ΔP1 at the time of the capacity-adjustment operation is large, the evaporating pressure subsequently will undergo variation to thereby cause variation in a heat exchange amount in the evaporator, so that the capacity of the refrigerating cycle system undergoes<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> variation, thereby causing occurrence of variation in a blow-out temperature. For this reason, ΔP1 is preferably reduced in order to maintain comfortable air-conditioning. Further, if ΔP2 is large, endothermic energy will decrease, so that the heat exchange amount, as well, will decrease. In order to render both ΔP1, and ΔP2 smaller, it need only be sufficient to reduce a duty period T (= τ1 + τ2) of the PWM control signal. However, there occur energy losses because of a back flow of the discharge refrigerant gas, losses in the pressure of the bypass piping 11, and so forth, occurring at the time of opening/closing the solenoid valve 12, in a PWM capacity-control operation. For this reason, in order to efficiently perform the capacity-adjustment operation, it is preferable not to reduce the duty period T.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Accordingly, with the present embodiment, in order to realize air-conditioning high in efficiency, and small in variation (change) of the evaporating pressure, an adequate duty period is decided in accordance with flow charts shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>, respectively, thereby effecting control of the capacity-adjustment operation.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">First, referring to a flow chart shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, a compressor rotational-speed control routine is described.

At this point in time, upon the PWM control signal being turned ON, a controller timer as well is turned ON, thereby starting to<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> count elapsed-time τ1. Further, the suction pressure sensor 23 starts measuring a suction pressure, repeating a measurement on the pressure, while the PWM control signal remains in the ON state until a measured suction pressure Ps exceeds a suction pressure Ps0 before the PWM control signal is turned ON by a preset allowable deviation ΔP (steps 38 to 41). If a difference between the measured suction pressure Ps and the initial suction pressure Ps0 exceeds ΔP, the PWM control signal is turned OFF, the solenoid valve 12 is turned into the closed state, and the timer is turned OFF, whereupon counting of the elapsed-time is completed, deciding τ1 as opening time (step 42). On the basis of the opening time τ1, and a present duty ratio d, closing time τ2 is decided, and the PWM capacity-control operation based on this duty period is performed (step 43). Thereby, change in the suction pressure, caused by the opening/closing of the solenoid valve 12, can be decided so as to fall within ΔP, so that an operation based on an optimum duty period is enabled by setting the ΔP in such a range as not to impair comfortability.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a flow chart for describing an expansion-valve opening-control routine in the refrigerating cycle system according to the present embodiment.

Then, when the PWM control signal is OFF (in step 46), the opening of the expansion valve 3 is controlled such that the sensed temperature (the discharge refrigerant temperature) Td of the discharge-temperature sensor 13 will approach the target discharge temperature Td* determined from a sensed temperature (condensation temperature) Tao of the outdoor heat-exchanger temperature sensor 15, a detection temperature (an outdoor air temperature) Tai of the outdoor<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> temperature sensor 17, the rotational speed f<sub>z</sub> of the compressor 1, and the rotational speed command value fp of the outdoor fan 21 (steps 47 to 51).</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">If the PWM control signal is ON in the step 46, a corrected compressor rotational speed f<sub>z</sub><sup>'</sup>, obtained by dividing the rotational speed f<sub>z</sub>opt at the time of starting the capacity-control operation by a duty ratio "d" at that point in time is decided (step 52), thereupon switching is made to a routine whereby the expansion valve 3 is controlled such that the sensed temperature (the discharge refrigerant temperature) Td of the discharge-temperature sensor 13 will approach the target discharge temperature Td* determined from the corrected compressor rotational speed f<sub>z</sub><sup>'</sup>, the sensed temperature (condensation temperature) Tao of the outdoor heat-exchanger temperature sensor 15, the detection temperature (the outdoor air temperature) Tai of the outdoor temperature sensor 17, and the rotational speed command value fp of the outdoor fan 21 (steps 52 to 57). At the time of the PWM capacity-control operation, the larger the duty ratio d is, the less a refrigerant circulation amount becomes, so that the opening of the expansion valve 3 can be changed to an adequate opening even against a reduced refrigerant circulation amount at the time of the PWM capacity-control<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> operation, and ΔP2 can be prevented from rising.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">With the refrigerating cycle system according to the present embodiment, variation (change) in the suction pressure (the evaporating pressure), due to the opening/the closing of the solenoid valve 12, can be decided so as to be in a range based on the allowable deviation ΔP, so that it is possible to suppress the variation (change) in the suction pressure to fall within a given range, thereby enabling comfortability in air-conditioning, and so forth to be enhanced. Further, since it is possible to prevent occurrence of an increase in losses, caused by an excessively shortened duty period, a highly efficient capacity-control operation can be realized.

The third embodiment differs from the first embodiment, and the second embodiment, respectively, in that the suction pressure sensor 23, as shown in the first embodiment, and the blow-out temperature sensor 24 installed in the vicinity of the outlet of the ventilation passage of the indoor heat exchanger 4, as shown in the second embodiment, are removed.<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --></p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In the case of executing the control by use of the capacity-adjustment mechanism for effecting the small-capacity control, upon the PWM control signal being turned ON (that is, the solenoid valve 12 is in the open state), an evaporating pressure rises, while upon the PWM control signal being turned OFF (that is, the solenoid valve 12 is in the closed state), the evaporating pressure falls. At this point in time, an evaporation temperature as well undergoes change, and a heat exchange amount in an evaporator undergoes change, so that a refrigerating cycle undergoes change , thereby causing occurrence of change in the blow-out temperature, and a refrigeration capacity. For this reason, change in the evaporation temperature is estimated by measuring the temperature of an evaporator-side heat exchanger (an indoor heat exchanger 4 at the time of the cooling operation, and an outdoor heat exchanger 2 at the time of the heating operation), whereupon the control can be executed.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">At the time of a normal operation, the evaporator-side heat exchanger is operated so as to effect the discharge superheat control such that a suction superheat at the outlet thereof is rendered nearly zero, that is, dryness 1, as previously described. As dryness at the inlet of the<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> evaporator-side heat exchanger is normally in a range of about 0.1 to 0.3, the evaporator-side heat exchanger has a distribution such that dryness gradually increases from the inlet toward the outlet inside the heat exchanger. At the time of the capacity-control operation, a circulation amount of the refrigerant decreases, and an amount of the refrigerant flowing out of the evaporator-side heat exchanger will decrease against an amount of the refrigerant flowing into the evaporator-side heat exchanger, so that the evaporating pressure rises, and the evaporation temperature rises, however, a liquid refrigerant undergoes phase change from a liquid phase to a gas phase, and dryness gradually increases. Accordingly, inside the evaporator-side heat exchanger, the refrigerant gradually becomes drier starting from the outlet side of the heat exchanger, a heat exchange amount becomes extremely smaller starting from a point closer to the outlet side. If the heat-exchanger temperature sensor (the reference numeral 14, or 15) is installed in the vicinity of the center of the relevant heat-exchanger, the evaporator-side heat exchanger temperature (the evaporator temperature) Tev measured by the sensor will behave as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>.

Furthermore, since the capacity-adjustment mechanism provided in the scroll compressor according to the present embodiment is simple in structure, reduction in cost, miniaturization, reduction in weight, and mass-production can be easily realized with respect to the scroll compressor.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">As described in the foregoing, with the refrigerating cycle system according to the present embodiment, the duty period as a cycle of a switchover time between the load-operation and the unload-operation is controlled such that the deviation of the evaporating pressure falls within a given value, and a rise as well as change of the suction pressure can therefore be controlled within a threshold value, thereby enabling comfortablity such as suitable air conditioning, and so forth to be enhanced. Further, with the present embodiment, the losses due to an excessively shortened duty period can be prevented, so that it is possible to realize a high-performance refrigerating cycle system capable of implementing an operation high in efficiency, and a highly efficient capacity-control in a wide range of 0 to 100%. Further, with the present embodiment, since the highly efficient capacity-control in the wide range can be<!-- EPO <DP n="57"> --> implemented, reduction in cost is enabled.
