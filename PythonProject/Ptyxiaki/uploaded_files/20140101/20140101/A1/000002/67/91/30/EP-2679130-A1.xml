In other words, the robot cleaner automatically performs cleaning of a certain area. To this end, the robot cleaner is provided with a distance sensor to sense a distance from an obstacle such as furniture, office supplies, or a wall in the area to be cleaned, and left and right wheels for movement of the robot cleaner. Here, the left and right wheels are respectively configured to be rotated by a left wheel motor and a right wheel motor. According to operation of the left wheel motor and the right wheel motor, the robot cleaner autonomously performs indoor cleaning, changing travel direction.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In addition, the robot cleaner is provided, at a lower portion thereof, with a suction nozzle to suction foreign substances from the floor. The suction nozzle includes a nozzle case fixed to the body of the cleaner so as not to be moved, a suction inlet formed on the bottom of the nozzle case to suction foreign substances, and an agitator rotatably arranged at the suction inlet to gather foreign substances such as dust accumulated on the floor to the suction inlet.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In addition to the left and right wheels, which are usually electrically driven, the robot cleaner is further provided with a caster allowing smooth rotating motion of the robot cleaner.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the conventional technology described above, when the robot cleaner climbs up the threshold abruptly rising from a lower position to a higher position or enters a carpet, the driving force for the left and right wheels and the frictional force between the left and right wheels and the surface may be insufficient to climb up an encountered stepped portion depending on the height of the stepped portion, and thereby the robot cleaner may fail to climb up the stepped portion.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Particularly, while the robot cleaner needs to be capable of climbing up a stepped portion having a great difference in height between the upper and lower sides of the stepped portion such as the threshold, but the robot cleaner often fails to climb. As a result, the space on the opposite side of the threshold is not cleaned.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a robot cleaner and a method for controlling the same that substantially obviate one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">An object of the present invention is to provide a robot cleaner which is capable of climbing up a higher stepped portion than in conventional cases and a method for controlling the same.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Another object of the present invention is to provide a robot cleaner which is capable of stably travel in climbing up a stepped portion and a method for controlling the same.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the invention.

Subsequently, with rotation of the main wheel 40, the slope 12 is raised along the front surface of the stepped portion 80, and is caused to move over the stepped portion 80 by inclination of the slope 12 and the driving power of the body 10 from rotation of the main wheel 40.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">As the main wheel 40 continuously rotates, the slope 12 in contact with the stepped portion 80 is separated from the stepped portion 80.

Once the auxiliary front wheel 20 moves to the top of the stepped portion 80, the front side of the stepped portion 80 remains disposed higher than the rear side of the stepped portion 80 for a predetermined time. In the case that the body 10 passes over an uneven portion having a height less than the height of a usual stepped portion 80, inclination of the body 10 is sensed for a time shorter than the predetermined time, and the inclination is removed in a short time. Accordingly, the body 10 may remain in the horizontal position. In the case of encountering such an uneven portion, the robot cleaner is allowed to travel according to the rotational force of the main wheel 40, and therefore the main wheel 40 is not lowered. Here, the predetermined time may be set to a proper time determined by a manufacturer of the robot cleaner.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">Further, whether the auxiliary front wheel 20 has entered the stepped portion 80 may be determined by increase in load applied to the main wheels 40. When the auxiliary front wheel 20 is moved to the top of the stepped portion 80, the front side of the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> body 10 is higher than the rear side thereof, and therefore a smaller portion of the weight of the body 10 is supported by the auxiliary front wheel 20. On the other hand, a larger portion of the weight of the body 10 is supported by the main wheels 40. In addition, as the auxiliary front wheel 20 is moved to the top of the stepped portion 80, greater rotational power needs to be transferred to the main wheels 40 than when on a level surface to maintain the same traveling speed as the speed at which the body 10 travels on the level surface. Accordingly, by combining various types of information, whether the auxiliary front wheel 20 has entered the stepped portion 80 may be determined.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">Meanwhile, entry of the auxiliary front wheel 20 onto the stepped portion 80 may mean that the auxiliary front wheel 20 contacts the upper surface of the stepped portion 80.

In the case that the main wheel 40 is lowered, the sensors 90 may allow the driving motor 60 to rotate until it is determined that the body 10 is no longer inclined, i.e., until the body 10 is level, and may stop rotation of the driving motor 60 when the body 10 is level.</p><p id="p0105" num="0105">As the main wheel 40 is lowered, the body 10 is raised with respect to the main wheel 40, and thereby the body 10 may become level.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">Meanwhile, the main wheel 40 vertically moves and therefore the robot cleaner according to the illustrated embodiment may climb up a higher stepped portion than in conventional cases.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0107" num="0107">In conventional cases, heavy load is applied to the main wheels 40 from the moment at which the slope 12 starts to go up the stepped portion 80 until the main wheels 40 are about to climb the stepped portion 80. Supporting this heavy load, the main wheels 40 may be raised by friction between the main wheels 40 and the floor surface and larger rotational power applied to the main wheels 40. However, the friction and the rotational power applied to the main wheels 40 do not increase beyond specific values. That is, the height of the stepped portion 80 that the main wheels are allowed to climb by friction and rotational power is limited.</p><p id="p0108" num="0108">Further, as the body 10 keeps moving forward to the stepped portion 80 with the auxiliary front wheel 20 raised to the top of the stepped portion 80 as exemplarily shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8</figref>, the front side of the body 10 is increasingly raised with respect to the rear side thereof, and thus the inclination angle of the body 10 increases. When the auxiliary rear wheel 30 comes into contact with the floor surface in this situation, friction between the main wheels 40 and the floor surface will inevitably be reduced. Therefore, even if the rotational power of the main wheels 40 is large, the body 10 may not climb up the stepped portion 80 anymore.</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">Particularly, when forward movement of the body 10 to the stepped portion 80 results in a situation in which the body 10 is supported by the auxiliary rear wheel 30 and the auxiliary front wheel 20, i.e., the main wheels 40 do not contact the floor surface, the robot cleaner may not move either forward or backward. This is because forward or backward movement of the robot cleaner is caused not by the auxiliary front wheel 20 and the auxiliary rear wheel 30 but by driving force from the main wheels 40.</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">To address such situation, the main wheels 40 according to the illustrated embodiment are allowed to vertically move, and thus the main wheels 40 may remain in contact with the floor surface.
