By this action of accelerating the blood circulation, it displays various physiological effects such as dropping of blood pressure, improving of metabolism or accelerating to remove pain substances or waste products. Further, it has also anti-inflammation and anti-bacterial function. Therefore, carbon dioxide has recently been given attentions also from viewpoints of improving health or accelerating beauty other than the purpose of medical cares.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the tissue of the living body, carbon dioxide works to release oxygen having been carried in combination with hemoglobin existing in a red blood cell. Around parts at the high concentration of carbon dioxide, the red blood cell releases more oxygen. Thus, supply of oxygen to cells by the red blood cell is mainly controlled by carbon dioxide. In short, being without carbon dioxide, hemoglobin remains as having been combined with oxygen and the cell becomes unable to receive oxygen. Carbon dioxide seems to be waste products resulted from action of the cell, however, as is seen, it plays in fact very important roles in the living body.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Further, recently, oxygen of the high concentration has also widely been known as effective over activity of metabolism, acceleration of blood circulation, fatigue recovery, or stability of blood pressure. Other than them, oxygen has effects of disinfection or sterilization by oxidation.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">By the way, for easing a symptom of disease in a respiratory system such as asthma or allergic rhinitis, oral nasogastric inhalation of medicines or steam using an inhaler or a nose spray have been till now carried out.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">An inventor of this invention has invented a gas mist inhaler, in which carbon dioxide or oxygen is efficiently dissolved in a liquid to turn out a mist for causing a physiological action of these gases to effectively influence to the living body. For example, the gas supplied into the gas mist generator is divided into two branches for using one part to generate the gas mist, while for supplying the other toward a discharge part from a gas mist generation part in order to heighten gas mist supply pressure of the gas mist generator.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0004">PROBLEMS THAT THE INVENTION IS TO SOLVE</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, in the prior art gas mist inhaler, gas was branched within the gas mist generator, and guided to a gas mist generation part the through such as an outside installed tube. A case of using as above the outside installed tube was involved with problems of taking labors and at the same time increasing production costs. Further, if gas pressure is high, gas probably leaks from a connecting part of a tube.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Then, in view of the above mentioned circumstances, the invention is to provide such a gas mist inhaler, in which a gas introduction part for heightening pressure to supply the gas mist is made integral with a gas mist generator in order to realize a simplified structure and cost reduction.</p><heading id="h0005">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">For solving the above mentioned problems, the invention<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> is to provide such a gas mist inhaler, which comprises a gas supply means of supplying oxygen, carbon dioxide, or mixed gas (called as "gas" hereafter) of oxygen and carbon dioxide; a gas mist generation means of generating a mist (called as "gas mist" hereafter) prepared by pulverizing and dissolving the gas supplied from the gas supply means as well as the liquid stored in an inside thereof, and of supplying the mist under a condition of mixing with the gas; and an inhalation member connected to the gas mist generation means and having an inhalation port for causing the above mentioned gas mist to be absorbed into the living body; wherein the above mentioned gas mist generation means is integrally provided with a connection part to the gas supply means; a diverging part of branching a gas flow from the connection part; a liquid storage of storing the liquid; a nozzle of discharging one-side gas flow branched by the diverging part; a liquid suction pipe of sending the liquid to a front end of the nozzle; a collision member of colliding the liquid blown up by the gas flow discharged from the nozzle with this collision member; a confluent part of joining the generated gas mist with the gas from an upward side; a gas introduction part of leading the other-side gas flow branched by the diverging part until the confluent part; and a gas mist discharge part of collecting and discharging the generated gas mist and gas.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">By the way, the invention refers it as "pulverizing and dissolving" to pulverize the liquid into fine liquid drops, and cause to contact and mix with gas (oxygen or carbon dioxide, or the mixed gas of oxygen and carbon dioxide).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Herein, with respect to the gas mist inhaler of this invention, in the gas mist generation means, it is desirable that the at least liquid storage is made replaceable and exchangeable with another liquid storage.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Herein, the gas mist generating means has preferably an air hole for taking in outside air, otherwise the inhalation member to have also sufficiently a further opening for taking in outside air.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The gas supply means is desirably a gas bomb of a cartridge system.

In addition, the front end 35B of the liquid suction pipe-forming member 35 opens nearly the front end open 34A of the nozzle 34, and the liquid sucked up by the liquid suction pipe 35A collides with the gas flow discharged from the nozzle 34.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The liquid sucked up by the liquid suction pipe 35A collides with the gas flow discharged from the nozzle 34 and is blown up, struck against the baffle 36 placed in opposition to the front end open 34A of the nozzle 34 and crashed to turn out the gas mist.
