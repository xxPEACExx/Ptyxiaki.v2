Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a pencil sharpener, and more particularly to an adjustable pencil sharpener having capabilities of adjusting degrees of sharpness of a pencil tip and providing a user with a clear signal when the adjusting process is completed.</p><heading id="h0002">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A pencil sharpener can sharpen a pencil to expose and sharpen the pencil core for writing. To fit with different needs, an adjustable pencil sharpener is provided to adjust degrees of sharpness of pencil tips. With reference to <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 7</figref>, a conventional pencil sharpener disclosed in Taiwan Utility Model No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="TWM384109"><text>M384109</text></patcit>, entitled "Pencil Lead Sharpener Having Two Operation Stages", comprises a waste case 70, a first blade base 71, a second blade base 72, a cam 73 and a rotating board 74. The first blade base 71, the second blade base 72 and the cam 73 are mounted in the waste case 70. The second blade base 72 is mounted on and axially moveable relative to a bottom of the first blade base 71. The cam 73 has multiple pushing protrusions 731 in different longitudinal heights formed on and protruding from a top of the cam 73, and the second blade base 72 has a bottom abutting one of the pushing protrusions 731 on the cam 73. The rotating board 74 is mounted on and exposed from a bottom of the waste case 70 and is connected with the cam 73. When the rotating board 74 is rotated, the cam 73 can be rotated to push the second blade base 72 to move axially relative to the first blade base 71. Accordingly, the relative axial distance between the first and second blade bases 71,72 can be changed, and the tip of the pencil can be<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> sharpened into varying degrees of sharpness.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, the conventional pencil sharpener has the following drawback. When the rotating board 74 is rotating to adjust the sharpness of the pencil tips, the conventional pencil sharpener cannot provide the user with a clear feedback signal to show that the adjusting process is completed by positioning the blade bases 71,72. The rotating board 74 may be over-rotated or the user gests confused about the direction in which the rotating board 74 should be rotated, so the conventional pencil sharpener is inconvenient in use.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">To overcome the shortcomings, the present invention tends to provide a pencil sharpener to mitigate or obviate the aforementioned problems.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The main objective of the invention is to provide an adjustable pencil sharpener that can adjust the degree of sharpness of a pencil tip. With the engagement between at least one engaging segment on a rotating knob and positioning segments on a waste case, vibrations and sounds will be generated to provide users with a clear feedback signal that the adjusting process is completed.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">To achieve the aforementioned objective, the pencil sharpener of the present invention has a waste case, a blade base, a blocking chunk, a blade, a rotating knob and an adjusting shaft. The waste case has a mounting hole and multiple positioning segments. The mounting hole is defined in the waste case and has an inner wall. The positioning segments are formed on the inner wall of the mounting hole. The blade base is mounted in the waste case and has a bottom. The blocking chunk is moveably mounted on the bottom of the blade base along an axial direction of the blade base and has a bottom. The blade is mounted<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> securely on the blade base. The rotating knob is mounted rotatably in the mounting hole in the waste case and has at least one engaging segment selectively engaging the positioning segments of the waste case. The adjusting shaft is connected securely with the rotating knob, is disposed on the bottom of the blocking chunk and abuts a bottom of the blocking chunk. When the rotating knob is rotated, the adjusting shaft is rotated to push the blocking chunk to move along the axial direction.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">With the pencil sharpener in accordance with the present invention, the axial position of the blocking chunk relative to the blade base can be changed by means of rotating the rotating knob to rotate the adjusting shaft. Thus, different sharpening effects can be applied to a sharpened pencil. With the vibrations and sounds generated by the engagement between the at least one engaging segment of the rotating knob and the positioning segments of the waste case, a clear feedback signal that the adjusting process is completed is provided to a user. Accordingly, the sharpening condition of the pencil tip, such as the degrees of bluntness or sharpness can be actually controlled and recognized.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Other objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>IN THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a pencil sharpener in accordance with the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is an exploded perspective view of the pencil sharpener in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2A</figref> is an enlarged end view of the adjusting shaft of the pencil<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> sharpener in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 3</figref> is another exploded perspective view of the pencil sharpener in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 4</figref> is a side view in partial section of the pencil sharpener in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 5</figref> is an operational perspective view of the pencil sharpener in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> with the front casing removed and showing the pencil sharpener in a first operation stage;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 6</figref> is another operational perspective view of the pencil sharpener in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> with the front casing removed and showing the pencil sharpener in a second operation stage; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 7</figref> is an operational perspective view of a pencil lead sharpener in Taiwan Utility Model No.<patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="TWM384109"><text> M384109</text></patcit>.</li></ul></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">Figs. 1 to 4</figref>, a pencil sharpener in accordance with the present invention comprises a waste case 10, a blade base 20, a blocking chunk 30, a blade 40, a rotating knob 50 and an adjusting shaft 60.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The waste case 10 is flat, egg-shaped and hollow and comprises a front casing 11, a rear casing 12 and a side cover 13.

When the rotating knob 50 is rotated, the adjusting shaft 60 is also rotated to push the blocking chunk 30 to move along the axial direction of the blade base 20 by the periphery surface of the adjusting wheel 62. Preferably, the periphery surface of the adjusting wheel 62 has a top segment and at least one side segment, and the radial distance R1 from the top segment to the axial line L of the shaft body 61 is longer than the radial distance R2 from the at least one side segment to the axial line L of the shaft body 61. In addition, the adjusting wheel 62 further has a limiting block 621 formed on and protruding from the bottom of the periphery surface of the adjusting wheel 62 and held in the limiting recess 122 in the rear casing 12 of the waste case 10.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As shown in the preferred embodiment, the waste case 10 has four positioning segments 112 formed on the inner wall of the mounting hole 111, and each positioning segment 112 is a cavity. Two indication members 113 are implemented on the outer surface of the waste case 10, and one indication member has a blunt tip shape and the other has a sharp tip shape. The rotating knob 50 has two connecting tabs 53, and the engaging segment 532 of each connecting tab 53 is a protrusion so the engaging segments 532 on the two connecting tabs 53 selectively engage two of the positioning segments 112 in the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> waste case 10. The top segment of the adjusting wheel 62 of the adjusting shaft 60 is a flat surface, and each one of the at least one side segment of the adjusting wheel 62 is a curved surface. The radial distance R1 from the flat surface to the axial line L of the shaft body 61 is longer than the radial distance R2 from each one of the at least one curved surface to the axial line L of the shaft body 61.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">With such an arrangement, two operation stages are provided. Two different sharpening effects applied to a pencil tip can be rapidly shifted by rotating the rotating knob 50 according to the positions of the indication members 113. With reference to <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 5</figref>, when the rotating knob 50 is rotated to align the operating rib 51 with the indication member 113 having the blunt tip shape, the adjusting shaft 60 is rotated to enable the top segment having a long radial distance to abut and push the blocking chunk 30. Consequently, the blocking chunk 30 can be lifted and enter further into the pencil inserting hole 21 of the blade base 20. When a pencil is inserted into the pencil inserting hole 21 for sharpening, the tip of the pencil comes into abutment on the blocking chunk 30 sooner. Thus, the pencil will be less sharpened to form a blunt tip. With reference to <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 6</figref>, when the rotating knob 50 is rotated in reverse to align the operating rib 51 with the indication member 113 having the sharp tip shape, the adjusting shaft 60 is rotated to enable the side segment having a short radial distance to abut and push the blocking chunk 30. Consequently, the blocking chunk 30 is descended and moves away from the pencil inserting hole 21 of the blade base 20. When a pencil is inserted into the pencil inserting hole 21 for sharpening, the tip of the pencil will come into abutment on the blocking chunk 30 later. Thus, the pencil will be sharpened more to form a sharp tip.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">When any one of the aforementioned adjusting processes is completed, the engaging segments 532 on the connecting tabs 53 of the rotating knob 50 will engage two of the positioning segments 112 in the waste case 10 to generate vibrations and sounds. Accordingly, the user can be noted that the adjusting process is completed and the pencil can be sharpened to a desired sharpness. In addition, with the limiting block 621 on the adjusting shaft 60 abutting between two end walls of the limiting recess 122 in the waste case 10, the rotation range of the rotating knob 50 can be limited.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of the invention, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977151" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A pencil sharpener, <b>characterized in that</b> the pencil sharpener comprises:
