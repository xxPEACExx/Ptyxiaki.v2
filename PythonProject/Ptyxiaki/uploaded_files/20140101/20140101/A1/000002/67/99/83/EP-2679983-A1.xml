Three basic components are required for absorption measurements: a light source, a sample cell, and a detector. Absorption of light by the analyte is registered as a decrease in the intensity of light transmitted through the sample cell when the analyte is present. The concentration of the analyte is related to the magnitude of absorption.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Mercury is one of the few elements occurring in the gas phase; compared to gas phase molecules, it has an exceptionally strong and narrow absorption line, which occurs at 254 nm in the deep-ultraviolet. Unfortunately, other major trace gases such as ozone, sulfur dioxide, and aromatic compounds also absorb at this wavelength (and aerosols also scatter and absorb light), making it difficult to reliably attribute an observed absorption solely to mercury. Furthermore, the sensitivity of absorption measurements is reduced by variations in the output of the mercury line source (usually a low pressure mercury fluorescence lamp or a mercury electrodeless discharge lamp).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">European Patent Application No: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP2282193A1"><text>2282193A1</text></patcit> discloses an atomic absorption mercury analyzer based on differential absorption that employs a magnetic field to split the atomic emission lines according to the Zeeman effect. As a result there are three emission lines, only one of which interacts with the mercury in the sample. Discrimination between the lines is based on modulating the polarization of the lines, and from this modulation and the resulting polarization, the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> wavelengths transmitted through the cell modulate between "on" absorption and "off" absorption wavelengths. The device disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP2282193A1"><text>EP2282193A1</text></patcit> is complicated and expensive to manufacture.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is an object of the invention to overcome at least one of the above-referenced problems.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>Statements of Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The invention is based on the differential absorption across the 254nm absorption band of mercury. Naturally-occurring mercury is comprised of several isotopes (<sup>198</sup>Hg, 10.1%; <sup>199</sup>Hg, 16.9%; <sup>200</sup>Hg, 23.1%; <sup>201</sup>Hg, 13.2%; <sup>202</sup>Hg, 29.9%; <sup>204</sup>Hg, 6.9%), each of which gives rise to one or more absorption lines around 254 nm. At ambient pressures, the resulting absorption profile of naturally-occurring mercury has a shape reflecting the relative abundance of the constituent isotopes and the positions of their absorption lines. It is then possible to quantify the mercury concentration from the ratio of absorption at two wavelengths in the mercury absorption band, where the absorption at one wavelength is stronger than at another. The advantage of using the absorption ratio is that it is highly sensitive to mercury concentrations, but is little affected by other gases because the absorption of these gases does not change appreciably across the spectrally narrow absorption line of mercury. The approach thus provides superb specificity to mercury, even in complex chemical environments such as emission stacks.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Differentiation of the absorption at the two wavelength regions may be accomplished in several ways, for example: (1) by using isotopically distinct light sources and distinguishing their intensities (e.g., at different times);<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> or (2) by spectral filtering of a narrow mercury emission line after it traverses a sample. In the latter case, an atomic filter containing isotopically-enriched mercury is used to remove selected spectral components of the transmitted light, based on the strong absorption of the mercury vapour. Detection may be accomplished in either transmission (where the mercury filter functions as an extremely narrow band-rejection filter) or in emission (where fluorescence from the atomic line filter is measured) mode. The ratio of two measured intensities (using either a second isotopic atomic line filter, or comparison to the unfiltered intensity) is then related to the differential absorption of mercury in the sample, and it is this differential absorption which forms the basis on which the mercury in the sample is quantified.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The invention is commercially attractive for monitoring relatively high mercury emissions, such as in continuous emission monitoring (CEM) of power plant and industrial emissions. Such regulatory monitoring requires expensive instrumentation and imposes a significant cost on such industries. The method and devices based on it are expected to be significantly lower in cost and require less maintenance, than other methods. Potentially, the approach could also be applied to open-path monitoring of mercury in the atmosphere, with applications in air quality monitoring and industrial fence-line monitoring.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Accordingly, in a first aspect, the invention provides a method for analysis (for example detection, identification or quantification) of gaseous elemental mercury in a gaseous sample using light absorption or fluorescence, which method comprises the steps of passing light through the gaseous sample and detecting the transmitted intensities or fluorescence at two wavelengths regions across the 254nm<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> absorption band of mercury, and determining the differential absorption between the two wavelength regions. The differential absorption at the two wavelength regions is determined using either isotope-ratio distinct mercury emission as the light source, or an atomic line filter or filters based on isotope-ratio distinct mercury. The differential absorption correlates with a characteristic of gaseous elemental mercury, generally the concentration of gaseous elemental mercury in the sample. Ideally, the function of the differential absorption/fluorescence intensities at the two wavelengths is a ratio of the two intensities.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Thus, the method of the invention employs differential absorption as a means of greatly reducing the influence of interferences from molecular absorption or aerosol extinction.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The term "two wavelengths regions across the 254nm absorption band of mercury" refers to different or distinct wavelength regions within or overlapping the 254nm absorption band of mercury.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In this specification, the term "gaseous elemental mercury" should be understood to mean mercury atoms in the gas phase, usually (but not necessarily) in their natural isotopic abundances.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In one embodiment, the step of detecting absorption at two wavelength regions across the 254nm absorption band of mercury comprises the steps of passing light from two isotope-ratio distinct mercury light sources through the gaseous sample, and detecting absorption of light from each source by the gaseous sample.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In this specification, the term "two isotope-ratio distinct mercury light sources" should be understood to mean mercury light sources, for example mercury lamps (e.g., in a low vapour mercury lamp or an electrodeless discharge lamp), that have different ratios of mercury isotopes. Thus, for example, the first light source may be a mercury lamp enriched with a first mercury isotope and the second light source may be a mercury lamp enriched with a second mercury isotope. Alternatively, the first light source may be an isotope-enriched mercury lamp and the second light source may be a mercury lamp that is not enriched in any mercury isotope.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In a different embodiment, but applying the same principle, the step of detecting absorption at two wavelength regions across the 254nm absorption band of mercury comprises the step of passing a first portion of the light through an atomic filter containing mercury having a first isotope ratio, wherein a second portion of the light is either unfiltered or filtered through an atomic filter containing mercury having an isotope ratio that is different to the first isotope ratio.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Thus, the two atomic filters (when two are employed) comprise mercury having different isotope ratios. Thus, the first filter may comprise a first mercury isotope (or mercury enriched in a first mercury isotope), and the second filter may comprise a second mercury isotope (or mercury enriched in a first mercury isotope).</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Detection may be accomplished in either transmission (where the mercury filter functions as an extremely narrow band-rejection filter) or in emission (where fluorescence from the atomic line filter is measured) mode.

Suitable commercially-available light sources include low vapour pressure mercury lamps and mercury electrodeless discharge lamps using mercury at its natural abundance.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In this specification, the term "mercury isotope" should be understood to mean <sup>198</sup>Hg, <sup>199</sup>Hg, <sup>200</sup>Hg, <sup>201</sup>Hg, <sup>202</sup>Hg, or <sup>204</sup>Hg<sub>.</sub> Preferably, the term "enriched" should be taken to mean that the mercury sample comprises at least 50% (w/w) of the particular isotope that the mercury sample is enriched in.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In a second aspect, the invention provides an apparatus typically suitable for carrying out the method of the invention for analysis, ideally quantification, of gaseous elemental mercury in a gaseous sample.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In one embodiment, the apparatus comprises:

The analytical cell must transmit 254 nm light and could be either open or closed path, but its optical configuration is flexible: it could be a single pass, multipass, or an optical cavity. In use, light emitted by the two light sources is transmitted through a gaseous sample contained within the analytical cell once or multiple times, and the intensity of the transmitted light is determined by the photodetector/s. The ratio of two measured intensities is then related to the differential absorption of mercury, and it is this differential absorption which forms the basis on which the mercury in the sample is quantified.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>, a further embodiment of the apparatus of the invention is described, indicated generally by the reference numeral 10, in which parts identical to those described with reference to the previous embodiment are assigned the same reference numerals. In this embodiment, the apparatus 10 comprises a single light source 11, in this case a low vapour pressure mercury lamp or an electrodeless discharge lamp with naturally (or possibly isotopically-enriched) mercury, an analytical cell 5 that in use contains the gaseous sample to be analysed, and an optical arrangement comprising a light splitter 12 adapted to split light transmitted through the analytic cell into two parts and a reflector 13. The apparatus additionally includes two atomic filters 15, 16, one of which contains an isotopically-enriched sample of mercury enriched in the <sup>202</sup>Hg (for example) mercury isotope, and the other of which contains a sample of mercury enriched in another mercury isotope/s, for example, the <sup>200</sup>Hg<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> mercury isotope. A pair of photodetectors 6, 7 adapted to determine the intensity of light transmitted through the atomic filters. In use, light emitted by the light source is transmitted through a gaseous sample contained within the analytical cell, and the transmitted light is split into two paths using the optical arrangement. An atomic filter is disposed along the first light path and the second atomic filter is disposed along the second light path. The intensity of the two filtered light signals are then determined using the photodetectors. The ratio of two measured intensities is then related to the differential absorption of mercury, and it is this differential absorption which forms the basis on which the mercury in the sample is quantified.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref>, a further embodiment of the apparatus of the invention is described, indicated generally by the reference numeral 20, in which parts identical to those described with reference to the previous embodiment are assigned the same reference numerals. In this embodiment, the apparatus is the same as that described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>, with the exception that the detectors measure fluorescence intensity of emitted light, as opposed to intensity of transmitted light, from the atomic filters.
