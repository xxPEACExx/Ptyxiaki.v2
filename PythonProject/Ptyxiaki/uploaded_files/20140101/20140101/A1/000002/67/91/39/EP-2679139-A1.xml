Endoscope apparatuses are configured such that an endoscope insertion portion is inserted into an observation target and an image in the observation target is picked up by an image pickup portion provided at a distal end of the insertion portion to display the image on the monitor, thereby enabling a user to view the picked-up image and perform examination and the like in the observation target. Endoscopes include various types, and some endoscopes include inside an endoscope insertion portion a resin tube for a treatment instrument insertion channel or the like.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2008229067A"><text>2008-229067</text></patcit>, a resin tube for a treatment instrument insertion channel has one end connected to a treatment instrument insertion port provided to an operation portion and the other end connected to a treatment instrument opening located at a distal end portion of an insertion portion, and a surgeon inserts a treatment instrument from the treatment instrument insertion port to allow the treatment instrument to pass through the resin tube and protrude from the treatment instrument opening, and thereby capable of performing treatment.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In such a case, a coil for preventing buckling and deforming of the resin tube is wound around the resin tube, and the resin tube is inserted through the insertion portion having flexibility. The length of the resin tube is different depending on a length of an insertion portion of each of various types of endoscopes. Therefore, resin tubes are produced by processing such that each of the resin tubes has a length<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> determined for each type of endoscopes.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, a resin tube around which a coil is wound has to be produced by processing the length of the resin tube with high accuracy depending on the type of an endoscope. Since the resin tube is made of a soft material, it is not easy to produce the resin tube by processing the length thereof with high accuracy so as to always have a desired length. Therefore, a resin tube around which a coil is wound is produced by processing the length thereof while adjusting it individually, which causes a problem of high production cost of such a resin tube.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In addition, if the coil end of the coil wound around the resin tube is located in a bending range in the flexible tube, a bending force is continuously applied to the position at which the rigidity of the resin tube changes, which causes a possibility that the resin tube buckles at the position of the coil end. Therefore, there is also a complication that the resin tube has to be produced by performing processing such that also the position of the coil end is located in a desired position or within a desired range with high accuracy.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a resin tube which is configured to be inserted into a flexible tube or the like of an endoscope and which is able to be easily produced by being processed into a desired length, and configured to allow a coil end of a coil wound around the resin tube to be located at a desired position or within a desired range, thereby enabling various channel tubes corresponding respectively to a plurality of types of endoscopes to be easily produced without increasing the number of components.</p><heading id="h0003">Disclosure of Invention</heading><heading id="h0004">Means for Solving the Problem</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">A resin tube according to one aspect of the present invention is configured to be inserted in a flexible tube of an endoscope or a connection cable, and the resin tube includes: a first tube including, on a part of an outer surface thereof, a helical-shaped first groove;
