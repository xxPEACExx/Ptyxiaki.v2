With a biological sample measuring device, biological sample information such as blood glucose level is measured by applying a specific voltage to the electrodes of the biological sample measuring sensor and measuring the output value from the output electrode.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For example, Patent Literature 1 discloses an electrochemical sensor that tells the user to redo a test if there is not enough of a liquid sample containing the substance being analyzed.</p><heading id="h0003">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT LITERATURE</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><p id="p0005" num="0005"><ul><li>Patent Literature 1: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2003004691A"><text>2003-4691 (laid open on January 8, 2003</text></patcit>)</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, the following problems are encountered with the conventional sensor discussed above.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Specifically, with the sensor disclosed in the above-mentioned publication, a sub-element of a detecting electrode is provided farther up along the flow path of the biological sample than a working electrode, and when electrochemical continuity occurs between the working electrode and the sub-element and the current value exceeds an arbitrary threshold, it is determined that sufficient current is flowing to establish an effective test to measure the concentration of the biological sample, and measurement is commenced.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">With this conventional sensor, however, the deposition observation time up to the point when the current value exceeds the arbitrary threshold is short (such as 1 to 5 seconds), and if the current value does not exceed the threshold during this brief deposition observation, it is concluded right away that an error has occurred. If this happens, that sensor has to be discarded, the patient's skin punctured again to collect a blood sample, and a new sensor used to measure again.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Meanwhile, there has been an increasing demand from users for a sensor that allows additional deposition to be performed even when the deposition observation time is extended and there is insufficient blood. However, if the deposition observation time is extended significantly beyond what it used to be (such as when it is extended from between 1 and 5 seconds to between 10 and 120 seconds), a biological sample that has seeped along the end<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> inside the capillary (pass-around) will eventually reach the detecting electrode, causing the current value to exceed the threshold. When this happens, even though the capillary does not contain enough biological sample to perform accurate measurement, there is the risk that the system will mistakenly determine that a sufficient amount of biological sample is contained.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Also, when measurement is performed using blood as the biological sample, the plasma component of the blood may reach the electrode that detects the flow of blood while seeping into the reagent (seepage), even though there is an insufficient amount of blood for accurate measurement. Here again, the current value ends up exceeding a specific threshold, and there is the risk that the system will mistakenly determine that enough blood is contained.</p><heading id="h0006">TECHNICAL PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is an object of the present invention to provide a biological sample measuring device with which the degree to which a biological sample is introduced into the capillary of a sensor can be accurately detected, without being affected by pass-around or seepage.</p><heading id="h0007">SOLUTION TO PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The biological sample measuring device pertaining to the first invention is one in which a deposited biological sample is introduced into a capillary by capillary action, a biological sample measuring sensor in which a reagent and the biological sample provided inside the capillary are reacted is mounted, and the biological sample is measured, said biological sample measuring device comprising a mounting portion, a voltage application section, and a controller. The biological sample measuring sensor is mounted to the mounting portion. The voltage application section applies voltage used for measurement to a plurality of electrodes disposed along the capillary in the biological sample measuring sensor.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> The controller eliminates the effect of seepage of the biological sample by seepage or pass-around at the end of the capillary, and detects the degree to which the biological sample is introduced into the capillary, on the basis of the output result measured by applying voltage from the voltage application section to the electrodes.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Here, with a biological sample measuring device in which a biological sample deposited on a biological sample measuring sensor is introduced into a capillary by capillary action, a biological sample measuring sensor in which the biological sample is reacted with a reagent provided inside the capillary, and in that state the biological sample is measured by applying voltage to the electrodes of the biological sample measuring sensor, how far into the capillary the biological sample has been introduced (the degree of introduction) is detected by eliminating the effect of infiltration of the biological sample by pass-around at the end of the capillary, and the effect of infiltration of the plasma component into the reagent by seepage, on the basis of the output result for voltage applied to a plurality of electrodes provided along the capillary.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The term "pass-around" here refers to a phenomenon whereby a biological sample infiltrates deep into the capillary along both ends in the width direction inside the tiny introduction space (capillary) provided for introducing the biological sample into the biological sample measuring sensor. The term "seepage" refers to a phenomenon whereby the plasma component of blood reaches a detecting electrode while seeping into the reagent when blood is being used as the biological sample.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">When this pass-around occurs, even if not enough biological sample is deposited onto the sensor so that the biological sample is not actually introduced onto the detecting electrode,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> for example, there is the risk if misdetection if the capillary is filled by biological sample as a result of biological sample coming in at the ends of the capillary.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Also, when seepage occurs, even if not enough blood is deposited onto the sensor so that the blood is not actually introduced onto the detecting electrode, for example, there is the risk if misdetection if the capillary is filled by blood as a result of the plasma component in the blood seeping into the reagent while reaching the detecting electrode.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">With the biological sample measuring device of the present invention, to eliminate misdetection and the introduction of biological sample due to this pass-around or seepage, the output result upon normal filling and the output result when pass-around or seepage occurs are determined on the basis of the output result when voltage was applied to a plurality of electrodes disposed along the capillary, which allows accurate detection of how far the biological sample has been introduced into the capillary.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The method for determining the output result upon normal filling and the output result when pass-around or seepage occurs can be as follows.

electrode 8a (second electrode), an electrode 8b (third electrode), and an electrode 8c (first electrode).</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">A reagent 10 that reacts with blood or another such biological

5 and the cover 7, and has a groove 11 at the end on the side where the biological sample is deposited. The substrate 5, the spacer 6, and the cover 7 are integrated so that the groove 11 portion functions as a capillary, which is a path for introducing the biological sample.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Capillary action causes the blood or other biological sample that is deposited on the biological sample measuring sensor 3 to advance deeper into the groove 11 functioning as a capillary. Once the biological sample reaches the reagent 10 portion, a reaction occurs between the reagent 10 and a specific component included in the biological sample (such as the glucose in blood). With the biological sample measuring device in this embodiment, information related to the biological sample, such as the blood glucose level, is measured on the basis of this reaction value.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 2a to 2c</figref>, the substrate 5 is longer than the spacer 6 and the cover 7 in the lengthwise direction. Consequently, the ends of the electrodes 8a to 8c provided to the substrate 5 that are on the opposite side from the side where the biological sample is deposited are exposed outside the sensor. Accordingly, the biological sample measuring<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> sensor 3 can be electrically connected with the electrical circuit inside the main body case 1 merely by mounting the mounting portion 4 to the mounting portion 4 of the main body case 1.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The cover 7 has an air hole 7a that promotes capillary action within the capillary, at a location corresponding to the inner end of the groove 11 of the spacer 6.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2b</figref>, the air hole 7a is disposed further to the inside (the right side in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>) than the location where the reagent 10 is placed on the biological sample measuring sensor 3. Consequently, the blood or other biological sample deposited on the distal end side (the left side in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>) of the capillary can be introduced smoothly up to the location of the reagent 10 by capillary action.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In a state in which the biological sample measuring sensor 3 has been mounted, the electrodes 8a to 8c are connected to a voltage application section 12 and a current/voltage converter 13 provided on the biological sample measuring device side (see <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>).</p><heading id="h0014">Configuration of Biological Sample Measuring Device</heading><p id="p0057" num="0057">As shown in the control block diagram of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the biological sample measuring device in this embodiment comprises, inside the main body case 1, the mounting portion 4 to which the above-mentioned biological sample measuring sensor 3 is mounted, the voltage application section 12, a reference voltage section 12a, the current/voltage converter 13, an A/D (analog/digital) converter 18, a controller 20, a memory 23, and the display section 2.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The display section 2 displays biological sample measurement values (such as the blood glucose level), messages recommending an additional deposit (discussed below), measurement error, and various other such information.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The voltage application section 12 is connected to the mounting portion 4 to which the biological sample measuring sensor 3 is mounted, and applies a specific voltage to the electrodes of the biological sample measuring sensor 3.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The reference voltage section 12a applies a reference voltage to the terminal serving as the counter electrode of the biological sample measuring sensor 3.

The set value for the threshold used in executing this auto-start function preferably varies with the ambient temperature during measurement. For example, if the ambient temperature is below Temp1 (such as 15°C), the reaction between the biological sample and the reagent will be slow, so the threshold of the output value of the voltage applied between the A and E electrodes (preferably a voltage of 5 to 30 mV, such as 7 mV), and the threshold of the output value of the voltage applied between the A and C electrodes (preferably a voltage of 5 to 30 mV, such as 10 mV) are used.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">In this embodiment, auto-start control is executed according to the flowchart in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>.
