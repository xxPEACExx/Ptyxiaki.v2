Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">A demand for an auto location (vehicle tire location) function for automatically discriminating locations of tires in a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) has been increased. The reason is that when a tire pressure is out of a normal level, it may inform a driver of which tire is out of a normal pressure.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In connection with this, many methods for mounting an auto location function in a TPMS are derived and a part thereof is applied to a real TPMS.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, all the methods known up to now have disadvantages. For example, the methods have problems in that when performance is improved, installation costs are increased, when installation costs are reduced, accuracy of tire location recognition in an auto location function is degraded, and the like.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As more detailed example, there is a method of discriminating locations of tires by mounting low frequency (LF) transmitters around each tire wheel to analyze signals transmitted to a selectively specified tire pressure monitoring apparatus from the LF transmitters and RF signals transmitted from the TPMS sensor module in response to the analyzed signals.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The method can very accurately detect the locations of the tires but is troublesome in that signal lines are connected near each wheel while the LF transmitters need to be mounted. That is, the mounting cost of the system is increased.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Another method as described in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6725712B"><text>US Patent 6725712</text></patcit> discriminates locations of tires using strength of a radio frequency (RF) signal transmitted an electronic control unit (ECU) from a general TPMS sensor module for discriminating a front and a rear of a tire. For example, if the ECU is mounted on a front bump of a vehicle, the tire is discriminated as a front tire when the strength of RF signal transmitted to the ECU is large and the tire is discriminated as a rear tire when the strength of the RF signal is small.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A problem of the method for discriminating the front/rear tires using the strength of the RF signal has a limitation in the mounting place of the ECU.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Describing in more detail, a vehicle is generally formed of metal materials and the RF signals are distorted by the metal materials of a vehicle. Here, when the ECU is mounted at places other than the front/rear bumps, there is a problem in that the method for discriminating the front/rear tires with the strength of the RF signal due to the distortion in the RF signal by a car body has reduced accuracy.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">That is, when the mounting place of the ECU is limited to the front/rear bumps of a vehicle, a length of wirings may be more increased as compared with the case in which the ECU is mounted at other places and waterproofing, an impact resistant design, and the like, may be required. This may lead to the increase in the mounting costs of the system.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Further, since the front/rear bumps may be more frequently impacted as compared with other portions of a car body, the defects of the ECU may frequently occur.</p><heading id="h0005">[Prior Art Document]</heading><heading id="h0006">[Patent Document]</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">(Patent Document 1) <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6725712B"><text>US Patent No. 6725712</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0007">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention has been made in an effort to provide a tire location distinction device and a tire location distinction method using the same capable of discriminating locations of tires and improving reliability of location distinction.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a tire location discrimination device, including: a plurality of pressure gauges each measuring internal pressure of a plurality of tires;
