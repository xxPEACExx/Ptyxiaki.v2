However, as the bypass circuit 31 can be detached from the circulation circuit of the first refrigerant by closing the second air conditioning control valve 33 when the bypass circuit 31 is not used, it is desirable that the second air conditioning control valve 33 is provided.</p><heading id="h0029">List of Reference Signs</heading><p id="p0117" num="0117"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>S</dt><dd>Air-conditioning and hot-water supply system</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>Heat pump unit</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>Indoor unit<!-- EPO <DP n="62"> --></dd><dt>3</dt><dd>Hot water tank unit</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>Controller</dd><dt>10</dt><dd>Refrigerant circuit for air conditioning</dd><dt>11</dt><dd>Compressor for air conditioning</dd><dt>12</dt><dd>Four-way valve for air conditioning (Operation switching means for air conditioning)</dd><dt>13</dt><dd>Heat exchanger on heat source side for air conditioning</dd><dt>13a</dt><dd>Fan for air conditioning</dd><dt>14</dt><dd>Main expansion valve for air conditioning (Decompression device, First decompression device)</dd><dt>15</dt><dd>Heat exchanger on heat utilization side for air conditioning</dd><dt>15a</dt><dd>Heat exchanger tube on primary side of heat exchanger on heat utilization side for air conditioning</dd><dt>15b</dt><dd>Heat exchanger tube on secondary side of heat exchanger on heat utilization side for air conditioning</dd><dt>16</dt><dd>Auxiliary expansion valve for air conditioning (Decompression device, Second decompression device)</dd><dt>21</dt><dd>Intermediate heat exchanger</dd><dt>21a</dt><dd>Heat exchanger tube on primary side of intermediate heat exchanger</dd><dt>21b</dt><dd>Heat exchanger tube on secondary side of intermediate heat exchanger</dd><dt>22</dt><dd>First air conditioning control three-way valve (First branched part)</dd><dt>23</dt><dd>First air conditioning control valve</dd><dt>24</dt><dd>Junction</dd><dt>31</dt><dd>Bypass circuit</dd><dt>32</dt><dd>Second air conditioning control three-way valve (Second branched part)<!-- EPO <DP n="63"> --></dd><dt>33</dt><dd>Second air conditioning control valve</dd><dt>40</dt><dd>Refrigerant circuit for hot-water supply</dd><dt>41</dt><dd>Compressor for hot-water supply</dd><dt>42</dt><dd>Heat exchanger on heat utilization side for hot-water supply</dd><dt>42a</dt><dd>Heat exchanger tube on primary side of heat exchanger on heat utilization side for hot-water supply</dd><dt>42b</dt><dd>Heat exchanger tube on secondary side of heat exchanger on heat utilization side for hot-water supply</dd><dt>43</dt><dd>Main expansion valve for hot-water supply (Third decompression device)</dd><dt>44</dt><dd>Heat exchanger on heat source side for hot-water supply</dd><dt>44a</dt><dd>Fan for hot-water supply</dd><dt>45</dt><dd>First hot-water supply control three-way valve</dd><dt>46</dt><dd>Second hot-water supply control three-way valve</dd><dt>50</dt><dd>Heat transfer medium circulation circuit for air conditioning</dd><dt>51</dt><dd>First pump</dd><dt>52</dt><dd>Heat transfer medium four-way valve</dd><dt>53</dt><dd>Indoor heat exchanger</dd><dt>53a</dt><dd>Indoor fan</dd><dt>60</dt><dd>Hot-water supply circuit</dd><dt>61</dt><dd>Second pump</dd><dt>62</dt><dd>Tank</dd><dt>63</dt><dd>Water supply fitting</dd><dt>64</dt><dd>Hot-water supply fitting</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56976654" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="64"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An air-conditioning and hot-water supply system provided with a refrigerant circuit for air conditioning in which a first refrigerant is circulated and a refrigerant circuit for hot-water supply in which a second refrigerant is circulated, wherein:
