Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">This specification relates to a refrigerator having an air pressure adjusting apparatus for a refrigerator storage container.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Background of the Invention</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In general, a refrigerator is equipment for keeping foods and the like in a cold state for an extended time by generating cold air in response to driving a refrigerating cycle installed inside the refrigerator and supplying the generated cold air into a refrigerating chamber and a freezing chamber.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The refrigerator is typically provided with a storage container for keeping and storing vegetables. Also, when vegetables are generally stored in the refrigerator, they should be kept in the freshest state. Therefore, it may be important to maintain the space for keeping vegetables in an optimal condition.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a storage container for a refrigerator according to the related art. A storage container 10 for a refrigerator according to the related art may include a box receiving unit 11 and a box 13.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The storage container for the refrigerator, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, is a drawer-type storage container 10, which has a two-box form having the box receiving unit 11 and the box 13. Or, although not shown, the storage container 10 for the refrigerator may be implemented as a singe-box form (1-box form) that a cover on a box closes the box.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For the two-box type storage container as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, when the box 13 is closed by being inserted into the box receiving unit 11, an inside of the storage container 10 is sealed and maintained almost in a vacuum state, resulting in improvement of freshness of vegetables stored.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">This related art two-box type storage container is sealed in the form of the drawer to keep foods fresh for an extended time. Here, a vacuum pump is mounted in the sealed storage container and the storage container is set to be under predetermined pressure by the vacuum pump, such that the inside of the storage container can be uniformly maintained in a state close to vacuum (approximately 0.8 atm for example). Accordingly, foods and the like may be kept fresh in the storage container for the extended time.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, the related art storage container for vacuum storage has a difficulty in uniformly maintaining an internal vacuum degree (a degree close to vacuum) and sometimes causes an excessive vacuum degree. These may greatly affect the freshness of vegetables and the like stored in the storage container.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In addition, when the vacuum pump is controlled to maintain a predetermined vacuum degree in the storage container, the vacuum pump may be continuously operating due to several reasons such as system breakdown, a system error and the like. This may cause the internal air pressure of the storage container to be kept lowered. Accordingly, the internal air pressure of the storage container may be in an excessively lowered state.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">Therefore, to overcome the drawbacks of the related art, an aspect of the detailed description is to provide a refrigerator having an air pressure adjusting<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> apparatus for a refrigerator storage container, capable of uniformly maintaining internal air pressure of the storage container by opening a path for allowing external air to be introduced into the storage container when the internal air pressure of the storage container is excessively lowered below a predetermined air pressure.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Another aspect of the detailed description is to provide a refrigerator having an air pressure adjusting apparatus for a refrigerator storage container, capable of maintaining an appropriate vacuum degree by raising air pressure using external atmospheric pressure so as to prevent internal air pressure of the storage container from being drastically lowered.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Another aspect of the detailed description is to provide a refrigerator having an air pressure adjusting apparatus for a refrigerator storage container, capable of preventing an abnormal decrease of internal air pressure of the storage container by mounting the air pressure adjusting apparatus onto an outer wall of the storage container to be exposed to external air, and preventing in advance the risk of breakage of the storage container even when internal air pressure is continuously lowered due to breakdown of a vacuum pump, an error and the like.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of this specification, as embodied and broadly described herein, there is provided a refrigerator including a storage container having an inner accommodating space and installed to be drawn out of and inserted into the refrigerator, and an air pressure adjusting apparatus to allow external air to be introduced into the storage container based on internal air pressure of the storage container, so as to increase the internal air pressure.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The air pressure adjusting apparatus may selectively allow the external air to be introduced into the storage container based on a difference between the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> internal air pressure of the storage container and external air pressure.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The refrigerator may further include a vacuum pump to suck internal air of the storage container. Here, the air pressure adjusting apparatus may allow the external air to be introduced into the storage container when the internal air pressure of the storage container is lowered below a predetermined air pressure by the vacuum pump.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The air pressure adjusting apparatus may further include a casing having a through hole formed through the casing to allow for an introduction of external air therethrough, and a movable member installed in the casing to be movable up and down so as to selectively close and open the through hole based on a difference between the internal air pressure of the storage container and the external atmospheric pressure.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Here, the casing may be formed in a shape of a hollow tube, and have an upper portion with the through hole formed therethrough, and a lower portion open and inserted into the storage container.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The movable member may be formed of rubber.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, the air pressure adjusting apparatus may further include a supporting member fixedly installed within the casing with being spaced apart from the movable member, and an elastic member fixedly installed between the movable member and the supporting member.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Here, the casing may include a cylindrical part formed in a shape of a hollow circular pipe, and the cylindrical part may include, on an inner circumferential surface thereof, a first contact portion onto which the movable member is adhered, and a second contact portion onto which the supporting member is adhered.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The movable member may include an opening/closing portion to open and close the through hole, a deformable portion connected to the opening/closing portion and allowing for up and down movements of the opening/closing portion, and an elastic member fixing portion to fix the elastic member.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Here, the deformable portion may include a plurality of air holes formed through the deformable portion in a thickness direction of the deformable portion. Also, the deformable portion may be formed as a circular rubber member adhered onto an inner circumferential surface of the cylindrical casing, and be concavely deformed and restored in the thickness direction thereof in response to the down and up movements of the opening/closing portion formed on a central portion of the casing, with an outer circumference of the deformable portion being fixedly adhered onto the casing.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The elastic member may be implemented as a spring.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The supporting member may include an elastic member fixing portion to fix the elastic member, and a plurality of air holes formed through the supporting member in a thickness direction of the supporting member.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, the supporting member may include an elastic member fixing portion formed on an upper surface of the supporting member to fix the elastic member, a plurality of air holes formed through the supporting member in a thickness direction of the supporting member, a frame fixedly adhered onto a second contact portion of the casing, and a plurality of supporting legs extending from the frame toward a central portion of the supporting member. Accordingly, the supporting member may fixedly support the elastic member fixing portion on an inner circumferential surface of the casing.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The storage container may include a box having a front part and a main<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> body, and forming an inner accommodating space, the box being drawn out and inserted, and a box receiving unit to receive the box therein in an airtight state.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As described above, the present disclosure may acquire the following effects by the aforementioned technical solutions and configurations, coupling relationships and operation relationships to be explained later.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The present disclosure may allow internal air pressure of a storage container to be uniformly maintained by opening an path for an introduction of external air into the storage container even when the internal air pressure is lowered below a predetermined air pressure.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The present disclosure may prevent damage of the storage container due to a continuously decrease of the internal air pressure of the storage container, which may be caused by breakdown of a system, a breakdown of a vacuum pump, an error and the like.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Also, the present disclosure may prevent the internal air pressure of the storage container from being lowered below a predetermined air pressure by adjusting an elastic coefficient of an elastic member of the air pressure adjusting apparatus, namely, a spring constant of a spring.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Further scope of applicability of the present application will become more apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter.
