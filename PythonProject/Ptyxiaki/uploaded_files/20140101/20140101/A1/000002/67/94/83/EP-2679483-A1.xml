In the marine steam turbines, the high-pressure turbine and the low-pressure turbine are arranged side by side in a beam direction. Rotational output powers respectively obtained from the turbines are combined by a speed reducer to rotate one propeller.<br/>
Two output shafts for rotating the propeller may be required due to an increase in the size of marine vessels. In this case, if the steam turbine disclosed in PTL 1 is<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> employed, the high-pressure turbine and the low-pressure turbine need to be provided for each of the output shafts. However, it is difficult to install the high-pressure turbine and the low-pressure turbine for each of the output shafts due to restrictions in installation space (especially in the beam direction) within an engine room.<br/>
Thus, when two output shafts are required in marine vessels, a low-speed diesel main engine direct connection system or an electric motor propulsion system is mostly employed.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">To solve the problem of the installation space for the steam turbine, a steam turbine as disclosed in PTL 2 described below has been proposed. In the steam turbine, a high-pressure turbine and a low-pressure turbine are arranged side by side in a beam direction. One of output shafts is driven by the high-pressure turbine, and the other of the output shafts is driven by the low-pressure turbine, thereby avoiding an increase in the installation space.<br/>
However, since a single superheated-steam flow method in which the low-pressure turbine is driven by superheated steam discharged from the high-pressure turbine is employed, the output power of the high-pressure turbine and the output power of the low-pressure turbine inevitably become uneven. To solve the problem, the unevenness in the output power is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> eliminated by providing a shaft generator or an electric motor at each of the output shafts and electrically connecting the shaft generators or the electric motors in the steam turbine disclosed in PTL 2.</p><heading id="h0003">{Citation List}</heading><heading id="h0004">{Patent Literature}</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004"><ul><li>{PTL 1}<br/>

That is, a steam turbine driver according to a first aspect of the present invention includes: a high pressure-side turbine that is driven upon supply of steam; a first drive shaft that is driven by the high pressure-side turbine; a low pressure-side turbine that is driven upon supply of steam discharged from the high pressure-side turbine; and a second drive shaft that is driven by the low pressure-side turbine, the steam turbine driver further including a pressure control means that controls a pressure of the steam discharged from the high pressure-side turbine and supplied to the low pressure-side turbine.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A configuration in which two shafts using a single steam flow are provided is enabled by employing the first drive shaft driven by the high pressure-side turbine, and the second<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> drive shaft driven by the low pressure-side turbine that is driven by supply of the steam discharged from the high pressure-side turbine in the steam turbine driver. Accordingly, the configuration with two shafts can be achieved without causing an increase in installation space.<br/>
The pressure control means is provided so as to control the pressure of the steam discharged from the high pressure-side turbine and supplied to the low pressure-side turbine. The pressure of the steam flowing into the low pressure-side turbine can be thereby set without being affected by operating conditions of the high pressure-side turbine. Consequently, the output power of the high pressure-side turbine, and the output power of the low pressure-side turbine can be independently controlled. The independent control of the two shafts can be achieved with a simple configuration in which the pressure control means is added as described above.<br/>
Examples of the high pressure-side turbine include a configuration in which a single high-pressure turbine driven by high-pressure superheated steam guided from a boiler is provided, and a configuration in which a medium-pressure turbine driven by superheated steam obtained by reheating exhaust steam from the high-pressure turbine by the boiler is provided in addition to the high-pressure turbine.<br/>
For example, the output powers of the respective drive shafts of the steam turbine driver may be used for driving a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> propeller of a marine vessel, may be used as a power source of a compressor for liquefying gas, or may be used for driving a power generator.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the steam turbine driver according to the first aspect, the pressure control means may include: a steam dump path that branches a portion of the steam discharged from the high pressure-side turbine and guides the portion to a condenser; a pressure reducing valve that reduces the pressure of the steam flowing through the steam dump path; and a control section that controls the pressure reducing valve such that the steam flowing into the low pressure-side turbine has a predetermined pressure.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The pressure of the steam guided to the low pressure-side turbine is reduced by guiding a portion of the steam discharged from the high pressure-side turbine to the condenser through the steam dump path. At this point, the pressure reducing valve that reduces the pressure of the steam flowing through the steam dump path is controlled by the control section such that the steam flowing into the low pressure-side turbine has a predetermined pressure value. Accordingly, the steam pressure at an inlet of the low pressure-side turbine can be independently controlled irrespective of the exhaust pressure of the high pressure-side<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> turbine.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Moreover, in the steam turbine driver according to the first aspect, steam guided from a separate system from an exhaust system of the high pressure-side turbine may be supplied to the low pressure-side turbine.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The output power of the low pressure-side turbine is increased by supplying superheated steam from the separate system to the low pressure-side turbine. The output power can be thereby adjusted independently from the high pressure-side turbine. Accordingly, the low pressure-side turbine can be stably controlled.<br/>
Examples of the steam guided from the separate system include utility steam guided from a boiler desuperheated steam line. In this case, the separate system can be made independent from a main turbine system, so that more stable operation can be expected.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Moreover, in the above configuration, the low pressure-side turbine may be composed of two low-pressure turbines of a first low-pressure turbine and a second low-pressure turbine provided in parallel with respect to the superheated steam supplied from the high pressure-side turbine, the steam from the separate system being supplied only to the first low-pressure<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> turbine.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The low pressure-side turbine is divided into the two low-pressure turbines, and the steam from the separate system is supplied only to the first low-pressure turbine. Accordingly, the controllability of the low pressure-side turbine is improved.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Moreover, in the above configuration, a check valve that prevents the steam from flowing reversely from the first low-pressure turbine toward the high pressure-side turbine may be provided in a steam supply path that connects an inlet side of the first low-pressure turbine and an exhaust side of the high pressure-side turbine.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Since the steam is supplied to the first low-pressure turbine from the separate system, the pressure of the steam supplied from the separate system may become higher than the pressure of the superheated steam discharged from the high pressure-side turbine depending on pressure conditions of the superheated steam (that is, depending on a set pressure value of the pressure control means), thereby possibly causing the steam to flow reversely from the first low-pressure turbine toward the high pressure-side turbine. Thus, the check valve is provided so as to prevent the reverse flow, so that stable<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> operation is achieved.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Also, a marine vessel according to a second aspect of the present invention includes: the steam turbine driver described in any of the above configurations; a first propeller that is rotationally driven by the first drive shaft; and a second propeller that is rotationally driven by the second drive shaft.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Since a twin-screw marine vessel including two propellers can be achieved by using the steam turbine driver capable of independently driving the two shafts by use of the aforementioned steam turbine driver, a marine vessel having excellent installability and cost advantages can be provided.<br/>

An ahead medium-pressure turbine 40 mounted onto the same first drive shaft 4 as that of the ahead high-pressure turbine 7 is provided in the starboard engine 3 of a steam turbine driver 1B in the present embodiment. The ahead high-pressure turbine 7 and the ahead medium-pressure turbine 40 constitute the high pressure-side turbine. The ahead medium-pressure<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> turbine 40 is driven by superheated steam obtained by reheating the exhaust steam from the ahead high-pressure turbine 7 by a reheater 42. To be more specific, a bypass pipe 44 is branched from the exhaust steam pipe 27 on the exhaust side of the high-pressure turbine 7. The exhaust steam is partially guided to the reheater 42 through the bypass pipe 44 and reheated therein. The reheated steam is guided to the ahead medium-pressure turbine 40 through a reheated steam supply pipe 46. The flow rate of the steam bypassed to the reheater 42 is determined by adjusting the opening degree of a bypass valve 49 that is provided in the exhaust steam pipe 27 of the ahead high-pressure turbine 7. The opening degree of the bypass valve 49 is controlled based on a predetermined function given to a first control section 52. For example, as shown by a pattern indicated by reference numeral 52, when an ahead rotational speed (RPM (AHEAD)) is low, the opening degree of the bypass valve 49 is increased to reduce the flow rate of the steam bypassed to the reheater 42. When the ahead rotational speed is high, the opening degree of the bypass valve 49 is decreased to increase the flow rate of the steam bypassed to the reheater 42. The reheater 42 is generally configured as a portion of the unillustrated marine boiler.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The first control section 52 also controls the main steam<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> valve 10. For example, the main steam valve 10 is controlled such that the opening degree is increased along with an increase in the ahead rotational speed (RPM (AHEAD)), that is, a throttle is applied as shown by a pattern indicated by reference numeral 22.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The superheated steam discharged from the ahead medium-pressure turbine 40 passes through an exhaust steam pipe 48, and joins the exhaust steam guided from the ahead high-pressure turbine 7 at a junction 50. The steam is branched into the steam dump pipe 33 from a junction exhaust steam pipe 54 provided after the junction, and, similarly to the first embodiment, further branched into the first supply pipe 29 and the second supply pipe 31 connected in parallel with each other.<br/>
A pressure sensor 56 that measures the pressure of the steam reduced by the pressure reducing valve 35 provided in the steam dump pipe 33 is provided in the junction exhaust steam pipe 54. The pressure sensor 56 also partially constitutes the pressure control means of the present invention. A measurement pressure value PV measured by the pressure sensor 56 is fed to a second control section 58. The second control section 58 compares a set pressure value SV given from outside and the measurement pressure value PV, and outputs an instruction value OP obtained by, for example, PID<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> control to the pressure reducing valve 35 so as to obtain the set pressure value SV. The opening degree of the pressure reducing valve 35 is controlled based on the instruction value OP.<br/>

The check valve 62 prevents the steam from flowing reversely from the ahead first low-pressure turbine 11 toward the high pressure-side turbine (the ahead high-pressure turbine 7 and the ahead medium-pressure turbine 40).<br/>

The opening degree of the low-pressure drive steam valve 38 is controlled by a third control section 68. To be more specific, the low-pressure drive steam valve 38 is controlled such that the opening degree is increased along with an increase in the ahead rotational speed (RPM (AHEAD)). Accordingly, a deficiency in the output power of the low pressure-side turbine (the ahead first low-pressure turbine 11 and the ahead second low-pressure turbine 13) is compensated for independently from the main steam. While the opening degree of the low-pressure drive steam valve 38 is controlled as described above in the ahead motion, the low-pressure drive steam valve 38 is fully closed in the astern motion.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Moreover, in the present embodiment, a high-pressure astern turbine 70 on the starboard side, and a low-pressure astern turbine 72 driven by exhaust steam from the high-pressure astern turbine 70 are employed instead of the astern turbines 9 and 15 both driven by the main steam in the first embodiment.<br/>

The superheated steam discharged from the high-pressure astern turbine 70 passes through an astern exhaust steam pipe 78, and is then branched into a steam dump pipe 80. A pressure reducing valve 82 is provided in the steam dump pipe 80.<br/>
A pressure sensor 84 that measures the pressure of the steam reduced by the pressure reducing valve 82 is provided in the astern exhaust steam pipe 78. A measurement pressure value PV measured by the pressure sensor 84 is fed to a fifth control section 86. The fifth control section 86 compares a set pressure value SV given from outside and the measurement pressure value PV, and outputs an instruction value OP obtained by, for example, PID control to the pressure reducing valve 82 so as to obtain the set pressure value SV.

In the first embodiment and the second embodiment, it is premised that the steam turbine drivers 1A and 1B are applied to the twin-screw marine vessel.<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> In the present embodiment, a gas liquefaction apparatus 100 will be described as another application of the steam turbine driver.<br/>
The gas liquefaction apparatus 100 cools and liquefies natural gas (NG) as a raw material of liquefied gas such as LNG (liquefied natural gas). The gas liquefaction apparatus 100 uses the aforementioned steam turbine drivers 1A and 1B as a drive source of a compressor that constitutes a refrigeration cycle. Although the steam turbine drivers 1A and 1B are schematically shown in the drawing, a high pressure-side turbine 102, a low pressure-side turbine 103, a pressure control means (not shown), an assist drive (not shown) using low-pressure drive steam, a first drive shaft 105, and a second drive shaft 107 have the same configurations as those of the first embodiment and the second embodiment.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The gas liquefaction apparatus 100 includes a first compressor 109 that is rotationally driven by the first drive shaft 105, and a second compressor 111 that is rotationally driven by the second drive shaft 107. Each of the compressors 109 and 111 includes a coaxial two-stage compression section rotationally driven by each of the drive shafts 105 and 107. A compressed refrigerant (e.g., nitrogen) is guided to the unillustrated refrigeration cycle.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054"><!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> In the unillustrated refrigeration cycle, a first cold energy output section that obtains cold energy by expanding the refrigerant compressed by the first compressor 109, and a second cold energy output section that obtains cold energy by expanding the refrigerant compressed by the second compressor 111 are provided (a so-called double expansion cycle). The first cold energy output section and the second cold energy output section cool and liquefy natural gas as a raw material of LNG.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">By applying the steam turbine drivers 1A and 1B capable of independently controlling the two shafts so as to achieve a refrigeration cycle having two expansion sections as in the present embodiment, a gas liquefaction apparatus having excellent installability and cost advantages can be provided. Also, since the respective drive shafts can be independently controlled, one of the compressors can be used as a high-pressure compressor, and another of the compressors can be used as a low-pressure compressor. Accordingly, highly efficient liquefaction can be achieved.</p><heading id="h0014">{Fourth Embodiment}</heading><p id="p0056" num="0056">Next, a fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described based on <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>. In the first embodiment and the second embodiment, it is premised that the steam turbine<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> drivers 1A and 1B are applied to the twin-screw marine vessel. In the present embodiment, an example in which the steam turbine driver used as a marine vessel propulsion unit is converted into a power-generating driver is described as another application of the steam turbine driver.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In an existing single-screw steam turbine marine vessel, an output mechanism section 201 composed of a speed reducer, a propeller shaft or the like is provided at an output destination of a steam turbine driver, that is, on the output sides of respective drive shafts 205 and 207. When the steam turbine marine vessel is changed into a floating body such as an FSRU (floating storage and regasification unit) that requires no propeller, the output mechanism section 201 becomes unnecessary.<br/>
Thus, in the present embodiment, the output mechanism section 201 is removed, and the steam turbine driver is converted into the steam turbine drivers 1A and 1B similar to the first embodiment and the second embodiment. To be more specific, a pressure control means such as the steam dump pipe 33 and the pressure reducing valve 35, and an assist-drive system such as the low-pressure drive steam pipe 37 and the low-pressure drive steam valve 38 for guiding low-pressure drive steam such as utility steam are added between an existing high pressure-side turbine 202 and an existing low<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> pressure-side turbine 203. The first drive shaft 205 and the second drive shaft 207 are also respectively connected with a first power generator 209 and a second power generator 211 driven by the rotation thereof.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Even when the existing single-screw steam turbine marine vessel is changed into the floating body such as the FSRU as in the present embodiment, the existing propulsion unit can be converted so as to drive the power generator. Also, since the respective drive shafts 205 and 207 can be independently controlled, the steam turbine drivers 1A and 1B can freely adjust the electric power generations of the respective power generators 209 and 211, and can thereby flexibly respond to a demand for electric power.</p><heading id="h0015">{Reference Signs List}</heading><p id="p0059" num="0059"><ul><li>1A, 1B Steam turbine driver</li><li>4 First drive shaft</li><li>7 Ahead high-pressure turbine (high pressure-side turbine)</li><li>11 Ahead first low-pressure turbine (low pressure-side turbine)</li><li>13 Ahead second low-pressure turbine (low pressure-side turbine)</li><li>14 Second drive shaft</li><li>33, 80 Steam dump pipe (pressure control means)<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --></li><li>35, 82 Pressure reducing valve (pressure control means)</li><li>37 Low-pressure drive steam pipe</li><li>56, 84 Pressure sensor (pressure control means)</li><li>58 Second control section (pressure control means)</li><li>62 Check valve</li><li>86 Fifth control section (pressure control means)</li></ul></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977094" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A steam turbine driver comprising:
