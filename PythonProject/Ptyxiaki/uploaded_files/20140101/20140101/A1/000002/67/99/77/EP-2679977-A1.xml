A multi-core optical fiber is configured, for example, by a plurality of cores being arranged two-dimensionally in a cross section orthogonal to a longitudinal direction thereof, and it is known that crosstalk is generated between such plurality of cores. The method of measuring inter-core crosstalk in such a multi-core optical fiber and a light-receiving method of receiving light outputted from the multi-core optical fiber during measurement are disclosed, for example, in Non-patent Documents 1 to 3.

That is, when attempting to measure the crosstalk of a multi-core optical fiber in which the inter-core crosstalk caused by incident light propagation is extremely low, there are cases where accurate measurement cannot be performed since the noise light or the crosstalk during the coupling with the light-receiving optical fiber is larger. Specifically, when the coupling destination core and the core of the exit-side light-receiving optical fiber are aligned at the emission end of the multi-core optical fiber, output light from the coupling source core which is far more larger than the output light from the coupling destination core will enter the cladding of the light-receiving optical fiber. Here, depending on the state of the fiber end or the fiber structure, the light that entered the cladding of the light-receiving optical fiber is coupled with the core of the light-receiving optical fiber, and becomes noise during the measurement.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention has been developed to eliminate the problems described above. It is an object of the present invention to provide a light-receiving method of receiving light outputted from a multi-core optical fiber which enables the accurate measurement of inter-core crosstalk even when the inter-core crosstalk is small, as well as a separating apparatus.</p><heading id="h0007"><b>Means for Solving the Problems</b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to achieve the foregoing object, the method of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> receiving light outputted from a multi-core optical fiber according to the present invention, as a first aspect, disposes a light-receiving waveguide having a unique structure on an emission end side of the multi-core optical fiber, causes a measurement beam to enter a first core on a first end face of the multi-core optical fiber, guides, through the light-receiving waveguide, light outputted from a second core that is different from the first core on a second end face opposing the first end face of the multi-core optical fiber, and receives the light that was guided through the light-receiving waveguide. Here, the light-receiving waveguide is disposed at a position where the light outputted from the multi-core optical fiber reaches, and is a waveguide for guiding the light outputted from the core of the multi-core optical fiber and having a refractive index structure of depressed type or trench-assisted type in which the core is surrounded by a layer having a refractive index lower than that of a cladding.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Note that the at least one of the depressed layer constituting the depressed type and the trench layer constituting the trench-assisted type does not need to be configured entirely from a solid, and may also be a structure where the average refractive index is lower than that of the cladding due to a hole.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In accordance with the light-receiving method according to the first aspect, as a result of using a depressed type or trench-assisted type light-receiving waveguide in which the core is surrounded by the layer having a refractive index lower than that of a cladding as light-receiving means for receiving the light outputted from the multi-core optical fiber, the layer of the low refractive index can inhibit<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the propagation of noise and the like from the cladding to the core. Consequently, even in cases where multi-core optical fiber with as small inter-core crosstalk is measured, it is possible to accurately measure the inter-core crosstalk since components that are different from crosstalk-derived components in optical power are reduced.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Here, as a configuration which effectively yields the foregoing effect (as a second aspect that can be applied to the first aspect), the following aspect may be adopted. Specifically, the light-receiving waveguide includes a light-receiving optical fiber composed of a glass material in which its surface is covered with a coating. After the second core of the multi-core optical fiber and a core of the light-receiving optical fiber are aligned, the multi-core optical fiber and the light-receiving optical fiber are retained without being bonded with an adhesive. In a terminal portion of the light-receiving optical fiber including an end face facing the second core of the multi-core optical fiber, a glass portion from which the coating has been removed is exposed, or the glass portion is covered by the coating. In the second aspect, the light outputted from the second core of the multi-core optical fiber enters the core of the light-receiving optical fiber in a state where a ferrule is not mounted on the terminal portion of the light-receiving optical fiber.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As another configuration which effectively yields the foregoing effect, the following aspect (a third aspect that can be applied to the first aspect) can be adopted. Specifically, the light-receiving waveguide includes a light-receiving optical fiber composed of a glass material in which its surface is covered with a coating. After the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> second core of the multi-core optical fiber and a core of the light-receiving optical fiber are aligned, the multi-core optical fiber and the light-receiving optical fiber are bonded with an adhesive. A transparent ferrule is mounted via an adhesive on a terminal portion of the light-receiving optical fiber including an end face facing the second core of the multi-core optical fiber in a state where the glass portion from which the coating has been removed is exposed. Note that the refractive index of the adhesive used for mounting the ferrule is higher than that of the cladding of the light-receiving optical fiber. In the third aspect, the light outputted from the second core of the multi-core optical fiber enters the core of the light-receiving optical fiber in a state where the transparent ferrule is mounted on the terminal portion of the light-receiving optical fiber.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Moreover, the light-receiving method of receiving light outputted from a multi-core optical fiber according to the present invention, as a fourth aspect, disposes a light-receiving waveguide having a unique structure on an emission end side of the multi-core optical fiber, causes a measurement beam or signal light to enter one or more cores on a first end face of the multi-core optical fiber, separates the light outputted from the respective cores on a second end face by guiding, through the light-receiving waveguide, the light outputted from the respective cores on the second end face opposing the first end face of the multi-core optical fiber, and individually receives the light that was guided through the plurality of cores of light-receiving waveguide.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the fourth aspect, the light-receiving waveguide is disposed at a position where the light outputted from the multi-core<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> optical fiber reaches, and is a waveguide for guiding the light outputted from a core of the multi-core optical fiber and having a refractive index structure of depressed type or trench-assisted type which includes a plurality of cores and in which each of the cores is surrounded by a layer having a refractive index lower than that of a cladding. Moreover, at least one of the depressed layer and the trench layer is constituted by only solid having a refractive index lower than that of the cladding, or formed as a layer in which an average refractive index is lower than that of the cladding as a result of including a hole in the solid.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">As a fifth aspect that can be applied to the fourth aspect, the light-receiving waveguide may have a refractive index structure including a trap layer which has a refractive index higher than that of the cladding and which is positioned further toward an outer side than the depressed layer or the trench layer.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Moreover, as the fifth aspect, the separating apparatus of separating light outputted from a multi-core optical fiber according to the present invention comprises a light-receiving waveguide for guiding light outputted from a core of the multi-core optical fiber. The light-receiving waveguide having a unique structure and disposed at a position where light outputted from the multi-core optical fiber will reach. The light-receiving waveguide has a refractive index structure of depressed type or trench-assisted type which includes a plurality of cores and in which each of the cores is surrounded by a layer having a refractive index lower than that of a cladding.

The light outputted from the respective cores on a second end face is separated by guiding, through the light-receiving waveguide, the light outputted from the respective cores on the second end face opposing the first end face of the multi-core optical fiber. Consequently, the light that was guided through the plurality of cores of light-receiving waveguide is individually received.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As a configuration which effectively yields the effect of the fifth aspect, the following aspect (a sixth aspect that can be applied to the fifth aspect) may be adopted. Specifically, the light-receiving waveguide is configured from a plurality of single-core optical fibers in which terminal portions on one side thereof are bundled. The bundled terminal portion of the light-receiving waveguide is constituted as a ferrule or a connector in a state where the plurality of single-core optical fibers are aligned to match the core arrangement of the multi-core fiber.

Thus, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the inter-core crosstalk measuring device 1 comprises a light source 10, a single-mode optical fiber 40 (light-transmitting optical fiber) that is optically connected to any one of the cores on an entrance end of the multi-core optical fiber 30 in which one end thereof is to be measured, a single-mode optical fiber 50 (light-receiving optical fiber as the light-receiving waveguide), an optical part 60 for optically connecting an emission end of the multi-core optical fiber 30 and the single-mode optical fiber 50, and a power meter 20. Specifically, in the measuring device 1, as one example, the multi-core optical fiber 30 to be measured is disposed between the light source 10 and the power meter 20. A single-mode optical fiber 40 is disposed on the entrance end side of the multi-core optical fiber 30 and a single-mode optical fiber 50 is disposed on the emission end side, respectively. The multi-core optical fiber 30 and the single-mode optical fiber 50 are connected via the optical part 60 for<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> connecting the cores.

The single-mode optical fiber 50 is optically coupled to a second core 32 that is different from the first core 31 on the emission end face 30a in order to measure the inter-core crosstalk in the multi-core optical fiber 30 (light outputted from the second core 32 is guided through the single-mode optical fiber 50).</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2(A)</figref>, a terminal portion of the single-mode optical fiber 50 is placed on a holder 61 configured from a lower member and an upper member with V-grooves formed therein.

As a result of the holder 61 to which one terminal portion of the single-mode optical fiber 50 is placed relatively moving the core of the single-mode optical fiber 50 relative to the second core 32 in the multi-core optical fiber 30, the second core 32 and the core of the single-mode optical fiber 50 are aligned in the multi-core optical fiber 30.

A ferrule is not mounted on the terminal portion of the single-mode optical fiber 50.

The reason why the portion of the single-peaked pattern is of a sharper shape in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> in comparison to <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is because the spread of the core propagation mode is smaller in the latter.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Here, <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> shows the average of the coupling power of the range (range that cannot be explained with the mathematical formulas (1) to (3)) of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref> in which the absolute value of the axis displacement is 30 to 50 µm.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In accordance with the results of <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>, the average of the coupling power is high with respect to a fiber in the order of the matched cladding type single-mode optical fiber, and then the trench-assisted type single-mode optical fiber. Regarding a ferrule, it can be seen that the average of the coupling power is high in the order of the zirconia ferrule, the glass ferrule (regardless of the shape or existence of a metal part), and then the bared fiber. Among the above, it was confirmed that the reduction of the average of the coupling power was considerable when the trench-assisted type single-mode optical<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> fibers were butt-coupled in comparison to the case when the matched cladding type single-mode optical fibers were butt-coupled.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The reasons why the foregoing results were obtained can be qualitatively explained as follows.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">(A) Foremost, foregoing mathematical formulas (1) to (3) represent the coupling that occurs at only butted portion of the fiber end face. However, in reality, when the axis displacement increases, the coupling power to the core of the output-side optical fiber based on the butt-coupling will decrease, and most of the power will be coupled to the cladding. While the propagation mode of the cladding is unstable and the propagation loss is great, there is coupling while propagating from the cladding modes to the core mode, and this can be ignored when the coupling to the core in the butt-coupling is large, but cannot be ignored when the coupling to the core in the butt-coupling is small.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">(B) Moreover, with the trench-assisted type single-mode optical fiber, since a trench layer having a lower refractive index exists around the core, the trench layer acts as a barrier and inhibits the coupling from the cladding modes to the core mode.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">(C) The light that should have escaped outside the cladding is scattered or reflected to the ferrule or the adhesive used for bonding the ferrule and the optical fiber. Thus, the light that should have escaped outside the cladding is trapped in the cladding, and the power of light that is coupled from the cladding mode to the core mode is increased.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Based on the foregoing analysis, it was confirmed that the refractive index profile shape that is desirable as the light-receiving<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> waveguide for use in a measuring system for measuring the inter-core crosstalk in a multi-core optical fiber to be measured includes the following features.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">(1) A portion having a refractive index lower than that of a cladding exists between the core and the cladding such as trench-assisted type refractive index profile or depressed type refractive index profile.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">(2) The trench layer or the depressed layer has a thickness and refractive index difference relative to the cladding which are sufficient for inhibiting the coupling from a cladding mode to a core mode.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">(3) In the foregoing premise, the radius (trench outer diameter) from the core center to the interface of the trench layer and the cladding layer, or the radius (depressed layer) to the interface of the depressed layer and the cladding layer should be as small as possible. The reason for this is because, when measuring the inter-core crosstalk in a multi-core optical fiber, most of the power of the output light from the coupling source core is coupled to the outside of the cladding outer diameter or the depressed outer diameter on the butted surface of the multi-core optical fiber and the light-receiving waveguide upon receiving the output light from the coupling destination core with the light-receiving waveguide. This aims to prevent a component, which should inhibit the coupling to the core of the light-receiving waveguide, from becoming coupled to the inside of the barrier to be inhibited.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Moreover, when the light-receiving waveguide is an optical fiber (light-receiving optical fiber), the terminal portion butted with the<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> multi-core optical fiber 30 preferably includes the following features.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">(4) When it is not necessary to bond the multi-core optical fiber and the light-receiving optical fiber (when performing fusion or performing measurement on an aligning machine), desirably the coating is removed and the glass portion is exposed. However, if the refractive index of the coating is higher than that of the cladding and it is possible to cleanly cut the end face of the light-receiving optical fiber even with the coating remaining, the glass portion may be covered with a coating.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">(5) When it is necessary to bond the multi-core optical fiber and the light-receiving optical fiber, the adherend of the light-receiving optical fiber and the ferrule needs to have an area of a certain size. Thus, preferably, the light-receiving optical fiber is in a state of being bonded to the ferrule. Moreover, the ferrule is preferably composed of a material that transmits, without scattering, light of the wavelength band that is used for measurement so that the scattered light does not return to the light-receiving optical fiber. In addition, so that the power of the cladding mode can easily escape to the ferrule, the ferrule and the adhesive for bonding the ferrule and the fiber have a refractive index that is higher than that of the cladding of the light-receiving optical fiber.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">(6) When the refractive index of the ferrule and the adhesive for bonding the ferrule and the light-receiving optical fiber is lower than that of the cladding of the light-receiving optical fiber, it is also possible to provide, in the cladding on the outside of the trench interface or the depressed interface, a layer (trap layer) having a refractive index higher than that of the cladding, and couple the cladding mode to the trap layer.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> Here, even if a cladding is further provided outside the trap layer, the outside interface of the trap layer may be the interface of glass and air.
