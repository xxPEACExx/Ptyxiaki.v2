To address this, there is a known method for a muscle and fat structure in which a relationship between a spatial slope S and a muscle absorption coefficient <i>µ</i>a is expressed by introducing a second order function. The absorption coefficient of muscle is then determined by adding a means to input the thickness of fat, and using a computation formula corresponding to the thickness (Patent Document 1).
