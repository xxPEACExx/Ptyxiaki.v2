The fixed through cap end 3 is fixed to the sealing through pipe 2 by means of a retainer 9 that is preferably a threaded type. At the upper part of the sealing through pipe 2 there is a water reflector 4, which has a support 5 with a foot 6 with an opening in it. There is sealing 7 on<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the upper face of the outer pipe 1, and the foot 6 is located over the sealing 7, and the foot 6 is locked by a locking means to the sealing through pipe 2. The locking means comprises a lock 8, preferably a bayonet type with two symmetrical grooves, located at the upper end of the sealing through pipe 2, and two corresponding teeth at the foot 6.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">It is possible the water reflector 4 to be a truncated sphere with a radius from 35 mm to 100 mm, a truncation towards the centre of the sphere from 0.001 mm to 45 mm and an outer radius after truncation from 10 mm to 100 mm. The aim of the invention is to create a cold water inlet nozzle in a water heater with enhanced efficiency through low speed uniform distribution of the cold water flow, thus leading to increase in the discharged amount of hot water.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">It is possible the water reflector 4 to be conical with a height from 5 mm to 25 mm and a base with a radius from 10 mm to 100 mm.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">It is possible the water reflector 4 to be a truncated ellipse with a large semi-axis from 10 mm to 50 mm, small semi-axis from 0.1 mm to 25 mm, and an outer radius after truncation from 10 mm to 100 mm.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">It is possible the water reflector 4 to be a disc with a radius from 10 mm to 100 mm.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the preferred embodiment of the invention the lock 8 is a bayonet type. However, it is also possible to be threaded type, flange type or clamp type. It is possible the retainer 9 to be bayonet type or clamp type.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The cold water inlet nozzle in a water heater operates in the following way:</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Cold water is fed into the water heater through the outer pipe 1, respectively through the through cap end 3 and the sealing through pipe 2, and then it passes through the opening of the foot 6 and gets reflected by the reflector 4.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The shape of the reflector 4 is such that it reduces abruptly the speed of the cold water flow due to the great increase in the volume that it occupies after it has been reflected upon the attack of the water flow in the centre of the reflector 4. Thus uniform diffusion and low speed of the cold water flow is achieved, which leads to increase in the discharged amount of hot water from the installed water tank. The geometric apexes of the reflector 4, having axial symmetry, form laminar distribution of the reflected cold water flow and direct it in the opposite direction, thus providing enhanced efficiency of hot and cold water mixing in upward direction, and at the same time the displacement effect of hot water elevation is applied at the discharge of the electric water heater.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The various shapes and dimensions of the reflector 4 additionally contribute to achieve better effectiveness by a more uniform distribution and a lower speed of the cold water flow, thus leading to an increase in the discharged amount of hot water.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The use of a disc reflector 4 from <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 6</figref> contributes to reduce the speed of the cold water flow, and the direction of the reflection being in the horizontal plane, leads to an increase in the discharged amount of hot water. Due to the geometry of the reflector's shape, there is no turbulence of the cold water flow.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The use of truncated elliptical reflector 4 from <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 5</figref> leads to reduction of the speed of the cold water flow even more than the use of the disc reflector, while the direction of reflection changes from horizontal to downwards. There is an additional increase in the discharged amount of hot water in comparison to the amount discharged with disk reflector. Due to the reflector geometry, there can be cold water turbulence inside the reflector volume, but not outside.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The use of conical reflector 4 from <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref> leads to reduction of the speed of the cold water flow even more than the use of the elliptical reflector 4, while the reflection tends to be in vertical direction. There is an additional increase in the discharged amount of hot water in comparison to the amount discharged<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> with truncated elliptical reflector. Due to the reflector geometry, there can be cold water turbulence inside the reflector volume, but not outside.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The use of a truncated spherical reflector 4 from <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> leads to reduction of the speed of the cold water flow even more than the use of the conical reflector 4, while the reflection may be close to vertical direction. There is an additional increase in the discharged amount of hot water in comparison to the amount discharged with conical reflector. Due to the reflector geometry, there can be cold water turbulence inside the reflector volume, but not outside.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The outer section of the sealing through pipe 2 seals the outer pipe 1 in a secure and reliable manner. The through cap end 3 is intended to fix securely and reliably the joint to the outer pipe 1. The sealing 7 is used to seal the joint and to bring firmness after enabling the retainer 9.
