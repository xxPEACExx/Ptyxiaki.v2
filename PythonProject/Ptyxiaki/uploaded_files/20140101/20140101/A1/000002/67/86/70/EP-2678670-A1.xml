Application PCT/GB2011/000267 filed February 25, 2011 (Attorney Docket No. P056478WO), both of which claim priority to US Provisional Patent Application S.N. 61/308,167 filed February 25, 2010 (Attorney Docket No. DDI-5196) all of the applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties herein this application. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Background </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">[0002] Analyte detection in physiological fluids, e.g. blood or blood derived products, is of ever increasing importance to today's society. Analyte detection assays find use in a variety of applications, including clinical laboratory testing, home testing, etc., where the results of such testing play a prominent role in diagnosis and management in a variety of disease conditions. Analytes of interest include glucose for diabetes management, cholesterol, and the like. In response to this growing importance of analyte detection, a variety of analyte detection protocols and devices for both clinical and home use have been developed. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> [0003] One type of method that is employed for analyte detection is an electrochemical method. In such methods, an aqueous liquid sample is placed into a sample-receiving test cell in an electrochemical cell that includes two electrodes, e.g., a counter and working electrode. The analyte is allowed to react with a redox reagent to form an oxidizable (or reducible) substance in an amount corresponding to the analyte concentration. The quantity of the oxidizable (or reducible) substance present is then 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 estimated electrochemically and related to the amount of analyte present in the initial sample. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> [0004] Such systems are susceptible to various modes of inefficiency and/or error. For example, variations in temperatures can affect the results of the method. This is especially relevant when the method is carried out in an uncontrolled environment, as is often the case in home applications or in third world countries. Errors can also occur when the sample size is insufficient to get an accurate result. Partially filled test strips can potentially give an inaccurate result because the measured test currents are proportional to the area of the working electrode that is wetted with sample. Thus, partially filled test strips can under certain conditions provide a glucose concentration that is negatively biased. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> [0005] To alleviate some of these problems, biosensor researchers have turned to using capacitance of the test chamber to determine the fill sufficiency of the test chamber. Examples are shown and described in US Patent Nos. 6,856,125; 6,872,298; 7,195,704; and 7,199,594, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference into this application. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Summary of the Disclosure </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">[0006] Applicant believes that effects of parallel strip resistance in determining filled biosensor test strips have been ignored, leading to inaccurate high measurement of capacitance in a test strip, especially when lower parallel resistance is encountered. Exemplary embodiments of applicant's invention take into consideration this effect and at the same time obviate the need to determine the resistance in a biosensor </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> electrochemical test cell. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> [0007] In one aspect, a method of determining capacitance of an electrochemical </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> biosensor test cell of a test strip is provided. The test chamber has at least two electrodes disposed in the chamber and coupled to a microcontroller. The method can be achieved by: initiating an electrochemical reaction of a sample upon deposition of the sample in the biosensor chamber; applying an oscillating signal of a predetermined frequency to the chamber; ascertaining a first sampling-time interval for measurement of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 an output signal based on a predetermined sampling rate per cycle of the output signal at the predetermined frequency; sampling the output signal from the chamber at a second sampling-time interval different than the first sampling-time interval such that a magnitude of each sampled output signal is measured at each succession of the second sampling-time interval instead of at the first time interval; determining a phase angle between an output signal and the oscillating input signal from the chamber based on the sampled output signal of the sampling step; and calculating a capacitance of the chamber from the phase angle. In a variation of this aspect, the second sampling-time interval is based on a predetermined offset time with respect to the first sampling-time interval, or the first sampling-time interval comprises a duration between each step change in magnitude of the output signal; and the offset time comprises a percentage of the first sampling-time interval, which the percentage comprises a range from about 5% to about 30% of the first sampling-time interval. In another variation of this aspect, the ascertaining may include: determing a duration for one wave of the signal at the predetermined frequency; dividing the duration over a number of measurement samples for each wave to obtain a time duration; and setting the first sampling-time interval as being generally equal to the time duration. In yet a further variation, the ascertaining may include evaluating the output signal to determine a time duration between each step change of the output signal; and setting the first sampling-time interval as being generally equal to the time duration. It is further noted that in this aspect, the offset time may include a percentage of the first sampling-time interval, which the percentage may range from about 5% to about 30% of the first sampling-time interval. In yet a variation of this aspect, the calculating may include calculating capacitance with a phase angle compensation to account for phase shift in a circuit used to sample the output signal. In particular, the calculating may include calculating capacitance with an equation of the form:

In a more particular variation, the phase angle </p><p id="p0020" num="0020">compensation may include about 11 degrees. It is noted that in a further variation, the calculating may include: sampling a plurality of current outputs from the chamber over one cycle of the frequency; obtaining a mean of sampled current output; subtracting the mean from each sampled current of the plurality of current outputs; and extracting root- mean-squared value of all negative values from the subtracting to provide for the total current output. Alternatively, the calculating may include determining from the sampling, at least one cross-over point of the current from negative to positive values; and interpolating proximate the at least one cross-over point of the current to determine a first angle at which the current changes from positive to negative or negative to positive. It is further noted that the interpolating the at least one cross-over point of the current may include interpolating another cross-over point from the sampling to determine another angle at which the current changes from positive to negative or negative to positive; and subtracting from the another angle approximately 180 degrees to provide for a second angle. The subtracting further may include calculating an average of the first and second angles. The calculating may include determining a difference in the angle between the oscillating input current and the output current as the phase angle. </p><p id="p0021" num="0021"> In another aspect, an analyte measurement system is provided that includes an analyte test strip and an analyte meter. The analyte test strip includes a substrate having a reagent disposed thereon and at least two electrodes proximate the reagent a in test chamber of the test strip. The analyte meter includes a strip port connector disposed to connect to the two electrodes, a power supply, and a microcontroller electrically coupled 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 to the strip port connector and the power supply. The microcontroller is programmed to: initiate an electrochemical reaction in the biosensor chamber; apply an oscillating voltage of a predetermined frequency to the chamber; ascertain a first sampling-time interval for measurement of an output signal based on a predetermined sampling rate per cycle of the output signal at the predetermined frequency; sample the output signal from the chamber at a second sampling-time interval different than the first sampling-time interval such that a magnitude of each sampled output signal is measured at each succession of the second sampling-time interval instead of at the first time interval; </p><p id="p0022" num="0022"> determine a phase angle between a current output and the oscillating voltage from the chamber based on the sampled output signal; and calculate a capacitance of the chamber based on the determined phase angle. In this system, the second sampling- time interval is based on a predetermined offset time with respect to the first sampling- time interval. Additionally, the first sampling-time interval may include a duration between each step change in magnitude of the output signal. Specifically, the offset time may include a percentage of the first sampling-time interval; and the percentage may have a range from about 5% to about 30% of the first sampling-time interval. </p><p id="p0023" num="0023">[0009] These and other embodiments, features and advantages will become apparent to those skilled in the art when taken with reference to the following more detailed description of various exemplary embodiments of the invention in conjunction with the accompanying drawings that are first briefly described. </p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Brief Description of the Figures </p><p id="p0025" num="0025">[0010] The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated herein and constitute part of this specification, illustrate presently preferred embodiments of the invention, and, together with the general description given above and the detailed description given below, serve to explain features of the invention (wherein like numerals represent like elements).

 available from Texas Instrument as ultra-low power microcontroller model MSP430. Microcontroller ("MC") 300 may be provided with DAC output and built-in A-D conversion. MC 300 is suitably connected to a LCD screen 304 to provide a display of the test results or other information related to the test results. Memory 306 is electrically connected to the MC 300 for storage of test results, sensed current and other necessary information or data. The test strip may be coupled for a test measurement via a strip port connector ("SPC") 308. SPC 308 allows the test strip to interface with MC 300 via a first contact pad 47a, 47b and a second contact pad 43. The second contact pad 43 can be used to establish an electrical connection to the test meter through a U-shaped notch 45, as illustrated in FIG. 4. SPC 308 may also be provided with electrode connectors 308a and 308c. The first contact pad 47 can include two prongs denoted as 47a and 47b. In one exemplary embodiment, the first electrode connectors 308a and 308c separately connect to prongs 47a and 47b, respectively. The second electrode connector 308b can connect to second contact pad 43. The test meter 10 can measure the resistance or electrical continuity between the prongs 47a and 47b to determine whether the test strip 80 is electrically connected to the test meter 10. </p><p id="p0079" num="0079"> Referring to Figure 4, SPC 308 is connected to switch 310. Switch 310 is connected to the bias driver 312. Bias driver 312 is provided with the DAC signal 312a; current drive 312b and switch signal 312c. The MC 300 provides the DAC signal 312a, which includes analogue voltages in the range 0 to Vref (e.g., about 2.048V). The bias driver 312 can operate in two modes - constant voltage, or constant current. The current-driver line 312b controls the mode of the bias driver 312. Setting the line 312b low converts an op-amp in the bias driver 312 to a voltage follower amplifier. DAC signal 312a output is scaled to Vref/2 +/- 400mV full scale. The op-amp in the bias driver outputs this voltage directly to the MC 300 as line driver-line 312d. The voltage of line 312d is generated with respect to the Vref/2 virtual ground. So to drive a suitable bias (e.g., about 20mV bias), the DAC must drive (through a suitable scaler) about 1.044V. To drive a bias of about +300mV, the DAC must generally provide about 1.324V, and for the -300mV bias, the DAC must generally provide about 0.724V. The bias driver circuit 312

 also generates the 109Hz sine wave, which is used for fill detection via capacitance measurement. </p><p id="p0080" num="0080"> On the other hand, if current-drive signal 312a to bias driver 312 is held high, the DAC output is scaled to approximately 0 to approximately 60mV full scale. Switch signal 312c may also be energized, causing the current path through the test strip to be diverted through a resistor in bias driver 312. The op-amp in bias driver 312 attempts to control the voltage drop across the resistor to be the same as the scaled DAC drive - producing in this case a current of approximately 600nA. This current is used for sample detection in order to initiate a test measurement. </p><p id="p0081" num="0081"> Bias driver 312 is also connected to a trans-impedance amplifier circuit ("TIA circuit") 314. TIA circuit 314 converts the current flowing though the strip's electrode layer 66a (e.g., palladium) to electrode layer 64a (e.g., gold) contacts into a voltage. The overall gain is controlled by a resistor in TIA circuit 314. Because the strip 80 is a highly capacitive load, normal low-offset amplifiers tend to oscillate. For this reason a low-cost op-amp is provided in the TIA circuit 314 as a unity gain buffer and incorporated within the overall feedback loop. As a functional block, circuit 314 acts as dual op-amp system with both high drive capability and low voltage offset. The TIA circuit 314 also utilizes a virtual ground (or virtual earth) to generate the 1,024V bias on the electrode layer 64a (e.g., gold) contact of the SPC 308. Circuit 314 is also connected to a Vref amplifier circuit 316. This circuit, when in current measuring mode, uses a virtual ground rail set at Vref/2 (approximately 1.024V), allowing both positive and negative currents to be measured. This voltage feeds all of the gain amplifier stage 318. To prevent any circuit loads from 'pulling' this voltage, a unity gain buffer amplifier may be utilized within the Vref amplifier circuit 316. </p><p id="p0082" num="0082"> The strip current signal 314a from the TIA circuit 314 and the virtual ground rail 316a (~Vref/2) from the voltage reference amplifier 316 are scaled up as needed for various stages of the test measurement cycle. In the exemplary embodiment, MC 300 is provided with four channels of amplified signal sensed from the test strip with varying

Once the test meter 10 recognizes that the strip 80 has been inserted, the test meter 10 turns on and initiates a fluid detection mode. In one embodiment, the meter attempts to drive a small current (e.g. 0.2 to 1 μΑ) through the strip 80. When there is no sample present the resistance is greater than several Mega Ohms, the driving voltage on the op- amp trying to apply the current goes to the rail. When a sample is introduced the resistance drops precipitously and the driving voltage follows. When the driving voltage drops below a pre-determined threshold the test sequence is initiated. </p><p id="p0084" num="0084">[0054] Figure 5A shows the voltage to be applied between the electrodes.

 In this model of Fig. 3B, R represents the resistance encountered by the current and C represents a capacitance resulting from the combination of the physiological fluid and reagent electrically coupled to the electrodes. To initiate a determination of capacitance of the chamber, an alternating bias voltage may be applied across the respective electrodes disposed in the chamber, and a current from the chamber is measured. The filling of the chamber 61 is believed to be generally a measure of capacitance only and thus any parasitic resistance, such as, for example, R, must not be included in any determination or calculation of capacitance. Hence, in measuring or sensing the current, any parasitic resistance is believed to affect the measured current.

Hence, each sample represents approximately 5.6 degrees of the exemplary sine wave. </p><p id="p0113" num="0113"> [0072] In Figure 6A, the system adds a direct-current voltage offset to the alternating current bias and therefore the measured samples in Figure 6A will also have a direct- current offset, which must be removed via steps 706 and 708 in order to determine the total current i<sub>T</sub> according to one example of applicant's technique. </p><p id="p0114" num="0114"> [0073] In this technique, a mean of all the 64-65 samples, referenced here as 602, in</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">Figure 6A is derived, which will provide a threshold for the zero current of the AC component of the samples. A benefit of this derivation is that the noise across the samples is averaged out. For each sample point, the mean value is subtracted out of each sampled point, which results in isolating the alternating current component, shown here in Figure 6B. Thereafter, a RMS value of all the negative values is taken to provide for a substantially accurate magnitude of the total current i<sub>T</sub> . It is noted that the RMS value of the positive values could also be taken, but applicant believes that the positive values are disjointed due to being split across the first and fourth quadrants of the overall cycle, and therefore the negative values are preferred. Once the samples 602 have been manipulated to remove the DC offset, the samples can be plotted to show the output of the current over time, as referenced here at 604 in Figure 6B.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116"> 0

 To determine the phase angle, the system or processor 300, as appropriately programmed can compare the oscillating input voltage, shown here in Figure 6C to the oscillating output current to determine the phase angle. In the preferred embodiments, the sampled data 604 is analyzed to determine a cross-over point from positive to negative current. Because the sampling is based on a discrete number of samples, interpolation can be used to determine substantially when the output current crosses over the zero current line. In the embodiment described here, the phase angle Φ is less than 90 degrees and approximately 87 degrees. For increased accuracy, interpolation can be performed at another cross-over point with approximately 180 degrees subtracted from this second interpolated point. The two interpolated values should be within a few degrees and may be averaged out to increase accuracy. </p><p id="p0117" num="0117"> Once the phase angle has been derived, capacitance can be calculated using Eq. 8. Once capacitance of the test strip 80 has been determined, a two-point calibration can be performed to normalize the capacitance value to a value that is independent of any tolerances of the analog components (e.g., resistors, capacitors, op-amps, switches and the like). Briefly, the two-point calibration is performed by: placing a 550nF capacitor with 30k parallel resistance across the measurement input; command the meter to measure the capacitance, and note the value produced; place a 800nF capacitor with 30k parallel resistance across the measurement input; command the meter to measure the capacitance, and note the value produced. These two points will give an indication of the gain and offset of the measurement capability of that particular hardware instance (not the design). A slope and offset are then calculated from the measurement errors, and stored in the meter's memory. The meter is now calibrated. When a strip is inserted and a sample applied, the capacitance is measured and the stored slope and offset are applied to correct the measurement. </p><p id="p0118" num="0118"> After completion of the device calibration, an evaluation is made to determine whether the test chamber 61 has been sufficiently filled with test fluid. The evaluation can be based on a capacitance magnitude of at least 65% to 85% of an average capacitance value derived from a large sample of good filled test strips.

 Although the technical feature described above is believed to be sufficient for its intended use, it is believed that a more robust capacitance measurement can be made with a more comprehensive model. As such, applicant believes that the biosensor test strip 80 and test cell 61 with the electrode layers in Fig. 3A can be represented as a series of resistors Rpdcontact, RpdFilm, f ontact; and R<sub>A</sub>uFiim 'n Fig. 7A, and the test cell 61 can be represented as a parallel resistor-capacitor circuit having R<sub>Ce</sub>n conductance and CooubieLayer in Fig. 7A. The resistors of the strip 80 and the parallel resistor-capacitor of test cell 61 can be modeled in the form of a circuit having a series resistor R<sub>str</sub>i<sub>P</sub> for the strip gold and palladium layers and a parallel resistor R<sub>ce</sub>» and capacitor C circuit for the test cell test cell 61 as shown in Fig. 7B. In this model of Fig. 7B, the system can drive an alternating voltage with frequency/and root-mean-squared ("RMS") amplitude V, and measure total current i<sub>T</sub> as RMS value and phase angle Φ , capacitance C of the test cell 61 can be derived with the appropriate offset to account for the strip resistivity R<sub>str</sub>j<sub>p</sub> and any phase shifting caused by the measurement circuit. </p><p id="p0119" num="0119">Through the use of actual measurements and mathematical modeling, the resistance of R<sub>st</sub>rip was determined to be in the range of about 120 Ohms to about 150 Ohms (with about 135 Ohms being common) depending on the variation of the resistance of the Au and Pd contacts. It was believed that the resistance for R<sub>st</sub>rip in the range of about 150 Ohms was negligible in comparison to the much larger impedance of Rceii and C<sub>ce</sub>ii- Hence, with the assumption that nominal value for Rcell is about 33 kilo- Ohms and Ccen of about 600 nanoFarad at 109 Hertz, the phase angle was approximately 85.6 degrees. However, with the resistance of R<sub>str</sub>j<sub>P</sub> (~150 Ohms) added to the cell, the measured phase angle became about 82.7 degrees, a difference of about 3.5 degrees. While small, this difference is believed to have a significant impact on the capacitance measurement. Moreover, while the trans-impedance stage 314 (Fig. 4) has virtually no phase shift associated with this stage (the phase shift being about 0.007 degrees at about 109 Hz), the gain stage 318 (Fig. 4) at about 109 Hz showed a phase shift of about 6.1 degrees nominally. This additional phase shift can be offset by introduction of a

The compensation value <sub>ίΏΜ1&gt;</sub> can now be applied to Equation 8 to give a more accurate capacitance measurement in Equation 9. </p><p id="p0120" num="0120">[0079] C = |/<sub>r</sub> sin(0 + <sub>COMP</sub> )| / 2π/Υ Eq. 9 </p><p id="p0121" num="0121"> [0080] In the preferred embodiments, the compensation phase angle <sub>COMP</sub> ranges from about 3 to about 25 degrees and preferably about 11 degrees. </p><p id="p0122" num="0122">[0081] To demonstrate the improvements brought about by his technique above, </p><p id="p0123" num="0123"> experiments were carried out to determine the ability of the technique to determine capacitance despite increasing levels of interferants, which would normally affect the capacitance response. Figure 7D shows the measured capacitance to varying levels of gentisic acid interference on different prototypes. Prototype #1 was a blood glucose measurement system available in the Netherlands under the trade name of Verio and utilized without any phase angle correction; Prototype #2 was a blood glucose measurement system available in France under the trade name of Verio Pro; Prototype #3 is similar to Prototype #2 but utilized with Equation 9 and along with a compensated phase angle of about 6 degrees to account for the measurement circuit; and Prototype #4 which is Prototype #3 with 11 degrees of phase angle compensation with the strip calibrated for a strip resistance Rstrip of about 150 Ohms. The numbers "0 1 2 3 4" indicates increasing levels of gentisic acid added to blood volume and saline. In particular, at the "0" level, no gentisic acid is added; at the "1" level, the concentration is about 0.45 mg per deciliter; at the "2" level, the concentration is about 0.90 mg/dL; at the "3" level, the concentration is about 1.35 mg/dL; and at the "4" level, the </p><p id="p0124" num="0124"> concentration is about 1.8 mg/dL.

As the level of gentisic acid is added, the capacitance value increases to about 599 nanoFarads for an interval of about 47 nanoFarads. For Prototype #2, increasing the level of gentisic acid caused the capacitance magnitudes to decline from an average of about 625 nanoFarad (no gentisic acid) to about 573 nanoFarad, or an interval of about 52 nanoFarads. With phase angle compensation for the measurement circuit, Prototype #3 showed a decrease from an average of 635 nanoFarad (no gentisic acid added) to about 607 nanoFarad, or interval of about 28 nanoFarads. In contrast, with the phase angle compensation and the use of strip resistance set at about 150 ohms, Prototype #4 showed a decrease from an average of about 598 nanoFarad to about 586 nanoFarad, an interval of about 12 nanoFarads or a reduction of more than 50% from Prototype #3. Applicant note that not only is the interval between the highest average capacitance and lowest capacitance decreasing, the variation between the highest and lowest magnitude of capacitance for each level of gentisic acid (the area of each vertically oriented rectangle) is smaller from Prototype #2 to Prototype #4. These results indicate that capacitance measurements became less sensitive to various levels of interferents such as gentisic acid with the use of applicant's techniques.

 The modeled circuit of Figure 7B predicted a response of the electrochemical test cell 61 that varies as a function of the capacitance of the electrochemical test cell (C<sub>C</sub>ELL), resistance of the electrochemical test cell (RCELL)<sub>&gt;</sub> <sup>a n</sup>d <sup>tn e str</sup>'P resistance (RST IP) shown here in Figure 8A. As can be seen in Fig. 8A, when the strip resistor is assumed to be about zero ohm, the predicted or referential capacitive response of the electrochemical test cell 61 (denoted by line 700) is generally linear (approximately 435 nanoFarad) over a range of the test cell resistance from about 120 kilo-ohms to about 20 kilo-ohms at which point the predicted or referential capacitive response increases almost exponentially to approximately 450 nanoFarads. When the strip resistance is assumed to be about 50 ohms, the predicted or referential capacitive response 702 of the electrochemical test cell 61 is generally linear over the resistance of the electrochemical test cell 61 from about 120 kilo-ohms to about 20 kilo-ohms at which point the predicted or referential capacitive response increases non-linearly but not to the extent of the capacitive response 700 with about zero strip resistance. When the strip resistance is assumed to be about 100 ohms, the predicted or referential capacitive response 704 of the electrochemical test cell 61 is generally linear over the resistance of the test cell 61 from about 120 kilo-ohms to about 20 kilo-ohms at which point the predicted or referential capacitive response decreases somewhat non-linearly. When the strip resistance is assumed to be about 100 ohms, the predicted or referential capacitive response 704 of the test cell 61 is generally linear over the resistance of the test cell 61 from about 120 kilo-ohms to about 20 kilo-ohms at which point the predicted or referential capacitive response decreases exponentially. In all cases of RSTRIP values, the capacitance of the cell converges toward a generally common value when RCELL is about 100 kilo-Ohms and generally diverges depending on the RSTRIP values from about 20 kilo- Ohms to about zero Ohm. </p><p id="p0128" num="0128"> On the other hand, the actual capacitive and resistive responses in Fig. 8B from representative test strips of Fig. 3A are quite different from the referential </p><p id="p0129" num="0129">capacitive/resistive responses of Fig. 8A. In particular, the capacitive responses do not converge toward a common capacitive value at the higher value of RCELL- Yet the

 capacitive responses of the actual strip exhibited, at the low end of the resistance of RcELb a contrary behavior to the referential or predicted model of Fig. 8A by converging toward a generally common value of about 590 nanoFarad at the Rcell of about zero Ohms in Fig. 8B. </p><p id="p0130" num="0130"> [0085] This anomaly in the behavior of CCELL at different values of R<sub>C</sub>ELL was further </p><p id="p0131" num="0131"> investigated. A closer look at how the alternating signal was sampled showed what applicant believes is the reason for such anomaly. Specifically, the referential model utilizes a pure sine wave whereas the actual wave 900 is generated piecewise with 64 distinct current samples per wave, which is shown here in Fig. 9A. Because the wave 900 of Fig. 9A includes steps rather than a smooth line, this is believed to produce a different response of the measurement circuit that turns out to be highly dependent on RSTRIP- </p><p id="p0132" num="0132">[0086] Taking R<sub>ST</sub>RIP to be about 200 Ohms, it can be seen in Fig. 9B that a theoretical output given excitation via a pure sine wave is a smooth continuous line 902 whereas the stepped saw-tooth line 904 is the output using a stepped wave signal, such as for example, the piecewise signal 900 in Fig. 9A. It can be seen that depending on the timing of when the piecewise response 904 is measured or sampled, the amplitude and phase measurements can change somewhat. It is believed that the driver to this anomaly between Fig. 8A and Fig. 8B is capacitance sensitivity to strip resistance RSTRIP due to amplitude measurement inaccuracies. In this example with RSTRIP being 200 Ohm, the phase difference can be seen to be somewhat insignificant to have a serious effect on measurements. </p><p id="p0133" num="0133">[0087] However, when R<sub>S</sub>TRIP is set to about zero Ohm, the phase difference can be </p><p id="p0134" num="0134"> significant. As seen with respect to Fig. 9C, the piecewise like response 906 (which appears to have an inverted wave rectification) can, depending on where the response 906 is sampled can give a difference in output of up to about 20%. This difference is believed to be substantial in causing larger capacitance measurement errors. Applicant notes that when the resistance of the cell, RCEU, is reduced, the amplitude of the disturbances due to the piecewise wave 900 also reduces, which is believed to be why 
<!-- EPO <DP n="28"/>-->
 the capacitance measurements tend to converge to a single capacitive value when RCELL is about 5 kilo-Ohm. </p><p id="p0135" num="0135">To compensate for this effect, it is believed that the piecewise output signal should be sampled at the right time after a step change of the piecewise wave 906. As shown in Fig. 9D, the piecewise wave 906 tends to lag or lead a pure wave 902 during a change in direction of the wave 906 as compared to a pure wave 902. Taking an enlarged portion of Fig. 9D, shown here in Fig. 9E, it can be seen that there is a time differential At between a peak 908 of the piecewise wave 906 and where the piecewise wave 906 crosses over the pure wave 902 at cross-over point 910. </p><p id="p0136" num="0136">From this discovery of the source of the anomaly, applicant proceeded to carry out experiments to measure this time differential At using a range of values for CCELL, RSTRIP and R<sub>C</sub>ELL with reference to Fig. 9F and Table 1. In Fig. 9F, the reference "a" indicates the peak 908 at which the piecewise changes step and reference "b" indicates the desired sampling point where the output of the gain amp stage 314 matches the theoretical wave. The measurements were made at a plurality of points in both the positive and negative phases of the sine wave. The overall results are shown in Table 1, which gives a good idea of the boundary conditions for variations in the strip and meter system. </p><p id="p0137" num="0137">From Table 1, an average value can be calculated from the various boundary conditions to give a preferable sampling timing for a representative system. Applicant believes that the offset timing should be about 20% of the duration of a step change from peak-to-peak of the wave 906. For this particular example, with the driving frequency of about 109 Hz and 64 samples per cycle of the wave, 20% of a duration of a step change of 143 microseconds is about 28 microseconds. It is noted, however, other values from 5% to 40% (or about 17 microseconds to about 38 microseconds) will also work, depending on the driving frequency, sampling rate, duration of a step change, and the meter and strip system in use.

 predetermined frequency and a number of sample measurements taken for each cycle of the signal. As an example, in Fig. 6A<sub>;</sub> the predetermined frequency of the input signal is about 109 cycles per second, which means that one cycle of the output signal takes about 0.009 second. If the desired sampling rate is N, for example, 64 samples per second, then each sample (e.g., SI, S2, S3 ... Sn) is taken by dividing the time taken by one wave (0.009 seconds) over N (or 64) samples resulting in a sampling time of about 143 microseconds. In other words, the magnitude of the output response 602 is sampled every 143 microseconds and the measurement stored. In the sampling step, the magnitude of the output signal is measured at a second sampling time interval different from the first sampling-time interval in order to ensure that the magnitude of the sampled output response does not deviate from a theoretical continuous output signal (e.g., pure sine wave output). The second sampling time interval can be a </p><p id="p0142" num="0142">predetermined time offset from the first time interval or a percentage of the first sampling-time interval.

The second sampling time interval ST2 can be a percentage increase (or decrease depending the direction of the wave) of the first sampling-time interval STl. In one embodiment, the percentage can be any value from about 5% to about 30% and preferably about 20%. Once the second sampling time interval is determined, the magnitude of the output signal 906 (Fig. 9F) is measured at each succession of the second sampling time interval ST2 with two succeeding time intervals ST2 shown here in Fig. 9F as ST2(a) and ST2(b) where the magnitude of the output signal is sampled at 910, 912, 914 and so on. From the sampled magnitudes of the output signal, the phase angle difference between the input and output signal is determined and the capacitance can be measured as described earlier. Thus, applicant's use of the offset timing allow for the sampling interval to
