That is to say, when attaching the impeller to the shaft, it is necessary, while rotatively moving the impeller, to gradually bring it close to the shaft.<br/>
For this reason, the movement amount of the impeller when attaching the impeller to the shaft is a great deal more than the case of attaching the impeller to the shaft without rotatively moving it. Accordingly, in the methods of Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2, the amount of work required when fastening the impeller and the shaft ends up increasing.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Also, in order to prevent the impeller and the shaft from shifting in the rotation direction, it is preferable for sufficient frictional force to exist between the impeller and the shaft. For that reason, during attachment of the impeller to the shaft, after the impeller makes contact with the seating surface of the shaft, it is preferable to push the impeller further to the shaft side, and cause the impeller to undergo elastic deformation.<br/>
However, after the impeller makes contact with the seating surface, the frictional resistance increases due to the frictional force that works between the impeller and the seating surface, and so the amount of work for pushing in the impeller to the shaft side increases.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">On the other hand, firmly fastening the impeller and the shaft with hardly no rotational movement of the impeller with respect to the shaft is generally performed by using a tension bolt.<br/>
However, in the case of fastening the impeller and the shaft using a tension bolt, complex and large equipment such as a hydraulic tensioner is separately required.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The

In this compressor housing 1b, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, an intake opening 1g that intakes gas, a diffuser 1h that decelerates and compresses the gas that has been accelerated by the compressor impeller 1a, a scroll flow passage 1i that serves as the flow passage of the compressed gas, and a discharge opening that is not illustrated from which the compressed gas is discharged.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The shaft 2 is a member for transmitting power generated by the drive unit 4 as rotative power to the compressor impeller 1a, and is connected with the drive unit 4.<br/>
At a first end of the shaft 2, a fitting projection 2a is provided for fitting in the fitting hole 1e provided in the base portion 1c of the compressor impeller 1a, and by the fitting projection 2a being fitted in the fitting hole 1e, the compressor impeller 1a and the shaft 2 are positioned so as to be coaxial.<br/>
Also, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a female screw that a second end side of the two-way screw 3 is capable of screwing together with is provided in the fitting projection 2a.<br/>
The shaft 2 is formed for example with a steel material (for example, a steel<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> material including chrome and molybdenum).</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The two-way screw 3 is a member for fastening the compressor impeller 1a and the shaft 2. The first end side of this two-way screw 3 serves as an impeller screwing region 3a that is screwed together with the compressor impeller 1a, while the second end side serves as a shaft screwing region 3b that is screwed together with the shaft 2.<br/>
The turning direction of the screw thread that is formed on the impeller screwing region 3a and the turning direction of the screw thread that is formed on the impeller screwing region 3b are opposite directions.<br/>
For this reason, when the two-way screw 3 is turned in one direction, the compressor impeller 1a and the shaft 2 are draw close along the rotation axis L, and when the two-way screw 3 is reversed, the compressor impeller 1a and the shaft 2 separate along the rotation axis L.<br/>
Note that the turning direction of the screw thread that is formed on the impeller screwing region 3a is set to a direction in which the fastening power between the two-way screw 3 and the compressor impeller 1a increases due to a reactive force when the compressor impeller 1a is rotatively driven.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Also, in the first end face of the two-way screw 3 (a face on the compressor impeller 1a side), a fitting hole 3c for fitting a tool 10 for rotating the two-way screw 3 is provided. The shape of this fitting hole 3a is set to a shape, viewed from the rotation axis L direction, whose center of gravity is on the rotation axis L (for example, a hexagonal shape). In this way, by making the shape of the fitting hole 3c have a shape whose center of gravity is on the rotation axis L, when the compressor impeller 1a is rotated, it is possible to keep the weight distribution of the compressor impeller 1a that is<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> centered on the rotation axis L uniform, and it is possible to rotate the compressor impeller 1a in a stable manner.<br/>
Note that the first end face of the two-way screw 3 is exposed by the exposure hole If that is provided in the base portion 1c of the compressor impeller 1a as described above. For this reason, the fitting hole 3c that is formed in the first end face of the two-way screw 3 is exposed from a first end of the compressor impeller 1a via the exposure hole 1f.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Note that as long as the rigidity required for fastening of the compressor impeller 1a and the shaft 2 is ensured, it is preferable for the two-way screw 3 to be formed with a material having a higher thermal conductivity than the compressor impeller 1a.<br/>
Specifically, in the case of for example the compressor impeller 1a being formed with a titanium alloy, it is conceivable for the two-way screw 3 to be formed with a steel material.<br/>
In this way, by forming the two-way screw 3 with a material having a higher thermal conductivity than the compressor impeller 1a, it is possible to promote heat transfer from the compressor impeller 1a, which has risen in temperature due to the compression of gas, to the shaft 2, and it is possible to promptly transfer the heat to lubricating oil that is to be cooled by a cooling mechanism not shown.<br/>
Also, in the case of the two-way screw 3 being formed with a steel material, and the compressor impeller 1a being formed with a titanium alloy, the thermal expansion of the two-way screw 3 becomes greater than the compressor impeller 1a. For that reason, while there is a possibility of the compressor impeller 1a and the shaft 2 separating when the fastening portion becomes a high temperature, when it is possible to reduce the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> temperature change of the fastening portion by cooling through heat transfer enhancement due to the two-way screw 3 as described above, it is possible to reduce the thermal expansion and so possible to prevent separation of the compressor impeller 1a and the shaft 2. For this reason, it is possible to inhibit loosening of the fastening power between for example the compressor impeller 1a and the two-way screw 3.<br/>
Note that in the present embodiment, the two-way screw 3 and the compressor impeller 1a are screwed together, and the two-way screw 3 and the shaft 2 are screwed together. For this reason, the contact surface between the two-way screw 3 and the compressor impeller and the contact surface area between the two-way screw 3 and the shaft 2 broaden, the heat transmission area increases, and it is possible to further promote the aforementioned heat transfer.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The drive unit 4 is a member for generating power for rotatively driving the compressor impeller 1a and transmitting it to the shaft 2, and for example, is constituted to include a motor and gears and the like.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">During assembly of the turbocompressor S1 of the present embodiment having this kind of constitution, when fastening the compressor impeller 1a and the shaft, first the impeller screwing region 3a of the two-way screw 3 is slightly screwed together with the female screw that is provided in the compressor impeller 1a, and the shaft screwing region 3b is slightly screwed together with the female screw that is provided in the shaft 2. Alternatively, the shaft screwing region 3b is slightly screwed together with the female screw that is provided in the shaft 2, and the impeller screwing region 3a is slightly screwed together with the female screw that is provided in the compressor impeller 1a.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the tool 10 (hex wrench) is inserted in the exposure hole 1f that is provided in the base portion 1c of the compressor impeller 1a, and a distal end of the tool 10 is fitted in the fitting hole 3c that is exposed from the first end of the compressor impeller 1a via the exposure hole 1f. Then, by rotating the tool 10, the two-way screw 3 is rotated.<br/>
As a result, the compressor impeller 1a moves in a straight line along the rotation axis L without undergoing rotative movement with respect to the shaft 2. By rotating the two-way screw 3 until the fitting projection 2a is fitted in the fitting hole 1e and the compressor impeller 1a and the shaft 2 are in close contact, the compressor impeller 1a and the shaft 2 are fastened.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In the turbocompressor S 1 of the present embodiment, the compressor impeller 1a and the shaft 2 are fastened by the two-way screw 3, in which the turning direction of the screw thread that is formed on the compressor impeller 1a side and the turning direction of the screw thread that is formed on the shaft 2 side are opposite directions.<br/>
For this reason, by rotating the two-way screw 3, it is possible to cause the compressor impeller 1 a and the shaft 2 to move in a straight line along the rotation axis L direction without the compressor impeller 1a undergoing rotative movement with respect to the shaft 2. That is to say, according to the turbocompressor S 1 of the present embodiment, compared to the case of fastening the compressor impeller 1a and the shaft 2 while rotatively moving the compressor impeller 1a with respect to the shaft 2, it is possible to reduce the amount of movement of the compressor impeller 1a, and it is possible to cut down the amount of work during fastening.<br/>
Also, in the turbocompressor S1 of the present embodiment, since it is possible<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> to fasten the compressor impeller 1a and the shaft 2 without applying great tension to the two-way screw 3, there is no need for an additional complicated and large equipment such as a hydraulic tensioner.<br/>

By adopting this kind of constitution, the amount of movement of the compressor impeller 1a and the amount of movement of the shaft 2 per unit rotation of the two-way screw 3 change. In other words, the rotation amount of the two-way screw 3 with respect to the unit movement amount of the compressor impeller 1a and the shaft 2 differs.<br/>
As a result, when the turbocompressor is running, it is possible to inhibit rotation of the two-way screw 3 when the compressor impeller 1a and the shaft 2 attempt to move in the rotation axis L direction.
