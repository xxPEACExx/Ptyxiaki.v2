The upper revolving structure has a cab, a fuel tank, an operating oil tank and the like mounted on the front side of a revolving frame and has an engine for driving a hydraulic pump, a heat exchanger and the like mounted on the rear part of the revolving frame.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the hydraulic excavator in the conventional art, an exhaust pipe is connected to an exhaust port of the engine. On an outlet side of the exhaust pipe, the exhaust gas post-treatment device accommodating a muffler device and the like for reducing an exhaust noise amount is provided. Here, the engine is supported by a vibration isolating mount on the revolving frame and the exhaust gas post-treatment device is directly mounted<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> on the revolving frame and thus, the engine and the exhaust gas post-treatment device are relatively displaced or vibrated due to vibration caused by the engine and vibration caused by a vehicle body (revolving frame). Thus, in the middle of the exhaust pipe, a single bellows pipe having a bellows shape is provided, and such configuration is realized that relative displacement or vibration (hereinafter relative displacement or vibration is referred to simply as vibration) between the engine and the exhaust gas post-treatment device is absorbed by this bellows pipe (Patent Document 1).</p><heading id="h0003">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT DOCUMENT</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2009035111A"><text>2009-35111 A</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">According to above described Patent Document 1, the single bellows pipe is arranged with inclination to three axes (X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis) on the basis of the exhaust port of the engine. As a result, it is configured that the vibration caused by the engine and the exhaust gas post-treatment device can be absorbed by bending deformation of the bellows pipe.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">On the other hand, the bellows pipe can absorb vibration in various directions by bending of the bellows portion. However, the bellows pipe has its deformable amount (contraction amount) in its length direction (axial direction) small, and vibration absorbing capacity in the length direction is not high. Thus,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> if the single bellows pipe is configured to be arranged with inclination with respect to the three axial directions, the bellows pipe needs to be long to some degree in order to sufficiently absorb the vibration in the three axial directions by the bellows pipe (in order to be able to largely deform the bellows pipe in all the three axial directions). Therefore, in a case where the bellows pipe is made longer, the entire length of the exhaust pipe becomes long, and there are problems that a measure to prevent sympathetic vibration is needed or limitation on freedom in arrangement leads to limitation on the vehicle body on which the exhaust pipe can be mounted and the like.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In view of the above described conventional art problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a construction machine which can improve vibration absorbing performances of the exhaust pipe and moreover, freedom in arrangement of the exhaust pipe can be ensured.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">(1) A construction machine according to the present invention comprises an automotive vehicle body; an engine mounted on the vehicle body and having an exhaust port; an exhaust pipe connected to the exhaust port of the engine; and an exhaust gas post-treatment device provided on the outlet side of the exhaust pipe.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In order to solve the above described problems, the characteristic of the construction adopted in the present invention is that the exhaust pipe has a first bellows pipe located on the engine side and a second bellows pipe located on the exhaust gas post-treatment device side; and the first bellows pipe and the second bellows pipe are configured to be connected in series<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> with a positional relationship in which axis lines thereof cross each other.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">With this arrangement, bending deformation directions of the first bellows pipe and the second bellows pipe can be matched with all the three axial directions of the vehicle body (front-rear direction, left-right direction, and upper-lower direction). Thus, vibration of the engine and the exhaust gas post-treatment device whose vibration modes are different from each other can be stably absorbed by means of bending deformation of at least either (one of or the both) of the first bellows pipe and the second bellows pipe. Thereby, the vibration absorbing performances of the exhaust pipe can be improved, and reliability of the construction machine can be improved.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Moreover, since the directions of bending deformation of the first bellows pipe and the second bellows pipe can be matched with the three axial directions of the vehicle body, the vibration can be stably absorbed without making the length of the bellows pipe longer as in the conventional art, and elongation of the length of the exhaust pipe can be suppressed. Therefore, freedom in arrangement of the exhaust pipe can be ensured, and limitation on the vehicle body on which the exhaust pipe can be mounted can be reduced.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">(2) According to the present invention, the bellows pipe which is one of the first bellows pipe and the second bellows pipe is configured to be arranged in a horizontal direction, while the other bellows pipe of the first bellows pipe and the second bellows pipe is configured to be arranged in a vertical direction.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">With this arrangement, the direction of bending<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> deformation of one of the bellows pipes arranged in the horizontal direction can be matched with the upper-lower direction and the left-right direction of the vehicle body or with the upper-lower direction and the front-rear direction. On the other hand, the direction of bending deformation of the other bellows pipe arranged in the vertical direction can be matched with the front-rear direction and the left-right direction of the vehicle body. As a result, the bending deformation direction of each of the bellows pipes can be matched with all the three axial directions of the vehicle body, and vibration can be stably absorbed.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Moreover, since in the other bellows pipe, its length direction (axial direction) in which deformation is difficult is matched with the vertical direction in which its own weight acts, deformation of itself caused by its own weight can be suppressed. At the same time, in the one bellows pipe arranged in the horizontal direction, too, the bending deformation amount by its own weight can be kept small by the other bellows pipe. As a result, the vibration absorbing performances can be improved while deformation by its own weight is suppressed.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">(3) According to the present invention, a connecting pipe having an L-shaped bending portion is provided between the first bellows pipe and the second bellows pipe. With this arrangement, the one bellows pipe arranged in the horizontal direction and the other bellows pipe arranged in the vertical direction can be connected by the connecting pipe.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">(4) According to the present invention, a length of the other bellows pipe arranged in the vertical direction is set equal<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> to or more than a length of the one bellows pipe arranged in the horizontal direction. As a result, by setting the length of the other bellows pipe subjected to bending deformation in the front-rear direction and the left-right direction longer, the vibration absorbing performances in the front-rear direction and the left-right direction of the vehicle body in which the vibration amount (displacement amount) is larger can be improved.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">(5) According to the present invention, the first bellows pipe is arranged in the horizontal direction and the second bellows pipe is arranged in the horizontal direction with a positional relationship of crossing the first bellows pipe in configuration. With this arrangement, the direction of bending deformation of the one bellows pipe can be matched with the upper-lower direction and the left-right direction of the vehicle body, while the direction of bending deformation of the other bellows pipe can be matched with the upper-lower direction and the front-rear direction of the vehicle body. As a result, bending deformation direction of each of the bellows pipe can be matched with all the three axial directions of the vehicle body, and vibration can be stably absorbed.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">(6) According to the present invention, a connecting pipe having two L-shaped bending portions having different height positions in the upper-lower direction is provided between the first bellows pipe and the second bellows pipe in configuration. With this arrangement, the first bellows pipe and the second bellows pipe arranged in the horizontal direction at different height positions, respectively, can be connected by the connecting pipe.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">(7) According to the present invention, a connecting pipe arranged in the horizontal direction and having an L-shaped bending portion is provided between the first bellows pipe and the second bellows pipe in configuration. With this arrangement, the first bellows pipe and the second bellows pipe arranged in the horizontal direction at the same height, respectively, can be connected by the connecting pipe.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">(8) The construction machine according to the present invention comprises an automotive vehicle body; an engine mounted on the vehicle body and having an exhaust port; a first exhaust pipe connected to the exhaust port of the engine; a first exhaust gas post-treatment device provided on the outlet side of the first exhaust pipe; a second exhaust pipe connected to an exhaust port of the first exhaust gas post-treatment device; and a second exhaust gas post-treatment device provided on the outlet side of the second exhaust pipe.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In order to solve the above described problems, the characteristic of the construction adopted in the present invention is that at least one exhaust pipe in the first exhaust pipe and the second exhaust pipe has a first bellows pipe located on the upstream side with respect to a flow direction of an exhaust gas and a second bellows pipe located on the downstream side of the first bellows pipe; and the first bellows pipe and the second bellows pipe are configured to be connected in series with a positional relationship in which axis lines thereof cross each other.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">With this arrangement, the bending deformation directions of the first exhaust pipe and the second exhaust pipe can be<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> matched with all the three axial directions of the vehicle body, for example.

By bending deformation the second bellows pipe 20 as above, an interval in the left-right direction of the mounting flange portions 17A and 21A on the both end portions of the exhaust pipe 16 can be made smaller. Therefore, the exhaust pipe 16 can be easily assembled between the super charger 9 and the exhaust gas post-treatment device 22 while avoiding interference between the mounting flange portions 17A and 21A on the both end portions of the exhaust pipe 16 and the stud bolts 9C and 22B2.
