The disc 82 in this impeller 81 includes a cylindrical portion 82a and an annular disc portion 82b that are molded integrally. The cylindrical portion 82a is externally fitted to a rotating shaft. The annular disc portion 82b protrudes from a portion at one side (a right side in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>) in an axis line O direction on an outer peripheral surface of the cylindrical portion 82a to an outer side in a radial direction. A plurality of blades 83 are arranged at intervals in a circumferential direction on a surface at the other side (a left side in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>) in the axis line O direction of the annular disc portion 82b. Further, the cover 84 is integrally attached to cover the blades 83 from the other side in the axis line O direction.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> In such an impeller 81, a portion on the other side in the axis line O direction on an inner peripheral surface of the cylindrical portion 82a of the disc 82 is integrally fixed to the rotating shaft by being shrink-fitted to the rotating shaft. As only the portion on the inner peripheral surface of the cylindrical portion 82a is shrink-fitted in this way, attachment and detachment of the impeller 81 to or from the rotating shaft can be easily performed. Further, a shrink fitting place is spaced from a center of gravity of the impeller 81. As a result, it is possible to prevent the impeller 81 from deviating from the rotating shaft due to centrifugal force at the time of rotation.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A scheme of individually molding the disc 82, the blades 83 and the cover 84 and then integrating these members through welding is known as a method of manufacturing the impeller 81. However, in the method of manufacturing the impeller 81, welding distortion, a welding defect or the like may occur.<br/>
In contrast, a manufacturing method of integrally molding the disc 82, the blades 83 and the cover 84 by performing a cutting process on an impeller material as a base material using a machining tool 90 has been proposed.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Further, for example, a method of manufacturing an impeller by diffusion-bonding an inner peripheral side part and an outer peripheral side part that have formed a flow path between blades, in such a manner that the flow paths are connected to each other, has been proposed in Patent Document 1.</p><heading id="h0003">Prior Art Document</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Document</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006"><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><ul><li>Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2004036444A"><text>2004-36444</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Problem to be solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">When the impeller 81 is integrally molded, it is desirable to shorten a processing time. Accordingly, when the impeller 81 shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref> is integrally molded, it is desirable for the machining tool 90 to be able to easily access a place of the impeller material that becomes the flow path between the blades 83. However, in the impeller 81 of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>, it is difficult to perform processing for a desired shape due to the machining tool 90 interfering with portions of the impeller material that become the cylindrical portion 82a of the disc 82 and the cover 84. Accordingly, processing requires a lot of time and effort, which causes an increase in manufacturing cost.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In contrast, for example, a configuration shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7</figref> is considered to improve a characteristic of access of a machining tool 90 to a flow path. In other words, a cylindrical portion 82a of a disc 82 is molded to extend to one side in an axis line direction from an annular disc portion 82b. Further, a portion at the one side in the axis line direction on an inner peripheral surface of the cylindrical portion 82a becomes a shrink fitting place. However, in this case, the shrink fitting place approaches a position of a gravity center of the impeller 81 in comparison with the impeller 81 shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>. As a result, it is necessary to increase the thickness in a radial direction of the shrink fitting place for withstanding centrifugal force, which causes an increase in cost.<br/>
Furthermore, it may be considered to space a position of the shrink fitting place<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> further from the center of gravity by further extending the cylindrical portion 82a to the one side in the axis line direction is considered. In this case, however, for example, in a centrifugal compressor including plural stages of impellers 81, the rotating shaft lengthens and the rigidity of the shaft decreases.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Meanwhile, in the impeller disclosed in Patent Document 1, the accessibility of the machining tool to both the inner peripheral side part and the outer peripheral side part is high. However, it is necessary to form flow paths in both the inner peripheral side part and the outer peripheral side part and perform diffusion bonding so that the flow paths communicate with each other. This causes an increase in manufacturing cost.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention has been made in view of such problems and an object of the present invention is to provide an impeller capable of suppressing manufacturing cost to be low.</p><heading id="h0007">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention provides the following means in order to solve the above problems.<br/>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, an impeller includes an inner peripheral side part and an outer peripheral side part, wherein the inner peripheral side part is formed in a cylindrical shape around an axis line; and the outer peripheral side part includes an annular disc externally fitted to a portion at one side in the axis line direction in an outer peripheral surface of the inner peripheral side part, a plurality of blades that are provided at intervals in a circumferential direction on a surface that faces<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the other side in the axis line direction of the annular disc and form a flow path extending in a radial direction, and a cover that covers the plurality of blades from the other side in the axis line direction and has an insertion hole into which the inner peripheral side part is inserted in the axis line direction at an interval in a radial direction. The outer peripheral side part is configured the annular disc, the blades and the cover are integrally molded.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In such an impeller according to the first aspect, since the inner peripheral side part is formed in a cylindrical shape, it is possible to easily mold the inner peripheral side part through a cutting process. Further, the outer peripheral side part has a configuration in which the blades are provided at the other side in the axis line direction of the annular disc, and the cover is further provided at the other side in the axis line direction of the blade. Accordingly, in a step before the outer peripheral side part is externally fitted to the inner peripheral side part, there is nothing in inner sides in the radial direction of the blade and the flow path. Thus, it is possible for the machining tool to easily access the blades and the flow path formed between the blades from an inner side in the radial direction.<br/>
Further, through only a process of externally fitting the annular disc of the outer peripheral side part to the inner peripheral side part, the inner peripheral side part and the annular disc constitute the disc, thereby obtaining the impeller including the disc, the blades and the cover.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Further, according to a second aspect of the present invention, in the impeller, the annular disc is externally fitted to the inner peripheral side part through shrink fitting.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> It is possible to perform the fitting more firmly by fitting the outer peripheral side part to the inner peripheral side part through shrink fitting. Further, it is possible to achieve a reduction of cost in comparison with, for example, a case in which diffusion bonding or the like is performed.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Further, according to a third aspect of the present invention, in the impeller, an edge portion rising in a cylindrical shape from an inner side in a radial direction thereof to the other side in the axis line direction is provided in the cover, and an introduction portion of a fluid to the flow path is formed of the edge portion and an outer peripheral surface of the inner peripheral side part.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the third aspect of the present invention, the introduction portion to the flow path is formed of the edge portion of the cover and the outer peripheral surface of the inner peripheral side part. As a result, it is possible to smoothly guide a fluid to the flow path between the blades.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the impeller according to a fourth aspect of the present invention, at least a portion of a fitting portion of the inner peripheral side part and the annular disc of the outer peripheral side part is formed in a step shape.<br/>
With this configuration, it is possible to easily determine positions in the axis line direction of the inner peripheral side part and the outer peripheral side part.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the impeller according to a fifth aspect of the present invention, at least a portion of the fitting portion of the inner peripheral side part and the annular disc of the outer peripheral side part is formed in a tapered shape.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> -->With this configuration, surface pressure of the fitting portion can be constant. Accordingly, it is possible to maintain the center of gravity of the impeller at an appropriate place and avoid backlash or the like at the time of rotation.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Further, in the impeller according to a sixth aspect of the present invention, a key member that fixes the inner peripheral side part and the outer peripheral side part to each other is interposed in the fitting portion of the inner peripheral side part and the annular disc of the outer peripheral side part.<br/>
With this configuration, it is possible to more firmly fix and integrate the inner peripheral side part and the outer peripheral side part.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to a seventh aspect of the present invention, a rotor includes any one of the above impellers; and a rotating shaft to which a portion at the other side in the axis line direction of the inner peripheral surface of the inner peripheral side part of the impeller is externally fitted.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">With this configuration, in the rotor, since only a portion of the inner peripheral surface of the inner peripheral side part is externally fitted to the rotating shaft, attachment and detachment of the impeller to or from the rotating shaft can be easily performed.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to an eighth aspect of the present invention, in the rotor, the inner peripheral side part is externally fitted to the rotating shaft through shrink fitting.<br/>
As a result, it is possible to more firmly attach the rotor to the rotating shaft.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> According to a ninth aspect of the present invention, a rotor is a rotor including any one of the above impellers, and a rotating shaft that rotates integrally with the impeller, wherein the inner peripheral side part of the impeller is integrally molded with the rotating shaft.<br/>
In this case, it is unnecessary to perform a task of fixing the inner peripheral side part to the rotating shaft. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the number of work processes when the rotor is formed.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to a tenth aspect of the present invention, a impeller manufacturing method is a method of manufacturing an impeller including an inner peripheral side part and an outer peripheral side part, the method including steps of: molding the inner peripheral side part that is in a cylindrical shape around an axis line; integrally molding the outer peripheral side part including an annular disc capable of being externally fitted to a portion at one side in the axis line direction in an outer peripheral surface of the inner peripheral side part, a plurality of blades that are provided at intervals in a circumferential direction on a surface that faces the other side in the axis line direction of the annular disc and form a flow path extending in a radial direction, and a cover that covers the plurality of blades from the other side in the axis line direction and has an insertion hole into which the inner peripheral side part is inserted in the axis line direction at an interval in the radial direction; and fixing and integrating the inner peripheral side part and the outer peripheral side part by externally fitting the annular disc to a portion of the inner peripheral side part at the other side in the axis line direction.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">With the impeller manufacturing method having such a characteristic, it is<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> possible to easily mold the inner peripheral side part due to its simple shape. It is also possible for a machining tool to easily access the blades and the flow path in the outer peripheral side part.

A rotor 1 is, for example, a member used for a rotary machine such as a compressor or a turbine. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the rotor 1 has a configuration in which an impeller 10 is integrally attached to an outer peripheral side of a rotating shaft 2. The rotating shaft 2 is a member having a cylindrical shape extending in an axis line O direction and being rotatable around the axis line O. The impeller 10 is a member that sends a fluid flowing in the axis line O direction to an outer side in a radial direction.<br/>
Hereinafter, a right side in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is referred to as "one side in the axis line O direction" and a left side of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is referred to as "the other side in the axis line O direction." This one side in the axis line O direction is the downstream side of the fluid. Further, the other side in the axis line O direction is the upstream side of the fluid.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The impeller 10 includes two members: an inner peripheral side part 20 and an outer peripheral side part 30.<br/>
The inner peripheral side part 20 is formed in a substantially cylindrical shape around the axis line O. An outer peripheral surface 21 of the inner peripheral side part 20 includes a small-diameter portion 22, an enlarged-diameter portion 23 and a<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> large-diameter portion 24.<br/>
The small-diameter portion 22 is a portion including an end portion at the other side in the axis line O direction in the outer peripheral surface 21 of the inner peripheral side part 20. The enlarged-diameter portion 23 is a portion which is located continuously to the one side in the axis line O direction of the small-diameter portion 22 and whose diameter is gradually increased toward the one side in the axis line O direction. Further, the large-diameter portion 24 is a portion which is arranged continuously to the one side in the axis line O direction of the enlarged-diameter portion 23 and includes an end portion of the one side in the axis line O direction in the outer peripheral surface 21 of the inner peripheral side part 20. The diameter of the large-diameter portion 24 is slightly greater than that of the small-diameter portion 22.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Further, an inner peripheral surface 25 of the inner peripheral side part 20 includes a first inner peripheral surface 26 and a second inner peripheral surface 27. The first inner peripheral surface 26 is a portion including an end portion at the other side in the axis line O direction in the inner peripheral surface 25 of the inner peripheral side part 20, i.e., a portion corresponding to the small-diameter portion 22 of the outer peripheral surface 21. The inner diameter of the first inner peripheral surface 26 is set to be slightly smaller than the outer diameter of the outer peripheral surface 21 of the inner peripheral side part 20. The second inner peripheral surface 27 is a portion that is located continuously to the one side in the axis line O direction of the first inner peripheral surface 26 in the inner peripheral surface 25 of the inner peripheral side part 20 and includes an end portion at the one side in the axis line O direction of the inner peripheral surface 25. Further, an inner diameter of the second inner peripheral surface 27 is set to a size such that the rotating shaft 2 can be inserted.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The outer peripheral side part 30 is a member in which the annular disc 31, the blades 40 and the cover 50 have been integrally molded.<br/>
The annular disc 31 is a disc-shaped member formed around the axis line O. A fitting hole 32 penetrating in the axis line O direction is formed in a center of gravity of the annular disc 31. This fitting hole 32 is formed to have an inner diameter equal to or slightly smaller than the outer diameter of the large-diameter portion 24 of the inner peripheral side part 20. Further, a dimension in the axis line O direction of the fitting hole 32 is substantially equal to a dimension in the axis line O direction of the large-diameter portion 24 of the inner peripheral side part 20.<br/>
Further, a surface directed in the other side in the axis line O direction of the annular disc 31 has a curved surface 33 that gradually retreats toward the one side in the axis line O direction from an inner side to an outer side in the radial direction.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">A plurality of blades 40 are provided to rise from the curved surface 33 of the annular disc 31 to the other side in the axis line O direction. Each blade 40 extends over an entire area in a radial direction of the annular disc 31. Specifically, each blade 40 extends to be curved in one direction in a circumferential direction from an inner side to an outer side in the radial direction. Such a plurality of blades 40 are provided at intervals in the circumferential direction. Further, a space between the blades 40 adjacent in the circumferential direction becomes a flow path R through which a fluid flows.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The cover 50 is a member arranged to cover the plurality of blades 40 from the other side in the axis line O direction and is provided integrally with the blades 40. This<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> cover 50 includes a main body 51 of the cover and an edge portion 52. The main body 51 of the cover is formed in a disc shape around the axis line O. An insertion hole 53 penetrating in the axis line O direction is formed in a center of gravity of the main body 51 of the cover. The edge portion 52 is formed to rise in a cylindrical shape from an inner side in the radial direction of the main body 51 of the cover to the one side in the axis line O direction so that the insertion hole 53 extends to the one side in the axis line O direction. The insertion hole 53 is formed to have an inner diameter greater than the outer diameter of the outer peripheral surface 21 of the inner peripheral side part 20.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In the outer peripheral side part 30 including the annular disc 31, the blades 40 and the cover 50 as described above, there are no other components at inner sides in the radial direction of an end portion at an inner side in the radial direction of the blade 40 and an end portion at an inner side in the radial direction of the flow path R formed between the blades 40. Accordingly, in the outer peripheral side member 30, the blade 40 and the flow path R face the axis line O.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Further, in the present embodiment, the impeller 10 is formed such that the outer peripheral side part 30 is externally fitted to the inner peripheral side part 20 through shrink fitting. Specifically, in the outer peripheral side part 30, the fitting hole 32 thereof is externally fitted to the large-diameter portion 24 in the outer peripheral surface 21 of the inner peripheral side part 20. Further, as the fitting hole 32 is fitted to the large-diameter portion 24, a fitting portion 60 between the inner peripheral side part 20 and the outer peripheral side part 30 is formed.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">As the inner peripheral side part 20 and the outer peripheral side part 30 are<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> fitted in this way, the annular disc 31 of the outer peripheral side part 30 and the inner peripheral side part 20 are fixed and integrated. A disc 61 in the impeller 10 is formed of the inner peripheral side part 20 and the annular disc 31 that have been integrated. Further, an introduction portion 62 is formed among the small-diameter portion 22 of the outer peripheral surface 21 of the inner peripheral side part 20, the enlarged-diameter portion 23 and an inner peripheral surface of the insertion hole 53 in the cover 50 of the outer peripheral side part 30. The introduction portion 62 is formed to guide a fluid to the flow path R between the blades 40.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Further, in the impeller 10, the first inner peripheral surface 26 in the inner peripheral surface 25 of the inner peripheral side part 20 is externally fitted to the outer peripheral surface 3 of the rotating shaft 2. Particularly, in the present embodiment, as the first inner peripheral surface 26 is shrink-fitted to the outer peripheral surface 3 of the rotating shaft 2, the impeller 10 with the inner peripheral side part 20 and the rotating shaft 2 are firmly fixed and integrated to thereby form the rotor 1.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Next, a method of manufacturing the impeller 10 will be described.<br/>
First, the inner peripheral side part 20 is molded. This inner peripheral side part 20 is molded by cutting a bloom material of an elongated cylindrical shape formed of carbon steel to make a disc-shaped member and performing a cutting process on the disc-shaped member using a machining tool.<br/>
Further, the outer peripheral side part 30 is molded separately from molding of the inner peripheral side part 20. This outer peripheral side part 30 is molded by performing the cutting process on a disc-shaped member using the machining tool, similar to the inner peripheral side part 20.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Then, the outer peripheral side part 30 and the inner peripheral side part 20 are fixed and integrated by fitting the outer peripheral side part 30 to the inner peripheral side part 20 by shrink fitting. In other words, for example, the fitting hole 32 of the outer peripheral side part 30 is heated to increase the diameter of the fitting hole 32. In this state, the inner peripheral side part 20 is arranged into the fitting hole 32 of the outer peripheral side part 30. Further, the fitting hole 32 is cooled to decrease the diameter thereof and brought into close contact with the large-diameter portion 24 of the inner peripheral side part 20. Accordingly, the outer peripheral side part 30 and the inner peripheral side part 20 are integrally fixed. Thus, it is possible to obtain the impeller 10 of the present embodiment.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Further, the impeller 10 is externally fitted to the rotating shaft 2 through shrink fitting using the following method, thereby obtaining the rotor 1. First, the first inner peripheral surface 26 in the inner peripheral side part 20 of the impeller 10 is heated to increase the diameter of the insertion hole 53. In this state, the rotating shaft 2 is inserted into the first inner peripheral surface 26 and the second inner peripheral surface 27. The first inner peripheral surface 26 is then cooled to decrease the diameter. Accordingly, the first inner peripheral surface 26 is brought into close contact with the outer peripheral surface 3 of the rotating shaft 2 to thereby integrally fix the impeller 10 and the rotating shaft 2. Thus, it is possible to obtain the rotor 1 of the present embodiment.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">As described above, in the impeller 10 of the present embodiment, the inner peripheral side part 20 is formed in a cylindrical shape. Accordingly, it is possible to<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> easily mold the inner peripheral side part 20 by performing the cutting process on the disc-shaped member.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Further, in the outer peripheral side part 30, the blades 40 are provided at the other side in the axis line O direction of the annular disc 31, and the cover 50 is further provided at the other side in the axis line O direction of the blade 40. Accordingly, in a step before the outer peripheral side part 30 is externally fitted to the inner peripheral side part 20, there is nothing in inner sides in the radial direction of the blade 40 and the flow path R. Thus, it is possible for the machining tool to easily access the blades 40 and the flow path R formed between the blades 40 from an inner side in the radial direction. As a result, for example, it is possible to integrally mold the outer peripheral side part 30 using a machining tool such as a five-axis cutting apparatus.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Further, in the present embodiment, it is possible to obtain the impeller 10 including the disc 61, the blade 40 and the cover 50 only by fitting the inner peripheral side part 20 and the outer peripheral side part 30 as described above. Accordingly, it is possible to shorten the manufacturing time and reduce the manufacturing cost.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Further, the fitting of the outer peripheral side part 30 and the inner peripheral side part 20 is performed by the shrink fitting. Accordingly, it is possible to further strengthen the fitting of both of the parts. In addition, it is possible to decrease the manufacturing cost in comparison with, for example, a case in which both of the parts is joined through diffusion bonding.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Further, the introduction portion 62 to the flow path R is formed of the edge<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> portion 52 of the cover 50 and the outer peripheral surface 21 of the inner peripheral side part 20. Accordingly, it is possible to smoothly guide a fluid to the flow path R between the blades 40, for example, when the impeller 10 is applied to a compressor. It is also possible to suppress an increase in manufacturing cost since it is unnecessary to provide a separate member or the like in order to form the introduction portion 62.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Further, in the impeller 10 according to the present embodiment, only a portion of the inner peripheral surface 25 of the inner peripheral side part 20 is externally fitted to the rotating shaft 2. Accordingly, it is possible to easily perform attachment and detachment of the impeller 10 to or from the rotating shaft 2. Furthermore, particularly, the first inner peripheral surface 26 externally fitted to the rotating shaft 2 is arranged in the one side in the axis line O direction of the inner peripheral surface 25 of the inner peripheral side part 20. Accordingly, it is possible to space a fitting position from a center of gravity position of the impeller 10. As a result, it is possible to reduce the influence of the centrifugal force at the time of rotation of the rotor 1 and avoid the impeller 10 deviating from the rotating shaft 2 due to the centrifugal force.<br/>
Further, in the present embodiment, the inner peripheral side part 20 of the impeller 10 is externally fitted to the rotating shaft 2 by shrink fitting. Accordingly, it is possible to attach the impeller 10 to the rotating shaft 2 more securely.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">While the embodiment of the present invention has been described above in detail, the present invention is not limited thereto and some design changes may be made without departing from the technical scope and spirit of the present invention.<br/>
For example, as a first modified example of the present embodiment, a fitting portion 60 of an inner peripheral side part 20 and an outer peripheral side part 30 may be<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> formed in a step shape, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. In other words, in the first modified example, a diameter of a large-diameter portion 24 of the inner peripheral side part 20 is reduced by one step in an arbitrary position directed from the other side to the one side in the axis line O direction, thereby forming an inner peripheral side step portion 71 toward the one side in the axis line O direction. Further, the diameter of the large-diameter portion 24 of the inner peripheral side part 20 is reduced by one step in an arbitrary position directed from the other side to the one side in the axis line O direction, thereby forming an outer peripheral side step portion 72 toward the other side in the axis line O direction. Further, when the inner peripheral side part 20 and the outer peripheral side part 30 are fitted to each other, the outer peripheral side step portion 72 and the inner peripheral side step portion 71 contact each other.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Accordingly, positions in the axis line O direction of the inner peripheral side part 20 and the outer peripheral side part 30 can be uniformly determined. Thus, it is possible to easily perform positioning in the axis line O direction when the inner peripheral side part 20 and the outer peripheral side part 30 are fitted.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Further, for example, as a second modified example of the embodiment, a fitting portion 60 of an inner peripheral side part 20 and an outer peripheral side part 30 may be formed in a tapered shape, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>. In other words, in this second modified example, a large-diameter portion 24 of the inner peripheral side part 20 is formed in a tapered shape in which a diameter of the large-diameter portion 24 is gradually decreased toward the one side in the axis line O direction. Further, a fitting hole 32 of the outer peripheral side part 30 is formed in a tapered shape in which a diameter of the fitting hole 32 is gradually decreased toward the one side in the axis line O direction. Angles of the<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> tapers of the large-diameter portion 24 and the fitting hole 32 are equal to each other.<br/>
Accordingly, since a surface pressure of the fitting portion 60 can be constant, a center of gravity of the impeller 10 can be maintained on an appropriate place. As a result, it is possible to avoid backlash or the like at the time of rotation.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Further, for example, as a third modified example of the embodiment, a key member 73 that fixes an inner peripheral side part 20 and an outer peripheral side part 30 to each other may be interposed in a fitting portion 60 of the inner peripheral side part 20 and the outer peripheral side part 30, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>. Accordingly, the inner peripheral side part 20 and the outer peripheral side part 30 can be more firmly fixed and integrated.<br/>
Furthermore, the fitting portion 60 of the inner peripheral side part 20 and the outer peripheral side part 30 may be formed by appropriately combining the first to third modified examples.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Further, the inner peripheral side part 20 and the outer peripheral side part 30 may be fixed and integrated, for example, through spline joining as well as the above structure, or may be fixed and integrated through welding.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Further, to show, for example, as a fourth modified example of the embodiment, an inner peripheral side part 20 may be integrally formed with a rotating shaft 2, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5</figref>. In this case, when the rotating shaft 2 is cut out through a cutting process, the inner peripheral side part 20 and the rotating shaft 2 are integrally molded by forming the inner peripheral side part 20 on an outer peripheral surface 3 of the rotating shaft 2. As a result, it is possible to reduce the number of work processes when the<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> rotor 1 is formed since it is unnecessary to perform a task of fixing the inner peripheral side part 20 to the rotating shaft 2.</p><heading id="h0011">Industrial Applicability</heading><p id="p0053" num="0053">According to the present invention, it is possible to integrally mold the inner peripheral side part and the outer peripheral side part.
