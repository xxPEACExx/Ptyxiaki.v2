claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/445,988, filed February 23, 2011, which is incorporated by reference herein. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0005" num="0005"> The invention relates to cell culture media optimized for exposure to ultraviolet C (UVC) light exposure and methods related thereto. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> Sterilization of cell culture media that will be used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products is an important step as part of a process to produce high quality pharmaceutical products to prevent bioburden. This is typically achieved by sterilizing grade filtration (0.2 or 0.1 micron absolute rated filters). Mycoplasma and viral contamination of cellular media and supernatants also poses a large challenge to biopharmaceutical manufacturers worldwide. Several methods have been employed to inactivate and/or remove large or small, enveloped or non-enveloped (or "naked") DNA or RNA viral particles from solutions. Examples of these approaches include filtration(nano, viral or 0.1 micron), chromatography, batch heat treatment, flow-through High Temperature Short Term (HTST), gamma irradiation, low pH and chemical inactivation (solvents, detergents), and batch or flow-through ultraviolet light C (UVC). HTST is a proven method for the control of viruses, however, it has adverse effects on cell culture media that contain proteinaceous components such as serum. Additionally, chemical treatments to inactivate viral particles have been used, although the frequently toxic nature of these chemicals limits their use in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Moreover, HTST requires dedicated and integrated infrastructure 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 in a plant, which can be a consideration when contemplating the manufacture of pharmaceutical and therapeutic agents. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> In addition to the above techniques, UVC technology has been used to treat large-scale protein preparations prior to the purification of these proteins from cellular supernatants. See, for example, U.S. Patent Appl. Publ. No. 20100203610A1. UVC technology relies on the property of light in the ultraviolet wavelength range of the spectrum to disrupt the DNA/RNA of the unwanted organism. The intensity of the UVC treatment, considered to be the UVC dose, is dictated by the intensity of the light flux and the time the liquid is exposed to the UVC light source. The UVC dose provided needs to be sufficient for effective inactivation of the desired organisms, but must not be too high as to disrupt the components of the solution necessary for a robust process including target protein production and quality. Although UVC treatment of media is an effective means for viral inactivation, the present inventors have found that cells grown with media that has been exposed to UVC light prior to growth produce protein titers that are reduced as compared to media that has not been exposed to UVC light. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> Thus, there is a need in the art for a UVC treatable cell culture media, and methods for treating cell culture media with UVC for use in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Such methods can be particularly useful for protecting valuable cell lines from viral contamination, saving costs lost as a result of contaminated and unusable media, and increasing the efficiency of protein production by such cell lines. Accordingly, the development of such methods can have wide application in the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> Provided herein is a cell culture media comprising (a) a base media that is exposed to UVC light; and (b) an additive package comprising UV sensitive media components that is added to said base media after UVC exposure.

Unless otherwise defined herein, scientific and technical terms used in connection with the present invention shall have the meanings that are commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022"> The present invention addresses the need in the art for a UVC treatable cell culture media. Several obstacles had to be overcome in developing the novel formulations and methods of the present invention. Starting with the original media, the formulation of a stable, new base media was attempted by removing the UV sensitive components from the original media. Quite unexpectedly, however, it was found that removing the UV sensitive components from the original media led to certain instability and solubility issues in both the new base media that does not comprise UV sensitive components, and the additive package comprising UV sensitive components. </p><p id="p0023" num="0023"> The inability to predict the behavior of the separated mixtures derives from chemical interactions among and between the numerous constituents within the mixtures. More specifically, the solubility problem with the additive package is thought to be derived from an interaction of protons in the self buffering systems. Further, an instability problem with the new base media and additive package could have also been derived from other interactions, such as through reactive oxygen species which can be produced by exposure to UVC radiation. </p><p id="p0024" num="0024"> Unexpectedly, it was found that that the additive package was not stable. The additive package was not originally soluble or thermally stable when it was removed from the original base media. In order to regain the stability similar to the original media, it was necessary to adjust the pH of the mixture by adding titrant to make it soluble and stable. </p><p id="p0025" num="0025"> A further unexpected observance was related to an interaction in the new base media that does not comprise UV sensitive components when treated with 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
 UV, resulting in damage to key components of the base media. This damage would not have been predicta ble because components in the additive package ordinarily quench the reactive species in the original media, thereby protecting it from UV. Nonlimiting examples of potential quenchers not present in the new base media because they were placed in the additive package include pyridoxal and pyridoxal. Nonlimiting examples of quenchers remaining in the new base media which could have been damaged due to the a bsence of additional quenchers include pyruvate. Nonlimiting examples of key components remaining in the new base media which could have been damaged due to the a bsence of additional quenchers include fetal calf serum proteins. </p><p id="p0026" num="0026"> Surprisingly, however, the additive package is self-sta bilizing in certain aspects like a complex mixture (e.g., the original base media). The natural pH of the additive package is approximately 6.7, which is approximately the same as the base media. </p><p id="p0027" num="0027"> An additional unexpected effect is related to the type of UVC reactor and related dose distribution. Several process UVC reactors, e.g., laminar or thin-film reactors, produce a wide dose distribution, typically with a high dose tail. The new media receives this wide distribution (and overexposure), but it is surprisingly not damaged significantly as evidenced by the titer remediation. Previous studies used a helical UVC reactor which produces a tight dose distribution as compared to a thin-film reactor. These studies showed that UVC treatment results in decreased titer (product concentration). When the original media was thin-film UVC treated, the result was total process failure, i.e., a complete lack of attachment of cells to roller bottles and a lack of cell growth. </p><p id="p0028" num="0028"> Accordingly, in one aspect the invention provides a cell culture media suita ble for UVC exposure, wherein said media comprises a base media and an additive package comprising UV sensitive media components that is added to the base media after UVC exposure. In a further aspect, the invention further provides a method for making a UVC exposed cell culture media formulation, said

 method comprising the steps of formulating a base media, exposing the base media to UVC light, and adding an additive package comprising UV sensitive components to the UVC exposed base media. In another aspect the invention further provides a method for producing a protein, said method comprising the steps of exposing a base media to UVC light, adding an additive package comprising UV sensitive media components to the UVC exposed base media, and culturing cells in the UVC treated media such that a desired protein is produced. </p><p id="p0029" num="0029">UV-sensitive Media Components </p><p id="p0030" num="0030"> As will be discussed further herein below, cell culture media comprises many different components that support cell proliferation in an in vitro setting. It has been found that certain media components are sensitive to UVC light and degrade when exposed to UVC light. This in turn leads to reduced protein production from the cell culture. To overcome this deleterious impact to the protein product titer observed with UVC treatment of cell culture media, a new base media that is suitable for UVC exposure is required. Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide a base media that does not comprise the UV sensitive components, and an additive package that comprises UV sensitive components. As used herein, "base media" refers to a liquid, powdered, or other form of cell culture media that does not comprise certain UV sensitive components. As used herein, "additive package" refers to a liquid, powdered, or other form of UV sensitive component(s) to be added to the base media after the base media has been exposed to UVC light. </p><p id="p0031" num="0031"> In one embodiment, the base media is in a powdered form and the additive package is in a powdered form.

Such methods according to this aspect of the invention comprise (a) obtaining a mammalian cell to be infected with a virus; (b) contacting the cell with a virus under conditions suitable to promote the infection of the cell by the virus; and (c) cultivating the cell in the culture media of the invention under conditions suitable to promote the production of virus by the cell. According to the invention, the cell may be contacted with the virus either prior to, during or following cultivation of the cell in the culture media of the invention; optimal methods for infecting a mammalian cell with a virus are well-known in the art and will be familiar to one of ordinary skill. Virus-infected mammalian cells cultivated in suspension in the media of the invention may be expected to produce higher virus titers (e.g., 2-, 3-, 5-, 10-, 20-, 25-, 50-, 100-, 250-, 500-, or 1000-fold higher titers) than those cells not cultivated in suspension in the media of the invention.

In a continuous culture, for example, fresh culture medium supplement (i.e., feeding medium) is provided to the cells during the culturing period, while old culture medium is removed daily and the product is harvested, for example, daily or continuously. In continuous culture, feeding medium can be added daily and can be added continuously, i.e., as a drip or infusion. For continuous culturing, the cells can remain in culture as long as is desired, so long as the cells remain alive and the environmental and culturing conditions are maintained. </p><p id="p0066" num="0066"> In batch culture, cells are initially cultured in medium and this medium is not removed, replaced, or supplemented, i.e., the cells are not "fed" with new medium, during or before the end of the culturing run. The desired product is harvested at the end of the culturing run. </p><p id="p0067" num="0067"> For fed-batch cultures, the culturing run time is increased by supplementing the culture medium one or more times daily (or continuously) with fresh medium during the run, i.e., the cells are "fed" with new medium ("feeding medium") during the culturing period. Fed-batch cultures can include the various feeding regimens and times as described above, for example, daily, every other day, every two days, etc., more than once per day, or less than once per day, and so on. Further, fed-batch cultures can be fed continuously with feeding medium. The desired product is then harvested at the end of the culturing/production run.

 According to the present invention, cell culture can be carried out, and glycoproteins can be produced by cells, under conditions for the large or small scale production of proteins, using culture vessels and/or culture apparatuses that are conventionally employed for animal or mammalian cell culture. As is appreciated by those having skill in the art, tissue culture dishes, T-flasks and spinner flasks are typically used on a laboratory scale. For culturing on a larger scale (e.g., 500 L, 1000L, 2000L, 5000 L, 10000 L and the like), procedures including, but not limited to, a fermentor type tank culture device, an air lift type culture device, a fluidized bed bioreactor, a hollow fiber bioreactor, roller bottle culture, a stirred tank bioreactor systems, a packed bed type culture device, or any other suitable devise known to one skilled in the art can be used. Microcarriers may or may not be used with the roller bottle or stirred tank bioreactor systems. The systems can be operated in a batch, continuous, or fed- batch mode. In addition, the culture apparatus or system may or may not be equipped with a cell separator using filters, gravity, centrifugal force, and the like. </p><p id="p0068" num="0068">In one em bodiment, the cell culture base media is exposed to UVC light and then stored until needed, at which time, the additive package will be added to the UVC exposed base media prior to use in cell culture.
