transthyretin amyloidosis, pharmaceutical composition for use in said treatment or prevention, as well as to a diagnostic method and a kit. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0005" num="0005"> Transthyretin (TTR) is a functional plasma protein composed of four 14 kDa subunits. TTR is synthesized mainly by the liver and functions as a transporter for retinol and thyroxine. In addition to its physiological functions, TTR is found as a main constituent of amyloid fibrils in several distinct clinical forms of amyloidoses, including familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), familial cardiac amyloidosis and sporadic senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA). SSA is caused by the selective deposition of wildtype (VVT) TTR fibrils in cardiac tissue, affecting almost 25% of the population above 80 years of age. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006"> Around 100 amino acid mutations of TTR have been linked to familial forms of TTR amyloidoses. Studies have shown that TTR forms amyloid through a process that is initiated by tetramer destabilization. The destabilization results in accumulation of monomers which can misfold and aggregate into fibrillar structures. Considerable effort has been devoted to studying the amyloidogenicity of TTR mutations related to the familial forms of the disease, though the majority of TTR-related amyloidosis is represented by sporadic cases caused by aggregation and deposition of the otherwise stable VVT protein. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> Heparan sulfate (HS), a sulfated polysaccharide consisting of repeating units of glucosamine and glucuronic acid, is associated with amyloid deposits in a number of amyloidoses. Although accumulating evidence suggests that HS plays an important part in amyloid deposition, the precise role of HS in the pathology of amyloidosis remains unresolved. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> Thus a need remains in the art for elaborating the role of HS in TTR amyloidosis, as well as for developing medicaments therefore. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> The present invention is based studies, wherein co-deposition of HS with TTR in the cardiomyopathic heart was detected by immunohistochemical stainings. In vitro studies revealed that HS and heparin promoted TTR 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 fibrillogenesis, an effect that correlated with the degree of sulfation of the polysaccharide, and was exerted through a specific binding sequence on TTR. This promoting effect was further examined in a Drosophiia model that expresses human TTR. Thus, interaction of TTR with heparin/HS is size- dependent and selective, with a preference for polysaccharides with higher degrees of sulfation. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> The present invention provides a method of diagnosing TTR amyloidosis. The method comprises the steps of (a) providing a sample of a bodily fluid from a human subject, (b) determining the concentration of TTR in said bodily fluid, (c) determining said human subject as suffering from or at high risk of developing TTR amyloidosis, if the TTR concentration determined in step (b) is higher than in a control sample. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> The present invention also provides a kit for use in the above diagnostic method, comprising an anti-TTR antibody, and one or more reagents for detecting the expression level of TTR in a sample of a bodily fluid. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> The present invention further provides a method of preventing, alleviating and/or treating transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis in a patient in need thereof by administering an efficient amount of an agent capable of interfering with the interaction of TTR and heparan sulfate (HS). </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> Furthermore, the present invention relates to a medical use of an agent capable of interfering with the interaction between HS and TTR for preventing, alleviating and/or treating TTR amyloidosis. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"> Still further, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an agent capable of interfering with the interaction between HS and TTR, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> Specific embodiments of the invention are set forth in the dependent claims. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017"> Other objects, embodiments, details and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following drawings, detailed description and examples. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES </p><p id="p0019" num="0019"> In the following the invention will be described in greater detail by means of preferred embodiments with reference to the attached figures, in which </p><p id="p0020" num="0020"> Figure 1 shows microscopic images demonstrating co-localization of</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">TTR amyloid and HS in the heart of cardiomyopathy.

TTR (50 μΜ) was dissolved in phosphate-citric acid buffer at the pH-value as indicated and incubated at 37°C for 48 h. After incubation the samples were analyzed for their fibril content using ThT fluorescence (A). Fibril formation was only detected in the samples incubated at pH 2.7, in a much smaller amount (200 AU) in comparison with the samples incubated in the presence of heparin (8000 AU; Fig. 3A) at the same pH. TTR (500 μΜ) was incubated under the same conditions as above and were analyzed by native-PAGE (B). The strong bands migrated to the bottom of the gel represent mono- and di-mers. </p><p id="p0023" num="0023"> Figure 3 shows the effect of heparin and HS on WT TTR aggregation. (A, B) The TTR dissolved in phosphate buffer (50 μΜ, pH 2.7) was incubated alone or with different heparin or HS (12 μΜ) at 37°C for 48 h. After incubation the samples were mixed with ThT and fluorescence was measured. Data shown represent triplicate experiments (means±SEM). (C) TTR (500 μΜ) incubated with heparin (0, 5 or 20 μΜ) under the same conditions were analyzed with native-PAGE as described in Methods.

The radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. </p><p id="p0025" num="0025"> Figure 5 shows an analysis of heparin incubated with pre- aggregated TTR. TTR dissolved in phosphate buffer (pH 2.7) was incubated without heparin at 37°C for 48h. Heparin (mixture of <sup>3</sup>H-labeled and nonlabeled) was then added and the TTR-heparin sample was incubated for an additional hour at 37°C. The sample was thereafter separated by native- PAGE and the gel was cut into 6 sections as illustrated in Figure 4A. Radioactivity in each section was measured by scintillation counting. Data represents triplicate experiments (mean ± SEM). </p><p id="p0026" num="0026"> Figure 6 demonstrates HS/heparin binding to TTR at mild acidic conditions. (A) Dissociated TTR was immobilized onto a Biacore sensor chip and heparin (10 μΜ) was allowed to interact with the immobilized TTR in neutral or in mildly acidic conditions. (B) HS II (10 μΜ) binding to TTR at different pH was monitored and the response for each sample is expressed as response units (RU). The experiment was repeated three times and the graph shows a representative result. (C) TTR (50 μΜ) incubated with heparin or HS II for 7 days at pH 5.0 or pH 7.4 was analyzed by ThT fluorescence. Data represent triplicate experiments (means±SEM). </p><p id="p0027" num="0027"> Figure 7 demonstrates the binding affinity of heparan sulfate (HS) and heparin for TTR. Dissociated TTR was immobilized onto a Biacore sensor chip. Heparin (A), HS II (B) or HS I (C) were injected in a concentration series (ranging from 0.001 -70 μΜ) over the surface at pH 5.0. The response for each concentration was measured at the steady-state region of the curve. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was calculated by plotting the response at steady-state for each concentration versus heparin/HS concentration. The data were fitted to the equation: Response = (Rmax <sup>*</sup>C)/(KD+C), where C is the concentration of heparin/HS. Two analyte flow rates (20 and 30 μΙ/min) were tested to assess possible effects of mass transport limitations in the system. Altering the flow rate had no significant effect on the obtained KD-value, indicating that mass transport effects were not a limiting factor in the assay. The presented values are average value of three independent experiments. (D) Thioflavin T (50 μΜ) injected over the surface immobilized with dissociated TTR resulted in no binding. In contrast, Thioflavin T injection over the surface immobilized with aggregated TTR revealed significant binding.

(B) Equal mole of TTR-peptides or full-length protein (with or without acidic dissociation), were incubated with <sup>3</sup>H- labeled heparin (1500 cpm) at pH 5.0. The amount of <sup>3</sup>H-labeled heparin bound to the peptides was analyzed using a nitrocellulose-filter trapping method. </p><p id="p0028" num="0028"> Figure 9 shows SPR analysis of TTR peptides binding to heparin. Heparin was immobilized onto a Biacore sensor chip (CM5) using the surface thiol coupling kit (GE Healthcare). Peptides derived from regions on the TTR sequence (Fig. 5A) containing a histidine residue (24-35, 51 -61 and 84-94), were allowed to interact with the heparin surface at pH 5.0 (peptide cone. 25 pg/ml; flow rate 20 μΙ/min). In consistence with the result analyzed by the nitrocellulose filter-binding assay (Fig. 5B), only the peptide of aa 24-35 interacted with heparin (red). </p><p id="p0029" num="0029"> Figure 10 shows reduced HS binding activity to native TTR. (A) Equal amount of dissociated or native protein was immobilized onto a Biacore sensor chip and HS II was allowed to interact with the immobilized TTR at pH 5.0. (B) The values of the HS II -TTR interaction signal were obtained by repeated experiments using three chips with different ligand densities (250- 3000 RU). The signals were normalized to a ligand density of 1000 RU and average value is shown. Statistical analysis was done by t test. </p><p id="p0030" num="0030"> Figure 1 1 shows the effect of HS on TTR fibril formation in cell culture. Dissociated TTR was added to WT (CHO-WT) and HS-deficient (CHO- pgsD-677) cells and cultured for 48 hr.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0041" num="0041"> The present invention is based on studies aimed at determining whether heparin/heparan sulfate (HS) plays a role in the pathogenesis of transthyretin (TTR) -related amyloidosis. </p><p id="p0042" num="0042"> Immunohistological examination of a heart specimen from a patient diagnosed with amyloid cardiomyopathy revealed substantial HS accumulation with TTR amyloid deposits (Figure 1 ), although some of the TTR positive signals, largely in vessel walls, did not overlap with HS. This finding of a high degree of HS-TTR co-localization prompted us to explore the potential functions of HS in TTR amyloidosis. To address this question, we employed recombinant human WT TTR to assess its aggregation in the absence or presence of heparin/HS by in vitro and in vivo experiments. </p><p id="p0043" num="0043"> It has been established that TTR aggregation/amyloidosis is initiated by dissociation of the native tetramers, generating unstable monomers that spontaneously form oligmers. In agreement with earlier reports, we confirmed dissociation of the recombinant WT TTR upon incubation at pH 2.7, as analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Formation of amyloid-like fibrils was quantified by ThT fluorescence staining and the formation of oligomers was assessed by native-PAGE. We found that the WT TTR spontaneously aggregated to some extent upon incubation at 37°C for 48 h at pH 2.7, but not at higher pH (Figure 2). However, prolonged incubation under mildly acidic conditions resulted in aggregation of the TTR (Figure 6C), indicating altered kinetics of TTR aggregation at different pH conditions. Without being limited to any theory, this may reflect the in vivo situation, where repeated shortage of oxygen supply in a cardiomyopathic heart provides an acidified environment that may facilitate TTR aggregation. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="11"/>-->
 Addition of heparin, a commonly used analogue of HS, greatly promoted TTR fibrillization at pH 2.7 and 5.0 (Figure 3A and 6C). Notably, inclusion of heparin resulted in a differential pattern of TTR aggregates as demonstrated by native-PAGE analysis. Substantial quantities of macromolecules remained at the top of the gel reflecting a reduction or absence of oligomeric species (Figure 3C). It is possible that heparin altered the rate of monomer/oligomer fibril assembly, or redirects the aggregation pathway. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044"> The finding that heparin is incorporated into the TTR fibrils (Figure 4) suggests that HS/heparin can play a scaffold role, 'collecting' misfolded TTR monomers and being incorporated into the fibrils. Without being limited to any theory, this may reflect the in vivo TTR-HS aggregation where HS on the cell surface or in the extracellular matrix functions as a scaffold/catalyst to promote accumulation and aggregation of the unfolded TTR monomers. The scheme in Figure 15 illustrates this hypothesis of HS-mediated TTR fibrillization. </p><p id="p0045" num="0045"> HS also promoted TTR fibrillogenesis, but to a lower degree compared to heparin (Figures 3A and 3B), in agreement with a recent report. Interestingly, the promoting ability of HS is associated with degree of sulfation. HS I that contains 5% trisulfated disaccharides had a marginal effect on TTR aggregation, while the highly sulfated HS II, containing 45% of the trisulfated component, had a stronger effect on TTR aggregation. A comparison of the TTR binding to heparin or the two HS preparations revealed that the difference in affinity was correlated with sulfation degree. TTR displayed a 10-fold higher affinity for heparin when compared to HS II and more than a 1000-fold higher affinity when compared to low sulfated HS I (Figure 7). However, previous results have shown that chondroitin sulfate fails to promote aggregation of amyloid peptides, suggesting that the fine structure of HS is also important for the effect. </p><p id="p0046" num="0046"> Intriguingly, the degree of HS sulfation has been reported to be age- dependent, as HS in the aorta of elderly individuals was found to be more sulfated than HS from young subjects. Concomitantly, aortic deposition of amyloid has been found in all investigated subjects above 80 years of age. This may suggest an association of age-dependent alteration in HS sulfation with aortic amyloidosis. Whether the high incidence of WT TTR amyloidosis in the heart of elderly is associated with a similar alteration of HS structure remains to be determined. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"/>-->
 A long-asked question is why WT TTR forms amyloid, despite its well-demonstrated thermodynamic stability. To this end, our results showing that the sequence of aa 24-35 in WT TTR binds effectively to heparin may offer an explanation. In the native form of TTR this peptide is cryptic (Figure 13) and incapable to interact with HS. When the protein is dissociated, the sequence becomes exposed, facilitating the interaction with HS. The basic property of the peptide, having 3 basic amino acids in close proximity (31 -HVFRK-35), accommodates binding to the negatively charged HS/heparin through electrostatic interaction. This is of interest as similar HS/heparin binding motifs have been identified for other amyloid peptides, such as amyloid-beta (13- HHQK-16) and serum amyloid A (34-KYFHARGN-41 ). </p><p id="p0047" num="0047"> Moreover, our finding that heparin binds better to the WT peptide (aa 24-35) than to the corresponding peptide containing the V30M mutation (associated with familial amyloid polyneuropathy) (Figure 8B) may suggest a potential mechanism for the so far poorly understood phenomenon that V30M mutant and WT TTR displays a difference in tissue-specific deposition. Whether this different deposition pattern is correlated to the HS-binding property of WT v.s mutant TTR should be further investigated. Examination of HS structures from the amyloid deposits of WT and V30M TTR could be valuable to establish a correlation of TTR deposition with tissue-specific HS expression. </p><p id="p0048" num="0048"> Furthermore, we wanted to know whether the effect of HS/heparin on TTR fibrillization could be reproduced in a cell model. Incubation of the TTR with WT CHO cells that express HS generated substantial amounts of amyloid- like fibrils; in comparison, the HS-deficient CHO-pgsD-677 cells only produced minor amounts of fibrils (Figure 1 1 ). This result, combined with the strong TTR immunostaining in CHO-WT cells, clearly demonstrates a potential role for cellular HS in TTR fibrillization. This effect has further been demonstrated in a Drosophila model that expresses an amyloidogenic TTR. Feeding the animals with heparin promoted formation of TTR amyloid-like fibrils, a result not observed in the flies fed with heparin fragments (Klexane®). Correspondingly, immunohistostaining with antibodies against TTR and HS confirmed the co- deposition of TTR and heparin. </p><p id="p0049" num="0049"> It should be noted that the 18-mer heparin fragment (Mr of 4,500 Da) promoted the in vitro TTR aggregation better than full-length heparin (Figure 3A), while Klexane® (with an average Mr of 4,500 Da) failed to 
<!-- EPO <DP n="13"/>-->
 promote TTR fibrillization in vivo. Without being limited to any theory, this apparent discrepancy may be due to the molecular heterogeneity of Klexane®.The smaller fragments in the preparation may have interfered with TTR aggregation in the fly model; while the heparin 18-mer used in in vitro experiment is a homogenous preparation. In fact, low molecular weight heparin and heparin-like fragments have previously been shown to inhibit amyloidogenesis of SAA and amyloid-beta peptide. This raises the possibility that an optimal size of heparin will be able to interfere with the TTR-HS interaction, and attenuate TTR aggregation. </p><p id="p0050" num="0050"> The finding suggests that HS may play dual roles in modulating the</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">TTR metabolism. The HS expressed on the cell surface, such as macrophages, promote internalization of the monomeric form of TTR to prevent its aggregation (Fig. 19); the HS expressed on extracellular matrix may function as a scaffold to transfer the toxic oligomers formed to more stable fibrils. (Fig. 20). </p><p id="p0052" num="0052"> In summary, information about pro-amyloidogenic factors in WT TTR fibrillization is scarce. As the majority of TTR-related amyloidosis is sporadic cases caused by WT TTR deposition, understanding the pathologic mechanisms of WT TTR deposition is of valuable for prevention and treatment of SSA. Our data provide the first evidence of codeposition of HS with WT TTR in a cardiomyopathic heart, and illustrates a proamyloidogenic role for HS/heparin in TTR aggregation through selective binding to a specific domain of TTR. The results suggest a potential mechanism by which HS influences TTR aggregation/amyloidosis in the heart of the elderly population. The findings are consistent with reports involving other amyloid precursors, and collectively may assist in the design of potential therapeutic agents for amyloid associated diseases. </p><p id="p0053" num="0053"> Based on the present findings, TTR amyloidosis including, but not limited to, familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), familial cardiac amyloidosis, and sporadic senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA) may be prevented, alleviated, ameliorated and/or treated by interfering with the interaction of HS with TTR. This may be achieved by administering to a human patient in need of such prevention, alleviation, amelioration and/or treatment an efficient amount a HS/heparin-derived fragment or mimetic, a TTR-derived peptide or a modified peptide or an anti-TTR antibody having the ability to interfere with the interaction between HS and TTR.

 By an "efficient amount" of an agent capable of interfering with the interaction between HS and TTR is meant a level in which the harmful effects of TTR are, at a minimum, ameliorated. In other words, an efficient amount of such an agent is one that is sufficient to block, or partially block, the binding of HS with TTR, where such binding is harmful or undesired. Amounts and regimens for the administration of agents capable of interfering with the interaction between HS and TTR can be determined readily by those with ordinary skill in the clinical art of treating amyloidoses. Generally, the dosage of such interfering agents will vary depending on considerations such as: age, gender and general health of the patient to be treated; kind of concurrent treatment, if any; frequency of treatment and nature of the effect desired; extent of tissue damage; duration of the symptoms; and other variables to be adjusted by the individual physician.

Sulfated Alcian blue staining of the adjacent section revealed a pattern that resembles the Congo red positive morphology (Fig. 1 B). Double immunostaining confirmed that TTR deposition is largely co-localized with HS (Fig. 1 C, D and E). In comparison, staining of heart sections from an age- matched control did not produce immunosignals for TTR (Fig. 1 F). The codeposition of TTR and HS was prominent in the extracellular space and appeared tightly associated with myocyte membranes, whereas the co- deposition in the vasculature was more variable with some vessel walls lacking HS positive staining (Fig. 1 C and E). No TTR deposition or HS accumulation was detected in the control tissues (Fig. 1 F).

 Heparin and HS promote fibrillization of WT TTR </p><p id="p0093" num="0093"> Thioflavin T fluorescence analysis revealed that the recombinant human WT TTR expressed in a bacterial system exhibited very low spontaneous fibrillization upon incubation at 37°C for 48 h, even at low pH (2.7) condition (Fig. 2). However, addition of heparin (an analogue of HS) at this condition prompted TTR aggregation, forming substantial amounts of amyloid-like fibrils (Fig. 3A). Incubation of TTR with heparin-derived oligomers revealed a size dependence effect of heparin, as fragments (12-mer and 6- mer) less than 18-sugar residues had considerably lower effects than longer polymers. Notably, TTR incubated with an 18-mer resulted in more amyloidlike fibrils compared to the TTR incubation with full-length heparin (~50-mer). HS with higher degrees of sulfation (HS II) enhanced the fibrillization of TTR effectively, albeit to a lesser degree compared to heparin, whereas low sulfated HS (HS I) had a marginal effect on TTR aggregation (Fig. 3B). </p><p id="p0094" num="0094"> Analysis of the TTR incubated with or without heparin by native-</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">PAGE showed that the TTR-heparin aggregate displayed a different migration pattern. In contrast to the continuous smear appearance of the TTR aggregates without heparin, co-incubation with heparin resulted in substantial macromolecular TTR aggregates migrating in the top of the gel, apart from the non-aggregated band observed prior to incubation, representing mono-, di- and tetramers (Fig. 3C). This effect of heparin on TTR aggregation is more pronounced at higher concentrations, suggesting a dose-dependent effect. The TTRheparin incubation generated Congo red positive fibrils as visualized under fluorescence and polarized light microscopy (Fig. 3D), while the TTR incubated without heparin was Congo red negative. </p><p id="p0096" num="0096"> To determine whether heparin was integrated/co-fibrillized into the resulting TTR fibrils or only acted as a catalyst for the fibrillogenesis, TTR was incubated with a mixture of <sup>3</sup>H-labeled and unlabeled heparin. The samples of co-incubated heparin-TTR and heparin alone were separated on native-PAGE. Alcian blue staining visualized a heparin migration pattern that was indistinguishable between the two samples (Fig. 6A). Analysis of <sup>3</sup>H-labeled heparin by counting the radioactivity in the gel sections (cut as illustrated in Fig. 6A) show that heparin incubated alone was mainly recovered in sections 4, 5 and 6 (Fig. 6B), in accord with the Alcian blue staining. In contrast, heparin co-incubated with TTR was substantially recovered in section 1 (the stacking section), in addition to sections 4, 5 and 6. Notably, Alcian blue failed to stain 
<!-- EPO <DP n="24"/>-->
 the heparin in section 1 for the heparin-TTR co-incubated sample, possibly due to a masking effect by the resulting TTR amyloid-like fibrils. </p><p id="p0097" num="0097"> To verify that the heparin recovered in section 1 is not a result of heparin interacting with aggregated TTR, 3H-labeled heparin was incubated with pre-aggregated TTR. Analysis of the product by the same method showed a distribution pattern of <sup>3</sup>H-labeled heparin (Fig. 5) that it is almost identical to that of heparin alone (Fig. 4B), indicating that no or very little heparin interacted with aggregated TTR. </p><p id="p0098" num="0098">Characterization of TTR-heparin/HS interaction </p><p id="p0099" num="0099"> To further investigate the mechanism for the TTR-heparin/HS interaction, we applied surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. Dissociated TTR was immobilized onto a Biacore sensor chip and heparin was allowed to interact with the ligand at neutral (pH 7.4) and mildly acidic (pH 5.0) conditions. Heparin binding to dissociated TTR was observed in mildly acidic pH, but not in the neutral condition, demonstrating a pH-dependency for the interaction (Fig. 6A). The pH-dependent interaction was also observed for HS II (a HS species with higher sulfation degree) that displayed substantial binding at pH 5.0, but significantly reduced binding at pH 5.5 (Fig. 6B). The SPR spectroscopy analysis also showed that sulfation degree of HS/heparin plays a role in this interaction, as affinity of TTR for heparin is 10-fold higher than for HS II, and more than 1000-fold higher than for the low sulfated HS I (Fig. 7A, B and C). This pH and sulfation degree dependent interaction was further confirmed by measuring fibril formation of TTR incubated with heparin and HS II at pH 5.0 and 7.4 for 7 days (Fig. 6C). </p><p id="p0100" num="0100"> To characterize the TTR-heparin interaction, we incubated TTR and its peptide fragments with <sup>3</sup>H-heparin. The binding was analyzed by a nitrocellulose-filter trapping method (18). Among the 16 peptides tested, only the peptide of aa 24-35 (PAINVAVHVFRK) bound to heparin (Fig. 8B). This heparin-binding peptide contains three basic amino acids, including a histidine that likely contributed to the pH dependency seen in the TTR-heparin/HS interaction. This selective binding propy was further verified by SPR analysis (Fig. 9). The 24-35 peptide containing the V30M mutation, which is associated with familial amyloid neuropathy, showed substantially lower binding to heparin compared to the WT peptide (Fig. 8B). </p><p id="p0101" num="0101"> From the binding assay, we noticed that heparin preferentially bound to dissociated TTR (Fig. 8B).

 dissociated and native TTR on to Biacore chips and injected HS II over the surface at pH 5.0. The obtained sensorgrams revealed stronger binding of HS II to dissociated TTR (Fig. 10). These results suggest that the heparin/HS binding domain of TTR is cryptic in the natively folded protein. HS/Heparin promotes fibrillization of TTR in cell culture and in vivo </p><p id="p0102" num="0102"> To investigate whether the effect of HS/heparin in TTR fibrillization is also applicable to cells, the dissociated TTR was incubated with cultures of Chinese hamster ovary WT (CHO-WT) and HS-deficient (CHO-pgsD-677) cells (19) for 48h. After incubation the cells were washed extensively in PBS to remove free TTR. ThT fluorescence analysis of the cell lysates revealed substantial amounts of amyloid-like fibrils in the CHO-WT cells compared to that in the HS-deficient CHO-pgsD-677 cells (Fig. 1 1 A), demonstrating an effect of HS on TTR fibrillization. Immunocytostaining of the cells with anti-TTR antibody detected trace amounts of positive immunosignals in the HS-deficient cells (CHO-pgsD-677); in comparison, strong positive signals were found in CHO-WT cells (Fig. 1 1 B). </p><p id="p0103" num="0103"> To evaluate the effect of heparin on TTR fibrillization in vivo, we employed a transgenic Drosophila model that expresses an engineered mutant form of human TTR (16, 20). The transgenic flies were reared on standard media supplemented with or without heparin or low molecular weight heparin (Klexane©). ThT fluorescence analysis of the fly head lysate extracted in saline (see Methods) showed that flies fed with heparin supplement generated ThT-positive amyloid-like fibrils, whereas flies given no additive or Klexane© did not generate any fibrils (Fig. 12A). To corroborate the observation of substantial fibril formation in the fly head fed with heparin, the head lysate was analyzed by dot-blot stained with Alcian blue (Fig. 12B). Strong staining in the head lysate from flies fed with heparin was observed, whereas no staining was detected in the corresponding samples from control- or Klexane fed flies. Immunohistostaining of sections prepared from the head of TTR-transgenic flies cultured on heparin-supplemented medium revealed TTR- and heparin co- staining in the retina (Fig. 15D; E, 3D-view of TTR and heparin co-deposited material). Neither sections prepared from transgenic flies reared on regular medium (Fig. 15F), nor sections prepared from nontransgenic flies reared on heparin-supplemented medium (Fig. 15G), showed co-staining for TTR and heparin in the retina.
