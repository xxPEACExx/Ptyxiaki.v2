Then, the outer tube is retracted proximally so as to release and expand the stent, whereby the stent can be put indwelling in the lesion part. In the stent delivery system having the stent and the catheter of this kind, there are cases where, for example, the outer tube and the inner tube are inserted into a winding lumen of a living body and are advanced into a lesion part. In this case, the space provided between the outer tube and the inner tube may cause bending and buckling of the outer tube.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In view of this, there has been known, as for example disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2002525168T"><text>JP-T-2002-525168</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2006525834T"><text>JP-T-2006-525834</text></patcit>, a stent delivery system wherein a coiled spring is provided between an outer tube and an inner tube so that the outer tube can be supported when the outer tube and the inner tube are bent in a lumen of a living body.</p><heading id="h0003">Summary of Invention</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the stent delivery system disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2002525168T"><text>JP-T-2002-525168</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2006525834T"><text>JP-T-2006-525834</text></patcit>, however, both ends of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the coiled spring are connected (fixed) to the proximal end (base end) of the stent and the inner tube. When the inner tube and the outer tube are bent, therefore, the spring provided inside cannot follow up to the bending, so that stress concentration would occur at the contact point where the spring makes contact with the inner circumferential surface of the outer tube. As a result, the bent outer tube cannot be evenly supported by the spring. In addition, kinking (sharp bending) may take place, with the contact point between the bent outer tube and the spring as a starting point. In such a situation, the distal ends of the outer tube and the inner tube of the stent delivery system cannot be delivered into a desired portion in a lumen of a living body.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is a general object of the present invention to provide a stent delivery system such that an outer tube can be prevented from kinking, and the outer tube and an inner tube can be assuredly delivered into a desired portion in a lumen of a living body.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention provides a stent delivery system including: an inner tube; a stent which is disposed on a distal-side outer surface of the inner tube<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> by being compressed in the direction toward a center axis when inserted into a lumen of a living body, and which can be restored into a pre-compression shape by expanding outward when put indwelling in the lumen of the living body; and an outer tube which can contain the stent in an inner lumen thereof by being disposed on the outer surface side of the inner tube, and which can release the stent to the exterior by moving in a proximal direction relative to the inner tube,<br/>
wherein a reinforcing member movable in axial and radial directions is provided between the outer tube and the inner tube on the proximal side relative to the stent.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the present invention, in a stent delivery system for putting a stent indwelling in a lumen of a living body, a reinforcing member is provided at a position on the proximal side relative to the stent, between an inner tube and an outer tube which is disposed on the outer surface side of the inner tube and which can contain the stent in an inner lumen thereof. In this case, the reinforcing member is so provided as to be movable in the axial and radial directions within the space between the inner tube and the outer tube.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Accordingly, even in the case where the outer tube and the inner tube are inserted into a lumen of a living body and where the outer tube and the inner tube are bent according to the path of the lumen, the reinforcing member moves in the axial and radial directions within the space between the outer tube and the inner tube according to the bent state of the tubes, and, simultaneously, deforms elastically so as to be bent. As a result, the inner circumferential surface of the outer tube thus bent is substantially evenly supported by the moved and deformed reinforcing member, so that kinking (sharp bending) of the outer tube inside the lumen can be prevented from occurring. Therefore, the distal ends of the outer tube and the inner tube can be assuredly advanced to a desired portion in the lumen of the living body, and the stent can be delivered into the desired portion.</p><heading id="h0004">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>]<br/>

The inner tube 12 is composed of a tubular body, the distal end and the proximal end of the first distal tube 24 and the first proximal tube 28 are each opening, and the distal end of the first distal tube<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> 24 is so disposed as to protrude from the distal end of the outer tube 14. Incidentally, the above-mentioned guide wire 20 is used, for example, for guiding the stent delivery system 10 to a lesion part in a lumen of a living body.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The inner tube 12 is so set that the proximal end of the first distal tube 24 and the distal end of the first proximal tube 28 are connected to each other through the connecting member 26 in the inside of the outer tube 14. In addition, the first proximal tube 28 has a lumen 32 penetrating from the distal end to the proximal end thereof, and a liquid such as physiological saline is injected into the lumen 32 through the connector 30.

As a result, in the case where a stress in the moment direction corresponding to a lower torsional rigidity is applied, the spring shows a greater deformation, which would be attended by a larger deformation of the outer tube.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">As above-mentioned, in the case where the reinforcing spacer 52 is formed in a mesh form, it is ensured that in whatever moment direction may a stress be applied on the outer tube 14 and the reinforcing spacer 52, the amount of deformation of the outer tube 14 is suppressed favorably. As a result, the outer tube 14 and<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> the inner tube 12 can be advanced assuredly and smoothly into the lesion part in the lumen of the living body. In other words, the torsional rigidity is not varied depending on the direction of the moment force applied on the outer tube 14 and the reinforcing spacer 52, and a stable torsional rigidity can be obtained when a stress is applied in any of the clockwise direction (the direction of arrow H) and the counterclockwise direction (the direction of arrow J).</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Furthermore, in the case where the reinforcing spacer 52 is formed from an elastic resin material or the like, it is ensured that when the inner tube 12 and the outer tube 14 are bent, the reinforcing spacer 52 is elastically deformed in the same manner as the tubes. Therefore, the reinforcing spacer 52 would not hamper movements of the inner tube 12 and the outer tube 14; naturally, this is favorable.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Incidentally, the stent delivery system according to the present invention is not restricted to the above-described embodiment, and, naturally, various configurations can be adopted without departure from the gist of the invention.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977544" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A stent delivery system comprising: an inner tube (12); a stent (16) which is disposed on a distal-side outer surface of the inner tube (12) by being compressed in the direction toward a center axis when inserted into a lumen of a living body, and which can be restored into a pre-compression shape by expanding outward when put indwelling in the lumen of the living body; and an outer tube (14) which can contain the stent (16) in an inner lumen thereof by being disposed on the outer surface side of the inner tube (12), and which can release the stent (16) to the exterior by moving in a proximal direction relative to the inner tube (12),<br/>
