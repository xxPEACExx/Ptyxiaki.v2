The present invention also relates to an in-wheel motor drive system that may be associated with a drive wheel of a vehicle that may be an electric vehicle. The present invention also relates to a method of controlling a motor unit.</p><heading id="h0004">(Description of Related Art)</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">An electric vehicle may experience degradation in performance or malfunctions of a motor serving as a drive for the vehicle. This can significantly affect the travel performance or travel safety. Reliability of a motor, a wheel bearing and a reducer is an urgent concern for an in-wheel motor drive system which, due to its smaller size, has less materials used, involves rapid rotation of the motor, and etc.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A battery-powered electric vehicle may include a drive system which may be in the form of an in-wheel motor drive system. The drive system may employ an IPM (e.g., Interior Permanent Magnet synchronous motor). Such an IPM may include a neodymium magnet to provide a highly efficient performance,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> thus increasing the maximum travel range that is possible with a limited battery capacity.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the past, in the attempt to ensure such reliability, an in-wheel motor drive system has been proposed in which the temperature of components such as a wheel bearing, a reducer and a motor may be measured and monitored for overload, with features to limit a drive current in/to the motor or a rotational frequency of the motor according to the temperature measurements (see the Patent Document 1 listed below).

In the presence of such abnormal short-circuit, power may be generated in the motor. The generated power may become a braking force for the vehicle. When a vehicle is traveling at a high speed, its motor is undergoing rapid rotation. If abnormal short-circuit of the motor coils occurs under such a circumstance, this may give rise to various driving problems: for example, it may lead to a situation where driving of the vehicle is suddenly impossible. Another problem is that abnormal short-circuit of motor coils may result in constant application of a braking force to a motor. Towing of such a vehicle with another vehicle would be quite difficult.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide an electric vehicle, an in-wheel motor drive system, and a method of controlling a motor unit, which can achieve early detection of abnormal short-circuit of motor coils, thus avoiding various driving problems. The general aspects of the present invention will now be described using the reference signs in the figures showing embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention may provide an electric vehicle which includes a motor unit 6 configured to drive a wheel 2. The motor unit 6 includes a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> synchronous motor with three-phase motor coils 78. The three-phase motor coils 78 include a first motor coil, a second motor coil and a third motor coil of different phases. One end of the first motor coil, one end of the second motor coil and one end of the third motor coil are connected with each other at a neutral point P1 in a star connection. The electric vehicle also includes an ECU 21 which is an electronic control unit configured to perform general control of the vehicle. The electric vehicle also includes an inverter unit 22. The inverter unit 22 includes a power circuitry 28 including an inverter 31 configured to convert a DC power from a battery unit 19 into an AC power used to drive the motor unit 6, and also includes a motor control circuitry 29 configured to control at least the power circuitry 28 in accordance with control from the ECU 21. The electric vehicle also includes an abnormal short-circuit monitor 95 configured to detect an abnormal short-circuit of the motor coils 78, and also includes an abnormalities-responsive disconnection unit Es configured to electrically disconnect the motor coils 78 from the neutral point P1.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A synchronous motor with three-phase motor coils 78, where the three-phase motor coils 78 include a first motor coil, a second motor coil and a third motor coil of different phases, may be configured such that one end of the first motor coil, one end of the second motor coil and one end of the third motor coil is connected with each other at a neutral point P1 in a star connection. If an abnormal short-circuit of the motor coils 78 occurs during rotation of a motor unit, an abnormally large current may flow in the motor coils. This may result in sudden braking of rotation of the motor unit.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Hence, the abnormal short-circuit monitor 95 may continuously monitor if there is an abnormal short-circuit of the motor coils 78. The abnormalities-responsive disconnection unit Es may electrically disconnect the motor coils 78 from the neutral point P1, if the abnormal short-circuit monitor 95 detects an abnormal short-circuit of the motor coils 78. Continuously monitoring if there is an abnormal short-circuit of the motor coils 78 allows for<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> early detection of abnormal short-circuit in a motor unit 6, and electrically disconnecting the motor coils 78 from the neutral point P1 if such an abnormal short-circuit is detected can prevent sudden braking of rotation of the motor unit 6. This enables avoiding a situation where driving of a vehicle is suddenly impossible.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As noted above, the disconnection occurs at the neutral point P1. In this way, if abnormal short-circuit occurs in any at least one of the first motor coil, the second motor coil and the third motor coil (U, V, W) of the three-phase motor coils 78, it is ensured that the rotational frequency of the motor unit 6 does not become undesirably high due to such short-circuit. If, in contrast, disconnection of the first motor coil, the second motor coil and the third motor coil was designed to occur between the inverter 31 and the motor unit 6, it would be unable to avoid braking of the motor unit 6 that may be caused by short-circuit of the motor coils. This is because, for example, a permanent magnet structure present in a motor rotor would generate, in response to such short-circuit of the motor coils, an electromotive force in the motor coils, thus creating a current flow in the coils. The phrase "abnormal short-circuit" used herein not only refers to a complete short-circuit but also encompasses at least some level of short-circuiting of current. Determination of whether there is at least some level of short-circuiting of current may be made based on a threshold that can be appropriately selected.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The abnormal short-circuit monitor 95 may be configured to determine if there is an abnormal short-circuit of the motor coils 78, based on measurements of supply currents of three phases that flow from the inverter 31 to the motor unit 6. The abnormal short-circuit monitor 95 may be configured to determine that there is an abnormal short-circuit of the motor coils 78, if a motor current for a given motor voltage exceeds a motor current threshold defined for the given motor voltage. This is because it can be estimated that there is a short-circuit in the motor unit 6, if a motor current for a given motor voltage is<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> abnormally high. In a variant, the abnormal short-circuit monitor 95 may be configured to determine if there is an abnormal short-circuit of the motor coils 78, based on the level of variation among supply currents of three phases. A motor current for a given motor voltage may be determined in advance through experiments and/or simulations, and the values of a motor current at which abnormal short-circuits of the motor coils 78 occurred may be used as the aforementioned "motor current threshold". Where appropriate, a safety factor may be incorporated into the values of a motor current at which abnormal short-circuits of the motor coils 78 occurred, and the resulting values may be used as the aforementioned "motor current threshold".</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The abnormalities-responsive disconnection unit Es may comprise a relay or an electronic switch. In such a case, one end of the first motor coil, one end of the second motor coil and one end of the third motor coil of the motor coils 78, may be connected with each other through the respective relays or electronic switches. The other end of the first motor coil, the other end of the second motor coil and the other end of the third motor coil of the motor coils 78, may be connected with the inverter 31.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The inverter unit 22 or the ECU 21 may include the abnormal short-circuit monitor 95. With a configuration where the inverter unit 22 includes the abnormal short-circuit monitor 95, the abnormal short-circuit monitor 95 that may detect an abnormal short-circuit of the motor coils 78 is positioned closer to the motor unit 6 than with a configuration where the ECU 21 includes the abnormal short-circuit monitor 95, thus the former configuration being more advantageous in terms of wire routing. Also, with a configuration where the inverter unit 22 includes the abnormal short-circuit monitor 95, an appropriate control can be initiated more quickly than with a configuration of the ECU 21 including the abnormal short-circuit monitor 95, thus promptly avoiding various driving problems. Furthermore, with the former configuration, the load<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> on the ECU 21, whose complexity is increasing hand-in-hand with its sophistication, can be reduced.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In a configuration where the inverter unit 22 includes the abnormal short-circuit monitor 95, the inverter unit 22 may also include an abnormalities notifier 41 configured to send information indicating an abnormal short-circuit to the ECU 21, if the abnormal short-circuit monitor 95 detects an abnormal short-circuit of the motor coils 78. The ECU 21 performs general, integrated control of the vehicle. Thus, by sending information indicating an abnormal short-circuit to the ECU 21 if the abnormal short-circuit monitor 95 included in the inverter unit 22 detects an abnormal short-circuit of the motor coils 78, the ECU 21 can correspondingly perform an appropriate control of the vehicle in general. Also, the ECU 21 is an upper-level control unit which may send a drive command to the inverter unit 22. Thus, an urgent control performed by the inverter unit 22 may be followed by a more appropriate control of drive which is performed by the ECU 21.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">An electric vehicle according to the present invention may further include an in-wheel motor drive system 8 which includes a wheel bearing unit 4, the motor unit 6 and a reducer unit 7 interposed between the motor unit 6 and the wheel bearing unit 4. Reliability of the wheel bearing unit 4, the reducer unit 7 and the motor unit 6 is an urgent concern for an in-wheel motor drive system 8 which, due to its smaller size, has less materials used, involves rapid rotation of the motor unit 6, and etc. Continuously monitoring if there is an abnormal short-circuit of the motor coils 78 of a motor unit 6 allows for early detection of abnormal short-circuit in the motor unit 6, and electrically disconnecting the motor coils 78 from the neutral point P1 if such an abnormal short-circuit is detected can prevent sudden braking of the motor unit 6. This enables avoiding a situation where driving of a vehicle is suddenly impossible.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">An electric vehicle according to the present invention may further include a reducer unit 7 configured to produce rotation with a speed that is<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> reduced with respect to that of rotation of the motor unit 6, wherein the reducer unit 7 may comprise a cycloidal reducer. Such a configuration in which the reducer unit 7 comprises a cycloidal reducer having, for example, a reduction ration of 1/6 or greater, allows for the provision of a smaller motor unit 6, thus achieving reduction in dimensions of the system or assembly. A reducer unit having a significant reduction ratio, while making it possible to achieve reduction in dimensions of the system or assembly as noted above, accompanies significant amplification of torque generated by a motor unit 6 which will be transmitted to the wheel 2. This may result in abrupt braking of the vehicle when abnormal short-circuit of the motor coils 78 occurs. The provision of an abnormal short-circuit monitor 95 can prevent such abrupt braking that may be caused by abnormal short-circuit of the motor coils 78. This enables avoiding a situation where driving of a vehicle is suddenly impossible.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The motor unit 6 may include an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor including a neodymium permanent magnet to provide a highly efficient performance. This increases the maximum travel range of a vehicle that is possible with a limited battery capacity. An abnormal short-circuit of the motor coils 78 which may occur in a motor unit including an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor is addressed, enabling avoiding a situation where power is generated in the motor unit 6 and the generated power becomes a braking force for the vehicle.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In a configuration in which the electric vehicle includes the in-wheel motor drive system 8, a moisture detector Sk configured to detect moisture in the motor unit 6 may be disposed in proximity to a terminal block 6a that may be associated with the motor unit 6.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A motor unit 6, if included in an in-wheel motor drive system 8, may be located near a wheel, thus being exposed to an environment in proximity to a road surface. In the aforementioned configuration, a moisture detector Sk disposed in proximity to a terminal block 6a associated with the motor unit 6<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> may continuously detect if there is moisture in the motor unit 6 or in a motor housing 72. The in-wheel motor drive system 8 may be configured to limit or shut off a motor current, based on a moisture detection signal. This is because it can be estimated that wires for the motor unit 6 are more susceptible to short-circuiting, if the moisture detector Sk detects moisture. In this way, abnormal short-circuit in a motor unit 6 which may be undergoing rapid rotation can be prevented. This enables avoiding a situation where driving of a vehicle is suddenly impossible. Wires in the motor unit 6 may be sheathed. The same wires, however, may be unsheathed near a terminal block 6a to provide a connection, thus being susceptible to short-circuiting if moisture enters the motor unit 6. The provision of a moisture detector Sk in proximity to a terminal block 6a enables detecting abnormal short-circuit more effectively.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The terminal block 6a may include a plurality of terminals 96 that are positioned in or within a motor housing 72 of the motor unit 6. In other words, the moisture detector Sk may be disposed in proximity to the plurality of terminals 96 that are positioned at such locations. In this way, moisture in the volume around exposed portions of electrically conductive paths 100 can be detected with precision. This not only ensures that moisture which can be the cause for short-circuiting is detected but also ensures that false detections are prevented.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A moisture-detection-responsive controller 102 may further be provided which is configured to monitor if a moisture detection signal produced from the moisture detector Sk meets a defined condition (i.e., a condition indicative of moisture exceeding a predefined amount) and to, upon determining that the defined condition is met, limit or shut off a motor current. This is because it can be estimated that a motor unit 6 which may be located near a wheel is more susceptible to short-circuiting, if a moisture detection signal produced from the moisture detector Sk meets the defined condition. A configuration of the moisture-detection-responsive controller 102, upon<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> determining that the defined condition is met, limiting or shutting off a motor current enables achieving early detection of abnormalities in a motor unit 6, thus avoiding various driving problems.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The moisture-detection-responsive controller 102 may be included in the inverter unit 22 which includes the power circuitry 28 including the inverter 31 and which also includes the motor control circuitry 29 configured to control at least the power circuitry 28 in accordance with control from the ECU 21 which is an electronic control unit configured to perform general control of the vehicle.

With a configuration where the inverter unit 22 including the moisture-detection-responsive controller 102, an appropriate control can be initiated more quickly than with a configuration of the ECU 21 including moisture-detection-responsive controller 102, thus promptly avoiding various driving problems. Furthermore, with such a configuration, the load on the ECU 21, whose complexity is increasing hand-in-hand with its sophistication, can be reduced.

As noted above, the disconnection occurs at the neutral point P1. In this way, if abnormal short-circuit occurs in any one of the at least one first motor coil, the at least one second motor coil and the at least one third motor coil (U, V, W) of the three-phase motor coils 78, sudden braking of the motor unit 6 can be prevented.
