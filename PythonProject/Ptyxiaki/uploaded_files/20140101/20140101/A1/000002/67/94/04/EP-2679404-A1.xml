Field of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a bicycle hub-spoke assembly according to the preamble of Claim 1. Accordingly, the present invention severally relates to bicycle hub-spoke assemblies and more particularly, to a bicycle hub-spoke assembly that allows quick combination between spokes and a hub thereof, and can be assembled to a bicycle wheel rim conveniently and adjustably.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>2. Description of the Related Art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Traditionally, a bicycle hub is peripherally formed with a raw of fixing holes to independently receive plural separated spokes, as can be seen in Taiwan Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="TWM332034"><text>M332034</text></patcit> and Taiwan Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="TW348024"><text>348024</text></patcit>. The spoke typically has a radially-enlarged fixing end for being retained at the fixing hole and a threaded end for being combined with a wheel rim.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">To assemble the traditional bicycle hub-spoke assembly, the spokes have to be installed one by one, and then be<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> adjusted at their threaded ends respectively to provide uniform tension that properly hold the hub at the center of the wheel rim. The whole assembling and adjusting process is therefore time-consuming, leading to poor efficiency of production and fabrication.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">One objective of the present invention is to provide a bicycle hub-spoke assembly having an integrated spoke set that allows fast combination between spokes and its hub so that the problem of the prior art that separated spokes have to be installed one by one can be eliminated, thereby simplifying the assembling and adjusting process and improving the efficiency of production and fabrication.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Another objective of the present invention is to provide a bicycle hub-spoke assembly wherein a fastening ring and spokes are formed into an integrated spoke set as a unity. Since the position of the fastening ring with respect to the spokes is fixed, the spoke set can rapidly hold a hub at the center of a wheel rim, and then the combination between the spokes and<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the wheel rim can be adjusted by spoke caps to provide appropriate tension.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">To achieve these and other objects of the present invention, the invention provides a bicycle hub-spoke assembly according to Claim 1. Further embodiments of the invention are described in the dependent claims.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIG. 1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a bicycle hub-spoke assembly according to one embodiment of the present invention combined with a wheel rim.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIG. 2</b></figref> is an exploded view of the bicycle hub-spoke assembly and the wheel rim.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003"><b>FIG. 3</b></figref> is an exploded view of the bicycle hub-spoke assembly.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004"><b>FIG. 4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the bicycle hub-spoke assembly combined with the wheel rim.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005"><b>FIG. 5</b></figref> is an enlarged view of the circled area of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0006"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><p id="p0008" num="0008">The following preferred embodiment is made to clearly exhibit the above-mentioned and other technical contents, features and effects of the present invention.
