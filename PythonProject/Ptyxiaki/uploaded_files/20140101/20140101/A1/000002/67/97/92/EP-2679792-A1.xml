However, a conventional head cover structure has a possibly of dropping the detection accuracy of a cam angle sensor by vibration of the head cover. Further, in case of attaching auxiliary units to a head cover with a lower stiffness compared with a cylinder head, the auxiliary units being for example a common rail having been conventionally attached to a cylinder head, it is possible to increase vibration and noise. Therefore, further increasing of the stiffness (in another word, rigidity) of a head cover has been desired.<br/>

The upper side bearing portions 13 are arranged on both the left and right sides of the respective cylinders. Incidentally, in the present embodiment, an upper side bearing portion 13c arranged on the left side of the leftmost cylinder serves also as the left end portion 12b (see <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref>) of the outer peripheral marginal portion 12.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 2A, 2B</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the central portion, with respect to the front/back direction, of the lower surfaces of the upper side bearing portions 13 are provided with respective recessed portions 13a in a semicircular shape. These recessed portions 13a provided on the upper side bearing portions 13 and the respective recessed portions 23a provided on the lower side bearing portions 23 form the bearing portions, which axially and rotatably support the respective cam shafts 31, 32. Bolt penetration holes 13b for penetration of bolts B, which are tightening members, are provided<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> on the both the front and back sides of the recessed portions 13a. These bolt penetration holes 13b correspond to 'bearing side tightening/fixing portion' in claims. Incidentally, the lower side bearing portions 23 of the cylinder head 2 are provided with bolt tightening holes 23b for tightening bolts B at positions corresponding to the bolt penetration holes 13b.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The cover portion 11 is a plate shaped part for covering the valve train 3, and is disposed being separated upward from the valve train 3 (see <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>). The cover portion 11 has bulging portions 111 bulging upward in a substantially hemispherical shape between neighboring upper side bearing portions 13. Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the cover portion 11 has first reinforcement limbs 15 for reinforcing the bulging portions 111. The first reinforcement limbs 15 are extended such as to stand up between the bolt penetration holes 12a of the outer peripheral marginal portion 12 and bolt penetration holes 13b of the upper side bearing portions 13, the bolt penetration holes 12a being provided between neighboring upper side bearing portions 13. Thus, the bulging portions 111 are surrounded by neighboring upper side bearing portions 13 and the first reinforcement limbs, and are thus in a state of being peripherally reinforced.<br/>
Incidentally, regarding the bulging portions 111, it is assumed that 'a substantially hemispherical shape' includes, in addition to a hemispherical shape, a shape that can be recognized to be equal to a hemispherical shape (so-called dome shape, etc.).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2B</figref>, on the lower surface of a bulging portion 111, second reinforcement limbs16 are radially provided, extending from the top<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> point 111a of the bulging portion 111 toward the bolt penetration hole 13b of the upper side bearing portion 13, the bolt penetration hole 12a of the outer peripheral marginal portion 12, the bolt penetration hole 12a being provided between neighboring upper side bearing portions 13, and the recessed groove portion 14. The second reinforcement limbs 16 are disposed substantially symmetrically with the top point 111a as the center. As the bulging portion 111 is thereby uniformly reinforced, vibration and noise can be reduced. Further, in order to avoid interference with the cam 33, the second reinforcement limbs 16 are curved such as to be convex upward along the lower surface of the bulging portion 111 (see <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a common rail 5 is attached to the back end portion of the head cover 1 to supply high pressure fuel to a fuel injection device, not shown. Further, a cam angle sensor 6 is attached to the upper surface of the head cover 1 to detect the rotation angle of the cam shaft 32. Still further, a negative pressure pump 7 is attached to the end portion, on the left side, of the head cover 1 to supply an operational hydraulic pressure to a valve timing adjustable mechanism (not shown) of the valve train 3. Yet further, an engine hanger 8 is attached on the left side of the front end portion of the head cover 1 to hold the internal combustion engine E at a vehicle body frame, not shown. Further, an opening 9 is provided through the upper surface of the right end portion of the head cover 1 to exhaust blow-by gas to a gas-liquid separation chamber (not shown) provided separately from the head cover 1.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> The head cover structure, for an internal combustion engine, according to the present embodiment is basically configured as described above.
