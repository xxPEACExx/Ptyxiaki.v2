Typically these major panels include a floor panel, right and left body side panels, a fire wall and either a roof panel or transversely extending header members to which a roof panel is subsequently mounted. After the individual panels are stamped, some preliminary assembly operations may then be performed on the individual panels such as, for example, adding door hinge and latch hardware at the body side panels at appropriate locations proximate the door opening, adding seat mounting brackets, adding reinforcements to the body panel, etc.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Next a set of panels that together constitute a sub-assembly of the finished vehicle body is loosely assembled together. This initial loose assembly of panels frequently is accomplished by a "toy tab" arrangement in which one or more panels is formed with a tab which projects from an edge and which is received in a slot in an adjacent panel. This technique interlocks the panels and frame members to each other to thereby form a preliminary loosely assembled vehicle body wherein the panels and frame members will not separate from each other but wherein the panels<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> and frame members are free to tilt or otherwise move relative to one another. This initial loosely-assembled subassembly is then brought, as for example by a pallet riding on rails, to a welding station where the various panels and frames are welded to each other in a rigid permanently assembled relationship. This initial welding operation step at the welding station is one of the most important steps in the assembly of the vehicle body because it establishes the final welding alignment of all of the various panels and headers relative to each other which is essential to subsequent assembly operations performed on the sub-assembly. During the welding operation it is desirable that the various panels and headers be precisely and accurately located and aligned relative to one another and be held fixedly in the desired position. The positioning of the various panels and header members during the welding operation at the welding station is accomplished utilizing a framing apparatus located at the welding station and including a plurality of gates. For example, a pair of side gates may be utilized in combination with a top gate with the gates moveable between retracted positions, to allow the entry of the vehicle assembly into the welding station, and working positions wherein tooling members carried by the gates suitably engage the assembled body panels to fix them into desired finalized positions whereafter programmable welding robots, each provided with a welding gun, perform welding operations on the assembled body components as they are held in place by the gates and the tooling members.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Prior art welding gates tend to be rather bulky and heavy apparatuses due to the necessity of carrying many and sometimes rather complicated and heavy tooling members and this heavy construction of the gates has necessitated cumbersome and expensive power equipment to move the gates between their retracted and working positions. The bulky and heavy construction of the welding gates has also interfered with the ability of the robots to access the vehicle body components located within the gates.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In an attempt to reduce the bulk and weight of the gates, gates having an open frame or skeletal structure have been utilized but these open frame structure gates, by their fragile nature, have difficulty in handling all of the heavy tooling members and are subject to damage as a result of inadvertent impact with obstacles.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> Such impacts may not only damage the gate but may also misalign tooling members carried by the gate with resultant imprecise joinder of the various body panels.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The invention is directed to the provision of an improved framing apparatus for use at a body welding station.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">More particularly, this invention is directed to the provision of a framing apparatus utilizing a relatively light weight gate that is yet capable of handling even very heavy tooling members.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Yet more particularly, this invention is directed to the provision of a framing apparatus with breakaway provisions to preclude damage to the gate and/or the tooling members in the event of inadvertent encounters with obstacles.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The body framing apparatus of the invention is intended for use at a welding station and includes a plurality of tooling members for use in positioning components of the body at the welding station for welding, each tooling member being mounted on the framing apparatus by a mounting bracket.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the invention, each mounting bracket includes a base for mounted on the framing apparatus and a riser structure mounted on the base and mounting a respective tooling member; the riser structure is mounted on the base by a single central fastener bolt; and the interface between the riser structure and the base comprises a plurality of contact points arranged in concentric relation with respect to the fastener bolt.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to a further feature of the invention, the fastener bolt includes a reduced diameter portion sized to break away in response to a predetermined impact against the riser structure.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to a further feature of the invention, each base includes a planar platform portion mounting the respective riser structure and a plurality of legs extending from the platform portion and sized to straddle the framing apparatus.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to a further feature of the invention, each mounting bracket further includes at least one dowel received in aligned apertures in the base and in the riser structure at a location offset from the axis of the fastener bolt.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to a further feature of the invention, the interface between the base and the riser structure comprises three equally angularly spaced contact points.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to a further feature of the invention, the three contact points are defined by three spherical members positioned at the interface in concentric relation with respect to the central axis of the bolt.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to a further feature of the invention, the spherical members are carried by the base and each spherical member is received in a spherical socket defined in the base.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to a further feature of the invention, each fastener bolt passes through an unthreaded central aperture in the riser structure for threaded engagement with a threaded central aperture in the base.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to a further feature of the invention, each spherical member is seated in a locating socket in the riser structure and each locating socket includes a groove contacting the respective spherical member at only two points.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to a further feature of the invention, each groove defines a central axis and the axes of the grooves pass through the central axis of the fastener bolt.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to a further feature of the invention, each locating socket is defined by a pin received in the riser structure, each spherical member comprises a ball, and each socket pin defines a respective groove opening at the interface for seating of the respective ball.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to a further feature of the invention, each locating socket is defined by a socket pin received in a bore in the riser structure and each socket pin defines a respective groove opening at the interface for seating of the respective ball.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to a further feature of the invention the fastener bolt is part of a fastener bolt assembly including the fastener bolt, an upper annular plate surrounding a head of the fastener bolt, a lower annular plate surrounding a shank of the fastener bolt, a compressible annular spring device positioned in surrounding relation to the bolt shank between the upper and lower plates, a plurality of upper attachment bolts passing downwardly

through bores in the riser structure for threaded engagement with further threaded bores in the lower annular plate, the head of the fastener bolt bearing against the annular spring device so that, with the bolt passing through the bore in the riser structure for threaded engagement with the base, tightening of the fastener bolt compresses the spring device to pretension the fastener bolt.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to a further feature of the invention, the spring device comprises a stack of Belleville washers.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to a further feature of the invention, the riser structure includes a tubular member having a central bore to accommodate the fastener bolt and a plurality of circumferentially spaced bores in an end rim of the tubular member

Tightening of the bolt, in coaction with washers 74 and 76, will be seen to engage the bolt head 66a with the bolt face 64 and firmly press riser ring surface 52g against base ring surface 50j to firmly and positively clamp the riser to the base. Since the interface between the riser and the base is only along well defined ring surfaces, the riser will engage the base in a triangulated manner to provide a firm positive inter-engagement as between the riser and the base. It is also critical that the riser dimension between the bolt face 64 and the lower face of the riser be sufficient to insure that the riser structure within the ring surface 52g remain rigid and not flex or distort as the bolt is tightened since such flexing or distorting might interfere with the firm positive triangulated inter-engagement of riser surface 52g and base surface 50j. Following mounting of the riser on the base, a tooling member, for example a clamp 78, may be mounted on the riser utilizing a blade 82 (<figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 13</figref>) fastened to the mounting face 60 of the riser utilizing bolts and dowel pins passing through bolt holes 52h and dowel holes 52i and through aligned bolt holes and dowel holes in the blade.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">If a breakaway provision is desired, a breakaway bolt 72 is employed, the bolt is tightened utilizing head 72a until the bolt head seats against the bolt face 64, and further torque is applied to the bolt by the head 72a until the reduced diameter portion 72b shears. It will be understood that reduced diameter portion 72b is designed to shear before reduced diameter portion 72d and that the tightening of the bolt structure until the reduced diameter portion 72b shears has the effect of<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> pretorquing the bolt to the torque level required to shear the reduced diameter portion 72b. In use at the framing station, each open frame gate structure 30 is positioned by a robot which is secured to robot mounting plate 40 and programmed is known manner. Ideally, the robot moves the gate into position at the framing station without encountering any obstacles and therefore without damaging the tooling members or, more importantly, the delicate frame structure. However, if an obstacle is encountered, the obstacle will typically exert a force F against the vertical portion of a riser which in turn will cause the riser to tilt which in turn will result in shearing or rupture of the reduced diameter bolt portion 72d which in turn will allow the riser and associated tooling member to breakaway from the base 50 and preclude twisting or other damage to the delicate frame structure 30 and/or dislocation of the tooling member carried by the riser with consequent mis-assembly of the respective automotive body components. The defined inter-engaging ring surfaces on the riser and the base have the effect of defining a locus of points equal distant from the center line of the breakaway bolt 72 so that no matter in which direction the impact F is exerted on the riser vertical portion the same moment will be applied to the riser and to the bolt structure and the same force.F will result in an identical rupture pattern with respect to the reduced diameter bolt structure portion 72d.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">The single central mounting bolt in combination with the dowel pins 80 provides a firm, positive locating of the riser on the base and the defined ring surface interface between the lower face of the riser and the upper face of the base insures a firm positive triangulated mounting of the riser on the base. As compared to a prior art riser mounting arrangement employing four quadranted bolt holes with dowel holes positioned between the bolt holes, the invention riser mounting system employs a single central bolt hole, a single central bolt and a pair of flanking dowel pins providing considerable savings in both materials and labor. The invention riser, by virtue of its extruded construction, also provides significant material savings as compared to prior art risers and the invention riser, by virtue of its aluminum extrusion formation, provides considerable weight savings as compared to prior art risers.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">The illustrated and described base and riser structure also allows ready provision to accommodate production variances or tolerances.
