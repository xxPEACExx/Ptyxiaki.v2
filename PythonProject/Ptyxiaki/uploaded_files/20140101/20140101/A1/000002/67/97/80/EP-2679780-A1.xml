Thus, the support structure of the exhaust duct has to be protected by means of an insulation, which then has to be covered and protected by liner segments. Exhaust ducts and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Diffusers of that kind are for example disclosed in documents <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5104286A"><text>US 5,104,286 A</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5669812A"><text>US 5,669,812 A</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6807803B2"><text>US 6,807,803 B2</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1</figref> shows the principle configuration of an exhaust section of such a gas turbine. The exhaust gases emerging from the gas turbine 10 are expanded in a conical diffuser 11 and then enter an exhaust duct 12, which leads the exhaust flow 18 to a stack 19, not shown. The diffuser 11 comprises an inner cone 13 and an outer cone 14, which are coaxially arranged with respect to a machine axis 34. The walls of the inner cone 13 and outer cone 14 and exhaust duct 12 each have an internal structure comprising a liner 15, an intermediate insulation 16 and a support structure 17. Depending on the specific configuration the inner and outer cone 13, 14 can also be cylindrical.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The fixation of the liners is difficult due to several problems:
<ul><li>● as the support structure is cold and the liner is hot, there are different thermal expansions, which have to be safely absorbed by the fixtures or fixing means;</li><li>● the fixtures cross the insulation, thereby creating thermal bridges;</li><li>● the side of the liner exposed to the exhaust flow must be as flat as possible to avoid disturbing the flow and creating turbulent flow; as the liner has to be mounted somehow, this is hard to achieve;</li><li>● longitudinal ribs extending into the flow are tolerable for some parts with not too high flowing velocity; however, they cannot be tolerated in the diffuser section, as in this section there may be still an exhaust gas swirl and longitudinal ribs may reduce the diffuser efficiency; therefore, an aim should be to have a smooth surface of the liner at its exhaust flow side, especially in the diffuser section.</li></ul></p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> shows an exemplary prior art solution, where the wall comprises a support structure 21, an intermediate insulation and a liner 23, which is fixed by means of U profiles 24 and threaded joints 25, which disadvantageously extend into the exhaust flow.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Experience has further shown that the nuts, which are secured to the threaded bolts by means of welding points, break off, thereby putting the fixation at risk.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to provide a diffuser, which avoids the disadvantages of the prior art solutions and combines a smooth inner surface with a safe compensation of different thermal expansions, especially during transient conditions of the gas turbine.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">This and other objects are obtained by a diffuser according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The diffuser according to the invention comprises at least one cone extending along a machine axis and bordering a channel for an exhaust flow, whereby said at least one cone has a wall with an internal structure comprising a plurality of longitudinal liner segments extending in axial direction and establishing a conical liner being in contact with the exhaust flow, a support structure coaxially arranged with respect to said conical liner in a predetermined distance, and an insulation (filling the space between said conical liner and said support structure.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The diffuser according to the invention is characterized in that each of said liner segments is fixed in lateral direction (i.e. circumferential and longitudinal direction) at one fixing point, and that each liner segment is supported at a plurality of distributed points outside said fixing point by means of supporting elements, which are confined to the space between said conical liner and said support structure and allow for a lateral thermal expansion of the liner segments.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to an embodiment of the invention the diffuser comprises an inner cone and an outer cone, which are arranged coaxially and have each a plurality of longitudinal liner segments extending in axial direction and establishing a conical<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> liner being in contact with the exhaust flow, a support structure coaxially arranged with respect to said conical liner in a predetermined distance, and an insulation filling the space between said conical liner and said support structure, whereby each of said liner segments is fixed in lateral direction at one fixing point, and each liner segment is supported at a plurality of distributed points outside said fixing point by means of supporting elements, which are confined to the space between said conical liner and said support structure and allow for a lateral thermal expansion of the liner segments.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to another embodiment of the invention the supporting elements each comprise a pair of C profiles, which are welded to the back surface of the liner segments thereby defining a slotted guiding channel running parallel to said back surface, and a T support, which is welded to the respective support structure with its base and engage with its cross beam said pair of C profiles at said slotted guiding channel.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Specifically, said C profiles are welded to the respective liner segment with a circumferential seam.

<ul><li>● for each liner segment there is only one fixing point with a fixing means connecting the liner segment and the underlying support structure;</li><li>● the liner segment is free to thermally expand stress-free in different (lateral) directions outside of the fixing point;</li><li>● neighbouring liner segments overlap to protect the underlying insulation against the hot exhaust flow;</li><li>● the overlapping sections (strips) formed by bending stiffen the liner segments thereby reducing natural resonances of the segment;</li><li>● C profiles used to establish an expansion-tolerant connection between the liner segments and the support structure are circumferentially welded to the liner segments, and are small enough to have always the same temperature as the liner segments, so that thermal stress between profile and segment is avoided;</li><li>● the fixing point/fixing means fixes only the plane of the liner segment; all other degrees of freedom are not blocked so that the liner segment has many possibilities to move, respectively to rotate, which is important for transient conditions of the machine.</li></ul></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The present solution has been developed to fulfil the requirement that for aerodynamic reasons no fixing parts shall extend into the exhaust flow at the diffuser section.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">Fig. 3-5</figref>, the liners 15a and 15b of the inner cone 13 and outer cone 14 with their liner segments 29 and 30 are each fixed at one fixing point (35 in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">8</figref>) by means of a fixing means 27a and 27b. Outside the fixing point the liner segments 29 and 30 of the liners 15a and 15b are connected to the respective support structure 17a and 17b by means of distributed T supports 26a and 26b. These T supports 26a,b are welded to the support<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> structure 17a,b with their base and engage each with its cross beam a pair of C profiles 31a,b welded to the back surface (insulation side) of the liner segments 29, 30 thereby defining a slotted guiding channel running parallel to said back surface (<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4, 4a and 5, 5a</figref>).</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The liner segments 29 and 30 are fixed in their position at the fixing points 35. The C profiles 31a,b are aligned in the longitudinal direction of the segments or the flow or axial direction, respectively. This allows an easy mounting even in the presence of the insulation 16a,b, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> (see the rectangular or nearly rectangular mounting arrows). Moreover, the liner segments 29 and 30 can freely expand in the longitudinal direction (flow or axial direction).</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6 and 7</figref>, expansion in circumferential direction is made possible by providing different cold plays a and b at opposite sides of the cross beam of the T support 26a,b or opposite C profiles, respectively.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">At the fixing points 35, fixing means 27a,b fix the liner segments 29, 30 only in longitudinal and circumferential direction. This is achieved by means of a gudgeon 33 which is welded to the liner segment during assembly and engages with a ring 37 fixed at one end of a radial tube 38, which tube 38 is welded to the support structure 17a,b with its other end. Other movements and tolerances, for example perpendicular to the segment plane, are possible without generating stress.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The base of each T support 26a,b has an oval hole (36 in Fig. 4b) to minimize heat transport to the support structure. The advantage of a combination of C profiles and T supports is a small contact area, which reduces heat transport between liner segment and T support base and hence the support structure.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Each C profile 31a,b can be welded to the liner segment with a circumferential weld seam. In connection with the comparatively big contact area between<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> both parts this results in a good heat transport from the liner segment to the C profile. As a consequence, no substantial thermal stress is generated at the welding seam during transient conditions like starting and stopping the gas turbine.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">To achieve a smooth overall surface the contact area between neighbouring liner segments is designed in an overlapping fashion, whereby one liner segment overlaps the other with an overlapping strip 29a, 30a. The overlapping strips 29a, 30a are formed by bending the respective liner segment. This leads to an enhanced stiffness of the liner segment without changing its thickness.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As can be seen especially in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 10</figref>, there are two liner segments at 6 o'clock position and 12 o'clock position, which differ from the other liner segments with respect to overlapping. While all other liner segments have only one overlapping strip, these two liner segments have two overlapping strips at opposite sides. For the liner segment at the 6 o'clock position this configuration results in a kind of flume, which prevents a possible liquid running down the diffuser from dripping through the liner into the insulation.</p><heading id="h0006">LIST OF REFERENCE NUMERALS</heading><p id="p0032" num="0032"><dl id="dl0002" compact="compact"><dt>10</dt><dd>gas
