The commanded mode is indicated in broadcast signalling (NETWORK_CONTROL_ORDER sent in SI2quater message, see 3GPP TS 44.018), but may also be signalled in point-to-point signalling. The commanded mode applies both in packet transfer mode and in packet idle mode. If a circuit-switched connection is active (e.g. in a voice call), different procedures apply (approximately similar to the rules for NC2, although handover is the only permitted means of cell change in this case). </p><p id="p0043" num="0043"> NCO: In this mode, cell reselection is autonomous (i.e. is performed by the mobile without being prompted by the network). Criteria for reselection are specified and parameters relating to these criteria may be transmitted by the network. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044"> NC2: In this mode, the mobile sends measurement reports to the network indicating the signal strength/quality of neighbouring cells; based on these reports, the network directs the mobile to perform cell reselection or handover. Autonomous reselection in this mode is not permitted. </p><p id="p0045" num="0045"> NC1 : This is a hybrid of NCO and NC2; in this mode, the mobile station shall perform autonomous reselection if the appropriate criteria are met.

 However, CSG (closed subscriber group) cells (which may, for example, be e.g. femto cells) are not fully under the control of the operator in the way other ("macro") cells are. CSG cells may be partially controlled by a home user, enterprise or institution that has installed the CSG cell on their premises. It is therefore desirable that deployment of a CSG cell in any location does not require any modification to the non-CSG cells in the area (otherwise an operator may have to modify the configuration of several non-CSG cells to accommodate the presence of a single CSG cell). </p><p id="p0070" num="0070"> To this end, mobility by the MS towards CSG cells is autonomous and does not require that the CSG cell be listed in the neighbour cell list of the serving cell.

 Operating system software executed by the microprocessor 128 is in some embodiments stored in a persistent store, such as the flash memory 116, but may be stored in other types of memory devices, such as a read only memory (ROM) or similar storage element. In addition, system software, specific device applications, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store, such as the RAM 118. </p><p id="p0249" num="0249">Communication signals received by the wireless device 100 may also be stored to the RAM 118. </p><p id="p0250" num="0250">The microprocessor 128, in addition to its operating system functions, enables execution of software applications on the wireless device 100. A predetermined set of software applications that control basic device operations, such as a voice communications module 130A and a data communications module 30B, may be installed on the wireless device 100 during manufacture. In addition, a personal information manager (PIM) application module 130C may also be installed on the wireless device 100 during manufacture. The PIM application is in some embodiments capable of organizing and managing data items, such as e-mail, calendar events, voice mails, appointments, and task items. The PIM application is also in some embodiments capable of sending and receiving data items via a wireless network 110. In some embodiments, the data items managed by the PIM application are seamlessly integrated, synchronized and updated via the wireless network 110 with the device user's corresponding data items stored or associated with a host computer system. As well, additional software modules, illustrated as another software module 130N, may be installed during manufacture. </p><p id="p0251" num="0251">Communication functions, including data and voice communications, are performed through the communication subsystem 170, and possibly through the short- range communications subsystem 102. The communication subsystem 170 includes a receiver 150, a transmitter 152 and one or more antennas, illustrated as a receive antenna 154 and a transmit antenna 156. In addition, the communication subsystem 170 also includes a processing module, such as a digital signal processor (DSP) 158, and local oscillators (LOs) 160. The specific design and implementation of the communication subsystem 170 is dependent upon the communication network in which the wireless device 100 is intended to operate. For example, the communication subsystem 170 of the wireless device 100 may be designed to operate with the Mobitex™, DataTAC™ or General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) mobile data communication networks and also designed to operate with any of a variety of voice communication networks, such as 
<!-- EPO <DP n="38"/>-->
 Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Personal Communications Service (PCS), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), etc. Examples of CDMA include 1X and 1x EV-DO. The communication subsystem 170 may also be designed to operate with an 802.11 Wi-Fi network, and/or an 802.16 WiMAX network. Other types of data and voice networks, both separate and integrated, may also be utilized with the wireless device 100. </p><p id="p0252" num="0252">Network access may vary depending upon the type of communication system. For example, in the Mobitex™ and DataTAC™ networks, wireless devices are registered on the network using a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) associated with each device. In GPRS networks, however, network access is typically associated with a subscriber or user of a device. A GPRS device therefore typically has a subscriber identity module, commonly referred to as a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card, in order to operate on a GPRS network. </p><p id="p0253" num="0253">When network registration or activation procedures have been completed, the wireless device 100 may send and receive communication signals over the </p><p id="p0254" num="0254">communication network 110. Signals received from the communication network 1 0 by the receive antenna 54 are routed to the receiver 150, which provides for signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., and may also provide analog to digital conversion. Analog-to-digital conversion of the received signal allows the DSP 158 to perform more complex communication functions, such as demodulation and decoding. In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted to the network 1 0 are processed (e.g., modulated and encoded) by the DSP 158 and are then provided to the transmitter 152 for digital to analog conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification and transmission to the communication network 10 (or networks) via the transmit antenna 156. </p><p id="p0255" num="0255">In addition to processing communication signals, the DSP 158 provides for control of the receiver 150 and the transmitter 152. For example, gains applied to communication signals in the receiver 150 and the transmitter 152 may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP 158. </p><p id="p0256" num="0256">In a data communication mode, a received signal, such as a text message or web page download, is processed by the communication subsystem 170 and is input to the microprocessor 128. The received signal is then further processed by the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="39"/>-->
 microprocessor 128 for an output to the display 126, or alternatively to some other auxiliary I/O devices 106. A device user may also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, using the keyboard 114 and/or some other auxiliary I/O device 106, such as a touchpad, a rocker switch, a thumb-wheel, or some other type of input device. The composed data items may then be transmitted over the communication network 110 via the communication subsystem 170. </p><p id="p0257" num="0257">In a voice communication mode, overall operation of the device is </p><p id="p0258" num="0258"> substantially similar to the data communication mode, except that received signals are output to a speaker 111 , and signals for transmission are generated by a microphone 112. Alternative voice or audio I/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the wireless device 100. In addition, the display 126 may also be utilized in voice communication mode, for example, to display the identity of a calling party, the duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information. </p><p id="p0259" num="0259">The short-range communications subsystem 102 enables communication between the wireless device 100 and other proximate systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the short range communications subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a Bluetooth™ communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices. </p><p id="p0260" num="0260">In Figure 4, a CSG cell reselector (not shown) is provided to implement any one or combination of the methods described herein. This might, for example, be implemented as processor code stored in flash memory 116, or other memory, for execution by the microprocessor 128. </p><p id="p0261" num="0261"> Application to Ceil Classes other than CSG Cells </p><p id="p0262" num="0262"> The embodiments described have been specific to reselection to CSG cells. In another embodiment, any of the embodiments described herein may be used to control reselection to another class of cells (for example those associated with a specific RAT) without seeing a neighbour cell list. The feature of CSGs that makes them problematic here is that the mobile station is permitted to perform autonomous reselection to them without there needing to be any related signalling (in particular, neighbour cell list) having been received. In general, it might be expected that reselection to any other RAT requires a neighbour cell list, however this might not be the case, especially for non-3GPP 
<!-- EPO <DP n="40"/>-->
 technologies; also, there is a trend to minimizing the amount of NCL information transmitted (e.g. for E-UTRAN, the NCL is actually just a list of frequencies on which cells may be operating). </p><p id="p0263" num="0263"> Numerous modifications and variations of the present application are possible in light of the above teachings.
