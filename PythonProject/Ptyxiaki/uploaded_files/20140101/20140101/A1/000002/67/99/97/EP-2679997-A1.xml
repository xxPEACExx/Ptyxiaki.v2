More particularly, when the impulse reaches the level of the motor endplate of the muscle, action potential is generated and transmitted to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Then, calcium ions are released into the cytosol, and bind to troponin C. A conformational change of the troponins I, T, and C complex occurs by enhancing the interaction between troponin I and troponin C, and it enables muscle contraction by the actin-myosin interaction.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">When cardiac muscle is irreversibly damaged, the cardiac troponin that is released appears in the blood stream. Three subunits, i.e., cardiac troponin I, cardiac troponin C, and cardiac troponin T, alone or as a complex (cardiac troponin) consisting of two or three different subunits, exist in the blood.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A blood sample (serum, plasma, or whole blood) is commonly used to evaluate various cardiac troponins. However, such a selection may be limited by the method used. For example, it is known that a serum is an inappropriate biological sample in a method for rapidly evaluating cardiac troponin, and that whole blood complicates the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> implementation of a quantitative assay. In an immunological assay using heparinized plasma or heparinized whole blood, even when the performance of the method used is very high, unreliable results are often obtained. In general, this problem occurs when the concentration of cardiac troponin in plasma is not very high (non-patent literature 1). Actually, it is known that the presence of heparin in a blood sample interferes with various immunological assays and affects the measurement results. Because of this, the clinical diagnosis of a doctor may be modified.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An EDTA blood collection tube is also commonly used as an anticoagulant, EDTA plasma or EDTA whole blood may cause unreliable results. In general, cardiac troponin I forms a complex with cardiac troponin C and/or cardiac troponin T in the presence of calcium ions. However, in the presence of EDTA, since calcium ions are chelated, the complex containing cardiac troponin I decomposes. As a result, it is known that EDTA plasma or EDTA whole blood affects an immunological assay due to a change in the form of cardiac troponin I in blood (non-patent literature 2).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">With respect to a method for avoiding the influence of interfering substances in a specimen in a cardiac troponin assay, an immunological measuring method characterized in that it is carried out using a biological sample containing heparin in the presence of hexadimethrine bromide (polybrene) is disclosed (patent literature 1). This relates to a method for avoiding the interference caused by heparin, and this literature does not refer to EDTA.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Further, it is disclosed that the addition of a divalent cation to cardiac troponin is effective in stabilizing the cardiac troponin complex (patent literatures 2, 3, and 4).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">For example, patent literature 2 discloses a composition containing calcium chloride or magnesium chloride at a concentration of 100 µmol/L to 100 mmol/L, as a buffer for a stable composition of troponin complex, and an embodiment<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> containing 2 mmol/L calcium chloride, as a preferable composition (paragraph [0013]). However, patent literature 2 does not refer to the concentration of calcium chloride or magnesium chloride in a reaction solution during the troponin assay (i.e., when the immunological complex is formed). Therefore, it is not disclosed nor suggested in patent literature 2 that a high concentration should be maintained in the reaction solution for the immunological measurement of cardiac troponin, and that an accurate value sometimes cannot be obtained at a low concentration (for example, 2 mmol/L) depending on the type of specimen.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Patent literature 3 discloses that, as a preferable composition of stabilized troponin I, the concentration of calcium chloride or magnesium chloride is 0.01 mmol/L to 10 mmol/L. Further, it is disclosed in Example 14 that calcium chloride is added to a serum or plasma so as to become a final concentration of 6 mmol/L before carrying out an antigen-antibody reaction, the resulting solution is incubated at room temperature for 2 hours followed by 4°C overnight, and the incubated sample is diluted with a metal-free assay buffer via a dilution factor of 2 to 256 (maximum). In this procedure, calcium chloride is present in the reaction solution at approximately 3 mmol/L or less. However, it is not disclosed nor suggested that a high concentration should be maintained in the reaction solution for the immunological measurement of cardiac troponin, and that an accurate value sometimes cannot be obtained at a low concentration (for example, approximately 3 mmol/L) depending on the type of specimen. In connection with this, the calcium chloride concentration in the troponin assay buffer used in the Examples of patent-literature 3 is 2 mmol/L (for example, Examples 10 to 12).</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Patent literature 4 discloses that the concentrations of calcium ions and magnesium ions are not important as buffers used in the preparation of a troponin complex, but it should be preferably about 20 µmol/L to about 20 mmol/L, and the typical amount of calcium and/or magnesium is about 2 to 5<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> mmol/L. Although it is not clearly described, it is disclosed in Examples 1 and 2 that about 225 mg/L calcium chloride or other calcium salts capable of providing 1 to 3 mmol/L calcium ions are contained in the reaction solution for the preparation of a complex. However, patent literature 4 does not refer to the concentration of calcium chloride or magnesium chloride in a reaction solution during the troponin assay. Further, it is not disclosed nor suggested that a high concentration should be maintained in the reaction solution for the immunological measurement of cardiac troponin, and that an accurate value sometimes cannot be obtained at a low concentration (for example, approximately 3 mmol/L) depending on the type of specimen.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As described above, patent literatures 2, 3, and 4 disclose that calcium chloride or magnesium chloride is generally added at a concentration of about 1 to 6 mmol/L for the stabilization of a sample containing troponin complexes, and it is not intended to improve the reliability of the measured value of an immunological reaction.</p><heading id="h0003">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT LITERATURE</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><ul><li>[Patent literature 1] Japanese Translation Publication (Kohyo) No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2002502979A"><text>2002-502979</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent literature 2] Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP9021804A"><text>9-21804</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent literature 3] Japanese Translation Publication (Kohyo) No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP11505605A"><text>11-505605</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent literature 4] Japanese Translation Publication (Kohyo) No.<patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2002508839A"><text> 2002-508839</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">NON-PATENT LITERATURE</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013"><ul><li>[Non-patent literature 1] <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>P.

Examples of the biological sample include blood samples, such as whole blood, a serum, and plasma. A subject from whom a biological sample is collected is not limited, so long as the measurement of cardiac troponin is desired. The subject is preferably a patient suspected of having a myocardial disease, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A specimen which may be used in the present invention is not limited, so long as it is a sample for measurement capable of being prepared from the above-described biological sample. For example, when a blood sample is used, examples of the specimen include a specimen (for example, whole blood, a serum, or plasma) collected using a blood coagulation inhibitor. Examples of the blood coagulation inhibitor include heparin, EDTA, and citric acid. Such an anticoagulant may be used, preferably, by previously adding it to a blood collection tube before blood is collected from a subject such as a human.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Cardiac troponin to be measured in the present invention may be free-form heart troponin I (sometimes abbreviated as cTnI or I), free-form heart troponin T (sometimes abbreviated as cTnT or T), or free-form heart troponin c (sometimes abbreviated as cTnc or c); in a dimer form thereof (IT, IC, or TC); or in a trimer form thereof (ITC).<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> Unless otherwise specified herein, the term "cardiac troponin" refers completely to all these forms, and the term "cardiac troponin complexes" refers entirely to the dimers and the trimer.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">An immunological measuring method which may be used in the present invention is not limited, so long as it is a known method using one or more antibodies specific for cardiac troponin. Examples of the method include turbidimetric immunoassay (TIA), enzyme immunoassay (EIA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), a latex agglutination method, fluorescence immunoassay, and immunochromatography. More particularly, it is a method in which an immunological complex of cardiac troponin contained in a specimen with an antibody specific to cardiac troponin is formed in a reaction solution, and a signal derived from the formation is appropriately detected to detect the presence of cardiac troponin. The antibodies may be selected in accordance with a measuring system. When a quantitative measurement with high sensitivity is carried out, a sandwich immunoassay using two or more antibodies may be selected. The sandwich immunoassay may be carried out in one or more stages (two stages, three stages, or the like).</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">For example, when cardiac troponin contained in a biological sample is measured as a substance to be analyzed, a specimen prepared from the biological sample as previously described is diluted with a sample dilution solution to prepare a specimen for measurement; the resulting specimen is mixed with an insoluble carrier immobilized with an antibody (first antibody) which specifically binds to cardiac troponin, and another antibody (second antibody) which specifically binds to cardiac troponin and is labeled with a labeling substance, to form an immunological complex; unreacted antibodies and cardiac troponin are removed (B/F separation) from the reaction solution by washing; and the amount of the labeling substance bound to the insoluble carrier is measured.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As the insoluble carrier, a carrier which is conventionally used in the art may be used. Examples of material for the insoluble carrier include polymer materials, for example, latex, rubber, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, a styrene-butadiene copolymer, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate, polyacrylamide, polymethacrylate, a styrene-methacrylate copolymer, poly glycidyl methacrylate, an acrolein-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate copolymer, polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), and silicone; agarose; gelatin; erythrocyte; and inorganic materials, for example, silica gel, glass, inert alumina, and magnetic material. These may be used individually, or as a combination of two or more.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The shape of the insoluble carrier may be, for example, a microtiter plate, a test tube, beads, particles, or nanoparticles. Examples of the particles include magnetic particles, hydrophobic particles such as polystyrene latex, copolymer latex particles having a hydrophilic group such as an amino group, a carboxyl group, or the like on its surface, red blood cells, and gelatin particles. In these particles, magnetic particles are most preferable in view of the achievement of a quick and convenient B/F separation. More particularly, magnetic particles of microparticles made of, for example, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, or various ferrites; metals such as iron, manganese, nickel, cobalt, chromium, and the like; or alloys such as cobalt, nickel, manganese, and the like may be preferably used. Further, insoluble carriers in which these magnetic particles are immobilized on the surface of, or contained within polymer latex made of polystyrene or the like, gelatin, liposome, or the like may be preferably used.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A method of immobilizing the first antibody on these insoluble carriers is known in the art. The immobilization may be carried out by, for example, a physical adsorption method, a covalent binding method, an ion binding method, or a combination thereof.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">A labeling substance is not limited, so long as it is a labeling substance which may be used in a conventional immunoassay. Examples of the labeling substance include an enzyme, a fluorescent substance, a radioactive isotope, and insoluble particles. Examples of the enzyme for labeling include alkaline phosphatase, peroxidase, glucose oxidase, tyrosinase, and acid phosphatase. Examples of the fluorescent substance include fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), green fluorescent protein (GFP), and luciferin. Examples of the isotope include <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>14</sup>C, and <sup>32</sup>P.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">When the labeling substance is an enzyme, the labeling substance may be measured by carrying out a luminescence, fluorescence, or coloring reaction using a substrate for the enzyme. For example, when the enzyme is alkaline phosphatase, a chemiluminescent substrate, such as CDP-star (registered trademark)(disodium 4-chloro-3-(methoxy-spiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2'-(5'-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.1<sup>3,7</sup>]decane}-4-yl)phenyl phosphate), CSPD (registered trademark)(disodium 3-(4-methoxy-spiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2-(5'-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.1<sup>3,7</sup>]decane}-4-yl)phenyl phosphate), AMPPD (registered trademark)(3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2'-tricyclo[3.3.1.1<sup>3,7</sup>]decan}-4-yl)phenyl phosphate), APS-5, or the like; a fluorescent substrate, such as 4-methylumbelliferylphosphate or the like; or a coloring substrate, such as p-nitrophenyl phosphate, BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate), NBT (4-nitro-blue tetrazolium chloride), INT (iodo-nitrotetrazolium), or the like may be used as its substrate.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The antibody which specifically binds to cardiac troponin, which may be used in the present invention, is not limited, so long as it is a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody which recognizes an amino acid sequence of cardiac troponin as its epitope.

The epitope means not only a minimum region an antibody recognizes, but also a region identified as a region an antibody can recognize. The antibody may be an antibody fragment which may be prepared by a known method, such as Fab or the like. These antibodies may be appropriately purchased from, for example, Hytest, MedixBiochemica, Meridian Life science, DAKO, Fitzgerald, Biospacific, or the like.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">When two types of antibodies are used in the measurement of the present invention, they are not limited, so long as they can form an immunological complex with cardiac troponin contained in a biological sample. It is preferable that the epitopes recognized by the first and second antibodies are different from each other. A monoclonal antibody and a polyclonal antibody may be used in an appropriate combination thereof. Each of the first and second antibodies may be used, not only alone, but also as a combination of two or more.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The addition of a divalent cation in the present invention is not limited, so long as it is carried out so that the divalent cation is present at least when the first immunological complex of cardiac troponin and an antibody specific to cardiac troponin is formed (in the reaction solution) in the immunological measuring method. More particularly, the divalent cation may be added<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> simultaneously when the immunological complex is formed (to the reaction solution), or alternatively, the divalent cation may be added to a specimen before the immunological complex is formed (before the antibody is brought in contact with the specimen containing cardiac troponin).</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The divalent cation to be added is prepared as a solution by dissolving it in a known buffer. The divalent cation solution may be prepared alone as well as with a buffering agent, or together with known substances required for a pretreatment of specimens or reactions. Because it is necessary that the divalent cation is present at least when the immunological complex is formed (in the reaction solution), as described above, the divalent cation may be contained in a buffer or the like which may be present when the immunological complex is formed. The "buffer or the like which may be present when the immunological complex is formed" may be appropriately selected in accordance with a measuring method and apparatus used, and may be, for example, a sample dilution solution, antibody solution (such as a solution containing particles immobilized with antibody, a solution containing labeled antibody, or the like), or the like. The divalent cation may be added to multiple buffers.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Examples of the divalent cation in the present invention include a calcium ion and a magnesium ion. Its form is not limited, so long as it can be present as an ion in the reaction solution, and a salt is preferable. Examples of the salt include calcium chloride and magnesium chloride.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The concentration of the divalent cation in the present invention may be selected, as the concentration when the immunological complex is formed, from 4 mmol/L or higher, preferably 5 mmol/L or higher, more preferably 6 mmol/L or higher, more preferably 8 mmol/L or higher, more preferably 10 mmol/L or higher, more preferably 12 mmol/L or higher, or more preferably 15 mmol/L or higher; and 500 mmol/L or lower, preferably 100 mmol/L or lower, more preferably 50<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> mmol/L or lower, or more preferably 20 mmol/L or lower, as an appropriate combination thereof. In the present invention, the divalent cation is present in the reaction solution within the above concentration range, regardless of the presence of divalent cations contained in a biological sample. In relation to this, when the concentration of the divalent cation in the reaction solution is too high, an accurate measurement of interest cannot be carried out due to the inhibition of an antigen-antibody reaction, and thus, it is necessary to pay attention. To stably and accurately measure cardiac troponin contained in a biological sample regardless of the type of specimen in accordance with the present invention, it is within the range of design issues to determine the concentration of the divalent cation added in accordance with the amount of cardiac troponin contained in the specimen and the type of divalent cation used.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The concentration of the divalent cation in the present invention is higher than that of the divalent cation contained in the reaction solution in conventional immunological measurement for cardiac troponin. As in the conventional methods, when a divalent cation is not contained at the time of the immunological complex formation, or when a divalent cation is contained, but its concentration is low, as we will show concrete experimental data in the Examples described below, divergence occurs between a measured value obtained using a blood sample to which EDTA is added as an anticoagulant (for example, EDTA plasma or EDTA whole blood, particularly, EDTA plasma) and a measured value obtained using a blood sample other than that (for example, a serum, heparinized plasma, citrated plasma, or whole blood). By contrast, when a divalent cation is present at a high concentration at the time of the immunological complex formation, the difference between the measured values is smaller, or the measured values agree substantially with one another. This difference, which the present inventors have found for the first time, in behavior caused by the difference in the type of specimens based on the presence or absence of EDTA addition is a phenomenon<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> commonly observed even when plural monoclonal antibodies recognizing different epitopes are used (see Examples 3 and 4 described below), and is not a phenomenon unique to the specific monoclonal antibody.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">As shown in the Examples below, the concentration of the divalent cation in the present invention can be easily determined by preparing an EDTA-added blood sample and another blood sample, measuring the amount of cardiac troponin contained in each blood sample in the presence of many different concentrations of divalent cations, and determining the concentration range of divalent cations in which the measured values of both samples agree with one another. That is to say, the concentration of the divalent cation in the present invention can be selected from the concentration range in which a measured value obtained using a blood sample to which EDTA is added as an anticoagulant accords with a measured value obtained using a blood sample other than the EDTA-added blood sample.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The kit of the present invention may be used for carrying out the method of the present invention, and contains one or more antibodies which specifically bind to cardiac troponin, and a buffer solution containing the divalent cation.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">As the antibody which specifically binds to cardiac troponin, above-mentioned known antibodies may be used, and a monoclonal antibody or a polyclonal antibody may be used.
