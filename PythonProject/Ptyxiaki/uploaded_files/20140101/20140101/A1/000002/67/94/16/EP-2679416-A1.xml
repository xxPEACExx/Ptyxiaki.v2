As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a torsion beam type suspension of the embodiment of the present invention is configured by connecting a left trailing arm 1 to a right trailing arm 2 by a torsion beam 4 extending in a width direction of a vehicle body perpendicular to a back-and-forward direction of the vehicle body. The trailing arm 1 and the trailing arm 2 are left-right symmetric. The pair of left and right trailing arms 1 and 2 is formed by bending a hollow pipe having a circular shaped cross section.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A collar 6 is attached firmly, by welding, to one end of the left trailing arm 1. The left trailing arm 1 is swingably supported by the not-illustrated vehicle body via the collar 6. Further, a vehicle wheel supporting member 8 is attached firmly, by welding, to the other end of the trailing arm 1. The not-illustrated vehicle wheel is rotatably mounted on the vehicle wheel supporting member 8. Still further, a spring receiving member 10 is attached firmly to the left trailing arm 1 by welding. A coil spring is disposed between the spring receiving member 10 and the not-illustrated vehicle body.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As is the case with the aforementioned left trailing arm 1, also for the right trailing arm 2, a collar 12 is attached to one end of the right trailing arm 2, and a vehicle wheel supporting member 14 is attached firmly, by welding, to the other end of the right trailing arm 2. A spring receiving member 16 is attached firmly, by welding, to the right trailing arm 2.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The torsion beam 4 is pressed into an opening cross-sectional shape by folding a plate member. The cross-sectional shape is formed into an approximately U-shape or V-shape, i.e., into a saddle-like shape opening towards the lowerside of the vehicle body (see <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>).<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to the embodiment, expanded portions 18 and 20 are formed at both ends of the torsion beam 4, which bulge outwardly in a radial direction of the trailing arms 1 and 2. The expanded portions 18 and 20 bulge as if expanding outwardly from the outer peripheries of the trailing arms 1 and 2.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Cutouts 22 are formed at both of the expanded portions 18 and 20 (here, only one of the cutouts 22 being illustrated). As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the cutout 22 is formed at the expanded portion 20 of the torsion beam 4 at the side of the right trailing arm 2. The cutout 22 is formed in correspondence to the cross-sectional shape of the trailing arm 2, and, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the cutout 22 is formed penetrating along the axial direction of the trailing arm 2.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to the embodiment, the torsion beam 4 is formed into an approximately U-shaped cross-sectional shape, and the cutout 22 is formed penetrating both side walls 4a and 4b. The cutout 22 includes an opening 24 formed opening towards the trailing arm 2. The cutout 22 is formed into an approximately arc-shape so that an inner periphery of the cutout 22 comes in contact with the outer periphery of the trailing arm 2, i.e., so that the cutout 22 receives the trailing arm 2, when a joining<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> portion G of the trailing arm 2 is inserted into the cutout 22.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the trailing arm 2 has the joining position G and an inserting position I. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the joining position G of the trailing arm 2 is a position where both ends of the torsion beam 4 are connected, by welding, to the trailing arms 1 and 2. According to the embodiment, the inserting position I is provided at the trailing arm 2 in the vicinity of the joining position G.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the inserting position I is formed with grooves 26 and 28. According to the embodiment, two grooves 26 are formed at an upper-side outer periphery of the trailing arm 2, and two grooves 28 are formed at a lower-side outer periphery of the trailing arm 2. The grooves 26 and 28 are arranged approximately in parallel, respectively.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The upper-side grooves 26 and the lower-side grooves 28 are formed at the same relative positions along the axial direction of the trailing arm 2. The interval between the two upper-side grooves 26 is formed to be the same as the interval between the side walls 4a and 4b of the torsion beam 4 having the approximately U-shaped cross section.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The cutout 22 is configured such that the torsion beam 4 surrounds half or more of the outer periphery of the trailing arm 2 in a state where the trailing arm 2 is inserted into the cutout 22 of the torsion beam 4 and then the torsion beam 4 has moved to the joining position G. Accordingly, the opening 24 is formed into a size such that, even if the trailing arm 2 is to be inserted into the cutout 22 through the opening 24, at the joining position G of the trailing arm 2, the end of the torsion beam 4 impacts the outer periphery of the trailing arm 2 and the trailing arm 2 is not able to be inserted.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Further, the interval between the bottom of the upper-side groove 26 and the bottom of the lower-side groove 28 is formed smaller than the clearance of the opening 24. Therefore, it is configured such that the trailing arm 2 is inserted into the cutout 22 from the radial direction by aligning the upper-side and lower-side grooves 26 and 28 to the cutout 22.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Further, it is configured such that the torsion beam 4 is moved to the joining position G by moving the torsion beam 4 in the axial direction of the trailing arm 2 after inserting the trailing arm 2 into the cutout 22. The torsion beam 4 and the trailing arm 2 are connected together by welding along the torsion beam 4 after moving the torsion beam 4 to the joining position G.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> The same cutout as the cutout 22 at the side of the trailing arm 2 is formed at the end of the torsion beam 4 at the side of the left trailing arm 1. The left trailing arm 1 is also formed with a joining position G and an inserting position I having grooves.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Next described below is a method of assembling the torsion beam type suspension of the embodiment. Regarding the left and right trailing arms 1 and 2, the collars 6 and 12 are welded to the ends thereof, the vehicle wheel supporting members 8 and 14 are welded to the other ends thereof, and the spring receiving members 10 and 16 are welded thereto, respectively. Further, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, the cutout 22 at the right-side end of the torsion beam 4 is aligned to the grooves 26 and 28 of the inserting position I of the right trailing arm 2, and then the trailing arm 2 is inserted into the cutout 22 through the opening 24 at the grooves 26 and 28.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Then, the torsion beam 4 is moved relatively in the axial direction of the trailing arm 2, and then the cutout 22 of the torsion beam 4 is aligned to the joining position G of the trailing arm 2. Accordingly, the outer periphery of the trailing arm 2 comes into contact with the cutout 22 with no clearance therebetween, and the trailing arm 2 is connected to the torsion beam 4 by<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> welding along the cutout 22. The left trailing arm 1 is connected to the torsion beam 4 by welding in the same manner.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Next, an operation of the torsion beam type suspension of the embodiment will be described. During the vehicle running, when both left and right wheels travel in the same direction and at the same amount relative to the vehicle body, the torsion beam type suspension moves up and down in that orientation and no twisting occurs. However, when the vehicle body inclines, for example, by the centrifugal force applied to the vehicle body and the left and right wheels travel in opposite directions relative to the vehicle body, the torsion beam 4 is twisted and torsional reaction force is generated in proportion to its torsional stiffness.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Stress due to the torsional reaction force is generated at the welded portions between the torsion beam 4 and the trailing arms 1, 2. However, the torsion beam 4 has been welded to half or more of the outer periphery of each of the trailing arms 1 and 2, and it is thus possible to keep the welded length long, and the stress can be spread and generation of an excessive amount of stress due to stress concentration can be inhibited.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">As described above, the torsion beam 4 is connected, by welding, to the left and right trailing arms 1 and 2, without employing gussets, thereby enabling to reduce the number of components. Further, the torsion beam 4 can be connected to the trailing arms 1 and 2 maintaining the welded length shorter than the welded length obtained when welding the gussets, thereby enabling to reduce the welded length. Still further, the torsion beam type suspension according to the embodiment can be reduced in weight because gussets are not employed.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">According to the embodiment, a configuration that the grooves 26 and 28 are formed at the inserting position I is employed as an example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4A</figref>. However, the configuration is not limited to the above and may be such that the trailing arm 2 is inserted into the cutout 22 through the opening 24 without forming the grooves 26 and 28 on the trailing arm 2 and by setting the diameter of the trailing arm 2 smaller than the clearance of the opening 24. In this case, the cross-sectional shape of the inserting position I may be oval, oblong, round, or the like.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The present invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments.
