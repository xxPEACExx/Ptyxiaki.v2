With such a container, which is known from <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="NL1037285"><text>NL1037285</text></patcit> in the name of the present applicant, the container can be swung open from the closed position to an unfolded position by pivoting the side walls away from each other. Rigid side walls adjacent to each other are connected by flexible connecting side walls. In the closed position, access to the interior of the container is limited, whilst in the unfolded position the articles can be selected or displayed on the surface provided by said unfolding. Both the rigid side walls and the flexible connecting side walls are provided with edge elements which prevent the relative small articles from rolling off the surface.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">When the articles are to be put away again, the side walls and the connecting side walls are pivoted toward each other until the side walls<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> extend substantially transversely to the bottom wall and to each other. When this takes place, the articles move over the side walls and the connecting side walls in the direction of the bottom wall. Subsequently, a cover can be positioned on the side of the side walls remote from the bottom wall.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">With the container known from <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="NL1037285"><text>NL1037285</text></patcit> it is thus no longer necessary to tip over the contents of the container in order to find the desired article, for example in the case of Lego pieces for building a particular Lego structure.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Although the known device is quite satisfactory, it is a drawback of the known device that it is relatively costly to produce the rigid bottom wall, the rigid side walls that are pivotally connected thereto and the connecting side walls that are connected to the side walls. The known container comprises a relatively large blank in the unfolded position. As a result, a version of plastic material will be relatively costly because relatively large moulds must be used. It has furthermore been found that it is relatively difficult to realise the various material properties that are required, such as the combination of flexible connecting parts and rigid side walls, in the end product.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The object of the invention is to provide a container that can be produced in a relatively simple manner.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">This object is achieved with the container according to the invention in that the container is provided with a flexible holder element which is connected to the edge elements, wherein the flexible holder element extends over the bottom wall, the side walls, between adjacent side walls and between adjacent edge elements in the unfolded position of the container.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The bottom wall, the side walls and the edge elements can be made of one and the same plastic material. The bottom wall, the side walls and the edge elements can be produced as separate parts, which are subsequently joined together, or as a single blank. Openings are located<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> between adjacent side walls, which extend in different directions in the unfolded position. The flexible holder element extends over said openings. The flexible material extends further between the edge elements, which extend transversely to the side walls. In the unfolded position, the flexible material is stretched between the edge elements, as it were, in which position it extends substantially transversely to the side walls, just like the edge elements.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Surprisingly it has been found that the use of more parts makes it possible to produce the container at relatively lower cost. The use of relatively more parts leads to a greater functionality. The use of the flexible holder element and the edge elements placed on the side walls makes it possible to produce the container in a relatively simple manner and at low cost. In the closed position, the flexible holder element is located in the interior of the container and holds the articles. The flexible holder element has the advantage that, in co-operation with the edge elements, it forms a holder having a bottom surface and a circumferential wall in the unfolded position of the container for holding articles present on the bottom surface. The articles will thus remain in the interior of the container also in the unfolded position, thereby reducing the risk of the articles inadvertently being lost.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The flexible holder element can be made of any flexible material.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">It is noted that from <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US20060169690A1"><text>US 20060169690 A1</text></patcit> there is known a convertible container comprising a bottom wall and side walls hinged thereto. Said document, however, does not present a container having relatively rigid walls and rigid edge elements and a flexible holder element, which flexible holder element extends not only over the rigid walls and between the side walls but also over the edge elements and between the edge elements. As a result, the flexible element covers the openings between the side walls and at the same time forms an upright wall that extends between the edge elements.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">It is noted that from <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5542870A"><text>US 5,542,870 A</text></patcit> there is known a fold-out container comprising a bottom wall and side walls pivotally connected thereto. The side walls comprise triangular edge parts extending transversely thereto, which, in the closed position, form a cover extending parallel to the bottom wall. However, said document does not present a container provided with a flexible holder element that extends over the rigid walls, between the side walls and also over the edge elements and between the edge elements.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">One embodiment of the container according to the invention is characterised in that the flexible holder element forms an endless upright edge in the unfolded position over the edge elements and between the adjacent edge elements.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Because of the provision of the endless edge, relatively small articles are prevented from sliding or rolling off the bottom surface in a simple manner.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Another embodiment of the container according to the invention is characterised in that the flexible holder element forms a substantially regular octagonal surface, with the endless upright edge extending transversely thereto, in an unfolded position.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Such a regular octagonal surface is suitable for a container having a square bottom wall and identical side walls.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Preferably, both the bottom and the side walls are square. By using four side walls, a cube-shaped container is obtained. Using such a container, a relatively large area can be defined, whilst folding as well as unfolding can take place in a simple manner. Because of the relatively large area in an unfolded position, sorting and selecting the articles is relatively easy.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Another embodiment of the container according to the invention is characterised in that the flexible holder element is made of a cloth-like material.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Such a material is relatively inexpensive the textile-like material can be relatively thin, so that the textile-like material is easily deformable upon folding and unfolding the container. The textile-like material may be cotton or a synthetic material, for example.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Another embodiment of the container according to the invention is characterised in that the flexible holder element is undetachably connected to the edge elements.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In this way the holder element is prevented in a simple manner from becoming detached from the edge elements upon folding and unfolding of the container.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Another embodiment of the container according to the invention is characterised in that the flexible holder element is provided with means for connecting the flexible holder element to the edge elements.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">If the flexible holder element is connected to the edge elements by means of shell-shaped elements, Velcro or other detachable means provided on the flexible holder element, the flexible holder element can be easily detached, for example for being washed.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Another embodiment of the container according to the invention is characterised in that the container comprises a number of connecting elements, wherein at least each side wall and the bottom wall are pivotally connected via at least one connecting element.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">This makes it possible to use relatively simple walls. The connecting elements are preferably designed for engaging edges or edge portions of the walls.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Another embodiment of the container according to the invention is characterised in that the connecting element comprises a hook-shaped hinge element, which hook-shaped hinge element comprises two spring lips extending parallel to each other, which are connected near a first end and which are provided with barb-like elements at a second end remote from the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> first end, whilst the hook-shaped hinge element is provided with a hook-shaped element on a side of the first end remote from the second end.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The connecting element can be easily connected to the bottom wall by means of the lips, whilst the hook-shaped element can be connected to the side wall, or conversely.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Another embodiment of the container according to the invention is characterised in that the barb-like elements are located in an opening provided in the bottom wall, and that the hook-shaped element is in engagement with a pivot connected to the associated side wall, or vice versa.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The barb-like elements provide a solid connection between the connecting element and the wall in question. The hook-shaped hinge element that has been moved into engagement with the pivot provides a pivotable connection between the bottom wall and the side wall in a simple manner.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The hook-shaped hinge elements can be used in pairs. Two hook-shaped hinge elements are in that case used beside each other, with the hook-shaped elements facing away from each other and extending in opposite directions. The connecting elements are pivotable relative to the bottom wall upon connection of the hook-shaped elements, so that the hook-shaped elements can engage the pivot from opposite sides. Once the two hook-shaped elements surround the pivot, the connecting elements can be moved relative to the bottom wall, resulting in the barb-like elements being positioned in a further opening in the bottom wall and the lips abutting against a strip-shaped element of the bottom wall. In this locked position, the connecting elements are no longer pivotable relative to the bottom wall. Since the two hook-shaped elements engage around the pivot from different sides, disconnecting the hook-shaped elements is not possible. As a result, a substantially undetachably, pivotable connection between the bottom wall and the side wall is obtained. It is also possible, of course, for the pivot to be connected to the bottom wall and for the barb-like<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> elements of the connecting element can be connected to the side wall. Preferably, two pairs of hook-shaped hinge elements are used for each side wall.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Another embodiment of the container according to the invention is characterised in that the container comprises a number of coupling elements, wherein two adjacent side walls are detachably connected together in the closed position of the container via the interlocking coupling element and connecting element.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">By connecting the side walls together in the closed position of the container, undesirable unfolding of the container is prevented in a simple manner.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Another embodiment of the container according to the invention is characterised in that the coupling element comprises two spring lips extending parallel to each other, which are connected near a first end and which are provided with barb-like elements at a second end remote from the first end, whilst the coupling element is provided with a cam-shaped element on a side of the first end remote from the second end.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Such a coupling element can be connected to the side wall in a similar manner as the above-described connecting element. Preferably, it is connected to the side wall at a position spaced from the bottom wall, so that a good connection between the side walls is obtained.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Another embodiment of the container according to the invention is characterised in that the side walls include an angle of at least 135 degrees, preferably 180 degrees, with the bottom wall in the unfolded position.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">If an angle of at least 135 degrees is used, the container provides a kind of shell shape in the unfolded position, in which the articles that may be present therein are readily accessible to a user. The surface is formed by the bottom wall and the side walls that extend at an angle of 130 degrees or more with respect to the bottom surface. Preferably, the side walls lie substantially in the same plane as the bottom wall in the unfolded position,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> in other words, the side walls more or less include an angle of about 180 degrees with the bottom wall. In this way a relatively flat surface is provided, which can form an ideal playing surface for a child, for example.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Another embodiment of the container according to the invention is characterised in that the bottom wall and/or the side walls are made of a relatively rigid material, for example a rigid plastic.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In this way a container is obtained which exhibits robustness in the closed position thereof, whilst a maximal area is obtained in the unfolded position due to the use of the flexible holder element.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The invention further relates to a set of parts for forming a container as described in the foregoing, said set comprising a bottom wall, a number of separate side walls being pivotally connectable to the bottom wall, a number of separate edge elements, each edge element being connectable to a side wall, which edge element extends transversely to the side wall, spaced from the bottom wall; as well as a substantially flexible holder element, which is connectable to the edge elements, wherein the side walls, after connection of the parts into an assembled container, are pivotable from a closed position of the container, in which access to the bottom wall is limited, to an unfolded position of the container, in which access to the bottom wall is easier, in which unfolded position the flexible holder element extends over the bottom wall, the side walls, between adjacent side walls and between adjacent edge elements.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The invention is based on the surprising perception that the known container can be suitably assembled from a number of parts which in themselves are relatively small. Instead of integrally forming a blank by means of which the container can be placed in a closed position, the container is built up of separate parts.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In an unfolded position of the container, the flexible holder element forms, in co-operation with the edge elements, a holder having a bottom surface and a circumferential wall for holding articles present on the bottom<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> surface in place thereon. The articles will thus remain in the interior of the container also in the unfolded position, so that the risk of the articles inadvertently being lost is reduced.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">A special additional advantage of the set of parts is that the set can be packaged as a relatively compact whole, which thus takes up relatively little space, for example in a shop.

The container 1 comprises a bottom wall 2, to which four side walls 4a-4d are pivotally connected. The bottom wall 2 and the side walls 4a-4d are made of a relatively rigid material, for example a rigid plastic. <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows the situation with the container 1 in an unfolded position. In this position, the four side walls 4a-4d extend parallel to the bottom wall 2. Provided on each of the side walls 4a-4d is an edge element 6a-6d. The edge element 6a-6d extends transversely to the plane formed by the side wall 4a-4d. The edge element 6a-6d is mounted in openings in the side wall 4a-4d by means of hook-shaped pins.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The container 1 also comprises a flexible holder element 7. The flexible holder element 7 may be made of a textile material or of a flexible plastic material. The flexible holder element 7 comprises an octagonal layer of material, which is provided with an endless upright edge 8 at the octagonal outer circumference, which edge is preferably made of the same material. The upright edge 8 is provided with a receiving opening on the sides facing the bottom wall 2 and the edge elements 6a-6d, via which the holder element 7 can be connected to the edge elements in a simple manner. In a simple embodiment, the upright edge 8 provided with receiving openings is made of a textile material. To that end a piece of textile is affixed to each side of the octagon opposite the edge elements 6a-6d, with the end being folded toward the edge of the octagon. The flap is folded double, as it were. The side edges are then joined together, using a sewing or a glueing technique, for example. Thus a receiving opening for the edge element 6a-6d is formed. By connecting the side edges of each flap of the octagon to a side edge of an adjacent flap, an upright edge 8 is formed, which offers some resistance against deformation also in an unfolded<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> position. In the folded position, a cover element 9 can be placed on the container 1 so as to close the interior of the container.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Folding and unfolding the container can take place in a similar manner as already described in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="NL1037285"><text>NL 1037285</text></patcit>, which publication is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">As <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> clearly shows, the container 1 comprises substantially six identical wall elements, which together form a cube-shaped container 1 comprising a bottom 2, side walls 4a-d and a cover 9. Because of the use of six substantially identical wall elements, the production process is relatively simple and inexpensive. The use of several costly moulds is no longer necessary. Furthermore, this embodiment of the container 1 makes it possible for the container 1 to be transported as a construction kit comprising a set of parts and also to be offered and sold as such in a shop. The user must assemble the container himself.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> shows an overview of the set of parts. The set comprises a flexible holder 7, a number of walls, a number of edge elements 6 and a number of connecting elements 11 and coupling elements 12. Said parts are not shown to scale. A usual set comprises one flexible holder 7, which is octagonal in shape, one bottom wall 2, four side walls 4a-4d, which are all five identical, four edge elements 6 and sufficient connecting elements 11, 12 for pivotally connecting the four side walls 4a-4d to the bottom wall 2, and possibly for firmly connecting the edge elements 6 to the side walls 4a-4d. Each edge element 6 comprises short sides extending at an angle of 45 degrees to the longitudinal side. If desired, a cover 9 similar to the bottom wall 2 and the side walls 4a-4d may be added to the set.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The connecting element 11 is provided with a hook-shaped hinge element which comprises two spring lips 13, 14 extending parallel to each other, which lips are connected near a first end 15 and which are provided with barb-like elements 17 at a second end 16 remote from the first end. The<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> hook-shaped hinge element is provided with a hook-shaped element 18 on a side of the first end 15 remote from the second end 16.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The coupling element 12 comprises two spring lips 19 extending parallel to each other, which are connected near a first end 20 and which are provided with barb-like elements 22 at a second end 21 remote from the first end. The coupling element 12 is provided with a cam-shaped element 23 on a side of the first end 20 remote from the second end 21. The cam-shaped element 23 can be detachably clamped in the hook-shaped element 18, as will be explained in more detail yet below.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The walls 2, 4a-4d, 9 each have two pairs of connecting positions 25 on each longitudinal side 24 for connection to a connecting element 11 or a coupling element 12. Each connecting position 25 comprises a pivot 26 extending parallel to the longitudinal side 24 in question, a first opening 27, a strip 28 extending parallel to the pivot 26 and a second opening 29.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">To connect a side wall 4a-4d to the bottom wall 2, a connecting element 11 is provided at each pair of connecting positions 24 on the longitudinal side 24 of the bottom wall facing the side wall in question. To that end the barb-like elements 17 are pushed over the pivot 26 in the direction indicated by arrow P1 until the barb-like elements 17 are located in the opening 27. When this is done, the lips 13, 14 are urged apart against spring force. In this position, the connecting element 11 can pivot about the pivot 26. The hook-shaped elements 18 of two adjacent connecting elements 11 are connected to the pivot 26 in opposite sense, with the opening 30 of one hook-shaped element 18' facing up, seen in the plane of drawing of <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>, and the opening of the other hook-shaped element 18" facing down, seen in the plane of drawing of <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>. Subsequently, the hook-shaped elements 18', 18" are placed round the pivot 26 of the side wall 4d from both sides. Once the four connecting elements 11 are connected to the side wall 4, the side wall 4d and the connecting elements 11 connected thereto are moved in the direction indicated by arrow P1 toward the side wall 2. Upon<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> said movement, the lips 13, 14 are again urged apart against spring force until the barb-like elements 17 are located in the openings 29 and the lips 13, 14 abut against the strip 28 on either side. In this position the connecting element 11 can no longer pivot about the pivot 26 of the bottom wall 2. This position is shown at the connection between the side wall 4c and the bottom wall 2. Since the hook-shaped elements 18', 18" engage round the pivot 26 from both sides, the pivot 26 cannot undesirably become detached from the hook-shaped elements 18', 18". The bottom wall 2 and the four connecting elements 11 connected thereto can pivot about the four pivots 26 of the side wall 4d.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In a similar manner, all side walls 4a-4d are pivotally connected to the bottom wall 2. It is also possible to connect the barb-like elements 17 of the connecting elements 11 to the side walls 4a-4d and to connect the hook-shaped element 18 to the pivots 26 of the bottom wall 2.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">On two adjacent longitudinal sides 24 of two adjacent side walls 4c, 4d, a connecting element 11 is provided at the connecting position 25 furthest removed from the bottom wall 2 in the case of one side wall 4d and a coupling element 12 is provided at the connecting position 25 furthest removed from the bottom wall 2 in the case of the other side wall 4c. The connecting element 11 and the coupling element 12 are moved in the directions indicated by arrows P2, P3 until the barb-like elements 17, 22 are located in the openings 29 and the lips 13, 14; 19 abut against the strip 28 on either side. In the closed position of the container 1, the cam-shaped element 23 of the coupling element 12 is detachably clamped in the opening 30 of the hook-shaped element 18 of the connecting element 11.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059"><figref idrefs="f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">Figures 4-7</figref> show a second embodiment of a container 40 according to the invention. The container 40 comprises a blank 41 of plastic material, comprising a bottom wall 42 and four side walls 43, which are pivotally connected to the bottom wall 42 via fold lines 44. The blank 41 is made of polypropylene, for example. Each side wall 43 comprises, on either side<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> thereof, a connecting strip 45 extending transversely to the associated fold line 44. The connecting strips 45 are pivotally connected to the side wall 43 via fold lines 46. Adjacent connecting strips 45 of adjacent side walls 43 are provided with mating strips of Velcro 47, 48, by means of which the container 40 can be held in the closed position.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Each side wall 43 further comprises an edge element 49 (see <figref idrefs="f0007">figure 7</figref>), which extends parallel to the associated fold line 44.

The flexible holder element 53 comprises an octagonal bottom surface 54 and an upright endless edge 55 extending along the circumference of the bottom surface 53. The edge 55 extends transversely to the bottom surface 54. The flexible element 53 is made of a 80 - 100 g nonwoven polypropylene cloth, for example.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The endless edge 55 is glued to the edge elements 49 of the blank 41 with edge portions 56. Edge portions 57 of the endless edge 55 located between edge portions 56 extends between the short sides 51 of the edge elements 49. A central portion 58 of the bottom surface 54 extends over the bottom wall 42 and portions 59 extend over the side walls 43. Portions 60 of the bottom surface 54 extend over openings between adjacent side walls 43. The edge portions 56 are foldable about fold lines 61 relative to the portions 59. The edge portions 57 are foldable about fold lines 62 relative to the portions 60.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In the fully unfolded position, the edge elements 49 of the blank 41 and the edge portions 56 connected thereto of the flexible holder element 53 extend transversely to a base plane in which the bottom wall 42 and side<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> walls 43, are located. The edge portions 57 that extend between the short sides 51 of the edge elements 49 also extend transversely to the base plane.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065"><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref> shows an unfolded cloth of which the flexible holder element 53 is made. The edge portions 57 comprise a lip 64 near both ends, which lip is connected to the edge portion 57 via a fold line 65. The lip 64 extends along a short side 66 of the edge portion 56. The lip 64 is cut loose from the edge portion 56 along the short side 66. Then the edge portions 56, 57 are folded about the fold lines 61, 62 to an orientation transversely to the bottom surface 54. The lips 64 are folded about the fold lines 65, placed against the edge portions 56 and subsequently connected thereto by glueing or sewing. Thus the flexible holder element 53 comprising an upright endless edge 55 is obtained. The edge 55 preferably has a height of a few centimetres, for example 3 - 6 centimetres, so that on the one hand small articles are held within the flexible holder element 53 and on the other hand articles are readily accessible to a user.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066"><figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref> shows the container 40 in a partially unfolded position, in which two side walls 43 extend transversely to the bottom wall 42 and two side walls 43 extend parallel to the bottom wall 42.
