The user may change the address based on a current location of the user like in holiday's period using the holidays address.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A further component of the postal package delivery system may be a mobile user device being able to read tags. In case such a tag is a RFID tag the mobile user device comprises a RFID enabled tag reader. The mobile user device may be a mobile phone or a Personal digital assistant PDA alike device having certain communication facilities like short message service or email-capabilities or possibly short-range communication means such as WIFI or Bluetooth or wireless USB, or possibly long-range communication means such as 2G or 3G.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Finally there is a tag such as a RFID tag at least containing a unique reference number.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">. The mobile user device is coupled with the tag associating device TAG-ASSO over a communication connection such as a mobile communication connection GSM, WIFI Bluetooth or wireless USB.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The mobile user device additionally is equipped with a near field communications means for reading the associated tag such as a RFID tag.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">This user device also may be a fixed communications device having similar function modules like the tag reader.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The tag associating device TAG-ASSO is coupled to the user profile holding part UP based over a communication connection such as web services or may even be integrated in the tag associating device TAG-ASSO.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The tag associating device TAG-ASSO and the central tag resolution device TAG-RES are coupled over a web service. Alternatively both devices may be integrated in one housing.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The central tag resolution device TAG-RES is coupled to any of the Postal nodes TPN1, TPN2, TPN3 over a web service.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In order to explain the present invention it is assumed that a user A brings a package to the post office for delivering the package to a destination,<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> being user B. At first a tag such as an RFID tag is attached to the package to be delivered. The sender, user A for instance selects the destination of the package in from the list of contacts in its mobile phone. User B is selected as destination. Additionally user A reads the tag, i.e. the RFID tag and determines the reference number from the tag. Then the sender, user A, sends the tag just read, i.e. the RFID, the information on the selected destination, User B, with its unique (mobile) phone number (mobile ID) and the (mobile) telephone number of the sender telephone in a message towards the tag associating device TAG-ASSO that receives the message including the tag of the package, the telephone number of the destination and the telephone number of the sender.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The sender information as well as the destination information may additionally contain email addresses of respectively the sender and the destination.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The tag associating device TAG-ASSO will then resolve the received destination information into a detailed coordinates of both the sender and the receiver with the aid of the User Profile holding part UP. The User Profile holding part UP contains a list of records with the unique telephone numbers including mobile phone numbers as an identifier where each such telephone number is linked to an address of the owner of the telephone number. The association of telephone number and address may comprise additional personal information such as an email address, an Instant Messenger ID. Hence the User Profile holding part UP may contain a plurality of records, each record including a unique telephone number, address information an email address etc.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Here the physical addresses of the sender and the destination not necessarily needs to be their home address. In case the destination, user B, is on vacation outside the country, their "mobile" addresses will be resolved into the system and results in the holiday address. Hence, the package can be sent to a person instead of to an address. Afterwards, the tag associating device TAG-ASSO sends the tag, i.e. the RFID and detailed coordinates to the central tag resolution device TAG-RES. The central tag resolution device TAG-RES then is able to resolve the physical destination address associated with said tag<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> (i.e. the holidays address) of said package at request of a postal node TPN1. The postal node TPN1 then is able to forward the package based on the resolved destination address being the holiday's address of user B. As a consequence of the previous the package is forwarded to postal node TPN 2, which is a step closer to the destination for instance a postal center for international post.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Optionally a notification means of the receiving postal node TPN1 will send a message back User B (the message could be an SMS/email/instant message to the handheld/PC/mobile handheld of User B) saying "User A is going to send you a parcel" based on personal settings.

The package arrives at the hand of a distributor. Right before the distributor deliveries the parcel to the destination; he touches the tag, i.e. the RFID with his RFID enabled handheld. The handheld sends the RFID and mobile ID to the tag associating device TAG-ASSO. The tag associating device TAG-ASSO, recognizes the mobile ID is from a distributor and sends the RFID and an information &lt;letting is arriving&gt; to the postal node TPN3. Afterwards, the postal node TPN3 will first resolve the RFID into the phone number/email of User B, then sends a message to User B, e.g. "your parcel is going to arrive in an hour, please stay at home".</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">When User B receives the parcel, he touches the tag i.e. the RFID with his RFID enabled handheld.
