The tilt &amp; turn window 1 comprises a window frame 3 and a window pane 5, hingeable around a horizontal tilting axis 7 and a vertical turning axis 9, provided with a pane 9, present in it and connected to it.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The <figref idrefs="f0002">figures 3 and 4</figref> show a cross-section of the tilt &amp; turn window 1, respectively in the closed position and the tilted open position. The insect screen 11 has an accordion-shaped netting 13 and two profiles 15 and 17 attached to it. The netting has, seen from folding and unfolding direction, a first end edge 13a, and a second end edge 13b.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The profiles 15 and 17 extend in a U-shape and each has two parallel partial profiles 15a, 17a, as well as a horizontal partial profile 15b, 17b, which extends between the two vertical partial profiles. The horizontal partial profile is connected at the ends to the first ends of the vertical partial profiles. The other, second ends of the vertical profiles are connected to each other by hinges 19.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A first of the profiles 15 is connected to the first end edge 13a of the netting and is attached to window frame 3. The second profile 17 is connected to the second edge 13b of the netting and is detachably connected to window pane 5. The profiles can be switched between a first position in which the netting between the profiles is folded, see <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 3</figref>, and a second position in which the netting is unfolded, see <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 4</figref>. The second profile of the insect screen is, for instance by a magnet 21, which is connected to the partial profile 17a, detachably connected to the window pane 5, which is for this purpose provided with a ferromagnetic platelet 23.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The tilt &amp; turn window shown in the <figref idrefs="f0002">figures 3 and 4</figref> is provided with means to return the profiles automatically from the unfolded position to the folded position of the netting. These means are formed by two helical springs 25, one in each partial profile 17a. Each helical spring is attached at one end to the partial profile 17a. At the other end of the helical screw a cord 27 is attached that is diverted via a diversion element to partial profile 15a where the cord is attached to this partial profile.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">When opening the window pane 5 the helical springs 25 are stretched out. If profile 17 then is loose from the window pane 5 the helical springs 25 contract and profile 17 is drawn towards profile 15 until both profiles are in contact with each other.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In addition, the tilt &amp; turn window has a wire spring 28 that prevents the netting 13 from sagging. This wire spring 28 has a helical spring 28a, which functions as a torsion screw, with on each end of the helical springs the long arms 28b and 28c. In <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 5</figref> the tilt &amp; turn window is shown from above. The screw spring 28a is in the partial profile 17b and the spring arms 28b and 28c stretch out under the upper horizontal part of the netting 13 and support it. At the free ends the arms are bended to a loop 28d and 28e so the ends do not form sharp parts which could damage the netting.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The netting 13 is locked in the profiles 15 and 17. A detail of this lock is shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 6</figref>. In the partial profile 15b a strip 30 is pushed or clicked after the netting 13 first is attached with an edge in the partial profile. The C-shape of the partial profile 15b and the width of the strip 30 (width larger than opening in C-shape) ensure that the strip cannot be drawn out of the profile by the netting. The resilience of the netting and/or the clamping between the partial profile and the strip ensure that the netting cannot be easily drawn out between the strip and the partial profile.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref> shows a detail of the tilt &amp; turn window at the location of the hinge 19. This tilt &amp; turn window is provided with a second embodiment of the means. In this embodiment the means are formed by two torsion springs 29, one at the location of each hinge 19. Each torsion spring 29 is connected at one end to the partial profile 17a and at the other end with a part of the hinge which is connected to the partial profile 15a. The axis of the torsion spring coincides here with the hinge axis.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">When opening the window pane 5 the torsion springs 29 are twisted. When profile 17 then is detached from the window pane 5 the torsion springs 29 contract and profile 17 is pulled to profile 15 until both profiles are in contact with each other.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 8</figref> shows the tilt &amp; turn window provided with a third embodiment of the means. In this embodiment the means are formed by two weights 31, one in each partial profile 17a. These weights are adjustable in the partial profiles 17a. A cord 33 is attached to each weight 31 which has been diverted by a diversion element present in this partial profile 17a to partial profile 15a. The cord 33 is attached at the other end to this partial profile 15a.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">When opening the window pane 5 the weights 31 are lifted. When profile 17 then is detached from the window pane 5 the weights 31 slide down and profile 17 is pulled towards profile 15 until both profiles are in contact with each other.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Although in the above the invention is explained on the basis of the drawings, it should be noted that the invention is in no way limited to the embodiment shown in the drawings. The invention also extends to all embodiments deviating from the embodiment shown in the drawings within the context defined by the claims. The weights could also be present in the other partial profile 15a, for instance, or the helical springs can also be present in the other partial profiles 15a. Also one screw spring, which is then present in one of the horizontal partial profiles 15b or 17b, could suffice. The insect screen can also be provided with two of the shown means or all three.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977338" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Insect screen for a tilt &amp;
