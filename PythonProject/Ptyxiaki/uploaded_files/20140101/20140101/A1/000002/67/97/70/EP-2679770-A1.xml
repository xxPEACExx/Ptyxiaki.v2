The recess reaches as far as the disc-side base of the blade platform and the insert strip to have a form fit to the disc, which protects against axial displacement in a direction of inserting of the gas turbine blade.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US3834831A"><text>US 3,834,831</text></patcit> disclosures gas turbine engine, wherein cooling fluid may escape through radially directed passageways within the turbine blade or through a space between the adjacent blade platforms.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It has been accepted that a leakage flow will occur between the adjacent blade platforms of gas turbine blades. The air is used to cool the underside of the platforms before it<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> leaks into the gas path. Excessive cooling air leakage wastes valuable cooling air and has an impact on the engine efficiency. Currently the sealing of a blade root can have up to 3 small seals to cover the two vertical joints and the one horizontal joint making them difficult to assemble and prone to leaking when all components are hot.</p><heading id="h0003">Description of the invention</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is a first objective of the present invention to provide an advantageous seals strip, in particular for use in a gas turbine blade assembly. A second objective of the present invention is to provide an advantageous turbine blade assembly and an advantageous gas turbine. A third objective of the present invention is to provide an advantageous method for assembling a turbine blade assembly, for example a gas turbine blade assembly.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The first objective is solved by a platform seals strip as claimed in claim 1. The second objective is solved by a turbine blade assembly as claimed in claim 5 and by a gas turbine as claimed in claim 11. The third objective is solved by a method for assembling a turbine blade assembly as claimed in claim 12. The depending claims define further developments of the present invention.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The inventive platform seals strip, in particular for use in a gas turbine blade assembly, comprises an upper side and a lower side. It further comprises a first portion and a second portion. The width of the first portion is smaller than the width of the second portion, which means that the width of the first portion has a smaller value than the width of the second portion. The first portion and the second portion are at least partially bent downwards such that the upper side comprises a convex surface portion and the lower side comprises a concave surface portion. In other words, the first<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> portion and the second portion are bent towards the lower side.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">"Downward" may mean, once the seal strip is installed, in direction of an axis of rotation of the machine. "Downward" also defines the orientation of the bend in respect of the upper side and the lower side, meaning that "downward" is a motion in direction of the lower side.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">"Upper" and "lower" may merely define two opposite sides of the seal platform strip. Particularly "upper" may also mean, once the seal strip is installed, a direction away from of the axis of rotation of the machine. "Lower" may mean, once the seal strip is installed, a direction directed to the axis of rotation of the machine.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The invention seal strip may for example have an U-shape or a shape like an U. Convex surface portion or concave surface portion means that at least part of the surface has a curvature or bending which is convex if seen from the upper side or upper surface and which is concave if seen from the lower side or lower surface of the first portion or of the second portion. As a result of the bending the first portion may comprise an upper surface portion with a surface normal and the second portion may comprise an upper surface portion with a surface normal which includes an angle α with the surface normal of the first portion between 0° and 180°, which means 0° &lt; α ≤ 180°, advantageously between 90° and 180°.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The inventive seal strip has the advantage that inter seal leakage, for example between two adjacent blade platforms can be overcome by using a single piece seals strip.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Advantageously the inventive seal strip comprises a transition portion which is located between the first portion and the second portion. The width of the transition portion increases from the first portion to the second portion. Preferably<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the width of the transition portion continuously increases from the first portion to the second portion.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Generally the platform seal strip may comprise metal or may consist of metal.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Preferably the inventive seal strip comprises at least one nose. The nose may be located at the first portion or at the second portion. Advantageously one nose is located the first portion and an additional nose is located at the second portion. The nose is at least partially bent upwards such that the upper side of the seals strip with the nose comprises a concave surface portion and the lower side of the seal strip with the nose comprises a convex surface portion.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the context of the present invention the term nose describes a portion of the seal strip which is bent with respect to the adjacent first or second portion. For example, the nose may have a surface portion with a surface normal. The first portion or the second portion may comprise a surface adjacent to the nose. This surface may have a surface normal which may include an angle β with the surface normal of the nose portion between 0° and 180°, which means 0° &lt; β &lt; 180°, preferably between 60° and 90°.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The inventive turbine blades assembly comprises a number of platform seal strip, as previously described, a disc and a number of blades. Each blade comprises a blade platform. The blades are connected to the disc, for example loaded onto the disc. Each seal strip is placed in a gap between the blade platforms of adjacent blades.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The disc may comprise a rotation axis. The platform of each blade may comprise a side surface with a surface normal which includes a right angle with the rotation axis, especially when the blade is loaded onto a disc. The side surface of the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> platform may comprise a slot and part of the second portion of the seal strip engages in the slot.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Furthermore, the platform may comprise a leading edge side or upstream side and a trailing edge side or downstream side. The slot preferably extents up to the trailing edge side or downstream side. Generally the leading edge side of the platform is defined such that it corresponds to the leading edge of the aerofoil portion of the blade and the trailing edge side of the platform is defined such that it corresponds to the trailing edge of the aerofoil portion of the blade.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The disc can comprise a front face or upstream side and a rear face or downstream side, which are defined with respect to a hot gas flow through the turbine. A first cover plate or cover disc may be attached to the rear face of the turbine disc and/or a second cover plate may be attached to the front face of the turbine disc. Adding cover plates or cover discs to the front and/or rear face of the turbine disc assembly allows for making more efficient use of the cooling air. The cover plates or discs contain and direct cooling air in a more efficient manner than previously used, since they may comprise fluid channels for guiding cooling air.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">By means of the describe seal strip the sealing at the plate platform is improved. For example, the seal strip may comprise a nose which engages into a groove of the first cover plate or into a groove the second cover plate. Advantageously the seal strip comprises a first nose at the first portion and a second nose at the second portion. The first nose can engage into a groove of the cover plate at the front face and the second nose can engage into a groove of the cover plate at the rear face.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Preferably only one seal strip is located between two adjacent blades. This reduces the number of necessary components to be assembled and reduces the time for assembling.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The cover discs, especially the second cover discs or forward cover disc which is attached to the front face, may comprise a seal means, for example a C-seal or 0-ring or rope seal as appropriate. The seal means my comprise metal or may consist of metal. The seal means is preferably located such that it faces the leading edge side or the trailing edge side of the platform of the blade or the blade root.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The inventive gas turbine comprises a turbine blade assembly as previously described. It generally has the same properties and advantages as described in conjunction with the inventive seal strip and the inventive turbine blade assembly.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The inventive method for assembling a turbine blade assembly is related to a turbine blade assembly as previously described. The method comprises the steps of loading the number of blades onto the disc leaving a gap between the platforms of adjacent blades, inserting a seal strip into the gap between the platforms of two adjacent blades, and retaining the seal strips by attaching a first cover plate to the disc.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Advantageously a second cover plate, for example a forward cover disc, may be attached to the disc before loading the blades onto the turbine disc. If the second cover plate is identical with a forward cover disc, than the first cover plate is identical with an aft cover disc. The forward cover disc may be connected to the front face of the disc and the aft cover disc may be connected to the rear face of the disc.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Preferably a seal strip with at least one nose is used and the at least one nose is inserted into a groove in the first or in the second cover plate. Advantageously the seal strip comprises two noses and a first nose is inserted into a groove in the forward cover disc and the second nose is inserted into a groove in the aft cover disc.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Moreover, a seal means can be positioned between the first cover plate, for example the aft cover disc, and the turbine disc. Additionally or alternatively a seal means can be positioned between the second cover plate, for example a forward cover disc, and the turbine disc. A C-seal or an 0-ring or a rope seal can be used as seal means. The used seal means may comprise metal or may consist of metal.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The present invention improves the sealing of turbine hot blade components. By improving the sealing also the cooling of a turbine blade can be improved. Furthermore, the amount of cooling air consumed by the turbine blades can be reduced. Moreover, the lifetime of the components is increased, leakages are reduced and the cooling air efficiency is improved. Furthermore, the part count and assembly time is reduced.</p><heading id="h0004">Description of embodiments</heading><p id="p0031" num="0031">Further features, properties and advantages of the present invention will become clear from the following description of embodiments in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The turbine 105 comprises a number of turbine stages. Each turbine stage comprises rings of turbine blades. In flow direction 103 of the hot gas in the hot gas flow channel a ring of turbine guide vanes 117 is followed by a ring of turbine<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> rotor blades 115. The turbine guide vanes 117 are connected to an inner casing of a stator. The turbine rotor blades 115 are connected to the rotor.

Then, the blades 151 were loaded onto the disc 12, for example by inserting at least part of the blade root 19 into corresponding grooves 20 in the disc 12. Between adjacent platforms 151 a gap is left. After loading the blades 151 onto the disc 12 the seal strips 1 are inserted into the gap between the platforms 3 of adjacent blades 151. This is schematically shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 5 and 6</figref>. In <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref> the first portion 31 is inserted into the blade root cavity 15 via an opening between two adjacent blades 151 close to the slot 24 in the platforms 3. In doing so the seal strip 1 is canted over or turned. In <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 6</figref> the seal strip 1 is turned back into a correct position.

Part of the second portion 32 and part of the transition portion 35 of the seals strip 1 engages into the slots 24 of the adjacent blades 151. The nose 13 of the first portion 31 is inserted into the corresponding groove 10 in the forward cover disc 6. For retaining the seal strips 1 and the blades 151 a first cover plate, in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref> the aft cover disc 7, is attached to the disc 12. The nose 14 of the second portion 32 of the seal strip 1 is inserted or engages into the corresponding groove 11 of the aft cover disc 7.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Generally the present invention uses a single piece seal strip 1 to overcome inter seal leakage in order to make more efficient use of the cooling air. Cover discs 6 and 7 have been added to the front face 26 and the rear face 27 of the, for example CT, disc assembly. The cover discs 6 and 7 can contain and direct cooling air in a more efficient manner then in previously known solutions. The present layout gives<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> the opportunity to improve the sealing at the blade platform as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">5 to 7</figref>.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The benefit of the invention is that the seal strip 1 is a single piece, for example of metal, eliminating leaks and joint inter faces and making assembly easier. The assembly of the single piece strip is allowed due to profile of the strip as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref>. The narrow nose 13 allows it to be inserted into the gap between adjacent blades 151. The wider portion 32 of the strip then engages in the seal groove 24 machined into the side 23 of each blade 151, directly beneath the platform 3. The seal strip 1 is then pushed fully into the gap as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">Figures 5 to 7</figref>. Following the insertion of seal strips 1 the aft cover plate 7 is attached to retain the strip 1.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">To summarise, an embodiment of the invention is related to a platform seal strip 1, in particular for use in a gas turbine blade assembly, the platform seal strip 1 having sections that are substantially planar and sections that are curved. The platform seal strip 1 comprises an upper side 36 and a lower side 37. The platform seal strip 1 particularly being a sheet of metal that is three-dimensionally formed. The platform seal strip 1 comprises a first portion 31 - the first portion 31 being substantially planar - and a second portion 32 - the second portion 32 being substantially planar -, the width 33 of the first portion 31 being smaller than the width 34 of the second portion 32. The first portion 31 and the second portion 32 are connected via bent or curved sections, such that the upper side 36 comprises a convex surface portion 41, 42 and the lower side 37 comprises a concave surface portion 43, 44. The convex surface portion 41 and the concave surface portion 43 are opposite surfaces of the platform seal strip 1.
