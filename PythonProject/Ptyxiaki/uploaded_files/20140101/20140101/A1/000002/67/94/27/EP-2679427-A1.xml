The addition of oxygen to the pump environment may cause an explosion if the pump continues to operate after the crash. Several solutions have been proposed to turn off the pump in case of a crash.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Another potential problem during a crash is a fire starting near to the fuel system that is pressurized with fuel. Such fire could lead to an explosion.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Even though the occurrence of such a crash situation leading to such an explosion is rare, nevertheless, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method that improves the safety of a vehicle in case of an accident.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">To achieve the aforementioned and other objects, the present invention provides a method for controlling the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> depressurization of a fuel system mounted on board of a vehicle equipped with a vehicle impact sensor, wherein the method comprising the steps of:

As a result, the risk of an explosion and/or the damages caused by a potential explosion can be minimized.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is called impact sensor, a sensor that is able to detect a crash of the vehicle or the like.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The signal(s) generated by the controller of the invention can be a PWM (Pulse Width Modulated) type signal.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Depressurization means the fact to balance the internal fuel system pressure with the ambient pressure.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In a particular embodiment, the fuel system comprises a fuel tank connected in a communicating manner to a canister.

In an advantageous embodiment, each signal may contain, for example, information about the opening instant and the opening duration of the valve. In a first example, after analysing temperature and pressure data, the controller according to the invention may decide to activate (i.e. open) the FTIV valve only. In a second example, after analysing temperature and pressure data, the controller may decide to activate (i.e. open) at a first time the FTIV valve, and at a second later time the purge valve. Thus, the controller according to the invention can decide whether to activate the valves at the same time or at different times.

The fuel system is mounted on board of a vehicle. The fuel system comprises a fuel tank 1 that is in communication with a charcoal canister 2 via a venting line 4. The charcoal canister 2 has another venting line 5 connected to the intake manifold of the internal combustion engine (not shown). A purge valve 3 is disposed in the venting line 5 to allow for selective communication between the charcoal canister 2 and the intake manifold (not shown). There is an additional communication between the charcoal canister 2 and the atmosphere. This communication can be selectively controlled via a fuel tank isolation valve or FTIV 13 to create a completely sealed fuel system.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In the example illustrated on <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, the FTIV 13 is disposed in the venting line 16. When the FTIV 13 is opened, it allows the charcoal canister 2 to communicate with the atmosphere, and it allows fuel vapours within the fuel tank<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> 1 to flow towards the charcoal canister 2 to be surely captured. In another example (not illustrated), the FTIV 13 can be disposed in the venting line 4, and the venting line 16 can be left open.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the purge valve 3 and the FTIV valve 13 are both opened when the internal combustion engine is operated and allows for a canister purging mode. The purge valve 3 is closed and the FTIV valve 13 is opened when the vehicle is being refueled by the addition of gasoline to the fuel tank 1. The purge valve 3 and the FTIV valve 13 are both closed when the internal combustion engine is operated and the canister is not purged, or when the engine is not operated (vehicle parked). Further, in the case of a hybrid vehicle, the purge valve 3 and the FTIV valve 13 are both closed when the vehicle is operated solely under battery power.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In a configuration where the FTIV 13 is disposed in the venting line 16, an additional valve (not pictured) could be disposed in the venting line 4 for isolating the tank 1 from the canister 2 to avoid unwanted fuel vapour suction inside the air intake manifold during the canister purge mode.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The fuel system further comprises a pressure sensor 6 adapted for measuring the pressure inside the fuel tank 1. For example, the pressure sensor 6 is adapted to measure pressure comprised within a working range of pressure. For example this could be a range of -30mbar to +30mbar for the fuel system in a conventional internal combustion vehicle, or -150mbar to +350mbar in a plug-in hybrid vehicle.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The fuel system further comprises a temperature sensor 7 adapted for measuring the temperature inside the fuel tank 1. The fuel system further comprises a float-type fuel level sensor 8 adapted for measuring the fuel level inside the fuel tank 1. These sensors can be used for diagnostic purposes.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The present invention proposes a method which consists in using a controller for activating the depressurization of the fuel system in case of a detection of an impact or a crash of the vehicle. In the following of the description, it is described a particular embodiment where the controller according to the invention is comprised in the Fuel System Control Unit (FSCU) of the vehicle. In this particular embodiment, when a vehicle crash occurs, the FSCU controls the opening of the valve(s) of the fuel system, in order to release the internal pressure of the fuel system.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In another embodiment, the controller according to the invention can be comprised in the Central Control Unit (CCU) of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In yet another embodiment, the controller according to the invention can be comprised in a specific microprocessor which is distinct from the FSCU or the CCU.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Referring back to <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, a Fuel System Control Unit (FSCU) 9 is configured to execute an algorithm for releasing the pressure within the fuel system in case of a vehicle crash event. To this end, the FSCU 9 is capable of generating control signal(s) for opening the purge valve 3 and/or the FTIV valve 13. The FSCU 9 communicates with a Central Control Unit 10 (i.e. an engine control unit (ECU)) via of a communication bus 11.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The FSCU 9 can manage the operating conditions and functioning parameters of the fuel system. The FSCU generally:
<ul><li>has means for controlling functions of the fuel system,</li><li>is connected with at least one fuel system component to send signals or receive signals from said at least one fuel system component,</li><li>is connected with at least one sensor that sends signals to the FSCU and/or the ECU,</li><li>is adapted to electronically and bi-directionally communicate with the ECU.</li></ul></p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The FSCU is a standalone controller, different from the ECU and which has taken over the control of the fuel system from the ECU, i.e. the ECU doesn't directly control the fuel system any longer. The FSCU communicates with the ECU also for indication of any fuel system failure to the ECU.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Reliability is increased by segmenting control of the fuel system away from the ECU, reducing load on the ECU.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The ECU 10 can activate a Malfunction Indicator Light 12 (MIL) on the dashboard of the vehicle when operation problem is detected.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In the example illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, an airbag crash sensor 14 and/or other crash sensors 15 exist to provide a signal when an impact or other similar event occurs. This signal is transmitted to the FSCU 9. Once received, the FSCU 9 generates a signal S1 for controlling the opening of the FTIV valve 13, and a signal S2 for controlling the opening of the purge valve 3. By this way, the pressure within the fuel system can be released and the risk of an explosion can be minimized.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In another example, the controller according to the invention can also generate a signal for controlling the opening of an additional valve disposed in the venting line 4.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In another embodiment, the signal provided by the sensors 14 and 15 can be transmitted directly to the ECU 10.
