Taking a slot-type coating device as an example, the slot-type coating device is suitable for a film-coating process of large area. The coating device has a restrictor, and liquid is conveyed into the coating device by a measuring pump, and then outflows from a slot outlet of the coating device. The measuring pump can provide a stable supply of liquid. Therefore, the degree of uniformity for the coating liquid of the coating device will depend on the smoothness of the surface of the restrictor.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The coating device is generally formed by using two stainless steel modules to hold a shim. The shim has a restrictor and a diversion structure connecting the restrictor thereon, in which the diversion structure is, for example, a flow channel or a manifold so as to guide the liquid into the restrictor. The diversion structure mainly includes three types: T-die type structure, fishtail type structure and coat-hanger type structure. The processing<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> and fabrication of the T-die type structure are more easily and able to make the flow rate of the liquid uniformly distributed, but the liquid is easy to form residue at the end of the manifold. The fishtail type structure enables the liquid to be uniformly spread in the flow channel, but the liquid is easy to form a recirculation zone in the diversion structures to affect the flow rate. The coat-hanger type structure can reduce the problems for the T-die type structure and the fishtail type structure to respectively produce the residue zone or the recirculation zone, but they are disadvantageous in complicate design and higher production cost. Therefore, the film-coating process usually employs a coating device with different diversion structure according to the coating liquid characteristic and the coating method, which makes a coating device very difficult to be shared for different film-coating processes.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">On the other hand, in order to uniformly coating with a liquid by a coating device, the surface of the shim used to form the diversion structure and the restrictor, particularly the surface of the restrictor, must have high smoothness. Therefore, the shim requires lapping and polishing to increase the surface smoothness thereof. And, if the shim has a diversion structure with more complicate design, the shim needs for additional machining on each processing surface followed by lapping and polishing, so that the liquid can flow on the shim uniformly. These processes increase the manufacturing cost of the coating device. Further, when the restrictor of such a coating device gets worn, it is necessary to replace the shim to ensure the uniformity of the coating fluid. Thus, such a coating device has higher manufacturing costs, which accordingly indirectly increases the production cost of the products by using these coating devices for film-coating process.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Accordingly, the disclosure is directed to a coating module with lower production cost and better reusability.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The disclosure provides a coating module suitable for coating a liquid onto a substrate and includes two plates and a diversion structure, in which there is a slot between the plates, an end of the slot has a slot inlet, the other end of the slot has a slot outlet, and one of the plates has an injecting port.

At the time, to handle the surface wearing problem of the slot 212 in the coating module 200 or 200a or 200b, only the plates 210a and 210b need to be replaced without replacing the whole coating module 200 or 200a or 200b, which makes the coating module 200 and 200a and 200b have lower production cost and better reusability.<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --></p><p id="p0084" num="0084"><figref idrefs="f0014">Fig. 12</figref> is a cross-sectional diagram of the coating module according to yet another embodiment of the disclosure.
