When personal information is required for the estimated function, the process (S114) of calculating a similarity between the first and the second voice recognition data when personal information is required for the estimated function is carried out. Here, the similarity can express a rate at which the number of characters or words coincident with each other within texts being compared to each other.

Accordingly, the selected second voice recognition data may be used to execute the estimated function. At this time, the estimated function may be modified or complemented by the selected second voice recognition data for its execution.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">On the other hand, the process (S122) of ignoring the second voice recognition data is carried<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> out when personal information is not required for the estimated function.
