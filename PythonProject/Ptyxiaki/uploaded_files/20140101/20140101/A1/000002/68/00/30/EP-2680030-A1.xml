A distance between the distance measuring apparatus and the object may be calculated in accordance with a difference between a time at which the laser pulse is generated and a time at which the reflected light is received by the light receiving device.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Normally, the laser pulse is generated by applying a pulse-shaped driving current to a semiconductor laser diode and undergoes form shaping into a light beam which includes a predetermined light beam profile via an optical coupling device such as a coupling lens, etc., so as to be released out of the distance measuring apparatus. While a light reflected from a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> surface to be detected is scattered in a random direction at a reflection point thereof, only a light component reflected following an optical path which is equal to that of a light beam released from the distance measuring apparatus is input into the apparatus again. Here, coaxial optics in which the optical axis of the optical device which makes up the light receiving unit and the optical axis of the light projecting unit are matched is adopted to cause the reflected light input into the distance measuring apparatus to be guided to the light receiving device.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Moreover, there is also a scanning laser radar which is provided, at a latter stage of the optical coupling device, with an optical scanner which scans the light beam in a horizontal direction. As the optical scanner, a polygon mirror, a galvanometer mirror, etc., are used. A laser beam can be scanned by a mirror device to perform distance measurement for a wide range of regions in the horizontal direction.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Furthermore, in recent years, performing detection by measurement region division in a vertical direction as well as expansion of a measurement range in the horizontal direction may be required. In combination with scanning in the horizontal direction, distance measurement data can be drawn on a two-dimensional plane. As a measure of conveniently achieving the region division in the vertical direction, a method in which slant angles are provided on reflection faces of a rotating polygon mirror relative to a rotating axle thereof, such that the slant angles are varied relative to the multiple reflection faces, or a configuration in which multiple of the light receiving devices are lined up in the vertical direction is adopted.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As described above, there is known, in the related art, a method of dividing the detection region in the vertical direction by lining up multiple of the light receiving devices in the vertical direction to perform measurement in the laser distance measuring apparatus in which the light projecting unit and the light receiving unit are arranged as the coaxial optics.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, while it is necessary to accurately adjust the optical axes of the light projecting unit and the light receiving unit in the laser distance measuring apparatus in<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> which the multiple light receiving devices are lined up in the vertical direction, no specific adjusting methods or adjusting apparatuses are disclosed, making it difficult to accurately adjust the optics.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">There is a problem that, when the optical axes of the light projecting unit and the light receiving unit are offset from an ideal state, a region in which the light beam irradiates the object to be measured and a region in which the light receiving device receives light are mutually offset, so that a region which is different from a proper measurement region is detected, a detection signal strength is reduced, etc.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Patent Document 1 discloses an adjusting method which, for an object of performing detection area position adjustment of a laser radar apparatus, a detection signal for reflection targets whose reflection faces are bent is monitored to fix the apparatus to a vehicle body at an appropriate position and, thereafter, correction by software is used to specify a detection area as a predetermined region.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the method disclosed in Patent Document 1, optical axis adjustment is performed using the reflection targets having different distances from the laser distance measuring apparatus in the optical axis direction. However, the method disclosed in Patent Document 1 represents a method of specifying a detection region when a laser radar unit whose optical axis adjustment has been completed in advance is installed onto the vehicle body, so that an optical axis adjusting method of the light projecting and light receiving units in the unit body or a laser distance measuring module in which the multiple light receiving devices are arranged is not disclosed. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately divide, into multiple regions, a measurement angle range in the vertical direction to perform detection.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Patent Document</u></heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Document 1: JP2002-174684A</heading><heading id="h0005"><u>DISCLOSURE OF THE INTENTION</u></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">An object of the present invention is to provide, in a laser distance measuring apparatus in which a measurement angle range is divided into multiple regions in a vertical direction<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> to perform detection of an object, a target for optical axis adjustment that is for accurately adjusting an optical axis of an emitting light beam and an optical axis of a light receiving device.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to an embodiment of the present invention, an optical axis adjusting apparatus for a laser apparatus is provided, the optical axis adjusting apparatus including a modulated light beam generating unit which includes a light source and a coupling lens to release a light beam to irradiate the released light beam to a detection target; multiple light receiving devices which receive light reflected from the detection target; a reflected light collecting unit which collects light reflected from the detection target to guide the collected light to the multiple light receiving devices; and first and second targets, wherein the multiple light receiving devices are arranged along a vertical direction relative to a releasing direction of the light beam such that the detection target is divided into multiple detection regions, wherein the first target and the second target are arranged such that a distance thereto from the laser apparatus in an emitting direction of the light beam mutually varies, wherein a width in a vertical direction relative to the emitting direction of the light beam of the first target is formed to be smaller than an irradiating width in the vertical direction of the light beam, and wherein one of the multiple light receiving devices is installed at a position which receives only a reflected light from the first target.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention makes it possible to provide, in a laser distance measuring apparatus in which a measurement angle range is divided into multiple regions in a vertical direction to perform detection of an object, an adjusting method and a target for optical axis adjustment that are for accurately adjusting an optical axis of an emitting light beam and an optical axis of a light receiving device.</p><heading id="h0006">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> descriptions when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:

Moreover, while not shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, an optical scanning mechanism which includes a rotating mirror, etc., may be provided in the back of the light projecting unit to scan the light beam in a horizontal direction (an X-axis direction).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A modulated laser light released from the light source 2 becomes a light beam having a predetermined divergence angle after passing through the coupling lens 3, and then is released from the laser distance measuring apparatus 1 as a projected beam 8 in a direction parallel to a Z axis, after which it irradiates an object to be detected 9. A light reflected by the object to be detected 9 is scattered in a uniform direction at a reflection point thereof, only a light component reflected following an optical path which is equal to that of a light beam released from the laser distance measuring apparatus 1 is guided to the light receiving devices 4a, 4b, and 4c via light receiving optics such as the light receiving lens 5, etc., within the laser distance measuring apparatus 1 and detected as a reflection signal.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A light beam irradiating angle range in the vertical direction (a Y-axis direction) is specified by a beam divergence angle in the vertical direction of the projected beam 8 which is released from the laser distance measuring apparatus 1. The beam divergence angle in the vertical direction depends on a focal distance of the coupling lens 3 and a light emitting width of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the light source 2, so that both values are controlled to cause the light beam having a desired divergence angle in the vertical direction to be released from the laser distance measuring apparatus 1.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">On the other hand, the reflected light from the object to be detected 9 returns to a light receiving mirror following the same path as the projected beam 8, so that a reflected light beam 10 which is coupled by the light receiving lens 5 also has a divergence angle equivalent to a divergence angle of the projected beam 8 in the vertical direction. Therefore, in an XY plane on which the light receiving devices 4a, 4b, and 4c are arranged, the reflected light beam 10 which passed through the light receiving lens 5 is collected at a position which is moved in the Y-axis direction from an optical axial center of the light receiving lens 5 in accordance with an angular component thereof.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates how the reflected light 10 from a topmost region as one example is input into the third light receiving device 4c via the light receiving lens 5.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Using this characteristic, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, multiple of the light receiving devices 4a, 4b, 4c may be arranged along the vertical direction to divide the detection region 11 in the vertical direction to obtain distance information. A focal distance of the light receiving lens 5 and a detection width in a Y-axis direction of all of the light receiving devices 4a, 4b, and 4c are controlled, so that a detection angle range in the vertical direction is determined. Moreover, this detection angle range is set equivalently to the above-described light beam irradiating angle range and the light receiving devices 4a, 4b, 4c are divided into multiple regions in the Y-axis direction to detect the respective reflected light signals, making it possible to divide the detection range in the vertical direction.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref> schematically illustrate the region in which the light beam released from the laser distance measuring apparatus irradiates a detection target and the region in which the multiple light receiving devices lined up in the vertical direction may respectively receive light.

The reason is that, when the irradiating regions 21, 31, 41 are smaller than the desired detection region, a region to be detected is not irradiated by a laser light to be a probe, making detection impossible, while, when the irradiating regions 21, 31, 41 are much larger than the desired detection region, power density of the light beam which irradiates an object to be detected decreases, so that, not only a reflected light strength decreases, but also a reflected light from an unintended region is detected as a stray light, causing reliability of measurement to decrease.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">For the same reason, it is preferable that the whole light receiving region which puts together divided light receiving regions 21a, 21b, 21c, 31a, 31b, 31c, 41a, 41b, and 41c also is the same as or a little larger than the desired detection region. The reason is that, when a detection range is too wide relative to the desired detection region, a light other than a reflected light from the detection target (for example, a light from an object irradiated by sunlight, or a laser light released from a different distance measuring apparatus and a reflected light thereof) is detected as a stray light, causing reliability of measured results to be lost.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As described above, it is desirable that the above-described irradiating region and the whole light receiving region are set to be regions which are mutually almost equal.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> shows an ideal relationship between the irradiating region and the light receiving region.

In either case, a region in which the irradiating region and the light receiving region overlap becomes small, so that the overlapping region merely occupies a limited range of an originally desired detection region. Therefore, a decrease in detection sensitivity of the reflected light occurs, causing reliability of measured results to be lost.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As described above, for a proper detection, it is necessary to adjust a relative position between the light receiving device which makes up the light receiving unit and the optical device which makes up the light projecting unit such that the irradiating angle and the light receiving angle mutually match.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an adjusting apparatus which adjusts the light projecting unit and the light receiving unit of the laser distance measuring apparatus.

Here, a target with a small relative length in the vertical direction that is arranged at a position close to the laser distance measuring apparatus 1 is to be called the first target 59a, while a target with a large relative length in the vertical<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> direction that is arranged at a position far from the laser distance measuring apparatus 1 is to be called the second target 59b.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">A size of the target that is preferable for the adjusting method according to the present invention is described. <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> shows a relationship between an irradiating range of the projected beam and the size of the target. The second target 59b has dimensions which are larger than any of the irradiating ranges in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction of the projected beam 8. Therefore, the laser light is not irradiated in the back of the second target 59b. In this way, releasing of the laser light to the outside of the adjusting apparatus 50 is prevented, so that safety for people which are present outside of the adjusting apparatus 50 is maintained.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">On the other hand, for the first target 59a, the size in the vertical direction thereof is set to be around the same size as that of one light receiving range out of the multiple light receiving devices. <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> shows an example of arrangement of a target when three light receiving devices are arranged along the vertical direction such that the light receiving regions are divided into three regions. Here, the first target 59a has a size corresponding to a center region of the three divided regions. Generally, sizes of the multiple light receiving devices are set to mutually equal sizes and a width in the vertical direction of the first target 59a generally becomes around 1/3 of the irradiating region of the projected beam 8.

As the width in the horizontal direction of the first target 59a is set larger than a<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> horizontal width of the projected beam, two irradiating regions which are mutually separated in the vertical direction are formed on the second target 59b in the back of the first target 59a.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Moreover, as a different embodiment of the first target 59a, with a width of the horizontal direction thereof being set to be of sufficiently large dimensions relative to an irradiating width in the horizontal direction of the projected beam, what draws, on the surface thereof, an irradiating target position of the projected beam may be used.

From expression (1), the inter-target distance corresponding to the time difference of 5 nanoseconds is determined to be 0.75 m. When accurate adjustment is applied, it becomes necessary to detect a reflected light from a target 2 after a trailing portion of the reflection signal from the target 1 has attenuated sufficiently, so that it is desirable to arrange the inter-target distance to have a separation of at least around 1 m.</p><heading id="h0010">Example 3</heading><p id="p0051" num="0051">Next, explanations of a preferable distance between a laser distance measuring apparatus and a target are given using <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 13.

Therefore, making adjustment with a distance of the target and the laser distance measuring apparatus shortened in an extreme manner, possibly causing adjustment to be completed at a position which is offset from a predetermined detection<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> region. Therefore, in principle, it is preferable that optical axis adjustment is embodied by placing a target as far as possible from the laser distance measuring apparatus.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">However, adjustment of the optical device, which needs to be embodied under an environment in which temperature, etc., are precisely controlled, is embodied indoors by necessity. Therefore, it is impossible to separate, in an extreme manner, a distance between the target and the laser distance measuring apparatus. The reason is that, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>, such a separation causes a projected beam to be irradiated to a floor 13 or a ceiling 14 in an adjustment environment, making it difficult to irradiate a projection beam 1308 only onto a target 1309.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">A divergence angle in the vertical direction of the projected beam released from a general laser distance measuring apparatus is around 1 to 10 degrees. Moreover, a height of the laser distance measuring apparatus 1 from the floor 13 is around 1 m. Adjusting at a position which is higher than the above makes work difficult and should be avoided from an eye safety point of view, as the projected beam 1308 released from the laser distance measuring apparatus 1 gets into the eyes of a direct working personnel.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">When the divergence angle in the vertical direction of the projected beam is 1 degree, the projected beam 1308 irradiates the floor 13 in a range which is farther than 114 m, making it possible to separate around 100 m between the laser distance measuring apparatus 1 and the target 1309. However, when the divergence angle in the vertical direction of the projected beam 1308 is 10 degrees, the light beam irradiates the floor in a range which is farther than 11 m, making it not possible to arrange the target at a position which is farther away therefrom. In view of the above, a distance between the laser distance measuring apparatus 1 and the target 1308 is appropriately set in accordance with a divergence angle of the projected beam 1308 in a range of between 5 m and 100 m.</p><heading id="h0011">Example 4</heading><p id="p0056" num="0056">Next, Example 4 is described.

In order to solve this problem, it is effective to set a reflectance of the target 2 to be higher than a reflectance of the target 1. As a specific target material, a black napped material with low reflectance may be used for the first target, while a reflector plate on which fine glass beads or corner reflectors are lined up, etc., may be used for the second target.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058"><figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 14</figref> is a diagram for explaining advantageous effects of mutually varying target reflectances.
