The mobile terminal 100 may be implemented by greater or fewer components.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Hereinafter, each of the above components 110-190 will be explained.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The wireless communication unit 110 typically includes one or more components allowing radio communication between the mobile terminal 100 and a wireless communication system or a network in which the mobile terminal is located. For example, the wireless communication unit may include at least one of a broadcast receiving module 111, a mobile communication module 112, a wireless Internet module 113, a short-range communication module 114, and a location information module 115.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The broadcast receiving module 111 receives broadcast signals and/or broadcast associated information from an external broadcast management server (or other network entity) via a broadcast channel. The broadcast associated information may refer to information associated with a broadcast channel, a broadcast program or a broadcast service provider. The broadcast associated information may also be provided via a mobile communication network and, in this case, the broadcast associated information may be received by the mobile communication module 112. Broadcast signals and/or broadcast-associated information received via the broadcast receiving module 111 may be stored in the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> memory 160.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The mobile communication module 112 transmits and/or receives radio signals to and/or from at least one of a base station, an external terminal and a server. Such radio signals may include a voice call signal, a video call signal or various types of data according to text and/or multimedia message transmission and/or reception.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The wireless Internet module 113 supports wireless Internet access for the mobile communication terminal. This module may be internally or externally coupled to the mobile terminal 100. Here, as the wireless Internet technique, a wireless local area network (WLAN), Wi-Fi, wireless broadband (WiBro), world interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), and the like, may be used.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The short-range communication module 114 is a module for supporting short range communications. Some examples of short-range communication technology include Bluetooth<sup>™</sup>, Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID), Infrared Data Association (IrDA), Ultra-WideBand (UWB), ZigBee<sup>™</sup>, and the like.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The location information module 115 is a module for acquiring a location (or position) of the mobile communication terminal. For example, the location information module 115 may include a GPS (Global Positioning System) module.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The A/V input unit 120 is configured to receive an audio or video signal. The AN input unit 120 may include a camera 121 and a microphone 122. The camera 121 processes image data of still pictures or video acquired by an image capture device in a video capturing mode or an image capturing mode. The processed image frames may be displayed on a display unit 151. The image frames processed by the camera 121 may be stored in the memory 160 or transmitted via the wireless communication unit 110. Two or more cameras 121<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> may be provided according to the configuration of the mobile communication terminal.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The microphone 122 may receive sounds (audible data) via a microphone in a phone call mode, a recording mode, a voice recognition mode, and the like, and can process such sounds into audio data. The processed audio (voice) data may be converted for output into a format transmittable to a mobile communication base station via the mobile communication module 112 in case of the phone call mode. The microphone 122 may implement various types of noise canceling (or suppression) algorithms to cancel (or suppress) noise or interference generated in the course of receiving and transmitting audio signals.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The user input unit 130 may generate key input data from commands entered by a user to control various operations of the mobile communication terminal. The user input unit 130 allows the user to enter various types of information, and may include a keypad, a dome switch, a touch pad (e.g., a touch sensitive member that detects changes in resistance, pressure, capacitance, etc. due to being contacted) a jog wheel, a jog switch, and the like.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The sensing unit 140 detects a current status (or state) of the mobile terminal 100 such as an opened or closed state of the mobile terminal 100, a location of the mobile terminal 100, the presence or absence of a user's touch (contact) with the mobile terminal 100 (e.g., touch inputs), the orientation of the mobile terminal 100, an acceleration or deceleration movement and direction of the mobile terminal 100, etc., and generates commands or signals for controlling the operation of the mobile terminal 100. For example, when the mobile terminal 100 is implemented as a slide type mobile phone, the sensing unit 140 may sense whether the slide phone is opened or closed. In addition, the sensing unit 140 can detect whether or not the power supply unit 190 supplies power or whether or not<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the interface unit 170 is coupled with an external device.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The sensing unit 140 may include a proximity sensor 141. And, the sensing unit 140 may include a touch sensor (not shown) for sensing a touch operation with respect to the display unit 151.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The touch sensor may be implemented as a touch film, a touch sheet, a touch pad, and the like. The touch sensor may be configured to convert changes of a pressure applied to a specific part of the display unit 151, or a capacitance occurring from a specific part of the display unit 151, into electric input signals. Also, the touch sensor may be configured to sense not only a touched position and a touched area, but also a touch pressure.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">If the touch sensor and the display unit 151 have a layered structure therebetween, the display unit 151 may be used as an input device rather than an output device. Such display unit 151 may be called a 'touch screen'.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">When touch inputs are sensed by the touch sensors, corresponding signals are transmitted to a touch controller (not shown). The touch controller processes the received signals, and then transmits corresponding data to the controller 180. Accordingly, the controller 180 may sense which region of the display unit 151 has been touched.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">When the touch screen is implemented as a capacitance type, proximity of a pointer to the touch screen is sensed by changes of an electromagnetic field. In this case, the touch screen (touch sensor) may be categorized into a proximity sensor 141.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The proximity sensor 141 indicates a sensor to sense presence or absence of an object approaching to a surface to be sensed, or an object disposed near a surface to be sensed, by using an electromagnetic field or infrared rays without a mechanical contact. The proximity sensor 141 has a longer<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> lifespan and a more enhanced utility than a contact sensor.
