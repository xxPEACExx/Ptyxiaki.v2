Therefore, because an output image of a single-panel type color imaging device is a RAW image (mosaic image), a multi-channel image is obtained by processing to interpolate a pixel of a missing color from the surrounding pixel (synchronization processing). In this case, there is a problem of a reproduction characteristic of a high-frequency image signal. In the color imaging device, aliasing is easily generated in a captured image as compared with an imaging device for black-and-white. Therefore, there is an issue in which it is important that high-resolution is achieved by expanding a reproduction band while suppressing occurrence of color moire (false color).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In a primary color system Bayer array that is a color array of a color filter that is widely used in the single-panel type color imaging device, green (G) pixels are arranged in a checkered pattern, and red (R) pixels and blue (B) pixels are arranged line-sequentially. Therefore, there is a problem of reproduction accuracy when a high frequency signal is generated in the diagonal directions for the G signal and reproduction accuracy when a high frequency signal is generated in the horizontal and vertical directions for the R and B signals.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In a case in which a black-and-white vertical stripe pattern (high frequency image) as illustrated in (A) in <figref idrefs="f0019">Figure 22</figref> enters a color imaging device having a color filter of a Bayer array illustrated in (B) in <figref idrefs="f0019">Figure 22</figref>, when the entered pattern is allocated to a Bayer color array and compared for each color, as illustrated in (C) to (E) in <figref idrefs="f0019">Figure<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> 22</figref>, a color image of R in light flat, a color image of B in dark flat, and a color image of G in light/dark mosaic are generated. The black-and-white image in which there is no concentration difference (level difference) between R, G, and B, originally, becomes in a state of being colored depending on a color array and an input frequency.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Similarly, in a case in which a diagonal black-and-white high frequency image as illustrated in (A) in <figref idrefs="f0020">Figure 23</figref> enters an imaging device including color filters of a Bayer array illustrated in (B) in <figref idrefs="f0020">Figure 23</figref>, when the entered pattern is allocated to a Bayer color array and compared for each color, as illustrated in (C) to (E) in <figref idrefs="f0020">Figure 23</figref>, color images of R and B in light flat and a color image of G in dark flat are generated. When it is assumed that a black value is 0 and a white value is 255, the diagonal black-and-white high frequency image becomes in green because only G becomes 255. As described above, in the Bayer array, the diagonal high frequency image cannot be reproduced appropriately.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Generally, in an imaging apparatus that uses a single-panel type color imaging device, an optical low pass filter that is constituted by a birefringence material such as crystal is arranged in the front of the color imaging device, and a high frequency is avoided so as to be optically reduced. However, in this method, coloring by the folding of the high frequency signal can be reduced, but there is a problem that the resolution is reduced due to the adverse effect.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In order to solve such a problem, a color imaging device has been proposed in which a color filter array of the color imaging device is a three-colors random array that satisfies an array restriction condition in which a given focused pixel is adjacent to any of three colors including a color of the focused pixel on the four sides of the focused pixel (PTL 1).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In addition, an image sensor of a color filter array has been proposed that includes a plurality of filters having different spectral sensitivities, and in which a first filter and a second filter out of the filters are alternately arranged in one diagonal direction of a pixel grid of the image sensor in a first certain cycle and are alternately arranged in the other diagonal direction in a second certain cycle (PTL 2).</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In addition, a color array has been proposed in which, in a color solid imaging device of three primary colors of R, G, and B, appearance probabilities of R, G, and B are equalized and a given straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal straight line) on<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> an imaging surface passes through all of the colors by arranging sets of 3 pixels in which R, G, and B are horizontally arranged so that the sets are shifted in a zig-zag manner (PTL 3).</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In addition, a color imaging device has been proposed in which R and B out of three primary colors of R, G, and B are arranged in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction in every three pixels, and G is arranged between R and B (PTL 4).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In addition, PTL 5 suggests a color array in which: in a color solid imaging device of three primary colors of R, G, and B, a color filter array is divided into four areas by the X axis and Y axis passing through the center; R, G, and B are arranged in a Bayer array in each area; and R, G, and B of each area has the X axis mirror symmetry pattern and the Y axis mirror symmetry pattern. In the color filter array described in this PTL 5, the one or more Gs are arranged on the horizontal direction (X axis) and vertical direction (Y axis) of the color filter array and each line of the diagonal directions.</p><heading id="h0003">{Citation List}</heading><heading id="h0004">{Patent Literature}</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><ul><li>{PTL 1} Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2000308080A"><text>2000-308080</text></patcit></li><li>{PTL 2} Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2005136766A"><text>2005-136766</text></patcit></li><li>{PTL 3} Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP11285012A"><text>11-285012</text></patcit></li><li>{PTL 4} Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP8023543A"><text>8-23543</text></patcit></li><li>{PTL 5} Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2009027684A"><text>2009-27684</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">{Summary of Invention}</heading><heading id="h0006">{Technical Problem}</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">The color imaging device discussed in PTL 1 has a random filter array. Therefore, it is necessary that optimization is performed for each random pattern when subsequent synchronization (interpolation) processing (or demosaic processing, the same applies hereinafter) is executed, so that there is a problem that the synchronization processing becomes complicated. In addition, the random array is effective in low-frequency color moire, and is not effective in a false color of a high frequency part.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In addition, in the image sensor discussed in PTL 2, the G pixels (brightness pixels) are arranged in the checkered pattern. Therefore, there is a problem that pixel<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> reproduction accuracy in a limit resolution area (particularly, in the diagonal directions) is not excellent.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the color solid imaging device discussed in PTL 3, filters for all of the colors exist on the given straight line. Therefore, there is an advantage that occurrence of a false color can be suppressed. On the other hand, there is a problem that the high frequency reproducibility is reduced as compared with a Bayer array because ratios of the number of pixels of R, the number of pixels of G, and the number of pixels of B are equal. Note that in the case of the Bayer array, a ratio of the number of G pixels that help most to obtain a brightness signal is twice as great as each ratio of the number of R pixels and the number of B pixels.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">On the other hand, in the color imaging device discussed in PTL 4, each ratio of the number of R pixels and the number of B pixels to a ratio of the number of G pixels is higher than that of the Bayer array, and a line of only G pixels exists in the horizontal or vertical direction. Therefore, it is not effective in a false color of a high frequency part in the horizontal or vertical direction.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the color imaging device discussed in PTL 5, the one or more Gs are arranged in each line of the horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions (particularly in the diagonal directions) of the color filter array. As a result, unlike the color imaging device discussed in PTL 2, there is no problem in the pixel reproduction accuracy in a limit resolution area (particularly in the diagonal directions). However, because either R or B is not arranged in the lines in the horizontal and vertical directions, the occurrence of the color moire (false color) cannot be suppressed.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The present invention is made in view of these circumstances, and an object of the present invention is to provide a color imaging device that can suppress occurrence of a false color, achieve high resolution, and simplify subsequent processing as compared with a conventional random array.</p><heading id="h0007">{Solution to Problem}</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">In order to attain the above object, a color imaging device according to an aspect of the present invention is configured by arranging color filters of a certain color filter array on a plurality of pixels that are configured by photometric conversion elements that are arranged in a horizontal direction and a vertical direction, wherein the color filter<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> array includes subarrays in which the color filters are arrayed in an array pattern corresponding to M×N (M is an even number equal to or greater than 2 and N is an even number equal to or greater than 4) pixels and the subarrays are repeatedly arranged in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction, the color filters include a first filter corresponding to a first color that contributes most to obtain a brightness signal and second filters corresponding to second colors of two or more colors different from the first color, and a ratio of a number of pixels of the first color corresponding to the first filter is larger than each ratio of a number of pixels of the second colors corresponding to the second filters, the first filter is arranged in a checkered pattern in the subarrays such that an arrangement of the first filter in one of the subarrays that are adjacent to each other in the horizontal direction or the vertical direction and an arrangement of the first filter in another have a mirror image relationship, and one or more of the second filters corresponding to each color of the second colors are arranged in each line in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction of the color filter array in a basic array pattern which is repeatedly arranged in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction in the color filter array and which includes K (K is a natural number equal to or greater than 1) sets of the subarrays that are adjacent to each other and have a mirror image relationship in the arrangement of the first filter.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to an aspect of the present invention, the first filters that contribute most to obtain a brightness signal is arranged in a checkered pattern in subarrays such that the arrangements of the first filters have a mirror image relationship between subarrays that are adjacent to each other in the horizontal direction or the vertical direction. Therefore, it is possible to arrange one or more first filters in each line in the horizontal, vertical, upper right diagonal and lower right diagonal directions of the color filter array and improve the reproduction accuracy of synchronization processing in a high frequency area.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In addition, one or more second filters corresponding to each color of the second colors of two or more colors different from the first color are arranged in each line in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction of the color filter array in the basic array pattern. Therefore, it is possible to suppress occurrence of color moire (false color) and achieve high resolution.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Moreover, a certain basic array pattern is repeatedly arranged in horizontal direction and the vertical direction in the color filter array. Therefore, according to the above aspect, at the time of performing subsequent synchronization (interpolation) processing, it is possible to perform processing according to a repetitive pattern. In addition, according to the above aspect, it is possible to simplify subsequent processing as compared with a conventional random array.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Moreover, in the above aspect, the ratio of the number of pixels of the first color corresponding to the first color and the ratio of the number of pixels of each color of the second colors of two or more colors corresponding to the second filter are made different from each other, and the ratio of the number of pixels of the first color that contributes most to obtain a brightness signal especially is made larger than the ratio of the number of pixels of each color of the second colors corresponding to the second filter.
