This data presents significant business opportunities and competitive advantages through effective data management and transformation into business insights and intelligence. Businesses are thirsty for strategic insight for dealing with unexpected market changes, heightened competition, partnership challenges and opportunities, and increasing globalization. Yet despite an abundance of data to support strategic decisions, the reality is that executives are often overwhelmed by unwieldy amounts of information, or worse, out-of-date or misleading data that can yield suboptimal conclusions. It is a well-acknowledged fact that companies and industries are continuously dedicating larger amounts of their information technology budgets to databases, business intelligence, and reporting tools. However, the current marketplace is filled with numerous vendors and providers that focus on industry-specific, often niche-type applications and tools that have limited utility across broader markets.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">On the other side, business users are facing multiple challenges in making decisions regarding technology and tools that often produced results disconnected through organizational silos and contribute to ever increasing costs of information sharing and business justification of continuous investments. In overcoming many such issues, various embodiments herein include data management and business intelligence solutions that emphasize real-time analytics propelled by fast access storage of in-memory databases.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the inventive subject matter may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice them, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural, logical, and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the inventive subject matter. Such embodiments of the inventive subject matter may be referred to, individually and/or collectively, herein by the term "invention" merely for convenience and without<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> intending to limit the scope of this application to any single invention or inventive concept if more than one is in fact disclosed. The following description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limited sense, and the scope of the inventive subject matter is defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The functions or algorithms described herein are implemented in hardware, software or a combination of software and hardware in one embodiment. The software comprises computer executable instructions stored on computer readable media such as memory or other type of storage devices. Further, described functions may correspond to modules, which may be software, hardware, firmware, or any combination thereof. Multiple functions are performed in one or more modules as desired, and the embodiments described are merely examples. The software is executed on a digital signal processor, ASIC, microprocessor, or other type of processor operating on a system, such as a personal computer, server, a router, or other device capable of processing data including network interconnection devices.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Some embodiments implement the functions in two or more specific interconnected hardware modules or devices with related control and data signals communicated between and through the modules, or as portions of an application-specific integrated circuit. Thus, the exemplary process flow is applicable to software, firmware, and hardware implementations.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a data processing environment 100, according to an example embodiment. The data processing environment 100 provides a simplified view of at least one customer and customer account database 122 and customer and customer account analytical processes 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120. The customer and customer account analytical processes 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120 are generally statistical modeling processes that may be applied by a processor-executed process to segment at least one of customers and customer accounts represented in data stored in the at least one customer and customer account database 122.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In some embodiments, at least one statistical modeling process may exist or be defined to model historic data from which further statistical modeling processes may be based. For example, data representative of a desired outcome may be provided to such a statistical modeling process along with a desired statistical correlation or other factor and the statistical modeling process may identify other data indicators statistically related thereto from which a rule can be derived to segment other customers or customer accounts. A more specific example is a desire to identify customers having a near-term need for a home equity line-of-credit. The input may be to identify customers that have opened a home equity line-of-credit account and a desired statistical correlation of 75% to other data in a six-month period prior to opening the home equity line-of-credit account. The result of this exercise may reveal that customers opening a home equity line-of-credit account commonly do so within six-months within opening of a minor-child savings account. While this example is rather simple, it is illustrative of a statistical discovery from which a rule may be defined, stored, and applied in segmenting customers and customer accounts. Once segmented, the customers and customer accounts segments can be utilized for various purposes, such as marketing, default prevention, education, and account reviews.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The customer and customer account analytical processes 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120 may not only be based on statistical discoveries in data, but may also be input by users, included with a purchased software solution, and purchased or otherwise obtained as system 100 add-ons. Some such analytical processes may be based on key performance indicators (KPIs) or industry standards. Other analytical processes may be based on institutional or individual employee knowledge, experience, and intuition.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As illustrated, the analytical processes include analytical processes to segment customers or customer accounts by account size 102, regular depositing accounts 104, customers likely to respond to a credit offer 106, special account 108, default likelihood 110, and good and bad accounts 112, however good and bad may be defined by a particular organization. Other analytical processes may include a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> "did this/did that" 114 analysis that segments historic data of customers to identify likely future behaviors of other customers. In some embodiments, one analytic process may segment customers or customer accounts based on common attributes 116 there between, segment customers based on customer loyalty factors 118, and other such processes 120.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In financial service markets, software products have been designed for precise marketing purposes that fail to differentiate between customer groups. However, undifferentiated marketing is typically unsuccessful in financial services markets. For example, a good strategy decision for one customer group can be totally wrong if the targeted customer group is changed. Precision marketing can be a harbinger of success, especially in the banking field where financial products often have more dependence to customer attributes. At the same time, it is challenging for financial companies to identify, group, and understand their customers to allow for precision marketing.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Moreover, as time passes, customer groups can merge, split, and appear or disappear, as customer identification and grouping tasks are neither a one-time nor a periodic task. Instead, in some embodiments provided herein, customer identification and grouping, to be the most accurate and useful, is performed on a real-time or near real-time basis at or relatively close in time to when the identification and grouping is to be utilized. To accomplish real-time or near real-time customer identification and grouping, various embodiments include a high-performance run-time customer classification tool that performs analysis according to one or more of the analytical processes 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120 to discover customer and customer account segments and segmenting rules. Classification is also referred to herein as segmenting, segmentation, and other forms of the word "segment." Unless explicitly stated otherwise, classification and segmentation are intended as synonyms. Some such embodiments include a systematic approach towards utilization of financial services transactional data with applications to account classifications. Such embodiments utilize a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> unique, systematic approach of information management and scalability to manage large amounts of data.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Many modern banks process and maintain millions of accounts. Accounts can be categorized into multiple groups or classes through combinations of business and customer attributes. Some attributes defining types of the accounts can be considered static through the life of the account; others such as balances or maturities are dynamic and change in time. Multiple business units and people having different roles within banks have responsibilities for different functions and business scenarios associated with account management. For example, a risk management department typically focuses their effort on identification of risk-related indicators such as delinquency roll rates, probabilities of default, loss associated with adverse events, and the like. A marketing department typically is interested in product cross-selling and improving customer retention rates. A portfolio manager is typically responsible for portfolio growth and focuses on identification of accounts with high growth potential. While an account can keep the same structure and data content, classification of the account can be different for different business scenarios, such as may be defined and utilized by different departments and roles within an institution. Classification of the account can also change over time for various reasons, such as changing account balances, changing economic conditions, changing business rules, and the like.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Transaction-level account data provides opportunities for learning, statistical inference, and performance optimization. Previous processes for account classification involved lengthy steps of segmentation, attribute and parameter selections, model testing and validation, and monitoring. These steps can be very expensive and work intensive processes that have to be frequently repeated in order to adjust for new information coming into the system. When working with such large amounts of data, intermediate steps of data staging and aggregations, time intensive Extract Transform Load (ETL) operations, and multiple passes of analytical queries that create challenges in balancing between analysis flexibility<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> and performance. As a result, customer and customer account segmenting use has been limited.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The analytical processes 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120 in the various embodiments leverage data replicated by at least one data replication process into at least one in-memory database for dynamic classification of accounts that can be performed on-demand based on a system of business rules and business scenarios. For example, sales representatives or accounts managers may care about account balances and numbers of trades that directly impact their commissions. The sales representatives or accounts managers might be interested in classifications directly incorporating their primary KPIs such as number of trades and account size.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">From another perspective, risk analysts might be interested in earlier identification of delinquent accounts through pattern recognition that can be evaluated from the historical transactions. Risk managers, and others may defme segmentation rules in the analytical processes 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120 based on complex rules that involve machine-learning algorithms such as neural networks, K-means, Bayesian classifiers, among other statistical techniques based on the analysis to be performed.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Such segmentation rules are utilized herein to define how customers and customer accounts, or other items, are classified and grouped. To better classify such items, common purposes for different rules can be considered as follows:
<ol><li>1. Classify: Classification belongs to the prediction model. It is used to predict the user types. For example, in a credit system for people who do not yet have a credit score, they can be classified into different groups based on historical transaction or behaviors. This type of rule can be discovered through statistical analysis of historic data sampling to identify typical symptoms, or contributors, for each group.</li><li>2. Clustering: Different from classification, clustering is a non-prediction model. It explains how to group existing customers and accounts.</li><li>3. Association: this model is also a non-prediction model. Association studies the relationships among customers and<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> accounts. For example, a customer who buys a product A has higher possibility to buy the product B and C. Through identifying, the internal relationship of customer behavior or even the customer attributes is helpful in fully understanding the customer.</li></ol></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The rule descriptions for the three type usages are typically different. For example, quite often classifications may be based on a set of "if-then" rules that utilize quick production of subsets of accounts satisfying combinations of the rules. For example, to identify a good candidate for line increase on an account, a user is searching for accounts with utilization ratios exceeding certain cut-off values and Loan to Value (LTV) values less than certain cut -off values, e.g. LTV&lt;50% and Utilization&gt;80%.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In general, a variety of formats may be supported to allow for effective applications of decision trees algorithms, such as a C4.5 algorithm. For these cases, the classification functions are typically represented by ranges or discrete values of the attributes, and combinations thereof. Such as:
<tables id="tabl0001" num="0001"><table frame="all"><tgroup cols="1" colsep="0"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="60mm" colsep="1"/><thead><row><entry align="center" valign="top">IF-THEN Rule Types</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry>Attribute <i>BIGGER THAN</i> value</entry></row><row><entry>Attribute <i>NOT LESS THAN</i> value</entry></row><row><entry>Attribute LESS THAN value</entry></row><row><entry>Attribute <i>NOT BIGGER THAN value</i></entry></row><row><entry>Attribute <i>BETWEEN</i> value i <i>AND</i> value 2</entry></row><row><entry>Attribute LIKE"String Pattern"</entry></row><row><entry>Attribute <i>IN value</i> set</entry></row><row><entry>Attribute <i>EQUAL</i> value</entry></row><row><entry>Attribute <i>NOT EQUAL value</i></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Of course, the problems of classifications would be straightforward if users always knew the attribute combinations and values that need to be satisfied by classes of interest. However, this is often not the case. Quite often users need to learn the rules first before they can apply them to the segmentations. For example, a credit score associated with an account represents estimated probabilities of default. As such, a risk manager can use credit scores directly for account classifications for default rates estimates. However, imagine that a credit score is not available for the account. In this, the risk manger may desire to build a classification for default rates<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> from available attributes by "learning" how different attribute values and ranges effect default rates. These types of classifications are more complex and utilize advanced learning algorithms such as regression methods, time series modeling, neural networks, K-means, K-nearest neighbor, Bayesian classifiers, and the like. In some embodiments, once contributing attributes for segmenting particular desired outcomes or classifications are identified, rules can be generated therefrom.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Thus, the various embodiments herein, through defining, discovery, and application of the analytical processes 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120 and the rules therein, a flexible methodology and system for in-memory intelligent adaptive account classifications, is provided.

The system 200 includes a database 204 that stores data of a larger software system, such as an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), or other software system. The system 200 also includes a business logic layer 202 and data classification requirements 208 which are also typically, although not necessarily, components of the larger software system.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The system 200 also includes an in-memory database 212 that stores data replicated from the database 204 by a data replication server 206. In some embodiments, the in-memory database 212 stores transactional data in a large bank of random access memory (RAM). Note however that other forms of memory may be utilized in various embodiments. One such other memory type is Flash memory. In some such embodiments, the data stored in RAM may also be stored on disk to allow the RAM to be quickly loaded, such as on a system reset or power-on event. In other embodiments, the in-memory database 212 may store the replicated data primarily on disk. Such embodiments can• still provide very quick access to data as the data replicated to the in-memory database 212 may be replicated from a plurality<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> of databases 204. By replicating the data from multiple databases 204 to the single in-memory database 212, the multiple databases 204 need not be queried thereby eliminating multiple transactions, which each may present a processing bottleneck. Further, some such embodiments may replicate only select portions of data from a larger database and include different indexes than the larger database. Thus, performance is enhanced with regard to data access in the various embodiments in multiple ways through the implementation of RAM, Flash, or other memory types and consolidation of data of interest through replication to a single database.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The data replication server 206 replicates data to the in-memory database 212 according to data identified in at least one of the data classification requirements 208 and data classification rules 210. In some embodiments, the data replication server 206 is representative of one or more processes of an Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) system. In a typical embodiment, the data classification rules 210 are the analytical processes 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120 as illustrated and described above with regard to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. The data classification rules 210 may be generated based on the data classification requirements 208, based on KPI's, as input by a user, as discovered by application of one or more data classification rules 210 that output a data classification rule or component thereof, and other sources.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The data classification rules 210 are typically applied against data replicated by the data replication server 206 into the in-memory database 212. The data classification rules 210 are applied by the classifier/rule builder 214. The classifier/rule builder 214 performs analysis on data replicated to the in-memory database 212 according to one or more of the data classification rules 210. The result of the analysis, when the applied one or more data classification rules 210 is a rule, which may be a further data classification rule that may then be stored with the other data classification rules 210. In other instances, the classifier/rule builder 214 may apply one more data classification rules 210 that segment customers or customer accounts. Data representative of the resultant customer or customer account segments may be stored in the in-memory database 212, in the database<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> 204, output to the business logic layer 202 such as for generation of targeted marketing materials based thereon, stored to a file, and the like.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">However, it is possible in some embodiments that when the classifier/rule builder 214 applies a data classification rule, not all the needed data will have been replicated into the in-memory database 212. In such instances, the data replication server 206 may be called to replicate the needed data before the rule is applied. In other instances, the classifier/rule builder 214 may directly access the database 204 to obtain the needed data. The data replication server 206 may also receive a message indicating the needed data is to be replicated in the future according to its data replication logic 206. A goal in replicating the data to the in-memory database 212 is not only to access the data from a database having very quick retrieval times, but also to reduce a number of different data sources from which data is to be retrieved. Thus, as mentioned above, the database 204 as illustrated represents one or more databases. As a result, when the database 204 is two or more databases, the in-memory database 212 may store data replicated from each of the two or more databases thereby reducing the time needed to service a data request from the classifier/rule builder 214 based on one or more data classification rules 210. Further, as the system 200, and in particular the data replication server 206, is an OLTP implementation, as data in the database 204 is modified, the data replicated to the in-memory database 212 is also updated in real-time, or near real-time. This allows the classifier/rule builder 214 to perform analysis according to the data classification rules 210 that is very current. Additionally, when data is updated in the in-memory database 212, in some embodiments, the classifier/rule builder 214 may reapply one or more data classification rules 210 that contemplate the updated data to ensure the analysis based thereon is up to date.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a block flow diagram of a method 300 according to an example embodiment.
