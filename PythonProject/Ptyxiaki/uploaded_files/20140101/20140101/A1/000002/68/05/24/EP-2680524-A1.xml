For example, as already indicated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the system preferably is configured to serve a plurality of first devices 110A, 110B, 110C, ..., 110N. Preferably, the system is further configured to serve a plurality of second devices 120A, 120B, 120C, ... 120M, as indicated<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref>. In the example illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>, the second device 120C (tiled hatching) has initiated that a first multimedia content is simultaneously displayed on first devices 110A, 110B, 110C (tiled hatching), whereas the second device 120D (dotted) has initiated a second multimedia content to be simultaneously displayed on first devices 110D - 110N (dotted). Thus, server 130 is configured to serve a plurality of first and second devices at the same time, the plurality of devices being grouped into a plurality of groups, with the various groups being independent of each other.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">Initiating that a specific multimedia content be simultaneously displayed on a plurality of first devices 110A, 110B, 110C, ..., 110N, is preferably achieved using a communication scheme as described with regard to <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>. For example, the second device 120 may transmit a command message (e.g. a single command message or a plurality of command messages) to server 130, with the command message(s) indicating the desired multimedia content and the plurality of first devices 110A, 110B, 110C, ..., 110N on which the requested content should be displayed. This can, for example, be initiated by a user specifying a plurality of other users and/or a plurality of first device 110A, 110B, 110C, ..., 110N. This can, for example, be achieved by creating and using a so-called friends list, which may be created and updated using a specific app or a web browser, e.g. using a community we page such as Facebook.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Referring back to <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>, although not explicitly shown in the figures, any combination of any number of pull- and push-devices is possible. The pull-devices regularly query the server for new messages, whereas for the push-devices, the server automatically forwards messages stored in the data base for the respective push-device to that push-device.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">Further, a user of a second device 120 (e.g. an iPad or an Android Tablet or a Smartphone) may register one or several own devices as first devices 110A, 110B, 110C, ..., 110N. For example, said user may register his own TV with the<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> server system 130 and use the Tablet PC (e.g. the iPad) to start and control displaying of a multimedia content (e.g. a video) on his own TV.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">In another preferred embodiment, each user of a second device 120 may enter other users of first devices and/or second devices in a so called friends list to allow content to be displayed on the first devices of these users.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">In another preferred embodiment, each user of a second device 120 may enter other users in a friends list in order to allow these other users to initiate displaying multimedia content on this users' first device 110A.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">Preferably, the system allows each user to enter one or several first devices and one or several second devices for himself and to enter a plurality of users to display multimedia content on this user's first devices and/or to allow these users to initiate displaying multimedia content on this user's first devices.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">In a further embodiment, the system may allow users to exchange information while watching multimedia contents simultaneously. For example, the system may allow users to exchange text messages, images, further audio contents (e.g. voice), etc., so that the users can interact while simultaneously watching multimedia content in remote locations. Such a system allows a first user, for example in Western Europe, to simultaneously watch a movie with a friend sitting in North Europe, and further friends sitting in Southern Europe, and would further allow these friends to simultaneously interact, for example by chatting, communicating with an audio interface, a webcam, or various other interaction possibilities.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">In a further embodiment, these interactions can be stored in a data base for a given amount of time, and can be watched again together with all the recorded interactions.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">In an embodiment of the invention, the system allows the creation of so-called movie events or TV Show events, where users are able to invite friends in order to watch multimedia content together simultaneously. Preferably, each of these<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> created events may be linked to an event on Facebook or some other web page. While interacting during the movie or TV Show event, the users can share emotions and chat during watching, and each of these interactions can be stored using a content time code which links the interaction to a content time of the respective event. Each of these interactions can have an associated content time code, which can be stored in the data base together with the interaction.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">In another embodiment, the multimedia system is configured to allow users to automatically connect to other users which share the same or similar interests. For example, users can enter only information, and/or the system can obtain information with regard to the respective users by evaluating the users activities, such as watching activities, user ratings, Facebook-likes (e.g. with regard to actors, directors, movies, TV Shows, etc.). In a preferred embodiment, before new friends are connected as friends, the system establishes a first event where the users can interact during the event as indicated above and afterwards evaluates whether these users want to be linked together.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">It is to be understood that the above exemplary embodiments are intended to illustrate specific embodiments of the invention and are not to be understood in a limiting sense. Further, it is to be understood that the various aspects described herein can be combined unless specifically stated otherwise.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56976178" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A system (100), comprising:
