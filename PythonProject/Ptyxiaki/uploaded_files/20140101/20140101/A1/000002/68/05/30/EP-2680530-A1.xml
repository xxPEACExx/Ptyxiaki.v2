Additional communication options may be available for operational control depending on the in-flight entertainment (IFE) or other passenger systems installed on aircraft.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Unfortunately, current designs typically accommodate active data transfer over one communication channel regardless of the number of connectivity options that are available on the aircraft. The VDLM2 and SATCOM data links, as well as cellular telephony, all employ some mechanism to switch link connectivity seamlessly within the respective media as the mobile station transitions from one cellular coverage region to another. Nevertheless, if a communication fails on the currently selected channel, the capability does not exist to switch the data stream transparently to another active communication channel. When a data transfer fails mid-stream, dataflow over the selected medium/connection is terminated, and upper layer recovery mechanisms are invoked, which switch to a different media/channel and restart the whole data transfer. Such an approach reduces communication systems availability and increases end-to-end transit delay.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">A method and system for data communications is provided.

It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized without departing from the scope of the invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A method and system for data communications is provided that allows information to be transferred across multiple data links simultaneously. The method reduces the overall transmission time of the information to a destination by simultaneously sending different segments of the information over the multiple data links.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The method and system can be implemented with a stateful connectionless overlay protocol (SCOP), which resides above the link divergence on airborne and ground entities. The SCOP implements a routing algorithm that sends segmented information across multiple dissimilar subnetworks at the same time using different data links. If one of the data links fails, the overlay protocol keeps sending the information over the remaining data links until the information is delivered.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present approach maximizes data throughput when multiple dissimilar subnetworks are available. The present method allows routers making air/ground subnetwork selection to maximize throughput and optimize large message transfer time by sending segmented data packets simultaneously over all available subnetworks while measuring<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> transmit time and quality of service (QoS) to assist in subnetwork packet routing selections. By simultaneous use of available links and dynamic estimation of QoS, the present overlay protocol improves reliability and resolves the "make-before-break" problem faced by data link primary Air Traffic Control (ATC) operations, in which a communication must be completed before the connection is broken or else the whole data transfer is started over. The overlay protocol routes data to a destination across all available connectivity options, thereby eliminating the "make-before-break" requirement. The overlay protocol can operate effectively over links/networks having very different QoS performance characteristics.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">When information is presented to the overlay protocol for transmission, that information is fragmented into data segments based on available connectivity choices, and one data segment is sent over a connection. The overlay protocol may send the next and subsequent data segments simultaneously across all other available connections. These connections can be over the same media, such as one or more Very High Frequency (VHF) radios connected simultaneously to one or more VHF ground stations, or over different media, such as VHF, SATCOM and wireless.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Each of the data segments can be tagged by the media/connection identification (ID) and its own sequence number for reassembly at a peer entity. Each of the data segments may also be given a lifetime based on the expected transit delay to reach the destination entity.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The receiving entity reassembles the data segments for delivery to the network upper layers. The overlay protocol can request retransmission of any missing data segment using the expected lifetime for the chosen media. A data segment whose lifetime has exceeded can be discarded by any intermediate delivery points. The overlay protocol can also use the Global Positioning System (GPS) or any other mechanism to obtain synchronized time to compute/estimate one-way transit delays over each media/connection and uses that information for routing subsequent data segments.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The overlay protocol can be implemented in software running on various computing platforms, or can be implemented in various hardware configurations.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a block diagram of a data communication network 100 for an aircraft 110 according to one embodiment, which can implement the present stateful connectionless overlay protocol. In general, the overlay protocol tracks and maintains a protocol data unit (PDU) delivery status across each air/ground data link connection in network 100. In a layered network, a PDU is a unit of data that is specified in a protocol of a given layer. The<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> corresponding layers in each network system are called peer entities. The overlay protocol can maintain relationships with multiple peer entities.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The aircraft 110 includes a data communications system having various data communication devices. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, aircraft 110 can have a VHF transceiver 112, a first SATCOM transceiver 114, a second SATCOM transceiver 115, a wireless transceiver 116, and a cellular transceiver 118. It should be understood that aircraft 110 can be provided with more or less data communication devices than those shown. A stateful connectionless overlay protocol 119 is implemented in aircraft 120 such as in the aircraft avionics operated by an onboard computer. The overlay protocol 119 operatively communicates with the various transceivers in aircraft 110 to manage data transfer.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The data communication network 100 includes one or more digital service providers. For example, a digital service provider (DSP) 120 can have a first VHF ground station 122, a second VHF ground station 124, and a first SATCOM ground station 126. The VHF ground stations 122 and 124 can provide simultaneous connectivity to VHF transceiver 112 of aircraft 110 over VHF data links 132 and 134, respectively. The SATCOM ground station 126 provides connectivity to SATCOM transceiver 114 of aircraft 110 over a first SATCOM data link 136. A stateful connectionless overlay protocol 130 is implemented in DSP 120 so as to operatively communicate with VHF ground stations 122 and 124, as well as with SATCOM ground station 126. The DSP 120 can provide simultaneous connectivity to aircraft 110 over VHF data links 132, 134, and SATCOM data link 136. The overlay protocol 130 manages the data transfer over these data links.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In addition, network 100 can include other digital service providers. For example, a DSP 140 can have a wireless ground station, which provides connectivity to wireless transceiver 116 of aircraft 110 over a wireless data link 142. A DSP 144 can provide a second SATCOM ground station, which provides connectivity to SATCOM transceiver 115 of aircraft 110 over a second SATCOM data link 146. A DSP 148 can have a cellular ground station, which provides connectivity to cellular transceiver 118 of aircraft 110 over a cellular data link 148.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">An aircraft operator host/router 150 in network 100 can also implement a stateful connectionless overlay protocol 152 as part of data communications system. The aircraft 110 can transmit and receive data communications to and from aircraft operator host/router 150 through the various digital service providers as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. For example, the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> host/router 150 can communicate with aircraft 110 via the first and second VHF data links 132 and 134, the first and second SATCOM data links 136 and 146, the wireless data link 142, or the cellular data link 148, at any given instant. The overlay protocol 152 manages the information exchange end-to-end between aircraft 110 and host/router 150.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In order for the overlay protocol to work reliably across dissimilar media having substantially different capabilities, the underlying data links should provide link state and QoS data. In addition, the overlay protocol dynamically estimates the throughput and one-way transit delay over each data link and provides feedback to a respective peer entity for active connectivity management.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is a flow diagram of an exemplary data transmission process 200 that is carried out by the stateful connectionless overlay protocol. At the start of process 200, information is received from network upper layers such as the transport or application layers (block 210). The diversity paths to a destination peer are then determined, and the transmission characteristics of each path are estimated (block 220). As used herein, a "diversity path" is a connectivity option to the destination peer when multiple connectivity options exist between them. The path transmission characteristics include, for example, one way transit delay, average throughput, aggregate bit error rate (BER), etc. The information is then fragmented into separate data segments for transmission over each diversity path (block 230). The data segments are associated with each diversity path based on the path transmission characteristics (block 240). A lifetime for each data segment is determined based on the underlying transmission characteristics of each segment such as transit delay and BER (block 250). A segment header may be created, which may include path ID, lifetime, segment ID, time of day, etc. (block 260). The data segments are then transmitted simultaneously over their corresponding diversity paths (block 270). The process 200 then goes back to the start for transmission of additional information.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> is a flow diagram of an exemplary data receiving process 300 that is carried out by the stateful connectionless overlay protocol. At the start of process 300, an uplink (or downlink) information segment is received from a diversity path (block 310). A determination is then made whether the information segment is part of a multiple data segment transmission (block 314). If not, the received information segment is processed per standard procedures (block 318), and process 300 goes back to the start to receive the next transmission. If the information segment is part of a multiple data segment transmission, the information segment is stored regardless of the diversity path it was received from as long as<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the lifetime of the segment has not expired; if the lifetime has expired, the segment is discarded (block 322).</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">A determination is then made whether all data segments have been received (block 326). If yes, the full information content is constructed by inserting the segments in sequence, and the complete information is delivered to the network upper layer (block 330). The stored information segments that comprise the full information content are then discarded, and process 300 goes back to the start to receive the next transmission.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">If all data segments have not been received, a determination is made whether the remaining lifetime of the stored segments is less than or equal to a pre-defined threshold, such as the path-transit delay, and if there are missing segments (block 334). If yes, retransmission of the missing segments is requested (block 338); if no, the full information content is constructed by inserting the data segments in sequence, and identifying any missing sequences by the diversity path (block 342). The process 300 then goes back to the start and waits for any remaining data segments.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A computer or processor used in the present system and method can be implemented using software, firmware, hardware, or any appropriate combination thereof, as known to one of skill in the art. These may be supplemented by, or incorporated in, specially-designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The computer or processor can also include functions with software programs, firmware, or other computer readable instructions for carrying out various process tasks, calculations, and control functions used in the present method and system.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The present methods can be implemented by computer executable instructions, such as program modules or components, which are executed by at least one processor.
