Typically, the received call will have been originally directed from the calling party's phone to a called party's phone and then redirected (e.g. on no answer by the called party) to connect the calling party to the voicemail system. The voicemail system provides to the calling party, as part of the call, a notification of a network location; and provides through the network location to the calling party, access to a registration process for registering the calling party to receive a voicemail service from the voicemail system.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The enhanced voicemail system, as described in detail below, creates value for the calling party in that they are now able to simply obtain access to a registration process for obtaining a voicemail service from the voicemail service provider. The enhanced voicemail service also creates value for the voicemail service provider in providing a new channel for registering new users to receive voicemail service.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to various embodiments, the incoming call is a call from a calling party directed to a called party and redirected to connect the calling party to the voicemail system at the first network location; notification of a second network location comprises an indicator<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> from which an internet protocol address of the second network location is derivable; the notification is provided to the calling party as part of the call; the second network location is dedicated to the calling party; and the notification is provided to the calling party outside of the incoming call. According to various further embodiments, the notification is provided to the calling party using information, derived as part of the call; the notification is provided in response to a request received in the course of the call; and the first and second interfaces are comprised in a voicemail server. According to various further embodiments, access to the registration process is provided in response to a request received from the calling party directed to the second network location; the calling party is authenticated by recording, in the course of the incoming call received at the first network location, a received indication of the source of the incoming call and verifying the received indication against the telephone number of the calling party obtained via the second network location . According to various further embodiments, the incoming call received at the first network location is terminated prior to providing to the calling party through the second network location, access to the registration process; and the notification of the second network location is directed to the calling party at a first device and the access to a registration process is provided to the calling party at a second device.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Figure 1</b></figref> depicts a voicemail communications system 100 according to one embodiment of the present invention. The voicemail communications system of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> may form part of a public telecommunications network. A conventional public telecommunications network comprises a relatively small number of interconnected main switches forming a core or central network and a larger number of local switches forming part of several local networks. Each local switch is connected to one or more main switches and is connected along local access lines of a local communication network to several items of subscriber equipment such as telephone instruments provided for users of the network.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, voicemail communications system 100 comprises calling party communication terminal device 10, local communication network 30, central communications network 60, local communication network 40, called party communication terminal device 20 and voicemail system 70. It will be recognized that alternative embodiments of the present invention may embody variations in system 100, for example calling party communication terminal device 10, called party communication terminal device 20 and voicemail system 70 may all be connected directly to local communication network 30.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Communication terminal devices 10, 20 include any voice communication devices, such as fixed, landline telephones, cellular telephones, other telephones, including soft phones,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> communicating via internet protocol (IP) or any other device capable of providing voice communications over any form of telephone network.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Local communication networks 30, 40 may comprise any communication system capable of routing voice communications between communication terminal device 10 and communication terminal device 20. For example, local communication networks 30, 40 may comprise private branch exchanges, concentrators and local switching centres with one or more telephone switches.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Central communications network 60 may comprise any communications network suitable for conveying voice traffic at suitably high volumes in any form, including Ethernet, MPLS, SDH, ATM and IP networks.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Voicemail system 70 provides for storage of voicemail messages for a called party associated with communication terminal device 20. Typically, voicemail system 70 also provides for storage of voicemail messages for a plurality of further users associated with additional communication terminal devices (not shown). Voicemail system 70 may be a physical answering machine providing storage in physical media, such as tape or disc or semiconductor memory. Voicemail system 70 may be a service provided, e.g., by the provider of communications services to the called party on terminal 20 and to other users. Voicemail system 70 may be embodied in a network server (not shown) located in local communication network 40, central communications network 60 or elsewhere. The network server may store messages in local semiconductor memory or local or remote disc storage. The machine or service may store voicemail messages for a specific called party and only provide read access to these messages to the called party accessing the voicemail system from their own telephone or upon presentation of appropriate credentials. The called party may access the voicemail system to access messages, alter configuration settings, etc.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As used here, a voicemail message is any message comprising an audio element that is recorded for a user by voicemail system 70, whether in analog or digital form. For example, the message may comprise audio with or without associated pictorial elements, such as video.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Calling party communication terminal device 10 is configured to initiate a communication (referred to as a call) to called party communication terminal device 20 via networks 30, 40, 60. A call may be any communication from communication terminal device 10 to communication terminal device 20. When a called party does not answer a call, then the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> call is directed to voicemail system 70. For example, the call may go from calling party communication terminal device 10 to local communication network 30; local communication network 30 then routes the communication through central communications network 60 to local communication network 40; local communication network 40 determines that the communication is for the called party and routes the communication to called party communication terminal device 20. When the called party does not answer the call, it is redirected or re-routed to voicemail system 70. For example, the call may be re-routed across local network 40 to voicemail system 70.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Voicemail system 70 may present the calling party with a greeting and instructions on how to leave a voicemail message. For example, a calling party may select an option to leave a voicemail message. In one embodiment, an indication is sent from voicemail system 70 to communication terminal device 10 indicating that the calling party should leave a voicemail message after a signal from voicemail system 70. In an alternative embodiment, the calling party is asked to provide signals in order to direct operation of voicemail system 70 in recording a voicemail message. Suitable signals may be generated using a keypad on communication terminal device 10. For example, the calling party may press the * key to start recording and the # key to end recording. Alternatively, a calling party may end recording by terminating the connection (hanging up). Once voicemail system 70 is in recording mode, any audio sent by the calling party via communication terminal device 10 is recorded by voicemail system 70 as a voicemail message. The voicemail message left by the calling party may then be accessed by the called party at a later time convenient to the called party.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A typical architecture for a server or other form of computer apparatus on which software implementing the invention can be run, is shown by way of example in <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Figure 2</b></figref>.

For example, voicemail metadata database 304 stores time of receipt, length and read status for each voicemail message left for the called party.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Storage manager 306 is arranged in communication with file store 314 for storing and retrieving voicemail audio files. The voicemail audio files left for the called party stored in file store 314 represent the contents of the called party's voicemail box. Voicemail platform 300 further comprises a HTTP server (e.g. HTTP Rest server 312), which is arranged in communication with other components of voicemail platform 300, as follows: voicemail metadata database 304 and storage manager 306. A number of connections are arranged external to voicemail platform 300. voicemail processor 310 is arranged in communication with short message service (SMS) gateway 308. TUI 302 is arranged in communication with SIP/mobile network gateway 316. HTTP server 312 is arranged in communication with web portal 318. SMS gateway 308 is arranged in communication with mobile network 320 and, via the mobile network is communicable with a number of telephone terminal devices, including calling party terminal device 324 for exchange of SMS messages. SIP/mobile network gateway 316 is arranged in communication with mobile network 320 and, via the mobile network is communicable with a number of telephone terminal devices, including called party terminal device 322 for receipt of mobile telephone calls. According to a further aspect of the invention, SIP/mobile network gateway 316 is arranged to receive SIP telephone calls via a data network, such as an IP network (not shown) from calling party terminal device 324. Web portal 318 is arranged in communication with calling party terminal device 324 via a data network (not shown). For example web portal 318 may connect to calling party terminal device 324 via a mobile phone data network. According to a further aspect of the invention, the calling party may connect with web portal 318 using a network-connected device (not shown) different to calling party terminal device 324. Application store 330 is arranged in communication with calling party terminal device 324 via a data network (not shown).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Calling parties whose call is redirected to the voicemail system are presented with a prompt or other notification that the enhanced service providing access to a registration<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> facility network location is available. For example, a voice message may be played to the calling party on reaching the voicemail system similar to: "if you would like to register with this voicemail service, please press *2 and you will receive an SMS text with a link to our registration website". In an alternative embodiment, the prompt may notify the user by a different mechanism. For example, the calling party on reaching the voicemail system may be instructed to enter a code (e.g. DTMF) sequence to initiate sending of an email to the calling party, where the email contains a link indicating the network location providing access to a registration facility.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0003"><b>Figure 4a</b></figref> shows calling party's mobile device 324 with display screen 401 showing typical content that may be shown during an outgoing call. Display screen 401, typically displays destination telephone number 402, keyboard 404 and "end call" button 406. <figref idrefs="f0003"><b>Figures 4b</b></figref> shows a separate representation 420 of a typical content which may be communicated via a loudspeaker (not shown) on calling party's communication terminal device 324 or appear on display screen 401 including content which may be provided by the voicemail system during an outgoing call redirected to the voicemail system, including instructions received as a voice message from the voicemail system. The instructions may be received during a call made from calling party's mobile device 324 to called party's mobile device 322, where the call has been redirected to the voicemail system. Instructions comprised in content 420 relate to recording a voice message with the voicemail system: "you have reached +44 2546 2587, please leave a message after the tone"; where "+44 2546 2587" is the number of calling party's mobile device 322. In addition, according to the invention, instructions are provided relating to accessing a registration process: "When you are done, press *2 to get a link to our registration website", or similar. The calling party may, optionally, leave a message on the called party's voicemail box during the call.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The calling party enters a key sequence (e.g. *2) to request access to the voicemail system registration facility. The calling party may then receive confirmation that the voicemail system has accepted the calling party's request. For example, the voicemail system may play to the calling party a voice message similar to "thank you, a link to our registration facility will be texted to 0123 45678", where "0123 45678" is the telephone number of calling party's mobile device 324. In an alternative embodiment, the system may confirm "thank you, a link to our registration facility will be emailed to name@btinternet.com", where "name@btinternet.com" is an email address associated with the calling party. The call is then terminated.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In response to a request from the user for access to the registration process, the voicemail system may contact the user, e.g. by an SMS or an email message, outside of the call, for example once the call has been terminated. The SMS or email message may indicate by means of a hyperlink, a web address or other network resource indicator, a network location, such as a webpage, through which the calling party may register with the voicemail system. For example, a web portal may be operated by the voicemail system or independently operated but provides access to the voicemail system registration process. Successful registration results in the voicemail system providing to the calling party a voicemail service. As part of the voicemail service, the calling party can access their own account and mailbox with the voicemail system.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4c</figref> shows display screen 401 of calling party's mobile device 400 showing text content 430 of an SMS message received from the called party's voicemail system in response to the user entering the code (e.g. *2) for initiating a registration process. The SMS message provides to the calling party a URI of a website at which a voicemail registration facility may be accessed e.g. "http://bt.vinbox.com/vinbox/254342678253436273535". Alternatively, the called party's voicemail system may provide the URI in a message (not shown) to an email address provided by the user. The user could then, for example, access the email from a suitable client running on calling party's mobile device or from a separate, networked computer.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In order to contact the user outside of the call, the voicemail system needs to acquire an address of the calling party. According to one aspect of the invention, the voicemail system monitors incoming calls and detects a network location associated with the calling party's communication terminal device. The calling party's network location may be divined from a CLI (or calling line identity) associated with the calling party's telephone connection. The network location can then be used to direct an SMS message to the calling party at the terminal used to access the voicemail system. According to another aspect of the invention, the voicemail system uses voice prompts to prompt the user for an email address in the course of the redirected call. During the redirected call, the user can then speak an email address which the voicemail system converts to text by using conventional techniques and captures the user's email address.</p><heading id="h0004">Registration via Telephone</heading><p id="p0034" num="0034">According to a further aspect of the invention, instead of a URI, the network location may be indicated by means of a telephone number that the calling party can call to listen to audio prompts relating to a registration process. The calling party can take part in the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> registration process by responding to the audio prompts. For example, the calling party can enter information in response to the prompts by speaking or using the terminal keypad to generate DTMF tones. This aspect may be preferred where the user does not have access to a data network.</p><heading id="h0005">Registration via Webpage.</heading><p id="p0035" num="0035">When the calling party activates a hyperlink or uses a URI or network address to access a network location, a webpage providing access to a registration facility is displayed. For example, the webpage will be displayed in a browser on a calling party-operated networked device such as a smart phone, tablet or personal computer (not shown) with network access. That is, the network access may comprise access via a data network connection running over the calling party's telephone network or otherwise. The webpage may present the calling party with a number of options. For example, the calling party may be offered the option to request their own voicemail box to be provisioned by the provider of the called party's voicemail service.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0004"><b>Figure 5</b></figref> shows an example of a sample welcome screen webpage 501 provided at the network location for the registration process and displayed in a browser running on a mobile phone 500, according to an aspect of the invention. Welcome screen webpage 501 may comprise browser control panel 502 for controlling viewing of different web pages. The calling party may be asked to provide credentials to enable secure access. Webpage 501 comprises prompt text 504, prompting the calling party to enter credentials. These credentials may comprise the user's name and an email address or other personal identification or authentication information. For example, webpage 501 comprises data entry fields 506, 508, 510 for entering the user's name, an email address and the user's password, respectively. Once the user has entered the requested credentials, they may select "Create Account" button 514 to initiate an account creation process for the calling party. Optionally, the calling party may be asked to confirm the identity of their mobile service provider by selecting from a dropdown list in window 512. Use of webpage 501 has the advantage of allowing a calling party to create an account without needing to download an application to their terminal device.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">According to a further aspect of the invention, following successful completion of the data entry fields 506, 508, 510, the voicemail system sends to the calling party a link via SMS that will allow calling party to download a voicemail application. The calling party will need to sign-in via the application with their new credentials and then setup call forwarding on their phone thereby completing the sign-up and setup-user journey. Sign-in authenticates<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the user of the account, enabling the user to retrieve stored messages and to modify personal settings. The calling party may set up call forwarding on their phone using conventional functionality offered by the provider of the network (e.g. local network 30) to which the calling party's phone is connected.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idrefs="f0005 f0006 f0007"><b>Figures 6a - 6e</b></figref> show examples of suitable screens displayed by an application downloaded to and running on the user's communications terminal device (in this example mobile phone 500), according to a further aspect of the invention.
