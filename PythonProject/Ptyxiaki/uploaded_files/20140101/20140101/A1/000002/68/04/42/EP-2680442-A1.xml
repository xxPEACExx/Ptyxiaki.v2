Conventionally, phase locked loop (PLL's) are used for clock generation in bigger SoCs as they faithfully multiply a reference crystal clock to a stable high frequency clock. The negative feedback loop in PLL's generates a supply, temperature and process in-sensitive clock with very small frequency spread. However, in smaller systems with limited PAD/PIN, PLL's are not cost effective solution as they need an external reference crystal clock. So, one possibility is to use a reference oscillator in a negative feedback loop to mimic the PLL performance.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As the on chip resistors and capacitors vary across process, frequency of the oscillator may also vary significantly affecting the system performance. All digital systems process and manipulate only digital codes consisting of 0's and 1's. Since typically the output frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) is controlled by an analog input voltage, a digital to analog converter (DAC) is usually used to convert trimming bits to an analog voltage and then to program the frequency. A conventional DAC implementation scheme may consume almost 70-80% area of the oscillator and also the DAC power consumption may become an over head to the overall system.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In common VCO implementations, a negative feedback loop may be used to linearize the VCO. But any mismatch between control voltage (Vctl) and reference voltage (Vref) can lead to non-linearity.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20120074986A1"><text>US 2012/0074986 Al</text></patcit> discloses a generation of a clock signal.

The current controlled oscillator is adapted to generate a clock signal based on a control voltage signal, wherein the generated clock signal is supplied to the frequency to voltage converter. The frequency to voltage converter is adapted to generate an output voltage signal (Vout) based on the generated clock signal and based on the supply voltage signal.

The method comprises generating, by a current controlled oscillator, a clock signal based on a control voltage signal, wherein the generated clock signal is supplied to a frequency to voltage converter, generating, by the frequency to voltage converter, an output voltage signal based on the generated clock signal and based on the supply voltage signal, receiving, by an operational amplifier, the output voltage signal as a feedback signal at a first input terminal and receiving, by the operational amplifier, a reference voltage signal at a second input terminal, the reference voltage signal being generated from the supply voltage signal, and controlling the current controlled oscillator based on an output signal of the operational amplifier, wherein the output signal provides the control voltage signal to the current controlled oscillator in order to control the frequency of the clock signal.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to a further exemplary embodiment, a computer-readable medium is provided, in which a computer program of generating a clock signal is stored, which computer program, when being executed by a processor, is adapted to carry out or control a method having the above mentioned features.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to still another exemplary embodiment, a program element (for instance a software routine, in source code or in executable code) of generating a clock signal is provided, which program element, when being executed by a processor, is adapted to carry out or control a method having the above mentioned features.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Generating a clock signal, which may be performed according to embodiments of the invention, can be realized by a computer program that is by software, or by using one<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> or more special electronic optimization circuits, that is in hardware, or in hybrid form, that is by means of software components and hardware components.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">This invention describes an improved oscillator arrangement which produces a predetermined stable clock and is in-sensitive to supply and temperature variation. In the herein described oscillator arrangement, both feedback voltage and reference voltage are generated from the same supply voltage. Therefore any noise on the supply may become a common-mode noise for both amplifier inputs and hence are rejected by amplifier gain. Therefore, the oscillator becomes insensitive to supply variations.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In common design, frequency to voltage conversion (F2V) has been achieved with switched cap technique. However, this leads to the use of an additional operational amplifier (Op-amp) which is not attractive from a "needed area" and "needed power" point of view. The herein described oscillator arrangement may achieve the same performance without the additional amplifier thereby making it attractive as a low-power and low area F2V solution.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the herein described oscillator arrangement, the oscillator frequency is insensitive to supply variation as both reference voltage and feedback voltage are generated from the same supply.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the operational amplifier, the first input terminal may be the positive input terminal and the second input terminal may be the negative input terminal, or vice versa. This may depend on the frequency to voltage converter. If there is a sign change in the converter, the input terminals may be changed.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the following, further exemplary embodiments of the oscillator arrangement will be explained. However, these embodiments also apply to the semiconductor device, the generating method, to the program element and to the computer-readable medium.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The oscillator arrangement may further comprise an NMOS device, wherein the current controlled oscillator is connectable to the supply voltage source via the NMOS device, the NMOS device being controlled by the output signal of the operational amplifier.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The NMOS device may be adapted to convert an output error voltage corresponding to the output signal of the operational amplifier into a current for controlling the current controlled oscillator.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The NMOS device may be a native-NMOS device used to convert an input error voltage to a current which in turn controls the delay of an inverter chain in the current controlled oscillator (CCO). The CCO may generate a clock with a time period equal to 1/(2*N*Td) where N is the numbers of delay cells (inverters) in loop and Td is the delay of each inverter. The advantage of native-NMOS may be that Vt of this device can almost be zero hence V<sub>GS</sub> can be as low as ∼100mV and Op-amp output stage cascode devices can be biased properly. Also it may work as a source follower with gain ∼1 and therefore does not impact loop dynamics. Using a PMOS device in place of native NMOS might add one more gain stage and might impact the close loop stability.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The oscillator arrangement may further comprise a voltage divider being adapted to generate the reference voltage from the supply voltage signal, wherein the voltage divider is coupled between the voltage supply and the second input terminal of the operational amplifier.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The reference voltage (Vref) may be generated by a voltage divider from the supply AVDD. OP-amp gain and negative feedback may ensure Vref and Vout to be the same. A capacitor may be used to push the op-amp dominant pole towards origin thereby improving the closed loop phase margin and loop stability.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The oscillator arrangement may further comprise a level shifter unit being coupled between the current controlled oscillator and the frequency to voltage converter, wherein the level shifter unit is adapted to convert the clock signal being generated by the current controlled oscillator into a rail-to-rail clock signal.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As the CCO output clock is not a rail to rail clock, level shifters may be used to convert CCO output clock to a rail to rail clock (fout), which provides the clock signal being generated by the complete oscillator arrangement.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The frequency to voltage converter may be adapted to generate the output voltage signal based on the rail-to-rail clock signal.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Instead of using the clock signal directly from the CCO, the frequency to voltage converter may use the generated rail-to-rail clock signal fout.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The frequency to voltage converter may be implemented based on a switched capacitor resistor arrangement.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">This arrangement may provide the advantage that, as resistors and capacitors are largely insensitive to temperature variation, the oscillator frequency is stable across temperature range.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The frequency to voltage converter may comprise a trimming resistor being part of the switched capacitor resistor arrangement, wherein the value of the trimming resistor is adjustable in order to adapt the frequency of the switched capacitor resistor arrangement.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">This may provide a highly efficient low-power and low-area trimming option to control the process spread.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The values of resistors (R) and capacitors (C) may vary a lot across process, so the frequency of the oscillator may also vary accordingly. To compensate the process spread, the trimming resistor R may be trimmed in a binary fashion to switch back to nominal frequency.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">As can be seen from equation [3] shown below, the absolute oscillator frequency may be dependent on R and C values. R and C remain fairly constant across temperature variation and as a result oscillator frequency does not change across temperature. It may be convenient to change R and C absolute values to change the frequency of the oscillation.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The trimming resistor may comprise a plurality of resistors, each resistor being controlled by a transistor.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Digital trimming bits can be used to switch the transistors (ON/OFF MOS switches) and add capacitors in parallel or resistors in series. Therefore, process spread can easily be controlled without using digital-to-analog converters and hence area saving may be in the order of 70-80%.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The frequency to voltage converter may comprise a logic unit, the logic unit being adapted to change a frequency operation mode of the oscillator arrangement.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">For instance, an oscillator which is designed for 100MHz operation can easily be switched to operate at 200MHz with the same core and the additional logic unit.

M1 may be a native-NMOS device used to convert the input error voltage to a current which in turn controls the delay of inverter chain in current controlled oscillator (CCO) 102. CCO generates a clock with time period equal to 1/(2*N*Td) where N is the numbers of delay cells (inverters) in loop and Td is the delay of each inverter. The advantage of the native-NMOS M1 is that Vt of this device can almost be zero hence VGS can be as low as ∼100mV and Op-amp output stage cascode devices can be biased properly. Also it works as a source follower with gain ∼1 and therefore does not impact loop dynamics. Using a PMOS device in place of native NMOS (M1) will add one more gain stage and will impact the close loop stability.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The CCO output swing is not a rail to rail clock, hence a level shifter unit 204 may be used to convert CCO output to a rail to rail clock fout. Frequency to voltage converter (F2V) 103 is used to convert the input frequency to a voltage (Vout) which is then compared with Vref. Vout and Vref are here connected to + and - terminal of the amplifier as there may be a signal inversion in F2V, as will be shown below in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 6</figref>.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">A further embodiment of the oscillator arrangement 300 illustrating a complete implementation of CCO and F2V is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>. F2V 103 is implemented using switched capacitor technique by having a switched capacitor 303 in combination with a trimming resistor 304. At steady state S1, S2 and C form a equivalent resistor equal to 1/(Frequency steady-state *C). Similar to Vref, Vout is also derived directly from supply AVDD. Any noise on the supply will directly appear on Vref and Vout. Since random<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> supply noise appears on both Vref and Vout in same amplitude and phase hence this common mode noise is rejected by the amplifier 101. Therefore, the oscillator frequency does not react to supply variation. As can be seen, the oscillator 102 can be implemented by a cascade of inverters 302, forming an inverter chain.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In one embodiment, for generating Vref, R1 and R2 are selected in such a way that R2=2*R1.
