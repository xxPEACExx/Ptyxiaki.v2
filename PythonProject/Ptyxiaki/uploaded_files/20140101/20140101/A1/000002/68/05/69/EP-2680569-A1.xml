The remote camera that has received the control signal then executes pan/tilt operation, or the like so as to capture an image in an imaging direction in accordance with the control signal. In this manner, after a user gives the remote camera an instruction on change in angle of view by using the mobile terminal, the remote camera performs pan/tilt operation, or the like on the instruction, and transmits the captured image data to the mobile terminal. As a consequence, there is a problem that a delay occurs from when the instruction on change in angle of view is performed in the mobile terminal to when an image at the angle of view corresponding to the instruction is displayed.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention has been made to solve such a problem, and an object thereof is to provide an imaging apparatus, an imaging method, an imaging system, and a program that can improve the speed of change in the angle of view of a display image.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">With such a configuration, it is possible to change the angle of view of the display unit simply by changing<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> only the crop area without changing the angle of view of the captured image data.

An imaging apparatus 1 according to the embodiment includes a digital camera that can capture a moving image and a still image. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exterior perspective view of the imaging apparatus 1.</p><heading id="h0007">Exterior Configuration of Imaging Apparatus 1</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the imaging apparatus 1 includes a main unit 11, a support unit 12, arm units 13, a rotation platform 14, and a fixing platform 15.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The main unit 11 is a housing that houses a lens unit having a plurality of lenses, an imaging device, a battery, a Wi-Fi module, and the like. The lenses are attached to the front side of the main unit 11. The main unit 11 performs wireless communication with an operation terminal, which is described below, and operates in accordance with an instruction signal that is transmitted from the operation terminal.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The support unit 12 supports the main unit 11. Moreover, both ends of the support unit 12 in the lateral direction are rotatably coupled to the arm units 13. Hence, the support unit 12 can rotate in the direction of pitch that sets the lateral direction as an axis. One end of the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> arm unit 13 is coupled to the support unit 12. Moreover, the other end of the arm unit 13 is fixed to a side surface of the rotation platform 14.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The rotation platform 14 is disc shaped, and the arm units 13 are fixed at positions opposing each other on the side surface (peripheral surface) of the rotation platform 14. The rotation platform 14 is rotatably coupled to the fixing platform 15. Hence, the rotation platform 14 can rotate in the direction of yaw that sets the vertical direction as an axis. With such a configuration, the main unit 11 is supported so as to be located above the fixing platform 15, and can perform pan operation (yaw direction rotation) and tilt operation (pitch direction rotation). The pan and tilt operations are realized by driving an unillustrated motor. In other words, the support unit 12, the arm units 13, the rotation platform 14, and the fixing platform 15 function as a camera platform that is capable of pan and tilt operations.</p><heading id="h0008">Internal Configuration of Imaging Apparatus 1</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">A description will be given of the internal configuration of the main unit 11 of the imaging apparatus 1. <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of the main unit 11 according to the embodiment. The main unit 11 includes an imaging unit 100 constituted by a zoom lens 101, a focus lens 102, a diaphragm 103, and an imaging device 104. The zoom lens<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> 101 moves along an optical axis LA by an unillustrated zoom actuator. Similarly, the focus lens 102 moves along the optical axis LA by an unillustrated focus actuator. The diaphragm 103 is operated by being driven by an unillustrated diaphragm actuator. The imaging device 104 is constituted by a CCD (Charge Coupled Device), a CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor), or the like.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Image capturing using the imaging apparatus 1 is performed in the following procedure. The imaging device 104 performs photoelectric conversion of light that has passed through the zoom lens 101, the focus lens 102, and the diaphragm 103, and generates an analog image signal of a subject. After an analog image signal processor 105 amplifies the analog image signal, an image A/D conversion unit 106 converts the amplified signal into digital image data. An image input controller 107 captures the digital image data outputted from the image A/D conversion unit 106 as imaging data, and stores the data in a main memory 205 via a bus 200.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A digital signal processor 108 (a distortion correction processing unit) captures the imaging data stored in the main memory 205 via the bus 200 based on an instruction from a central control unit 400, and performs a predetermined signal process on an RGB signal to generate data including a luminance signal and a color difference<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> signal. The digital signal processor 108 also performs various digital corrections such as an offset process, a white balance adjustment process, a gamma correction process, an RGB complementation process, a noise reduction process, a contour correction process, a distortion correction process, a tone correction process, and a light source type determination process.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A microphone 109 collects ambient sound at the time of image capturing, and generates an analog audio signal. An analog audio signal processor 110 amplifies the analog audio signal generated by the microphone 109. An audio A/D conversion unit 111 then converts the amplified signal generated by the analog audio signal processor 110 into digital audio data. An audio input controller 112 stores in the main memory 205 the digital audio data outputted from the audio A/D conversion unit 111 together with the imaging data.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A multiplex unit 113 multiplexes compressed data of the imaging data and digital audio data that are stored in the main memory 205, and generates stream data. Moreover, the multiplex unit 113 performs an inverse multiplexing process on the stream data stored in a card type recording medium 302, and separates and generates compressed video data and compressed audio data.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A compression/extension processor 201 follows an<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> instruction from the central control unit 400 via the bus 200, performs a predetermined compression process on the imaging data and digital audio data that are stored in the main memory 205, and generates compressed data.

For example, if a fisheye lens is used, a distortion occurs with increasing distance from the center of the captured image data toward the outside. Hence, there is a difference in how a subject is viewed between a case where the subject is located in the center of the captured image data and a case where the subject is located at the end of the captured image data. Hence, if the image cropping unit 401 moves the crop area from the center to the end of the captured image data, the image data of the moved crop area distorts.<!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --></p><p id="p0102" num="0102">With the configuration of the imaging apparatus 1 according to the modification, the digital signal processor 108 performs distortion correction on the cropped image data based on the position of the crop area in the captured image data. For example, if the lens is a fisheye lens, the digital signal processor 108 does not perform distortion correction on the cropped image data if the crop area is located in the center of the captured image data. With increasing distance of the crop area from the center of the captured image data, the digital signal processor 108 increases the correction degree of distortion correction for the cropped image data. Consequently, the imaging apparatus 1 can transmit image data where distortion is suppressed to the operation terminal 20 regardless of the position of the subject in the captured image data.

Hence, the image cropping unit 401 previously deforms the crop area (e.g., a predetermined side of the<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> crop area is distorted outward or inward) such that the image data after distortion correction is rectangular, in accordance with the process content of the distortion correction process. The distortion correction process is then performed by the digital signal processor 108 to generate rectangular image data where distortion correction has been performed from the deformed image data. Consequently, image data to be transmitted to the operation terminal 20 always has a rectangular shape; accordingly, it is possible to improve visibility.
