A memory system generally includes a memory controller that manages access to the memory. The memory is typically configured in a matrix structure formed by rows and columns of memory cells, with each memory cell being capable of storing a bit of data. A block of memory cells may be accessed by a processing entity, or other source, by providing the appropriate address to the memory controller. The address from the processing entity may be sent to the memory controller over a bus with the row address occupying the higher-order bits and the starting column address occupying the lower-order bits. The memory controller uses a multiplexing scheme to send the row address to the memory followed by the starting column address.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">When a processing entity requires access to a block of memory, it sends a read or write command to the memory controller. Each read and write command includes an address. The manner in which the memory controller executes each command depends on whether the processing entity is attempting to access an open page in the memory. A "page" is normally associated with a row of memory, and an<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> "open page" means that the memory is pointing to a row of memory and requires only the starting column address and a column access strobe (CAS) to access the block of memory. To access an unopened page of memory, the memory controller must present the row address and a row access strobe (RAS) to the memory to move the pointer before presenting the starting column address and the CAS to the memory.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Various memories are used today in memory systems. A Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) is just one example. When a processing entity is writing to a SDRAM, or other memory device, data is transmitted over a data bus between the memory controller and the memory. A data mask may be used by the memory controller to mask data on the data bus. When the data mask is deasserted, the data on the data bus will be written to the memory. When the data mask is asserted, the data on the data bus will be ignored, and the write operation will not be performed.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The data mask is only used during write operations. When a processing entity is not writing to the SDRAM, or other memory device, the memory controller tri-states the data mask. Thus, there exists an opportunity to use the data mask for other purposes when the processing entity is not performing a write operation. By utilizing the data mask in this way, additional communications can occur between the memory controller and the memory without increasing the number of pins on the memory device.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">One aspect of a memory system is disclosed.

The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the present invention.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a conceptual block diagram illustrating an example of a processing system. The processing system 100 may be a collection of devices that cooperate to perform one or more processing functions. Typical applications for the processing system 100 include, but are not limited to, desktop computers, laptop computers, servers, cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDA), game consoles, pagers, modems, audio equipment, medical devices, automotive, video equipment, industrial equipment, or any other machine or device capable of processing, retrieving and storing information.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The processing system 100 is shown with a memory system 104 that may be accessed by any number of processing entities. In the configuration shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, three processors 102 are shown in communication with the memory system 104. Each processor 102 may be a general purpose processor, such as a microprocessor, a special<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> purpose processor, such as a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a direct memory access (DMA) controller, a bridge, a programmable logic component, or any other entity that requires access to the memory system 104.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a conceptual block diagram of a memory system. The memory system 104 includes a memory controller 202 that manages access to memory 204. The memory 204 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> as a multiple-bank memory device with four banks 204a-204d, but may have any number of banks depending on the particular application. A multiple-bank memory device may be thought of as a series of separate memories integrated into a single piece of silicon. In alternative embodiments of the memory system 104, the memory controller 202 may be configured to manage access to multiple memory devices, with each memory device being a single-bank or multiple-bank device. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the various concepts described throughout this disclosure may be applied to memory systems with different configurations.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The memory controller 202 may be any entity that controls the operation of one or more memory devices including a dedicated memory controller chip, a processor that directly controls the memory, controller circuitry on the memory device, or any other suitable arrangement. Each memory device may be any type of temporary storage device such as a SDRAM, DRAM, or RAM, or a longer term storage device such as flash memory, ROM memory, EPROM memory, EEPROM memory, etc.. In this example, the memory devices will be described in the context of a SDRAM, however, the various concepts described throughout this disclosure may be extended to other memory dcviccs.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">An example of a write operation to the memory device will be described with the reference to timing diagram of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. The memory device is enabled by asserting the chip select (CS) 301. Before a read or write operation can be performed to a bank within the memory device, a row in that bank must be opened. This is accomplished by sending both the bank address 308 and the row address 310 to the memory device and asserting the CS 301 and the RAS 302 by driving it into a logic "0" state at time 320. In this example, all control signals, except for the data mask, are "asserted" with a logic "0" state, however, the polarities may be switched in practice.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Once a row is opened in a memory device, the memory controller may read from or write to that row. At time 322, the memory controller initiates a write operation by sending the bank address 308 and the starting column address 312 to the memory device and asserting the CS 301, the CAS 304 and the write enable (WE) 306. After a predetermined delay following the assertion of the WE 306, the memory controller begins transmitting the data to be written to the memory device on the data bus 316 (see time 324). The memory device will ignore the data on the bus 316, and not perform a write operation, when the data mask is asserted. In this example, the data mask is asserted (i.e., driven into a logic "1" state) during the first data tenure 326. As a result, that data is not written to the memory device. During the second 328 and third 330 data tenures, the data mask is deaserted, and the data transmitted on the bus 316 is written to the memory device. As pointed out earlier, the polarity of an asserted data mask is chosen in this example for convenience of explanation, but may be any polarity in practice. Prior to such as time 332, and following, the write operation, the data bus 316 and data mask 318 are not loaded, for example, driven into a high impedance state or tri-stated.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a functional block diagram illustrating an example of a memory device 400. The memory device 400 includes control logic 401 that receives a CS, RAS, CAS and WE from the memory controller (not shown) and generates the appropriate triggers to perform read and write operations.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The memory device 400 also includes an address register 402 which receives an address from the memory controller. The address register 402 separates the addresses, sending the bank address to bank control logic 403, the row address to a multiplexer 404, and the starting column address to a column address counter 405. The bank control logic 403 selects the decoders from the row and column address decoders 408, 410 based on the bank address. The multiplexer 404 multiplexes the row address from the address register 402 with the output from a refresh counter 406 to the selected decoder in the row address decoder 408. The refresh counter 406 is used to generate a series of row addresses during a refresh period. The selected decoder in the row address decoder 408 decodes the row address when it receives a trigger from the control logic 401. The decoded row address is provided to the memory array 414 to open a row in the memory bank controlled by the selected decoder in the row address decoder 408.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Once the row is opened in the memory bank, the starting column address is output from the column address counter 405 when it receives a trigger from the control logic 401. Subsequent triggers from the control logic 401 are used to increment the column address counter 405 to create a series of column addresses sufficient to access a block of memory in the memory bank row to complete the read or write operation. The column address is provided to the decoder in the column address decoder 410 selected by the bank control logic 405. The selected decoder decodes the column address and provides the decoded address to an I/O and data mask logic unit 416. A signal from the control logic 401 is also provided to the I/O and data mask logic 416 to indicate whether the bus transaction is a read or write operation. In the case of a read operation, the contents of the memory array 414 specified by the bank, row, and column address is read into the I/O and data mask logic 416 before being transmitted to the memory controller by a data bus driver 423 via a bus driver 418. In the case of a write operation, the data on the data bus 418 is provided to the I/O and data mask logic 416 by a bus receiver 422. The data mask 430 is also provided to the I/O and data mask logic 416 by a data mask receiver 428. If the data mask is deasserted, the I/O and data mask logic 416 writes the data to the specified address in the memory array 414. If, on the other hand, the data mask is asserted, the data is ignored and the write operation is not performed.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As explained earlier, the data mask is tri-stated except when the memory controller is writing to the memory device 400. During that time, the data mask may be used to provide information or some type of notification to the memory controller. In one configuration of the memory device 400, the data mask may be used to indicate to the memory controller that there has been a change in status of the memory device 400. This concept may be used to eliminate the need of the memory controller to poll the status of the memory device 400 and provide the memory controller to be event driven. By way of example, and without limitation, the memory device 400 may use the data mask to indicate a change in temperature. Alternatively, or in addition to, the data mask may be used to indicate a timing error, such as a refresh error, The data mask may also be used to indicate an ECC (error-correcting code) error. Those skill in the art will be readily able to determine the information or the types of notifications best suited for any particular application.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">A state machine 426, or other entity, is used to monitor changes in the status of the memory device 400. When a change is detected, a signal or interrupt is output from the state machine 426 and provided to the input of a data mask driver 424. The state machine 426 also provides an enable signal 470 to the data mask driver 424. The enabled signal 470 is disabled from the data mask driver 424 when a write operation is being performed. By disabling the enable signal, the data mask driver 424 is forced into a tri-state condition, which allows the memory controller to use the data mask during the write operation. In one embodiment, the state machine 426 includes an internal timer (not shown) whose output controls the enable signal. The internal timer (not shown) is triggered or activated when the WE is asserted and remains activated for a time period sufficient to complete the write operation. The enable signal is removed from the data mask driver 424 while the internal timer (not shown) is activated.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a conceptual block diagram illustrating another example of a memory system. In this example, a memory controller 502 is shown in communication with a two rank memory 504 over a 32-bit data bus 506. The first rank 508 includes two 16-bit wide memory devices 508a-508b connected together to support a 32-bit bus connection. By way of example, the memory device 508a may be used for the lower-order bits and the memory device 508b may be used for the higher-order bits of any bus transaction. The second rank 510 also includes two 16-bit wide memory devices 510a-510b connected together in a similar fashion. Each memory device 508a-508b, 510a-510b may be a single-bank or multiple-bank device.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The signaling and addressing scheme between the memory controller 502 and the memory 504 is similar to that described in connection with <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> with the a common CS for each memory device in a rank. This common CS may be referred to as a rank select (RS) because it selects all the memory devices in a rank. In this example, the memory controller 502 sends an address over the data bus 506 to the memory devices in the selected rank, and asserts a RAS to open a row in a bank of a memory device and asserts a CAS to read from or write to that row. In the case of a write operation, the memory controller also asserts a WE.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a conceptual block diagram illustrating an example of the data mask signaling in the memory system of <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>. A data mask may be provided for each byte<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> lane on the data bus 506 (see <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>). Since there are four byte lanes on the bus (i.e., 32-bits), there are four data masks 601-604. The memory devices 508a, 510a connected to the two byte lanes carrying the lower-order bits receive two data masks 601, 602. The memory devices 508b, 510b connected the two byte lanes carrying the higher-order bits receive the other two data masks 603, 604. The four data masks 601-604 are utilized to facilitate the transmission of data between the memory controller 502 and the memory 504 when only a portion of the data bus is used. By way of example, a bus transaction may require only the writing of a single byte to the memory 504. The memory controller 502 may perform this bus transaction by transmitting the data on a single byte lane of the data bus and asserting the data masks for the other byte lanes. The data masks are used by the memory rank with the asserted RS to determine which byte lane the data is being transmitted on.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The data masks 601-604 may also be used by the memory 504 to indicate a change of status as discussed earlier in connection with <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, A different data mask may be assigned to each memory device 508a-508b, 510a-510b to provide a signal or interrupt to the memory controller when a write operation is not being performed. By way of example, the first data mask 601 may be assigned to the memory device 508a handling the lower-order bits in the first rank 508, the second data mask 602 may be assigned to the memory device 510a handling the lower-order bits in the second rank 510, the third data mask 603 may be assigned to the memory device 508b handling the higher-order bits in the first rank 508, and the fourth data mask 601 may be assigned to the memory device 510b handling the higher-order bits in the second rank 510. The memory controller can determine which of the four memory devices 508a-508b, 510a-510b is sending information or a notification based on the particular data mask carrying the signal or interrupt. All four data masks 601-604 may not be loaded by the memory devices 508a, 508b, 510a, 510b during a write operation to any of the memory devices. Various methods may be used to ensure that the data masks 601-604 are not loaded by the memory devices 508a, 508b, 510a, 510b during a write operation including tristating the lines, terminating the lines, switching techniques, etc.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> is a functional block diagram of a memory device of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>.
