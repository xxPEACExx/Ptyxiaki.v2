More particularly, the disclosure relates to an antenna apparatus of a communication terminal.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In general, a wireless communication system provides various multimedia services such as global positioning system (GPS), Bluetooth, and Internet services. In this case, the high data rate for a huge amount of data must be ensured in order to smoothly provide the multimedia services in the wireless communication system. To this end, studies and researches have been conducted to improve the performance of the antenna apparatus in the communication terminal. This is because the antenna apparatus substantially transceives data in the communication terminal. The antenna apparatus operates at an appropriate resonance frequency band to transceive data.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, the antenna apparatus has the narrow frequency band. Therefore, the communication terminal may include a plurality of antenna apparatuses to enlarge the resonance frequency band. However, since the installation space for the antennal apparatuses is required in the communication terminal, the difficulty is made when reducing the size of the communication terminal. In other words, it is impossible to use a wider resonance frequency band through a single antennal apparatus in the communication terminal.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>SUMMARY</u></b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">The disclosure provides an antenna apparatus having a wider resonance frequency band. In other words, the disclosure is to enlarge the resonance frequency<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> band of the antenna apparatus while reducing the size of the antenna apparatus.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In order to accomplish the above object of the disclosure, there is provided an antenna apparatus including a feeding pad for supplying a signal, a main device extended from the feeding pad, and a sub-device extended from the feeding pad and spaced apart from the main device while overlapping with the main device.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In addition, there is provided an antenna apparatus including a substrate having a feeding pad for supplying a signal, a sub-device mounted on the substrate and extended from the feeding pad, a mounting member comprising a bottom surface mounted on the substrate and the sub-device and a top surface spaced apart from the bottom surface in one direction perpendicular to the bottom surface, and a main device extended from the feeding pad, mounted on the top surface, and overlapped with the sub-device through the mounting member.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As described above, the antenna apparatus according to the disclosure includes the sub-device overlapped with the main device, so that the resonance frequency band of the antenna apparatus can be enlarged. Therefore, the communication terminal can use a wider resonance frequency band through the single antenna apparatus. Accordingly, since the communication terminal does not require a plurality of antenna apparatuses, the size of the communication terminal can be reduced.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view showing an antenna apparatus according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is an exploded perspective view showing the antenna apparatus according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> shows graphs to explain the operating characteristic of the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> antenna apparatus according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a perspective view showing an antenna apparatus according to another embodiment; and</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is an exploded perspective view showing the antenna apparatus according to another embodiment.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</u></b></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">Hereinafter, the embodiments will be described in more detail wither reference to accompanying drawings.
