The IPM motor can use both of a reluctance torque caused by magnetization of the rotor and a torque caused by magnetization of the magnet, and the magnet is embedded in the interior of the rotor formed of a silicon steel plate. As a result, the magnet does not fall out to the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> external by a centrifugal force of the motor even during rotation of the motor, and an excellent safety is obtained. For that reason, a current phase is controlled to enable high torque operation and operation at an extensive speed.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Incidentally, in general, there has been known that in an induction motor using no magnet, when the motor is driven by an inverter circuit, an iron loss of a rotor is converted into a heat, a temperature of the rotor rises, and a motor torque is lessened. In particular, in the case of the IPM motor in which the magnet is embedded in the interior of the motor, a magnet temperature also rises in association with the temperature rise of the rotor. When the magnet temperature exceeds a limit temperature, the magnet is demagnetized to further lessen the motor torque. Also, there arises such a problem that even if the magnet thus demagnetized is cooled to return the magnet temperature to the limit temperature, a desired motor torque is not obtained.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Under the circumstances, in order to suppress a reduction in the torque of the motor attributable to the rise of the rotor temperature and a reduction in the efficiency caused by the torque reduction, there arises an urgent issue in this field to precisely measure the rotor temperature within the motor, and also the temperature of the magnet when the magnet is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> embedded in the rotor.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, because the rotor per se rotates during driving of the motor, it is extremely difficult to measure the temperature of the rotor or the magnet within the rotor, for example, by cable. It is also conceivable to measure the temperature of the rotor, etc. by a non-contact thermometer such as a thermography. However, this makes the device configuration complicated and upsized, resulting in an increase in the manufacturing costs of the motor.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Under the circumstances, a technique of measuring the rotor temperature or the magnet temperature with the use of a cooling oil that is reflexed within the motor in order to cool the rotor is disclosed in PTL 1 and PTL 2. PTL 1 discloses a rotor temperature estimation method of measuring an inflow temperature of the cooling oil before being supplied to the rotor and an outflow temperature of the cooling oil after the rotor has been cooled, in reflexing the cooling oil within the motor, and estimating the rotor temperature on the basis of the inflow temperature, the outflow temperature, a thermal resistance of the rotor which has been obtained in advance, and a weight corresponding to an operating status of the rotor.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Also, PTL 2 discloses a magnet temperature estimation<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> device and a method therefor, which estimate the magnet temperature by directly measuring the temperature of the cooling oil after the magnet has been cooled, which is emitted by a centrifugal force when rotationally driving the rotor.
<ul><li>PTL 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2000023421A"><text>JP-A-2000-23421</text></patcit></li><li>PTL 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2008178243A"><text>JP-A-2008-178243</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0003">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0004">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the rotor temperature estimation method disclosed in PTL 1, because the rotor temperature or the magnetic temperature is estimated with the use of an arithmetic expression defined in advance, the operation of constructing a variable for the arithmetic operation is required. Also, in order to make an estimated value of the rotor temperature or the magnetic temperature, which is calculated according to the above arithmetic expression, approximate to a real temperature of the rotor or the magnet, there is a need to detect the states of the cooling oil such as the flow rate or flow velocity of the cooling oil, the inflow temperature of the cooling oil into the rotor, or the outflow temperature of the cooling oil from the rotor, with high precision.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Also, in the magnet temperature estimation device and<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the method therefor disclosed in PTL 2, the cooling oil temperature to be measured is changed by the flow rate of the cooling oil or the inflow temperature of the cooling oil into the rotor. For that reason, the rotor temperature or the magnet temperature to be estimated cannot be made to approximate to the real temperature without a complicated calculation taking the flow rate and the inflow temperature into account.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Thus, in both of the rotor temperature estimation methods disclosed in PTL 1 and PTL 2, there is a need to accurately grasp a circulation state of the cooling oil subjected to forced convection such as the flow velocity or the flow rate, and the temperature change when the cooling oil passes through the rotor. However, it is difficult to detect the state of the cooling oil with elaboration. Therefore, the rotor temperature or the magnet temperature cannot be measured with high precision.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide a motor that can detect the rotor temperature with high precision with a simple configuration not taking an influence on the temperature caused by the circulation of the cooling oil into account.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><heading id="h0005">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">In order to solve the above problem, according to the present invention, there is provided a motor, including a rotor, a stator arranged around the rotor, and a temperature sensor, in which the rotor includes an oil reservoir unit that reserves an oil on a rotating shaft line in an interior thereof, and the temperature sensor detects a temperature of the oil reserved in the oil reservoir unit.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to the above configuration, since the rotor includes the oil reservoir unit for reserving the oil on the rotating shaft line, the reserved oil temperature can be detected by the temperature sensor, and a rotor temperature can be detected according to the oil temperature. As a result, the rotor temperature can be detected with high precision not taking an influence of an inflow temperature, the flow rate, and the flow velocity of the oil into account. Advantageous Effects of Invention</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As understandable from the above description, according to the present invention, the rotor temperature can be easily detected with high precision by measuring a temperature of a fluid reserved in the reservoir unit within the rotor. In particular, in the case of a magnet motor in which a magnet<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> is embedded within the rotor, a magnet temperature can be also calculated with high precision with the use of the detected rotor temperature, and the demagnetization of the magnet attributable to the temperature rise can be effectively suppressed.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The other problems, configurations and advantageous effects will become apparent from the following description of the embodiments.</p><heading id="h0006">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1] FIG. 1</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view illustrating a motor according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2] FIG. 2</figref> is an enlarged diagram of an oil reservoir unit according to the first embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, in which (a) shows a vertical cross-sectional view illustrating a relationship between an oil and a temperature sensor in a motor stop state, (b) shows a view taken along an arrow A-A of (a), (c) shows a vertical cross-sectional view illustrating a relationship between the oil and the temperature sensor in a motor drive state, and (d) shows a view taken along an arrow C-C of (c).</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3] FIG. 3</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view illustrating a motor according to a second embodiment of the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> present invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4] FIG. 4</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view illustrating a motor according to a third embodiment of the present invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5] FIG. 5</figref> is an enlarged diagram of an oil reservoir unit according to a third embodiment of the present invention, in which (a) shows a vertical cross-sectional view illustrating a relationship of an oil, a temperature sensor, and a continuous hole in a motor stop state, and (b) is a vertical cross-sectional view illustrating a relationship of the oil, the temperature sensor, and the continuous hole in a motor drive state.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6] FIG. 6</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view illustrating a motor according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0007">List of Reference Signs</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018"><ul><li>1, rotor</li><li>2, stator</li><li>3, coil</li><li>4, oil reservoir unit</li><li>6, oil seal</li><li>7, step</li><li>8, 19, oil supply path</li><li>9, magnet<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></li><li>10, gear</li><li>11, oil inflow path</li><li>12, inflow port</li><li>13, oil outflow path</li><li>14, outflow port</li><li>15, coupling path</li><li>16, continuous hole</li><li>17, partition</li><li>18, oil circulation path</li><li>19A, oil exhaust path</li><li>20, 60, motor cover</li><li>21, outside cap</li><li>22, inside cap</li><li>23, 63, bearing</li><li>24, inverter circuit</li><li>25, 65, rotating angle sensor</li><li>26, rotation control means</li><li>27, temperature calculation unit</li><li>28, substrate</li><li>29, 68, opening portion</li><li>30, temperature sensor</li><li>31, cylindrical portion</li><li>32, bottom portion</li><li>33, jaw portion</li><li>34, corner portion<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></li><li>35, housing</li><li>36, temperature detection unit</li><li>40, reducer</li><li>41, housing</li><li>42, oil storage chamber</li><li>43, gear</li><li>44, shaft</li><li>45, bearing</li><li>46, oil seal</li><li>47, oil pool</li><li>48, oil supply path,</li><li>51, motor case</li><li>52, water jacket</li><li>53, bearing</li><li>54, step</li><li>61, 62, oil seal</li><li>64, oil storage unit</li><li>69, oil exhaust path</li><li>100, 200, 300, 400, motor</li><li>A, continuous hole inner diameter</li><li>D, oil reservoir unit inner diameter</li><li>d, temperature sensor outer diameter</li><li>L, rotor rotating shaft line</li><li>P, PA, oil</li></ul></p><heading id="h0008">Description of Embodiments</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --><p id="p0019" num="0019">Hereinafter, a motor according to embodiments of the present invention will described with reference to the drawings.</p><heading id="h0009">[First Embodiment]</heading><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a motor according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In the first embodiment, a configuration in which a magnet is embedded in an interior of a rotor will be described. However, the same configuration can be applied to a configuration in which no magnet is embedded in the interior of the rotor.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A motor 100 shown in the figure includes a rotor 1 and a stator 2 arranged around an outer peripheral surface 1A of the rotor 1, and a coil 3 is wound on the stator 2 in multiple turns, and the coil 3 is energized so that the rotor 1 is rotationally driven about a rotating shaft line L as a rotating center. A magnet 9 is embedded in an interior of the rotor 1 along the outer peripheral surface 1A thereof.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Also, a motor case 51 internally having a water jacket 52 which circulates a cooling water is disposed outside of the stator 2. With this configuration, an outer peripheral surface of the rotor 1 and the stator 2 can be protected from<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> an external environment, and a heat radiated from the rotor 1 can be absorbed by the internal cooling water to cool the rotor 1 or the stator 2. Also, a motor cover 20 including an outside cap 21 and an inside cap 22 is disposed on one end side of the rotor 1 in the rotating shaft line L direction. A substrate 28 is disposed on a surface 22A of the inside cap 22 of the motor cover 20 facing the outside cap 21, and an inverter circuit 24 having a temperature calculation unit 27 that calculates a rotor temperature and a magnet temperature is placed on the substrate 28. The inverter circuit 24 further includes a rotation control unit 26 so as to control a rotating speed of the rotor 1 on the basis of a signal from a rotating angle sensor 25 disposed on the rotor 1 side of the inside cap 22 in order to detect the rotation of the rotor 1 and the rotor temperature and the magnet temperature calculated by the temperature calculation unit 27. Also, bearings 53 and 23 are disposed between the motor case 51 and the rotor 1, and between the inside cap 22 and the rotor 1, respectively, so that the rotor 1 can rotate relatively with respect to the motor case 51 and the inside cap 22.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">An oil reservoir unit 4 for reserving an oil P on the rotating shaft line L of the rotor 1 is disposed on an end of the motor cover 20 side of the rotor 1. In this example, the oil reservoir unit 4 is formed into substantially a cylindrical<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> shape coaxial with the rotating shaft line L of the rotor 1. Also, an opening portion 29 is formed substantially in the center (on the rotating shaft line L of the rotor 1) of the inside cap 22 of the motor cover 20. A temperature sensor 30 is inserted through the opening portion 29 along the rotating shaft line L, and fitted to the inside cap 22 by a jaw portion 33. The jaw portion 33 of the temperature sensor 30 is fixedly engaged with an outer peripheral portion of the opening portion 29 of the inside cap 22 so that the temperature sensor 30 is fixed to the inside cap 22. In this example, the temperature sensor 30 is formed into the substantially cylindrical shape coaxial with the rotating shaft line L of the rotor 1, as with the oil reservoir unit 4.

An outer diameter of the temperature sensor 30 is set to be relatively smaller than an inner diameter of the oil reservoir unit 4.

Also, an opening portion 68 is formed substantially in the center (on the rotating shaft line L of the rotor 1) of the motor cover 60, and the temperature sensor 30 is attached to pass through the opening portion 68.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In this example, the partition 17 is disposed between the oil supply path 19 and the oil reservoir unit 4 as in the third embodiment, and the continuous hole 16 is formed substantially in the center of the partition 17 so that a part of the oil P flowing in the oil supply path 19 is supplied to<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> the oil reservoir unit 4.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In the fourth embodiment, as in the third embodiment, when the motor cover 60 is fitted to the motor case 51, there is no need to pour the oil P into the oil reservoir unit 4 in advance. That is, after the motor cover 60 is fitted to the motor case 51, the rotor 1 is rotated at a desired rotating speed so that a part of the oil P flowing in the oil supply path 19 can be supplied to the oil reservoir unit 4 through the continuous hole 16.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The four embodiments of the present invention have been described above. However, the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments, but can be variously modified in design without departing from the spirit of the invention disclosed in the claims.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">As understandable from the above description, according to the first to fourth embodiments, the rotor temperature can be detected through the oil which is reserved in the oil reservoir unit. That is, because there is no need to consider the influence of the inflow temperature, the flow rate, and the flow velocity of the oil in measuring the oil temperature reserved in the oil reservoir unit, the rotor temperature can be detected with easy and high precision on the basis of the<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> above measurement result. Further, when the magnet is embedded within the rotor, because the magnet temperature can be calculated with high precision on the basis of the detected rotor temperature, the rotating speed of the rotor can be controlled to suppress the demagnetization of the magnet. As a result, the motor can be driven with a high torque and a high efficiency for a long duration.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The present invention is not limited to the above first to fourth embodiments, but includes a variety of modified examples. For example, the above first to fourth embodiments are described in detail for facilitation to understand the present invention, and the present invention does not always provide all of the configurations described above. Also, a part of one configuration example can be replaced with another configuration example, and the configuration of one embodiment can be added with the configuration of another embodiment. Also, in a part of the respective first to fourth embodiments, another configuration can be added, deleted, or replaced.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Also, control lines and information lines necessary for description are illustrated, and all of the control lines and the information lines necessary for products are not illustrated. In fact, it may be conceivable that most of the configurations are connected to each other.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56976679" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A motor comprising: a rotor, a stator arranged around the rotor, and a temperature sensor,<br/>
