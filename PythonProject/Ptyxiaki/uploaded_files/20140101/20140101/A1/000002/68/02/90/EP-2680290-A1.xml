The electronic switch 100 may be formed in a polyhedral shape and have a hollow and an opened low surface. A seal cup 111 for connecting with a seal plate 137 which will be described below is provided at a low end of the housing 110.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Meanwhile, gas for arc extinction is injected into the housing 110. For example, hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) may be injected into the housing 110 at the ratio of about 9:1.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">A fixed contact point 120 is installed in the housing 110. The fixed contact point 120 is installed while passing through a top surface of the housing 110, such that at least one portion of the fixed contact point 120 is placed in the housing 110.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the embodiment, a gas inflow space 121 is formed in the fixed contact point 120. The gas inflow space 121 may be formed on one surface of the fixed contact point 120, one surface of a movable contact point 140 which will be described below, or both of the fixed and movable contact points 120 and 140. However, as one example, the case that the gas inflow space 121 is formed on one surface of the fixed contact point 120 will be described in the embodiment. One portion of the fixed contact point 120 is concaved such that the gas inflow space 121 is formed. In more detail, one surface of the fixed contact point 120, which faces the movable contact point 140, is concaved therein, so that the gas inflow space 121 is formed. An inlet 123 of the gas inflow space<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> 121 is placed on a low surface of the fixed contact point 120 which makes contact with the movable contact point 140. Gas flows into the gas inflow space 121 while the movable contact point 140 is making contact with the fixed contact point 120.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Further, a coil assembly 130 is installed in the housing 110. The coil assembly 130 includes a coil 131, a bobbin 133 and a yoke 135. The coil 131 is wound around an outer surface of the bobbin 133 which is formed in a cylindrical shape and has a hollow. The coil 131 generates an electromagnetic field when current is applied to the coil 131. The yoke 135 has a polyhedral shape surrounding the bobbin 133 and the coil 131.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Meanwhile, the seal plate 137 is installed on the top surface of the yoke 135. The seal plate 137 substantially seals an opened top surface of the yoke 135.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A cylinder 139 extends by passing through the yoke 135. The cylinder 139 may be formed in a hollow cylindrical shape and may be placed in a longitudinal direction. The top surface of the cylinder 139 may be opened and the top end of the cylinder 139 may make contact with the low surface of the seal plate 137.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The movable contact point 140 is movably installed in the housing 110. The movable contact point 140 makes contact with or is separated from the fixed contact point 120. One surface of the movable contact point 140 which faces the fixed contact point 120 is capable of making surface-contact with one surface of the fixed contact point 120 which faces the movable contact point 140. If the movable contact point 140 makes contact with the fixed contact point 120, the electronic switch 100 is switched on so that power is supplied to a load. If the movable contact point 140 is separated from the fixed contact point 120, the electronic switch 100 is switched off so that power is shut off.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In the embodiment, the movable contact point 140 allows the inlet 123 of the gas inflow space 121 to be selectively turned on or off. In other words, in the state that the fixed contact point 120 makes contact with the movable contact point 140, the movable contact point 140<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> allows the inlet 123 of the gas inflow space 121 to be closed. If the movable contact point 140 is spaced apart from the fixed contact point 120, the movable contact point 140 allows the inlet 123 of the gas inflow space 121 to be opened.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Meanwhile, the movable contact point 140 moves by an actuating unit 150, so that the movable contact point 140 makes contact with or is spaced apart from the fixed contact point 120. The actuating unit 150 includes a fixed core 151 fixed inn the cylinder 139, a movable core 153 movably installed in the cylinder 139, a return spring 155 of providing elastic force to the movable core 153, and a movable shaft 157 of moving together with the movable core 153.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In more detail, the fixed core 151 is fixed at an upper portion in the cylinder 139. A low end of the fixed core 151 is spaced apart from a low end of the cylinder 139 by a predetermined distance.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The movable core 153 is placed in the cylinder 139, which corresponds to a low portion of the fixed core 151. The movable core 153 moves closely the fixed coil 151 due to the electromagnetic filed generated from the coil 131.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The return spring 155 applies elastic force to the movable core 153 such that the movable core 153 moves in a direction to be spaced apart from the fixed core 151. For example, a coil spring may serve as the return spring 155. The coil spring is placed between the fixed and movable cores 151 and 153 and has both ends which are supported by the fixed and movable cores 151 and 153.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Further, the elastic force of a wipe spring 160 is provided to the movable core 153. The wipe spring 160 provide a contact pressure to the movable core 153 such that the contact state of the movable core 152 with the fixed contact point 120 is maintained.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Hereinafter, the electronic switch according to the first embodiment will be described in detail with reference to accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref> are views showing the states of an off-operation of<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the electronic switch according the first embodiment.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">First, when the electronic switch 100 is switched on, power is supplied to the coil 131. Thus, the magnetic field is generated from the coil 131 and the movable core 153 moves toward the fixed core 151 while overcoming the elastic force of the return spring 155 by Fleming's left-hand rule. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, as the movable core 153 moves, the movable contact point 140 moves toward the fixed contact point 120. Thus, while the movable contact point 140 moves to make contact with the fixed contact point 120, the gas stored in the housing 110 flows into the gas inflow space 121. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, if the fixed and movable contact points 120 and 140 make contact with each other, the inlet 123 of the gas inflow space 121 is closed by the movable contact point 140.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Next, if the electronic switch 100 is switched off, the power supplied to the coil 131 is shut off. Thus, due to the elastic force of the return spring 155, the movable core 153 moves in the direction so that movable core 153 is spaced apart from the fixed core 151. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, as the movable core 153 moves, the movable contact point 140 is spaced apart from the fixed contact point 120.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Meanwhile, while the fixed and movable contact points 120 and 140 are separated from each other, an arc having high temperature is generated. Then, the gas which is reserved in the gas inflow space 121 is substantially heated by the arc. Thus, as the gas which flows into the gas inflow space 121 is increased, the internal pressure of the gas inflow space 121 is increased.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In this case, when the movable contact point 140 moves to be spaced apart from the fixed contact point 120, the inlet 123 of the gas inflow space 121 is opened. As described above, since the inside of the gas inflow space 121 has a relatively high pressure, if the inlet 123 of the gas inflow space 121 is opened, the gas in the gas inflow space 121 is exhausted to an outside. Thus, since the movable contact point 140 is pressed by the gas that is exhausted from the inside to the outside of the gas inflow space 121, the movable contact point 140 can be separated<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> rapidly and substantially from the fixed contact point 120.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Hereinafter, the electronic switch according to the second embodiment will be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a perspective view showing a fixed contact point of an electronic switch according to the second embodiment. The same reference numerals as those used in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> according to the first embodiment are assigned to the same portions as those used in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> according to the first embodiment and the detailed descriptions are omitted.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, according to the present embodiment, a plurality of gas inflow spaces 221 are provided in a fixed contact point 220. An inlet 223 of the gas inflow space 221 is placed at one surface of the fixed contact point 220. Substantially, the inlet 223 is placed at one surface of the fixed contact point 220 making contact with the movable contact point 140. The gas inflow space 221 is disposed symmetrically with respect to the center of the cross section of the fixed contact point 220. Substantially, the gas inflow space 221 is disposed symmetrically with respect to the center of the one surface of the fixed contact point 220 which makes contact with the movable contact point 140. This is for applying substantially uniform external force over the whole area of the movable contact point 140 by the gas exhausted from the inside of the gas inflow space 221 to an outside. Thus, according to the embodiment, in the process of separating the fixed and movable contact points 220 and 140 from each other, the contact portions of both points can be separated entirely and uniformly from each other.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Although embodiments have been described with reference to a number of illustrative embodiments thereof, it should be understood that numerous other modifications and embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art that will fall within the spirit and scope of the principles of this disclosure.
