Briefly described, fuel gas, such as hydrogen gas, is supplied to the fuel electrode (i.e., anode-side electrode), and oxidant gas, such as air, is supplied to the air electrode (i.e., a cathode-side electrode). The hydrogen gas is supplied to the anode-side electrode through a fuel gas flow passage, and is dissociated into electrons and hydrogen ions by the action of a catalyst<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> of the electrode. The electrons move to the cathode side electrode through an external circuit. Meanwhile, the hydrogen ions pass through the electrolyte membrane and reach the cathode electrode, where the hydrogen ions bond to oxygen and the electrons passing through the external circuit to produce reaction water. The heat generated by the bonding reaction of hydrogen with oxygen and electrons is recovered by means of cooling water.

Basic Principle</heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">First, the basic principle of the present embodiments will be described.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In a fuel cell, heat and generated water are generated as a result of generation of electric power. The generated water produced on the cathode side is pushed out by oxidant gas such as air within the cathode side gas flow passage and flows from the upstream side to the downstream side of the gas flow passage. Consequently, a dry-up phenomenon is likely to occur on the gas upstream side and a flooding phenomenon is likely to occur on the gas downstream side.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In order to prevent the dry-up on the gas upstream side, while there can be considered external humidification of the oxidant gas by using a humidifier or the like before supply of the oxidant gas to a cell of a fuel cell, this method additionally requires a humidifier and therefore causes an increase in cost. It is therefore desirable to suppress the dry-up phenomenon without humidification and to simultaneously suppress the flooding phenomenon.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to the present embodiments, the anode-side gas flow passage and the cathode-side gas flow passage are set as opposed flow passages whose flow directions are opposite each other, such that, via an MEA, the upstream side of the anode-side gas flow passage and the downstream side of the cathode-side flow passage are opposed to each other and the downstream side of the anode-side gas flow passage and the upstream side of the cathode-side flow passage are opposed to each other.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Then, in a region in which the upstream side of the anode-side gas flow passage and the downstream side of the cathode-side gas flow passage are opposed to each other via the MEA, the temperature of the downstream side of the cathode-side gas flow passage is set to be relatively higher than the temperature of the upstream side of the anode-side gas flow passage. Further, in a region in which the downstream side of the anode-side gas flow passage and the upstream side of the cathode-side gas flow passage are opposed<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> to each other via the MEA, the temperature of the downstream side of the anode-side gas flow passage is set to be relatively higher than the temperature of the upstream side of the cathode-side gas flow passage.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the cathode-side gas flow passage, the generated water is pushed out by the oxidant gas such as air and flows toward the downstream side. Here, because the temperature of the downstream side of the cathode-side gas flow passage is higher than the temperature of the upstream side of the anode-side gas flow passage, the generated water flowing toward the downstream side of the cathode-side gas flow passage flows toward the upstream side of the cathode-side gas flow passage, whose temperature is relatively lower, via the MEA. Then, the generated water which has moved to the upstream side of the anode-side gas flow passage is pushed out by the fuel gas such as oxygen gas in the anode-side gas flow passage and flows toward the downstream side of the anode-side gas flow passage.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As the temperature on the downstream side of the anode-side gas flow passage is higher than the temperature on the upstream side of the cathode-side gas flow passage, the generated water which has flowed to the downstream side of the anode-side gas flow passage moves, via the MEA, to the upstream side of the cathode-side gas flow passage where the temperature is relatively lower.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> Consequently, the generated water produced on the cathode side flows sequentially through the upstream side of the cathode-side gas flow passage, the downstream side of the cathode-side gas flow passage, the upstream side of the anode-side gas flow passage, the downstream side of the anode-side gas flow passage, and back to the upstream side of the cathode-side gas flow passage, thereby circulating within the cathode-side gas flow passage and the anode-side gas flow passage. Accordingly, the flooding phenomenon on the downstream side of the cathode-side gas flow passage can be suppressed and also the dry-up phenomenon on the upstream side of the cathode-side gas flow passage can be suppressed simultaneously.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In order to make the temperature on the downstream side of the cathode-side gas flow passage relatively higher than the temperature on the upstream side of the anode-side gas flow passage in the region where the upstream side of the anode-side gas flow passage and the downstream side of the cathode-side gas flow passage are opposed to each other, it is sufficient to make the cooling performance (or the heat releasing property) of the upstream side of the anode-side gas flow passage relatively greater than that of the downstream side of the cathode-side gas flow passage.

As a matter of course, in this case,<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> as in the examples described above, the contact area of the ribs in each flow passage should be varied to form a temperature gradient.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Further, while in the present embodiments, the contact area of the expanded metal body or the contact area of the ribs is varied, the contact ratio, rather than the contact area, may be varied. Here, the contact ratio refers to a ratio of the area of the expanded metal body or the recesses and projections forming the gas flow passage which is in contact with the gas diffusion layer with respect to the surface area of the interface between the expanded metal body or the recesses and projections forming the gas flow passage and the gas diffusion layer. According to the present embodiments, the difference in the contact ratio between the cathode-side gas flow passage 18 and the anode-side gas flow passage 16 (or 17) is used to thereby form a temperature gradient, so that the generated water can be moved. The contact ratios of the cathode-side gas flow passage 18 and the anode-side gas flow passage 16 (or 17) in the region A of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, for example, are as follows:
<ul><li>Cathode-side gas flow passage 18: 8 to 10%</li><li>Anode-side gas flow passage 16: 15 to 20%</li></ul>
While the difference in the contact areas is preferably 7% or more, the difference is not limited to this range. The applicant of the present application has confirmed that with the difference in the contact ratios of at least 1% being present between the anode-side gas flow passage 18 and the<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> cathode-side gas flow passage 16 (or 17), the generated water can be moved to the opposite flow passage via the MEA 10.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Also, while in the present embodiments, an expanded metal body has been described as a member for forming the cathode-side gas flow passage 18, such a member is not limited to this example, and there can be used an expanded metal body and other metal members, more particularly a metal porous body.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Moreover, in the present embodiments, a high-temperature non-humidified operation can be performed because the generated water is supplied to the upstream of the cathode-side gas flow passage by circulating the water in the opposed flow passages. As a matter of course, however, a humidified operation can be performed as necessary and is not excluded. However, the non-humidified operation is particularly preferable for mass production because humidifying equipment is not required and therefore costs can be reduced.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">In addition, while the fuel cell of the present embodiments can be mounted in a vehicle such as an electric vehicle or a fuel cell vehicle, the fuel cell of the present invention is not limited for use with a vehicle.</p><heading id="h0016">REFERENCE NUMERALS LIST</heading><p id="p0081" num="0081"><!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> 10 MEA, 12 anode-side gas diffusion layer, 14 cathode-side gas diffusion layer, 16, 17 anode-side gas flow passage, 18 cathode-side gas flow passage, 20, 22 separator</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56976738" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A fuel cell, comprising:
