For example, an EtherCAT-standard device has two types of connection interfaces, namely an external bus (RJ45) and an internal bus (E-Bus) for its connection ports, so that the ports having the different types of connection interfaces cannot be connected to each other. Therefore, in design of the industrial network system, it is necessary to take into consideration the types of the connection port interfaces. However, the conventional design assistance system might find it difficult to grasp information about the types of the connection port interfaces. In a case where a user having no expert knowledge or experiences of SEs designs a network system or builds a real machine, a problem occurs in that such a design assistance system cannot easily design a network system that meets requirements of the user.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In view of the problems, the invention has been developed, and it is an object of the invention to provide a design assistance system by which even a user having no expert knowledge can easily design a network system that takes into consideration the type of the connection interface for the ports.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0007">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The invention provides a design assistance system for assisting design of a network system in which at least one slave device joins to a communication bus drawing a line, tree, or star topology from a master device as a starting point, the network system being formed by interconnecting ports of each of the master and slave devices, the design assistance system including:

The network system is an industrial field network formed by interconnecting ports of each of the master<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> and slave devices and can be illustrated as, for example, an EtherCAT-standard network system. The EtherCAT network system has two types of connection interfaces provided to the slave device, namely an external bus (RJ45) and an internal bus (E-Bus). The design assistance system of the present embodiment is not limited in application to design of an EtherCAT network system, and the port connection interface may be of any types other than the external and internal types.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">A design assistance system 1 has a display 2 which displays a design assistance graphical user interface (GUI), a personal computer (PC) 3 which controls the GUI displayed on the display 2, and an input device 4 which is configured by a keyboard or mouse with which a user provides the PC 3 with commands to operate the GUI. The design assistance system 1 enables the user to design a network system off-line.
