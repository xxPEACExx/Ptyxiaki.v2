This electronic apparatus 1 is formed with a battery device 11, a low-pass filter 12, an operating unit 13, a high-pass filter 14, and a management device 15.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The battery device 11 includes one or more battery cells (such as the battery cell 31-1 shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>) provided therein, and supplies DC voltage/DC current, or DC power, to the operating unit 13 via power lines 17 and 18. The operating unit 13 receives the supply of DC power from the battery device 11 via the low-pass filter 12, and performs various kinds of operations. For example, when the electronic apparatus 1 is regarded as an electric vehicle (EV), the operating unit 13 is equivalent to the motor that rotationally drives the tires. The battery device 11 can be formed as a battery pack, for example.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The low-pass filter 12 is placed on the power lines 17 and 18 between the battery device 11 and the operating unit 13, and<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> can supply DC power to the operating unit 13 that is a block that operates with the DC power. The low-pass filter 12 blocks an AC signal that is generated by the management device 15 and is transmitted via the power lines 17 and 18, to prevent the AC signal from entering the operating unit 13 that operates with DC power and breaking the operating unit 13.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The high-pass filter 14 passes the AC signal generated by the management device 15 to the battery device 11 via the power lines 17 and 18. The high-pass filter 14 also blocks the DC power transmitted via the power lines 17 and 18, and prevents the DC power from breaking the management device 15 that operates with AC power.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The management device 15 manages the battery device 11 by communicating the AC signal to and from the battery device 11 via the power lines 17 and 18. The management device 15 includes the functional blocks of a generating unit 21, a modulating unit 22, a transmitting unit 23, a demodulating unit 24, a determining unit 25, and a processing unit 26.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The generating unit 21 generates a command for an IC chip 53 (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>) of the battery device 11. The modulating unit 22 modulates a carrier wave in accordance with the generated command, and outputs the modulated carrier wave as the AC signal. The carrier wave may be a high-frequency signal (also referred to as a RF signal) having a frequency f of 13.56 MHz, for example.
