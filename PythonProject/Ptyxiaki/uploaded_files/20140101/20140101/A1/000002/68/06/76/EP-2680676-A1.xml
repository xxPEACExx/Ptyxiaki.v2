Accordingly, if an illumination space is designed focusing on only the illuminance on the floor surface, the desktop of the work desk and so on, the person who is located in the illumination space feels that the entire illumination space is dark, and the comfort in the illumination space is spoiled. This is because the brightness of the ceiling surface and the wall surface is not taken into consideration.</p><p id="p0135" num="0135">In response to this problem, there has been proposed a method of designing an illumination space with use of the concept of the brightness index (Feu value) as an index for evaluating the sense of brightness of the entire illumination space (see Reference 1: Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2007171055A"><text>2007-171055</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0136" num="0136">Here, the Feu value is an evaluation value of brightness of an illumination space that the person feels when observing the illumination space. The Feu value is defined based on the so called theory of the border luminance of color appearance mode (see Reference 2: <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>New Lighting Evaluation Techniques for Comfortable Lighting Spaces Using Sensation-of-Room-Brightness Index "Feu", Matsushita Technical Journal Vol. 53 No. 2 Jan. 2008</text></nplcit>). In the theory of the border luminance of color appearance mode, change in color appearance mode in the field of visual psychophysics is applied. Here, change in color appearance mode is a phenomenon that as the brightness of a color chart placed in an illumination space increases, an appearance of the color chart by an observer changes from as if the color chart is an object to as if the color chart is a light source emitting light therefrom. In the theory of the border luminance of color appearance mode, an attention is focused on that a luminance of the color chart where change in color appearance mode occurs (so called the border luminance of color appearance mode) differs depending on the brightness of the illumination space. The value of the border luminance of color appearance mode is defined as an index value relatively representing the brightness of the illumination space.</p><p id="p0137" num="0137">The higher the Feu value is, the person who is located in the illumination space feels more bright. The lower the Feu value is, the person who is located in the illumination space feels darker. The larger an area of a bright region in the illumination space is, the higher the Feu value is. The smaller the area of the bright region in the illumination space is, the lower the Feu value is.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> Accordingly, in order to increase the brightness of the illumination space, it is effective to adopt an illumination method for increasing the area of the region where the brightness is ensured in the illumination space.</p><p id="p0138" num="0138">The Feu value is proportional to the border luminance of color appearance mode, as described above. The border luminance of color appearance mode can be estimated based on the mean value of luminance in the visual field.</p><p id="p0139" num="0139">Here, the mean value of luminance in the visual field is equal to the mean value of luminance of regions in an induced visual field (equivalent to a range of visual angle of 100 degree left and right and 85 degree up and down).

(2) Efficiency of visual work performed by the person P who is located in an office or the like decreases due to a troublesome shadow of his own hand on a paper, reflected glare that is caused by reflection of light emitted from the illumination apparatuses 20 on a surface of the paper, and so on.</p><p id="p0150" num="0150"><figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 17A</figref> shows a situation where the person P performs visual work, and <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 17B</figref> shows operations of an illumination system relating to the present modification example.</p><p id="p0151" num="0151">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 17A</figref>, when the person P views a paper placed on a desktop, a range of a visual angle ϕ enters the person P's visual field. In such a situation, it is generally known that light is preferably prevented from entering from a region A1 on the ceiling surface C toward a region A2 included in the person P's visual field on a desktop D. Here, the region A2 is a region located between the following two intersection lines: an intersection line between the ceiling surface C and a surface that includes a position of the person P's eyes and is perpendicular to the desktop D; and an intersection line between the ceiling surface C and a plain surface on the desktop D where the most distant edge in the region A2 included in the person P's visual field forms an angle ϕ with a surface that is perpendicular to the desktop D. The angle ϕ is approximately 40 degrees.</p><p id="p0152" num="0152">In view of this, according to the illumination system relating to the present modification example, a distance Wz between the ceiling surface C and the desktop D is calculated based on image data stored in the camera 11, and a range of the region A1 is specified with use of the calculated distance Wz and the angle ϕ. Then, an illumination apparatus 220 placed in the region A1 on the ceiling surface C is specified among a plurality of illumination apparatuses 220. The illumination apparatus 220 placed in the region A1 is controlled not to turn on the first light source 24.</p><p id="p0153" num="0153">In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 17B</figref>, illumination apparatuses 220a and 220e are placed outside the region A1 on the ceiling surface C, and each include the first light source 24 that is able to irradiate around the person P with light. Accordingly, the illumination apparatuses 220a and 220e are controlled to turn on the respective first light sources 24. On the other hand, illumination apparatuses 220b, 220c, and 220d that are placed in the region A1 on the ceiling surface C are controlled not to turn on the respective first light sources 24.</p><p id="p0154" num="0154">With this structure, it is possible to suppress a troublesome shadow of the person P's hand on a paper, reflected glare that is caused by reflection of light emitted from the illumination<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> apparatuses 220 on a surface of the paper, and so on. This improves the efficiency of visual work performed by the person P who is located in the illumination space.<br/>
(3) According to an illumination apparatus 20 relating to the present modification example, light emitted from the first light source 24 for irradiating a desktop and so on is set to have a color temperature of approximately 5000 K, and light emitted from the second light source 25 for irradiating a ceiling surface C is set to have a color temperature of approximately 3000 K, which is lower than the color temperature of light emitted from the first light source 24.</p><p id="p0155" num="0155">Generally, when a color temperature of an illumination space increases, an environment with ensured functionality is realized where papers are easy to view for example. On the other hand, when the color temperature of the illumination space decreases, an environment that gives warm impression where a person who is located in the illumination space feels comfortable. In consideration of this, the following both are realized by adopting this structure. Specifically, it is possible to ensure the functionality of the illumination space, by setting the color temperature of light emitted from the first light source 24 for irradiating the desktop and so on to approximately 5000 K. Also, it is possible to realize an environment where that gives warm impression where a person who is located in the illumination space feels comfortable, by setting the color temperature of light emitted from the second light source 25 for irradiating the ceiling surface C to approximately 3000 K, which is lower than the color temperature of light emitted from the first light source 24.</p><p id="p0156" num="0156">Therefore, from a standpoint of ensuring functionality of an illumination space and realizing an environment that gives the sense of comfort to a person in the illumination space, the first light source 24 and the second light source 25 preferably have a color temperature in a range of 4200 K to 5000 K and a color temperature in a range of 3000 K to 5000 K, respectively. However, the respective ranges of the color temperatures of the first light source 24 and the second light source 25 are not limited to the above ranges, and may be adjusted appropriately in accordance with the space design and so on. In this case, the color temperature of the first light source 24 may be set to be higher than the color temperature of the second light source 25. Also, it is possible to perform space design that is more optimal for a person who is located in the space, by allowing a user to select and set the respective color temperatures of light emitted from the first light source 24 and the second light source 25 such that the above conditions are satisfied.<br/>

Alternatively, all the illumination apparatuses 20 may turn on the respective second light sources 25.<br/>
(5) As described in Embodiment 1, from a standpoint for ensuring functionality of the illumination space and realizing an environment where a person feels comfortable in the illumination space, it is preferable that the length between the illumination apparatus 20b2 and the edge of the irradiation range of the second light source 25 of the illumination apparatus 20b2 (the edge of the illumination apparatus 20c2 that is adjacent to the illumination apparatus 20b2) (irradiation distance)<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> is substantially equal to the distance Wx between the illumination apparatuses 20b2 and 20c2.</p><p id="p0157" num="0157">Note that, in the present invention, the irradiation distance does not need to be substantially equal to the distance Wx. As long as the irradiation distance is for example equal to or longer than half the distance Wx between the illumination apparatus 20b2 and the illumination apparatus 20c2, it is possible to ensure the functionality of the illumination space and realize an environment where a person feels comfortable in the illumination space.<br/>
(6) In Embodiments 1-3, the description has been given on the example where the first light source 24 and the second light source 25 are each composed of a separate LED lamp. Alternatively, the first light source 24 and the second light source 25 may be implemented in a pseudo manner, so as to have the structure where part of light emitted from one of the light sources is reflected on the ceiling surface C, for example.<br/>
(7) In Embodiments 1-3, the description has been given on the example where the illumination apparatuses 20 and the person position detection unit are placed on the ceiling surface C (first surface), and the respective first light sources 24 of the illumination apparatuses 20 irradiate the floor surface F (second surface) with light. Alternatively, the illumination apparatuses 20 and the person position detection unit may be placed on a first wall surface (first surface) in a room, and the respective first light sources 24 of the illumination apparatuses 20 may irradiate with light the floor surface F (second surface) or a second wall surface (second surface) that is opposed to the first wall surface, for example.<br/>
(8) In the present invention, there is no special limitation on the configuration of the camera sensor module 10. For example, the camera sensor module 10 may have a configuration of detecting radio field intensity transmitted from a wireless transmitter held by a person, and detecting a position of the person based on the detected radio field intensity. Alternatively, the camera sensor module 10 may include a doppler sensor or a pyroelectric sensor.<br/>
(9) In Embodiments 1-3, the description has been given on the example where the camera sensor module 10 includes both the person position detection unit and the control unit. Alternatively, the person position detection unit and the control unit each may be configured by a separate apparatus.<br/>
(10) In Embodiments 1-3, the description has been given on the example where the person position detection unit is composed of a single camera 11 and the image processing unit 12. Alternatively, the person position detection unit may for example include a presence sensor placed on each of a plurality of positions in an illumination space, and calculate a position of a person based on a position where a presence sensor that has detected the person.</p><heading id="h0036">[Reference Signs List]</heading><p id="p0158" num="0158"><ul><li>10 camera sensor module</li><li>11 camera</li><li>12 image processing unit</li><li>13 storage unit<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --></li><li>14 illumination control unit</li><li>15, 21 communication unit</li><li>16 timer</li><li>20, 220 illumination apparatus</li><li>22 lighting control unit</li><li>23 storage unit</li><li>24 first light source</li><li>25 second light source</li></ul></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56976049" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An illumination system comprising:
