This electronic apparatus 1 is formed with a battery device 11, a low-pass filter 12, an operating unit 13, a high-pass filter 14, and a management device 15.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The battery device 11 includes one or more battery cells (such as the battery cell 31-1 shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>) provided therein, and supplies DC voltage/DC current, or DC power, to the operating unit 13 via power lines 17 and 18. The operating unit 13 receives the supply of DC power from the battery device 11 via the low-pass filter 12, and performs various kinds of operations. For example, when the electronic apparatus 1 is regarded as an electric vehicle (EV), the operating unit 13 is equivalent to the motor that rotationally drives the tires. The battery device 11 can be formed as a battery pack, for example.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The low-pass filter 12 is placed on the power lines 17 and 18 between the battery device 11 and the operating unit 13, and can supply DC power to the operating unit 13 that is a block that operates with the DC power. The low-pass filter 12 blocks an AC signal that is generated by the management device 15 and is transmitted via the power lines 17 and 18, to prevent the AC signal from entering the operating unit 13 that operates with DC power and breaking the operating unit 13.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The high-pass filter 14 passes the AC signal generated by the management device 15 to the battery device 11 via the power lines<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 17 and 18. The high-pass filter 14 also blocks the DC power transmitted via the power lines 17 and 18, and prevents the DC power from breaking the management device 15 that operates with AC power.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The management device 15 manages the battery device 11 by communicating the AC signal to the battery device 11 via the power lines 17 and 18. The management device 15 includes the functional blocks of a generating unit 21, a modulating unit 22, a transmitting unit 23, a demodulating unit 24, a determining unit 25, and a processing unit 26.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The generating unit 21 generates a command for an IC chip 53 (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>) of the battery device 11. The modulating unit 22 modulates a carrier wave in accordance with the generated command, and outputs the modulated carrier wave as the AC signal. The carrier wave may be a high-frequency signal (also referred to as a RF signal) having a frequency f of 13.56 MHz, for example. The frequency f of the AC signal is not limited to 13.56 MHz, and any frequency may be used. The transmitting unit 23 outputs the AC signal to the power lines 17 and 18.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The demodulating unit 24 demodulates the reflected wave of the AC signal formed by subjecting the carrier wave to load modulation performed by the IC chip 53 of the battery device 11 based on reply information. The determining unit 25 performs various kinds of determining operations based on the demodulated reply information. The processing unit 26 performs various kinds of processing operations based on determination results.</p><heading id="h0013">&lt;2. First Embodiment&gt;</heading><heading id="h0014">[First Example Structure of a Battery Cell]</heading><p id="p0034" num="0034">Next, an example structure of the battery device 11 is described. As described above, the battery device 11 is formed with one or<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> more battery cells. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> shows a first example structure of a battery cell of the battery device 11.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">This battery cell 31-1 is formed with a battery 51, a DC blocking unit 52, and the IC chip 53.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The battery 51 outputs a positive voltage from a positive terminal 41 to the power line 17, and outputs a negative voltage from a negative terminal 42 to the power line 18. The battery 51 is a secondary battery that can be charged. That is, the power lines 17 and 18 serve as the passages for DC current/DC voltage at the time of charging or discharging.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The DC blocking unit 52 has the function to supply the AC signal supplied from the management device 15 via the power lines 17 and 18, to the IC chip 53. The DC blocking unit 52 also blocks DC power from entering the IC chip 53 through the power line 17. In this manner, the IC chip 53 is prevented from breaking down due to an input of DC power. The DC blocking unit 52 is formed with a capacitor 61 having a capacitance C1. The capacitor 61 is placed between the positive terminal 41 and the positive voltage supply point 83 of the IC chip 53.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The IC chip 53 as a storage element can be formed with an electronic tag, such as an IC chip or a tag compliant with various standards. For example, while an electronic tag compliant with standards such as RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), Mifare, FeliCa, and NFC (Near Field Communication) (all of which are registered trade names) can of course be used, an electronic tag that is not compliant with any of those standards and has a unique structure may also be prepared. The storage element preferably has the function to read and output at least the information stored therein with the AC signal, and further has the function to store<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> supplied information.

The values of the self-inductance L11 and the capacitance C11 are set so that the resonance frequency becomes 13.56 MHz. That is, the resonating unit 71 including the coil 81 functions as an antenna and also has the function to generate an AC inductive voltage through electromagnetic induction when the AC signal having the frequency f of 13.56 MHz is wirelessly communicated.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In this embodiment, however, the AC signal having the frequency f of 13.56 MHz is not wirelessly communicated, but is supplied from the management device 15 via a cable (the power lines 17 and 18).

In this case, the AC signal that is input via the power lines 17 and 18 is input directly to the wave detecting unit 72. Where the resonating unit 71 is not eliminated, the resonating unit 71 resonates with the AC signal having the frequency f of 13.56 MHz when the AC signal is input, and voltages are generated from the voltage supply points 83 and<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> 84.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The wave detect ing unit 72 is formed with a diode 91, for example. In this case, the anode of the diode 91 is connected to the positive voltage supply point 83, and the cathode is connected to one end of a resistor 101 of the load modulating unit 73. The diode 91 rectifies the AC inductive voltage from the positive voltage supply point 83 to a DC inductive voltage, and demodulates the signals contained in the AC signal (a carrier wave) transmitted from a reader/writer 291-11. One end of a FET (Field Effect Transistor) 102 that forms the load modulating unit 73 with the resistor 101 is connected to the other end of the resistor 101. The FET 102 as a switching element may be either a p-channel FET or an n-channel FET. It is also possible to use a bipolar transistor.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The voltage regulator 74 smoothes the voltage rectified by the diode 91, and turns the smoothed voltage into a constant voltage. The constant voltage is then supplied to the power supply unit 75.

The clock generatingunit 77 generates a rectangular clock signal from the AC signal supplied from the voltage supply point 83, and supplies the clock signal to the signal processing unit 78.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The signal processing unit 78 reads the data signal in synchronization with the clock signal.

In a case where the battery device 11 is formed with a large number of batterycells 31-2 connected in a cascade manner, however, the loss leads to a decrease in the AC signal reading sensitivity of the IC chip 53 of each battery cell 31-2, and therefore, some measures should be taken.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">If the transmission power from the management device 15 is increased, the decrease in the AC signal reading sensitivity of<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> the IC chip 53 can be reduced even though there is loss in the AC signal.
