More specifically, the present invention is directed to a method of texturing monocrystalline semiconductor substrates in alkaline baths to reduce incident light reflectance by reducing flat areas between pyramid structures.</p><heading id="h0002">Background of the Invention</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A textured semiconductor surface reduces reflection across wide bands of incident light thereby increasing absorbed light intensity. Such semiconductors may be used in the manufacture of solar cells. Solar cells are devices that convert light energy incident on their surfaces such as sunlight into electric energy. Reducing the reflectance of light incident on the surface improves conversion efficiency into electric energy. Texturing, however, is not restricted to semiconductors in the manufacture of solar cells but also may be used in the manufacture of photovoltaic devices in general, optical and electrochemical detectors/sensors, biodetectors/biosensors, catalysts, electrodes, and other devices where reducing the reflectance of incident light improves the efficiency of the device.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Known techniques for wet chemical pyramidal (tetragonal) structure texturing of (100)-orientated silicon surfaces use alkaline media, such as solutions of alkali hydroxides, alkali carbonates, ammonia or choline. Alkali hydroxides by themselves produce unevenly textured surfaces which result in areas of high reflectivity. An additive is necessary to control the texturing rate and to form repeatable pyramid structures. Solutions of hydrazine or ethylene diamine or pyrocatechol can also be used but they are disadvantageous on account of their toxicity to workers. The most common formulations include water, sodium or potassium hydroxide and alcohol. The alcohol component used is either ethylene glycol or isopropanol.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Another problem associated with the formation of pyramid structures is when too much oxygen is concentrated in the texturing bath prior to and during texturing. The oxygen reacts with hydrogen terminated sites on the silicon causing isotropic etching which results in flat areas between the pyramid structures on the surface of the silicon causing increased incident light<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> reflectance. To address the problem nitrogen sparging is commonly used to reduce the oxygen content of the bath; however, such sparging does not reduce the oxygen to sufficiently low levels and flat areas are typically still observed. Typically nitrogen sparging reduces oxygen content to only around 1,800ppb. Accordingly, there is still a need for a method of reducing oxygen in texturing solutions for monocrystalline silicon semiconductor wafers to improve incident light absorption.</p><heading id="h0003">Summary of the Invention</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In one aspect a method includes providing a monocrystalline semiconductor substrate; providing a solution including one or more alkoxylated glycols comprising a molecular weight of 170 g/mole or greater and a flash point of 75° C or greater, one or more alkaline compounds and one or more oxygen scavengers in sufficient amounts to reduce oxygen concentration in the solution to 1000ppb or less; and contacting the monocrystalline semiconductor substrate with the solution to anisotropically texture the monocrystalline semiconductor substrate.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In another aspect a texturing solution includes one or more alkoxylated glycols having a weight average molecular weight of 170 g/mole or greater and a flash point of 75° C or greater, one or more alkaline compounds, one or more oxygen scavengers in sufficient amounts to provide an oxygen concentration of 1000ppb or less and water.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The method and texturing solution are used to anisotropically texture monocrystalline semiconductors for photovoltaic devices, including semiconductors in the manufacture of solar cells.

The terms "current tracks" and "current lines" are used interchangeably. The terms "solution" and "bath" are used interchangeably. The indefinite articles "a" and "an" are intended to include both the singular and the plural. The term "selectively depositing" means that deposition occurs at specific desired areas on a substrate. The term "flash point" means the lowest temperature at which the vapor of a combustible liquid can be ignited in air. The unit "dynes" is a centimeter-grams-second unit of force.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The following abbreviations have the following meanings unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: °C = degrees Celsius; g = grams; L = liter; bv = by volume; A = amperes; m = meters; dm = decimeter; cm = centimeter; µm = microns; nm = nanometers; min. = minutes; ppm = part per million; ppb = parts per billion; SEM = scanning electron micrograph; UV = ultraviolet; and IR = infrared.

All ranges are inclusive and combinable in any order except where it is logical that such numerical ranges are constrained to add up to 100%.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Solutions for texturing semiconductor substrates include one or more alkoxylated glycols having a weight average molecular weight of 170 g/mole or greater and a flash point of 75° C or greater, and one or more alkaline compounds. Typically, the weight average molecular weight of the alkoxylated glycols range from 170 g/mole to 4000 g/mole, more typically from 190 g/mole to 500 g/mole. Flash points typically range from 75° C to 300° C or such as from 100° C to 300° C. More typically, flash points range from 140° C to 200° C. Alkoxylated glycols used in the texturing solutions are either water-soluble or at least water-miscible. The solutions provide uniform texturing as well as reproducibility of pyramid structure formation on semiconductors. This results in reduced incident light reflectance and improved conversion efficiency of incident light into electric energy. The flash points of 75°C or greater provide nonvolatile texturing solutions preventing substantial evaporation of solution components. In addition, the alkoxylated glycols have boiling points of 190° C or greater which further reduces the amount lost at operating temperatures. Accordingly, the texturing solutions may be used over longer periods of time than many conventional texturing solutions. This reduces downtime for manufacturing processes and reduces the frequency of solution replacement, thus improving<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the overall efficiency of the texturing method. This improved efficiency of the method reduces costs to both consumers and manufactures alike.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Alkoxylated glycols are included in the solution in amounts of 0.001wt% to 2wt% of the solution.

Most preferably the oxygen content is from 200ppb to 0ppb. While not being bound by theory, it is believed that the reduced oxygen content inhibits or prevents formation of flat areas between pyramid structures on the surface of a monocrystalline semiconductor by inhibiting isotropic etching. The flat area increases incident light reflectance and reduces the efficiency of the monocrystalline semiconductor.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Oxygen scavengers include, but are not limited to, hydroxyl amine compounds having a formula:

Such preferred solvents include, but are not limited to, neopentyl glycol, glycerol, butyl carbitol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, n-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), 1,4-butanediol, 2-pyrrolidone, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, 4-(2-aminoethyl)morpho line and 1-(2-aminoethyl)piperidine.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The texturing solutions may be applied to a surface of a monocrystalline semiconductor substrate by any suitable method known in the art. The texturing solutions are applied to a surface of the semiconductor substrate at temperatures of 70° C or higher, typically from 80° C to 200° C, or such as from 90° C to 150° C. Typically, the aqueous texturing solutions are applied to a surface of the monocrystalline semiconductor substrate by horizontal or vertical processes. Such methods are well known in the art. Briefly, horizontal methods involve passing the semiconductor substrate on a conveyor system and spraying the solution on the surface of the substrate. In the vertical process the substrate is dipped in the texturing solution. Various conventional apparatus used for such processes are well known in the art.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The texturing solution is applied to a surface of the monocrystalline semiconductor substrate for dwell times of 10 min. to 30 min. The semiconductor substrate is then rinsed with water. The texturing method is anisotropic and forms uniform and repeatable pyramid (tetragonal) structures over the entire treated surface of the semiconductor substrate. The pyramid structures are randomly dispersed over the entire treated surface. The pyramid structures may range in height from 1µm to 10µm.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The monocrystalline semiconductors textured with the solution reduce reflectance from incident light applied to their textured surfaces. Reflectance of incident light in the 360nm to 1000nm wavelength range is less than 11.5%. Typically reflectance of incident light is from 10% to 11.5%. Reflectance may be measured using conventional reflectometers well known in the art. Accordingly, monocrystalline semiconductors textured by the method using the solutions are suitable for use in devices which convert incident light, such as light from sunlight, lasers, fluorescent light, as well as other sources of light, into electric energy. Such devices include, but are not limited to photovoltaic devices, such as solar cells, optical and electrochemical<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> detectors/sensors, biodetectors/biosensors, catalysts, electrodes, gate electrodes, ohmic contacts, interconnection lines, Schottky barrier diode contacts and optoelectronic components.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Although the texturing method may be used to texture monocrystalline semiconductor substrates for various devices, typically, the texturing method is used in the manufacture of photovoltaic devices, such as solar cells. Typically the semiconductor substrate is in the form of a wafer. Such substrates typically have a p-type base doping. However, texturing may be done on semiconductor wafers prior to any doping or other processing steps. In general, texturing may be done at any convenient time during the manufacture of the photovoltaic device. Typically, the semiconductor substrate is textured before the doping process is complete.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The entire back side of the wafer may be metal coated or a portion of the back side may be metal coated, such as to form a grid. Such back side metallization may be provided by a variety of techniques, and may be done prior to the metallization of the front side of the wafer. In one embodiment, a metal coating is applied to the back side in the form of an electrically conductive paste, such as a silver-containing paste, an aluminum-containing paste or a silver and aluminum-containing paste; however, other suitable pastes known in the art also may be used. Such conductive pastes typically include conductive particles embedded in a glass matrix and an organic binder. Conductive pastes may be applied to the wafer by a variety of techniques, such as screen printing. After the paste is applied, it is fired to remove the organic binder. When a conductive paste containing aluminum is used, the aluminum partially diffuses into the back side of the wafer, or if used in a paste also containing silver, may alloy with the silver. Use of such aluminum-containing paste may improve the resistive contact and provide a "p+"-doped region. Heavily doped "p+"-type regions by previous application of aluminum or boron with subsequent interdiffusion may also be produced. Optionally, a seed layer may be deposited on the back side of the wafer and a metal coating may be deposited on the seed layer by electroless or electrolytic plating.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">To produce the semiconductor junction, phosphorus diffusion or ion implantation takes place on the front side of the wafer to produce an n-doped (n+ or n++) region and provides the wafer with a PN junction. The n-doped region may be referred to as the emitter layer.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The front side or emitter layer of the wafer is subjected to anisotropic texturing in order to impart to the surface an improved light incidence geometry which reduces reflections. The<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> solution including one or more alkoxylated glycols having a weight average molecular weight of 170 g/mole and a flash point of 75° C or greater, one or more alkaline compounds and one or more oxygen scavengers in amounts sufficient to maintain an oxygen concentration of 1000ppb or less is applied to the emitter layer for 10 min. to 30 min., typically from 10 min. to 15 min. to form uniform and randomly dispersed pyramid structures on the emitter layer. The emitter layer is substantially free of flat areas which increase incident light reflectance. The texturing solutions have surface tensions of 72 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> or less, preferably 40 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> or less. More preferably the surface tension is 20-40 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>. The temperature of the solution ranges from 80° C to 110° C. After a dwell time of 10 min. to 30 min., the wafer is rinsed with water to remove the texturing solution.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">An anti-reflective layer is added to the front side or emitter layer of the wafer. In addition the anti-reflective layer may serve as a passivation layer. Suitable anti-reflective layers include, without limitation, silicon oxide layers such as SiO<sub>x</sub>, silicon nitride layers such as Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, a combination of silicon oxide and silicon nitride layers, and combinations of a silicon oxide layer, a silicon nitride layer with a titanium oxide layer such as TiO<sub>x</sub>. In the foregoing formulae, x is an integer representing the number of oxygen atoms. Such anti-reflective layers may be deposited by a number of techniques, such as by various vapor deposition methods, for example, chemical vapor deposition and physical vapor deposition.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The front side of a wafer contains a metallized pattern. For example, the front side of a wafer may be composed of current collecting lines and current busbars. Current collecting lines are typically transverse to the busbars and typically have a relatively fine-structure (i.e. dimensions) relative to current busbars.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The pattern reaches through the antireflective layer to expose the surface of the semiconductor body of the wafer. Alternatively trenches may be formed in the openings to create a selective emitter. These trenches may be regions of high doping. A variety of processes may be used to form the pattern, such as, but not limited to, laser ablation, mechanical means, and lithographic processes, all of which are well known in the art. Such mechanical means include sawing and scratching. Typical photolithographic processes include disposing an imageable material on the surface of the wafer, patterning the imageable material to form openings in the anti-reflective layer, transferring the pattern to the wafer, depositing a nickel<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> layer in the openings and removing the imageable material. In one embodiment, the imageable material is removed before the step of depositing a metal layer in the openings. In another embodiment, the imageable material is removed after the step of depositing a metal layer in the openings. When the imageable material is present during the metal deposition step, such imageable material typically avoids any dyes, such as contrast dyes, that absorb in the wavelength of radiation used during the nickel deposition step. Imageable material present during the plating step typically contains a dye which has a minimum light transmittance of 40-60%.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The imageable material may be removed using any suitable polymer remover. Such removers may be alkaline, acidic or essentially neutral and are well known in the art.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In one embodiment, the front side of the wafer may be metallized using a conductive paste, which may be the same as or different from any conductive paste used on the rear side of the wafer. Any conductive paste used to metallize the front side of a wafer typically does not contain aluminum. The temperature used in the firing of the paste depends on the particular paste used, the thickness of any antireflective layer used, among other factors. The choice of such temperature is well within the ability of those skilled in the art. Also, it is appreciated by those skilled in the art that the firing process may be performed in an oxygen-containing atmosphere, an inert atmosphere, a reducing atmosphere, or a combination of any of these. For example, the firing may be performed at a first temperature in an atmosphere containing little oxygen and then at a second temperature under an inert atmosphere or under a reducing atmosphere, where the second temperature is higher than the first temperature.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Following the firing process, the wafer may optionally be contacted with a buffered acid solution, such as a buffered hydrofluoric acid solution, to remove any oxide produced during the firing procedure. Such contact may be by spraying the solution on the wafer or by dipping the wafer into such solution or by any other suitable means.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">After the front side pattern and rear side of the wafer are metallized using conductive paste, a layer of metal is then deposited on the front side conductive pattern. Such layer of metal may be any suitably conductive metal such as gold, silver or copper, and is typically silver. Such metals may be deposited by methods known in the art. In one embodiment, the deposited metal layer is composed of the same metal used in the conductive paste. For example, a silver layer is<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> deposited on a silver-containing conductive paste.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Silver may be deposited by light induced plating (LIP) or conventional silver electroplating methods well known in the art. When LIP is used, the rear side of the semiconductor wafer is connected to a source of external current (rectifier). A silver anode placed in the silver plating composition is connected to the rectifier such that a completed circuit is formed between the components. Typical current densities are from 0.1 A/dm<sup>2</sup> to 5 A/dm<sup>2</sup>. The total current requirement is dependent upon the particular size of the wafer used. Additionally, the silver anode provides a ready source of silver ions to replenish the silver plating composition with silver ions without the need to use an external source. A light source is positioned to illuminate the semiconductor wafer with light energy. The light source can be, for example, a fluorescent or LED lamp which provides energy within the wavelengths to which the semiconductor wafer is photovoltaically sensitive. A variety of other light sources may be used, such as, but not limited to, incandescent lamps such as a 75 watt and 250 watt lamps, mercury lamps, halogen lamps and a 150 watt IR lamp. Examples of commercially useful silver plating compositions are available as ENLIGHT™ Silver Plate 600 and 620 from Rohm and Haas Electronic Materials, LLC Marlborough, Massachusetts.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The plating cell is of such a material as to be chemically inert with respect to the silver plating composition and has a minimum light transmittance of 40-60%. Alternatively, the wafer can be positioned horizontally in the plating cell and illuminated from above the silver plating composition, in which case the plating cell need not have at least the minimum light transmittance.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In another embodiment a metal seed layer may be deposited on the front side conductive pattern instead of a metal paste. Typically the metal seed layer is nickel. The nickel seed layer may be deposited by any conventional nickel deposition method known in the art. Typically, the nickel seed layer is deposited by light assisted nickel deposition. If the source of the nickel is an electroless nickel composition, plating is done without application of external current. If the source of the nickel is from an electrolytic nickel composition, a rear side potential (rectifier) is applied to the semiconductor wafer substrate. The light may be continuous or pulsed. Prior to depositing nickel, surface oxides are typically removed from the conductive pattern using a solution of 1% hydrofluoric acid.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Light which may be used in the plating process includes, but is not limited to, visible light, IR, UV and X-rays. Light sources include, but are not limited to, incandescent lamps, LED lights (light emitting diodes), infrared lamps, fluorescent lamps, halogen lamps and lasers. In general the amount of light applied to the semiconductor may be 8000 lx to 20,000 lx.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Typically, nickel is deposited through the openings in the anti-reflective layer and onto the exposed textured surface of the semiconductor wafer using an electroless nickel plating composition. Examples of commercially available electroless nickel compositions include DURAPOSIT™ SMT 88 Electroless Nickel and NIPOSIT™ PM 980 and PM 988 Electroless Nickel. All are available from Rohm and Haas Electronic Materials, LLC, Marlborough, MA, U.S.A.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Alternatively, electrolytic nickel compositions may be used. When an electrolytic composition is used, an applied rear side potential (rectifier) is used in addition to light to deposit the nickel. Typical current densities are from 0.1 A/dm<sup>2</sup> to 2 A/dm<sup>2</sup>. The particular current requirement is dependent upon the particular size of the wafer used. The electroplating processes used are conventional. Suitable electrolytic nickel plating baths are commercially available as well as many which are disclosed in the literature. Examples of commercially available electrolytic nickel baths are the NICKEL GLEAM™ Electrolytic Nickel products obtainable from Rohm and Haas Electronic Materials, LLC.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">By illuminating the front of the semiconductor wafer with light energy, plating occurs on the front. The impinging light energy generates a current in the semiconductor. The rate of plating on the front is controllable by adjusting the light intensity, bath temperature, reducing agent activity, starting wafer conditions, doping level as well as other parameters which are known to workers in the art. If the plating bath is an electrolytic bath the rate of plating may also be adjusted by the rectifier. A nickel layer of 20nm to 300nm thickness is typically desired, with the exact thickness depending on various factors such as on the application, size, pattern and geometry.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">After the nickel is deposited through the openings and adjacent to the exposed surface of the semiconductor wafer substrate, silver is then deposited adjacent to the nickel. Conventional electroplating silver compositions may be used. The silver compositions may be cyanide containing silver compositions or cyanide-free silver compositions.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Silver may deposited on the nickel by light induced plating (LIP) or conventional silver electroplating methods well known in the art. The procedure of LIP plating is similar to that for plating the silver paste described above. A silver layer of 1µm to 30µm thickness is typically desired, with the exact thickness depending on various factors such as on the application, size, pattern and geometry.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">After the silver metal is deposited onto and adjacent the nickel, the semiconductor is then sintered to form nickel silicide. Sintering is done with the silver deposited onto the nickel surface to improve adhesion between the silver and nickel. The improved bonding between the nickel and the silicon reduces the probability of adhesion failure between the nickel silicide and the silver. Further, silver is not incorporated into the silicide by the sintering temperatures, thus nickel silicide is formed with the silver protecting the nickel from oxidation during sintering. A furnace providing a wafer peak temperature of 380° C to 550° C may be used. Typically, peak temperature times range from 2 seconds to 20 seconds. An example of a suitable furnace is a lamp based furnace (IR).</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Since the silver layer protects the nickel from oxidation during sintering, sintering may be done in oxygen containing environments as well as inert gas atmosphere or vacuum. In general, sintering is done for 3 min. to 10 min. Line speeds at which the semiconductor passes through the furnace may vary depending on the furnace used. Minor experimentation may be done to determine the appropriate line speed. Typically, the line speed is from 330 cm/minute to 430 cm/minute.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The method and texturing solution are used to anisotropically texture monocrystalline semiconductors for photovoltaic devices, including semiconductors in the manufacture of solar cells. The addition of oxygen scavengers in amounts to reduce the oxygen content of the solution to 1000ppb or less inhibits or reduces formation of flat areas between pyramid structures on the textured monocrystalline semiconductors to increase incident light absorption and improve the efficiency of converting incident light into electrical energy.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The following examples are included to illustrate the invention but are not intended to limit its scope.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><heading id="h0006">Example 1</heading><p id="p0051" num="0051">Three doped monocrystalline silicon wafers (obtained from SolarGiga) having n+ doped zones on the front side or emitter layer and a pn-junctions below the emitter layer were immersed in an aqueous texturing solution in an 18 liter falcon line which is a large scale texturing bath.
