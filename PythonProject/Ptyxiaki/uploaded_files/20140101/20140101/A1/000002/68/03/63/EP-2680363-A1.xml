When incorporating a bias tee into a circuit or system, a designer must pay particular attention to a number of certain properties, such as RF bandwidth, insertion loss, mismatch at the two RF ports, and the maximum DC current, for example.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref> illustrates a first example 100 of a current system implementing a typical bias tee. The system in this example 100 includes an RF/DC port 106, an RF port 102, a DC port 130, a first tee 110, and a second tee 124. Either or both of the first and second tees 110 and 124, repectively, may be a discrete component or simply a point at which multiple lines or wires connect.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the example 100, the bias tee is implemented by way of a first capacitor 104 situated between the tee 110 and RF port 102, an inductor 122 situated between the first tee 110 and the second tee 124, and a second capacitor 132 coupled with the DC port 130. An RF signal incident to the RF/DC port 106 is delivered to the RF port 102, while a DC signal is injected at the DC port 130.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2</figref> illustrates a second example 200 of a current system implementing a typical bias tee. The system in this example 200 implements a bias tee by way of a capacitive feedthru pin 218 passing through a layer 202, e.g., a substrate, a first wire 214 electrically coupling the capactive feedthru pin 218 to a capacitor 213 on the layer 202, and a second wire 212 electrically coupling the capacitor 213 to an RF microstrip 204 on the layer 202. A bias tee such as the one implemented in this example 200 is typically large, often requiring at least 3/8" of space on the layer 202. Also, the capacitive feedthru pin 218 is typically at least ¼" in diameter.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Bias tees are often used to place a DC or other low frequency signal on a RF/microwave signal without otherwise disturbing the microwave signal. This has usually accomplished by way of a coil of wire or, for higher frequencies, a very long bond wire. However, coils are plagued with parasitics that limit performance.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Bond wires tend to be long, thus requiring special cavities to contain them. In current systems and devices, bond wires cannot be folded to reduce space. Current systems generally require extremely long bond wires and special cavities to contain them. These bond wires are attached to metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors, which typically requires epoxy to secure them thereto, as well as additional bond wires.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly, a need remains for bias tees that have a reduced size without reducing or otherwise limiting performance.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>Summary</u></b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">Embodiments of the disclosed technology generally allow for an inductance to be folded, thus reducing the space required therefor. Since part of the inductance is thus placed on the substrate metalization, the consistancy of the resulting product is improved. Also, effective wide bandwidth capacitors may be built into different layers of the substrate to reduce the number of assembly components.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A bias tee in accordance with the disclosed technology generally requires only one bond wire, and the capacitor and additional filtering may be incorporated into the substrate. The net result is thus a smaller bias tee having associated therewith a more efficient assembly process.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Brief Description of the Drawings</u></b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref> illustrates a first example of a current circuit or system implementing a typical bias tee.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2</figref> illustrates a second example of a current circuit or system implementing a typical bias tee.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIGURE 3</figref> is a functional diagram illustrating an example of a circuit or system implementing a bias tee in accordance with certain embodiments of the disclosed technology.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIGURE 4</figref> illustrates a first view of an example of a circuit or system implementing a bias tee in accordance with certain embodiments of the disclosed technology.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIGURE 5</figref> illustrates a second view of the example circuit or system illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGURE 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIGURE 6</figref> illustrates a third view of the example circuit or system illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGURES 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIGURE 7</figref> illustrates an example graph indicating that embodiments of the disclosed technology may provide excellent in-band match as well as low loss and high isolation.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>Detailed Description</u></b></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">Embodiments of the disclosed technology generally include reduced size bias tees, such as would be suitable to be implemented in any of a number of different circuits and systems.

The system 300 includes a first RF port ("RF OUT") 302, a second RF port ("RF IN") 306, and a DC port 330. A first line 304 electrically couples the first RF port 302 with a first tee 310, and a second line 308 electrically couples the second RF port 306 with the first tee 310.

The first tee 310 is electrically coupled with the first catch pad 316 by way of a first wire 312, a second wire 314, and a connection point 313 therebetween. Either or both of the first and second wires 312 and 314, respectively, may be implemented as a wire bond. Alternatively or in addition thereto, either or both of the wires 312 and 314 may be at least substantially co-planar with or otherwise integrated on or with a surface of the underlying substrate, e.g., layer, at or on which the first catch pad 316 is situated.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The connecting pin 318 may be implemented as any suitable component or mechanism for electrically coupling the first catch pad 316 to the second catch pad 320, which may be situated on or at a surface of the substrate opposite that associated with the first catch pad 316. The connecting pin 318 typically is a via in the layer or substrate.

A connecting pin 418 serves to electrically couple the first catch 416 with a second catch pad, described below with regard to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIGURE 6</figref>.
