The core of the integration of the three types of networks is users, which get information and service through three types of screens, i.e., the television screen, the computer screen and the mobile phone screen. The integration of the three types of screens intends to take full advantage of existing platforms and resources, and take users as the core so as to achieve good transmission of video information and complementary services between three types of screens, so that users may obtain information more conveniently and enjoy better experience. The core value of the technical architecture for the integration of the three types of screens is to provide a new experience for users through integration of backend resources and complementary advantages of front ends and terminals.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The status of the animation industry in global economy, which is represented by manga, cartoon, animation, game and multi-media content products and the like, is improved quickly, and it becomes a pillar industry after the software industry. In the background of the integration of three types of screens, users may choose various screens at various times according to various hardware and their requirements, so as to proactively experience multi-media contents in the future.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">When a user is reading an image gallery such as a manga, which may be classed into<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> single-frame manga, four-frame manga and multi-frame manga, the user may read the manga through various screens (e.g., the screen of mobile phone, the screen of computer and the screen of the television). For example, a user may read a manga using his/her smart mobile phone on the way to work; when the user goes home, he/she may read the manga from where he/she left off last time on anther device (e.g., a television or a computer) through a bookmark. However, since different devices have different requirements for an image, the same manga will have different display effects on different terminals. For example, a manga may be correctly displayed on a smart mobile phone, but cannot be clearly displayed on a computer. Therefore, users cannot read a manga on various terminals continuously.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a method for providing reading service, a content provision server and system, so that a user may continuously read an image gallery with same contents on various terminals.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide technical solutions as follows.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In one aspect, there is provided a method for providing reading service, which is applied to a content provision server, the method comprises:
