These cable systems are typically used to broadcast high-definition live television, especially for sporting events such as golf tournaments. With the amount of environmental contamination that can occur at these events, damage to the electrical and optical contacts is a serious problem.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">With traditional cable systems, when the camera connector is damaged, the entire assembly, including the cable and connector, must be sent back to the manufacturer for repair. More recently, fusion splicing machines have been developed to allow for on-site replacement of damaged connectors, but these machines are very expensive.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Therefore, a system is needed that allows for immediate on-site replacement of damaged connectors without the need for expensive equipment.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Additionally, current fiber optic cables consist of internal wiring, as well as additional components that provide structural support for the cable. These cables can be expensive and are often heavy, which reduces their mobility in the field. Therefore, a reduced-cost cable, that also reduces overall weight, would be advantageous.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Summary of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Accordingly, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention teaches an adapter that comprises an outer housing, an inner shell, a contact insert, and at least one of an optical contact and an electrical contact.

The connector adapter 200 may be mated, at one end, with a connector 216, such as an industry-standard camera connector typically known as the LEMO® connector, which is usually part of a cable assembly that connects to the camera itself The cable adapter 300 is preferably used to terminate a cable, such as a fiber optic cable, to a camera connector, that is associated with the camera. Although the adapter assembly 100 is preferably used with an HD camera and its associated fiber optic cable, it will be recognized that the adapter assembly 100 may have other applications, including, for example, use in the telecommunications industry or digital signage.

The outer housing 204 has first and second opposing ends 202 and 214 for receiving the cable adapter 300 and a mating connector 216, respectively. The mating connector 216 may be a standard LEMO® connector, for example, as is used predominantly in the high-definition television industry. The first end 202 has a coupling member 218, which can be exterior threading. The second end 214 can have a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> corresponding coupling member 220, which may be interior threading, that allows it to be mated with the camera connector 216.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The inner shell 206 is received in the outer housing 204, and has first and second opposing ends 222 and 224, respectively.

The contacts 310 and 312 correspond to the contacts 210 and 212 of the connector adapter 200. The contact insert 308 defines a plug interface 340 which engages the optical and electrical contacts 210 and 212 of the connector adapter 200.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the connector adapter 200 and cable adapter 300 mate together to form the adapter assembly 100. When mated, the exterior threading 218 on the outer<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> housing 204 of the connector adapter 200 engages the interior threading 318 on the outer housing 304 of the cable adapter 300 to mate the adapters together. The outer housings 204 and 304 are floating, such that electrical contacts 212 and 312 and the optical contacts 210 and 310 can mate with each other, while the outer housings 204 and 304 are rotated so as to engage the exterior and interior threading 218 and 318. The socket and plug interfaces 240 and 340 of the contact inserts 208 and 308 abut when the electrical contacts 212 and 312 and optical contacts 210 and 310 are fully mated. Specifically, the electrical contacts 312 of the cable adapter 300 are inserted into the electrical contacts 212 of the connector adapter 200. The optical contact 210 of the connector adapter 200 touches and makes contact with the optical contact 310 of the cable adapter. The keying features of the adapters 200 and 300 facilitate proper alignment and mating of the adapters 200 and 300. In particular, the tab 334 of the cable adapter 300 is received in the notch 234 of the connector adapter 200.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As seen in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 4</figref>, the fiber optic cable 400, which terminates at the second end 314 of the outer housing 304 ofthe cable adapter 300, is made of a protective jacket 402 which houses all of the internal components. Within the protective jacket 402 is a plurality of power conductor cables 404, two optical fibers 406, and a plurality of auxiliary conductor cables 408. In traditional fiber optic cables, a steel strength member runs through the length of the cable for support. Second, a braid, which is also incorporated to provide added support, covers the internal wiring of the cable and is placed directly under the jacket 402. In the present invention, the steel strength member and braid have been removed, without jeopardizing the structural integrity of the cable.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">While particular embodiments have been chosen to illustrate the invention, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the scope ofthe invention as defmed in the appended claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977042" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An adapter, comprising:
