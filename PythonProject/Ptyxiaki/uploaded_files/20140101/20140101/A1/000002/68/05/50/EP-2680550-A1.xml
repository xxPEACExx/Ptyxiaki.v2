The invention still further relates to a wireless kit configured to enable wireless communication between a telecommunication device and a hands-free communication device.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Headsets, and especially headsets with built-in microphones and speakerphones for communication purposes have become quite common as they allow for hands free use of the telecommunication device, and is thus typically employed for office use, for use while moving, such as when driving, walking, etc. and the headsets may thus connect to mobile phones, telephone devices, such as desk phones, soft phones, IP phones, etc, or to any number of these telecommunication devices.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Such headsets are configured to be connected with the telecommunication device either wirelessly, or via a wire either to a port of the mobile telephone, a port of a computer, a handset port or a specifically provided headset port of the telephone device. However, the mobile phone typically use a built in Bluetooth connection to connect to the headset, the computer may use another Bluetooth connection to connect to the headset, and for a telephone device, the set up of the headset is specific to the specific telephone device, manufacturer, telephone type, make, etc.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Both wireless and wired headsets are commonly used, and while wireless headsets are convenient in use, as a user is able to move around and or move the speakerphone without being limited by the length of a cord and the risk of cord entanglement, they also have their disadvantages as the wireless devices require recharging and sometimes suffer from poor audio quality.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The opposite is the case with corded headsets and speakerphones. They are always ready for use as they do not need recharging and the audio quality is not influenced by a wireless connection. However, the cord limits the movement of the device and if the cord is long, the cord gets easily entangled with furniture etc.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to provide a combination of a corded and a wireless device.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In one aspect of the present invention, a hands-free communication system, such as a headset system and/or a speakerphone system, is provided, the system being configured for audio communication between a hands-free communication device and a telecommunication device using a wireless or a corded connection. The hands-free communication system may comprise a hands-free communication device having a speaker, and a first cable having a hands-free connector part in one end and being connected to the hands-free communication device in another end. Furthermore, a telecommunication device connector part may be configured to connect to a telecommunication device. A line of communication may be provided between the telecommunication device connector part and the hands-free connector part. The communication line may comprise a first transceiver and a second transceiver being configured to establish a wireless connection there between upon activation. The communication line may further comprise a releasable connection positioned between the first transceiver and the second transceiver configured to establish a corded connection, such as an<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> audio corded connection and/or an electrical corded connection, between the hands-free communication device and the telecommunication device when the releasable connection is connected. The first transceiver may be provided in the first connector part or the first transceiver may be provided along the communication line between the first connector part and the releasable connection. The second transceiver may be provided in the telecommunication device connector part or along the communication line between the telecommunication device connector part and the releasable connection. Hereby, a wireless connection between the first transceiver and the second transceiver may be enabled upon activation of the first transceiver and the second transceiver, respectively.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In a further aspect of the present invention, a wireless kit configured to enable optional corded and wireless communication between a telecommunication device and a hands-free communication device, is provided. The hands-free communication device, which do not necessarily form part of the kit, may have a first cable having a hands-free connector part in one end and being connected to the hands-free communication device in another end. The wireless kit may comprise a telecommunication device connector part configured to connect to a telecommunication device. A communication line may be provided between the telecommunication device connector part and the hands-free connector part. The communication line may comprise a first transceiver and a second transceiver being configured to establish a wireless connection there between upon activation. A releasable connection may be positioned between the first transceiver and the second transceiver for establishing a corded connection, such as an audio corded connection and/or an electrical corded connection, between the hands-free communication device and the telecommunication device when connected. The first transceiver may be provided in the first connector part or the first transceiver may be provided between the first connector part and the releasable connection. The second transceiver may be provided in the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> telecommunication device connector part or the second transceiver may be provided between the telecommunication device connector part and the releasable connection.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In a still further aspect of the present invention a wireless kit configured to enable wireless communication between a telecommunication device and a hands-free communication device is provided, the hands-free communication device may have a first cable having a hands-free connector part in one end and may be connected to the hands-free communication device in another end. The telecommunication device may have a telecommunication device connector part configured to connect to a telecommunication device. The wireless kit may comprise a first transceiver configured to connect to the hands-free connector part, and a second transceiver configured to connect to the telecommunication device connector part. A releasable connection may be positioned between the first transceiver and the second transceiver. The first transceiver and the second transceiver may be configured to establish a wireless connection there between upon activation.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Hereby, a wireless connection between the first transceiver and the second transceiver may be enabled upon activation of the first transceiver and the second transceiver, respectively.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In another aspect of the present invention, a method of enabling wireless communication between a telecommunication device and a hands-free communication device is provided, wherein the hands-free telecommunication device is connected to a first transceiver, and the telecommunication device is connected to a second transceiver. The first transceiver and the second transceiver may be connected by a releasable connection, and the first transceiver and the second transceiver may be activated upon disengagement of the releasable connection.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">It is an advantage of the present invention that a user may switch between a corded and a wireless use of a hands-free communication device, easily and swiftly without interruptions in the communication and/or without having to connect another hands-free communication device, such as to another headset, or another speakerphone. Thereby, a user may have the convenience of a wired headset when being seated at a desk working and communicating using the wired headset, and the flexibility of disengaging the corded connection when the circumstances so require, and e.g. move to a quiet office or retrieve documents required e.g. during a telephone call. It is a further advantage that the telecommunication device sees the same hands-free communication device, i.e. the same headset or speakerphone, whether these are connected to the telecommunication device via a corded or a wireless connection.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The first and second transceivers may be any conventional transceivers capable of providing a wireless link there between, the wireless link being capable of transferring data, such as communication data, such as audio and/or voice communication data between the two transceivers. The wireless link may be any link, such as a radio link, such as a link according to any wireless standard such as a Bluetooth standard, a wireless standard, such as a standard according to 802.11 b-g, such as a wireless USB, such as a PHS link or DECT link specifically configured for voice communication, etc.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">It is a further advantage of the present invention that the first transceiver and the second transceiver may be tailored to establish a wireless connection there between. Thus, the wireless connection may be established without relying on third party software, configurations, such as telecommunication device configurations, protocols, such as telecommunication device protocols, etc. A wireless communication being both more stable and of a better quality may be obtained by providing a dedicated set of transceivers for wireless communication.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The hands-free communication device may be a headset or a speakerphone, etc. The headset may have one or two speakers, and may furthermore comprise a microphone. Still further, the headset may have speakerphone functionality. It is envisaged, that even though the following description uses a headset as the example, also a speakerphone may be used. The speakerphone may comprise one or more loudspeakers and/or one or more microphones.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The first cable may be permanently connected to the hands-free communication device. Alternatively, the first cable may be releasably connected to the hands-free communication device, so as to e.g. allow for post-mounting of a wireless kit. It is however an advantage of providing a releasable connection away from the hands-free communication device itself, such as away from the headset, as the headset is a delicate structure and it may be inconvenient and give rise to noise signals in the communication when releasing or attaching a connector directly to the headset. Furthermore, when a change from corded operation to wireless operation, or vice versa, is desired, the headset is typically positioned at a user's ear(s) making it inconvenient for a user to attach or release a connection close to the ear, without being able to actually see the connectors. It is envisaged that the term cable is to be interpreted broadly to mean any means, such as cable, wire, line, etc., capable of providing a connection, electrical and/or audio, between the hands-free communication device and a hands-free connector part.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In one or more embodiments, the first cable is thus connected to the hands-free communication device in one end and has a hands-free connector part in the other end.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The first transceiver may be an external headset transceiver, that is a transceiver for receiving communication signals intended for the headset<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> and/or transmitting communication signals generated at the headset intended for e.g. a telecommunication device, but being positioned outside of any headset housing. The external headset transceiver may be configured to connect to the headset using a corded connection, such as a cable, such as the first cable.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The second transceiver may be an external telecommunication device transceiver, that is a transceiver for receiving communication signals intended for the telecommunication device and/or transmitting communication signals generated at the telecommunication device to e.g. a hands-free communication device, such as a headset or a speakerphone. The second transceiver may be configured to connect to the telecommunication device via a telecommunication device connector part, and the second transceiver and the telecommunication device connector part may be connected in any known manner, either directly via the connector, via an adapter and/or via a corded connection to provide a connection between the second transceiver and the telecommunication device connector part. The telecommunication device connector part may be a USB type connector part, a micro USB type connector part, a connector part for a telephone device handset or headset port, to a connector part for a mobile telephone, etc.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The first transceiver and the second transceiver may be provided along a line of communication between the telecommunication device connector part and the hands-free connector part. The communication line may, thus, comprise the first transceiver and the second transceiver. The first transceiver and the second transceiver may be configured to establish a wireless connection there between, typically, the wireless connection will be activated upon activation of the first transceiver and the second transceiver.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The communication line may further comprise a releasable connection positioned between the first transceiver and the second transceiver for establishing a corded connection, such as an audio corded connection and/or an electrical corded connection, between the hands-free communication device and the telecommunication device when the releasable connection is connected.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In one or more embodiments, the hands-free communication system, such as the headset system, the speakerphone system and/or the wireless kit may comprise a first connector part being interconnected with the first transceiver and a second connector part being interconnected with the second transceiver wherein the first connector part and the second connector part form a releasable connection there between.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The first connector part, the second connector part and/or the hands-free connector part may be any connector parts configured for releasable connection. The connector parts may be configured for locking by snapping, twisting, push/pull actions, etc., or any combination thereof. For example, at least one of connector parts, such as at least one of the hands-free connector part, the first connector part, the second connector part and/or a further connector part is a hermaphroditic connector part.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In one or more embodiments of the present invention, the first transceiver and the second transceiver may be provided anywhere along the communication line while still be interconnected by the first and second connector parts. For example, the first connector part may comprise the first transceiver, and/or the second connector part may comprise the second transceiver. In a further example, the telecommunication device connector part may comprise the second transceiver and/or the second connector part. In a still further example, the hands-free connector part may comprise the first transceiver and/or the first connector part.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The first transceiver and the second transceiver may be configured to enable communication between the headset and the telecommunication device. In one or more embodiments, the wireless connection, such as a wireless link, may be established upon activation of the first transceiver and the second transceiver. The hands-free communication system, such as the headset system or speakerphone system, or the wireless kit may thus further comprise an activation mechanism so that the first transceiver and the second transceiver may be activated or switched on when a user desires to establish a wireless connection.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The first transceiver and the second transceiver may for example be activated upon disengagement of the releasable connection. The activation mechanism may, thus, for example be provided in the first and/or second connector part and may be activated by disengaging the releasable connection. Hereby, a wireless link is established directly after disengagement.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The corded connection between the first connector part and the second connector part may furthermore transfer power from e.g. the telecommunication device to the first and/or second transceivers, and possibly to further electronic circuits in the hands-free communication device. The first transceiver and the second transceiver may thus further be provided with a rechargeable battery which may enable the functioning of the wireless connection.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In some embodiments, the user may want to shift frequently or swiftly between a wireless and a corded connection, and therefore, in some embodiments, it may be advantageous to enable the wireless link also when the first connector part and the second connector part are connected. Thus, it may be possible, for example via the telecommunication device or via any<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> interface to the transceivers to indicate that the first transceiver and the second transceiver may be permanently activated to maintain a wireless link between the first transceiver and the second transceiver also when a corded connection is established between the headset and the telecommunication device.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In this way, one of the disadvantages of the wireless communication connection is overcome, in that the set up time for the wireless connection is eliminated whereas the headset and/or the speakerphone and/or the first transceiver and/or the second transceiver may receive charging power from the telecommunication device via the corded connection.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown. The invention may, however, be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein.
