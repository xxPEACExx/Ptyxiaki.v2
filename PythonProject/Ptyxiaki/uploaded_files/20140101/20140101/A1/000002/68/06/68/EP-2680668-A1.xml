As illustrated in (a) to (c), the phase of a driving signal from a preceding arm (U-phase driving circuit 20) is advanced relative to the phase of a driving signal from a following arm (V-phase driving circuit 21), and thus a phase difference occurs between the output potential of the preceding arm and the output potential of the following arm. Based on this phase difference (hereinafter, also referred to as the phase difference between arms), the time of application of the output voltage of the inverter circuits 9 is controlled, and the magnitude of the output current flowing to the load circuits 24 can be controlled.<br/>
As illustrated in (a), in the case of the high output state, the phase difference between the arms is increased, and the voltage application duration in one cycle is thus increased. As illustrated in (b), in the case of the medium output state, the phase difference between the arms is reduced compared to the high output state, and the voltage application duration in one cycle is thus reduced. As illustrated in (c), in the case of the low output state, the phase difference between the arms is further reduced, and the voltage application duration in one cycle is thus further reduced.<br/>
The upper limit of the phase difference between the arms is applied to the case of an opposite phase (a phase difference of 180°), and the output voltage waveform at this time is substantially a rectangular wave. Furthermore, the lower limit of the phase difference between the arms is set to, for example, a level that does not cause a situation in which an excessive current flows to a switching element due to the relation with the phase of a current flowing to the load circuit 24 or the like when the switching element is turned on and the switching element breaks down.</p><heading id="h0014">(Load determination)</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --><p id="p0019" num="0019">Next, a load determination operation by the load determining means 26 will be explained.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> includes diagrams illustrating an example of the positional relationship between heating coils and load (pan) to be heated in the induction heating cooker according to Embodiment 1.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5(a)</figref> is an explanatory diagram illustrating the state when the arrangement of the heating coils 22 is viewed from the above, and <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5(b)</figref> is an explanatory diagram illustrating the state when the arrangement of the heating coils 22 is viewed from a side.

A load circuit 24' is connected between output points of each of the inverter circuits 9'. The load circuit 24' includes a heating coil 22, a resonant capacitor 23, and a clamp diode 27 connected in parallel to the resonant capacitor 23.<br/>
The clamp diode 27 clamps the potential of the connection point between the heating coil 22 and the resonant capacitor 23 at the potential of a bus on a lower potential side of a direct-current power supply.
