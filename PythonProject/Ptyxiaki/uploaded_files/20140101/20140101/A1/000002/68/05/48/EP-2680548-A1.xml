Dual microphone noise reduction means that two microphones are built in a handset, one for clear voice communication and the other for active physical noise reduction where ambient sounds are collected and processed and then a sound wave with an inverted phase to the noise is generated to reduce the noise by using an offsetting principle.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Due to the size of the mobile terminal, it is impossible to place a noise reduction microphone far from a main microphone. Therefore, when noise is filtered, some useful sounds are also filtered, thereby affecting the quality of voice communication and weakening the effect of noise reduction.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">Embodiments of the present invention provide a method and an apparatus for reducing noise in voices of a mobile terminal, which can improve the effect of noise reduction.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">To achieve the above objective, the embodiments of the present invention adopt the following technical solutions:</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A method for reducing noise in voices of a mobile terminal includes:<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> -->

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the method includes:</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">101. Select, from a voice headphone and a microphone built in the mobile terminal, a current communicating microphone and a current noise reducing microphone.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The voice headphone is connected to a handset in a wired or wireless manner.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The selecting, from a voice headphone and a microphone built in the mobile terminal, a current communicating microphone and a current noise reducing microphone may be implemented in two methods, specifically:</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Method 1: Obtain the audio signal received by the voice headphone and the audio signal received by the microphone built in the mobile terminal; obtain the audio energy corresponding to the audio signal received by the voice headphone and the audio energy corresponding to the audio signal received by the microphone built in the mobile terminal; compare the audio energy corresponding to the audio signal received by the voice headphone with the audio energy corresponding to the audio signal received by the microphone built in the mobile terminal, and determine greater one audio energy and smaller audio energy in the audio energy corresponding to the audio signal received by the voice headphone and the audio energy corresponding to the audio signal received by the microphone built in the mobile terminal; and select the microphone that receives the audio signal corresponding to the greater audio energy as the current communicating microphone and the microphone that receives the audio signal corresponding to the smaller audio energy as the current noise reducing microphone.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">It should be noted that the technical steps provided by the method 1 are performed by the handset automatically after the voice function is enabled and do not need to be set manually by a handset user.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Further, in the method 1, the step of obtaining the audio energy corresponding to the audio signal received by the voice headphone and the audio energy corresponding to the audio signal received by the microphone built in the mobile terminal is implemented specifically as follows:</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In each sampling period of a sampling time window, perform analog-to-digital conversion on the audio signal received by the voice headphone to obtain the sample audio signal of the voice headphone corresponding to each sampling period and perform analog-to-digital conversion on the audio signal received by the microphone built in the mobile terminal, so as to obtain the sample audio signal of the microphone built in the mobile terminal corresponding to each sampling period, where the sampling time window includes at least one sampling period; calculate according to the sample audio signal of the voice headphone corresponding to each sampling period, so as to obtain the one-period audio energy of the voice headphone corresponding to each sampling period and calculate according to the sample audio signal of the microphone built in the mobile terminal corresponding to each sampling period, so as to obtain the one-period audio energy of the microphone built in the mobile terminal corresponding to each sampling period; determine a sum of the one-period audio energy of the voice headphone corresponding to all sampling periods as the audio energy of the audio signal received by the voice headphone and determine a sum of the one-period audio energy of the microphone built in the mobile terminal corresponding to all sampling periods as the audio energy of the audio signal received by the microphone built in the mobile terminal; or determine a mean value of the one-period audio energy of the voice headphone corresponding to all sampling periods as the audio energy of the audio signal received by the voice headphone and determine a mean value of the one-period audio energy of the microphone built in the mobile terminal corresponding to all sampling periods as the audio energy of the audio signal received by the microphone built in the mobile terminal.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The sampling time window may have one or more than one sampling period and each sampling period may be set to 20 ms. There may be other settings which are not limited by the embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">It should be noted that the analog-to-digital conversion is to convert the analog signal received by a microphone to a digital signal through four steps including sampling, holding, quantization, and coding, for example, the converting the audio signal received by the voice headphone to a sample audio signal of the voice headphone and the converting the audio signal received by the microphone built in the mobile terminal to a sample audio signal of the microphone built in the mobile terminal. After the analog-to-digital conversion, calculation may be performed on the digital signal obtained by the analog-to-digital conversion, so as to obtain the corresponding audio energy.
