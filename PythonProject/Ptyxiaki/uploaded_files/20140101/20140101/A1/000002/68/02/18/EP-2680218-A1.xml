The biometric authentication apparatus acquires biometric information as information peculiar to a living body and checks the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> information with biometric information registered in advance to perform authentication based on the degree of the check. As the biometric authentication apparatus, a finger vein authentication apparatus using a vein pattern of a finger of a hand as biometric information is known.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Incidentally, ambient light incident on an imaging unit (camera) when imaging the vein pattern of the finger adversely affects the imaging of the vein pattern and authentication accuracy in the finger vein authentication apparatus. Accordingly, the finger vein authentication apparatus is designed to suppress the effect of ambient light by blocking incoming radiation of ambient light to the imaging unit by means of: (i) covering the entire imaging surface by a finger of a hand, (ii) covering the entire imaging surface by a cover provided as part of the apparatus, (iii) providing an external-light blocking cover for blocking incoming radiation of ambient light to the imaging unit and so on.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">PTL 1: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2007185335A"><text>JP-A-2007-185335</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, in the example in which the entire imaging surface is covered by the cover as the above (ii) in the finger vein authentication apparatus, it is difficult to visually recognize the finger put on the imaging surface. Accordingly, there were problems that a user has high psychological reluctance and that it is difficult to know whether the user puts the finger on a suitable position. In a common finger vein authentication apparatus, a two-dimensional vein pattern is used. Accordingly, the vein pattern imaged by the imaging unit is changed according to a posture in a roll direction (hereinafter referred to as merely a "posture") around an axis of the finger at the time of imaging. However, as the finger put on the imaging surface is difficult to be visually recognized in the example in which the entire imaging surface is covered by the cover as the above (ii), it is difficult to adjust the posture of the finger to be a posture at the time of registering the vein pattern (or a posture to be regarded as the posture at the time of registering the vein pattern) . The problem concerning the posture adjustment of the finger occurs also in the case where a slit for natural lighting is provided in the external-light blocking cover as in the invention described in PTL 1.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> In the finger vein authentication apparatus, it is desired to block incoming radiation of ambient light to the imaging unit as well as to facilitate the adjustment of the finger posture on the imaging surface.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008"><ol><li>1. According to an embodiment of the invention, there is provided an external-light blocking cover used for a finger vein authentication apparatus including a placing unit for placing a finger of a hand, an imaging unit imaging a vein pattern of the finger placed on the placing unit and an authentication processing unit performing authentication processing by using the vein pattern imaged by the imaging unit, which covers the finger placed on the placing unit to block external light incident on the imaging unit.<br/>
The external-light blocking cover includes a window portion for visually recognizing the finger covered by the external-light blocking cover from the outside of the external-light blocking cover, in which the window portion is formed so that an angle made by a first tangent line passing through a first edge point at the window portion in an outer surface of the external-light blocking cover and is tangent to a profile line of the finger and a second tangent line passing through a second edge point facing the first edge point at the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> window portion in the outer surface of the external-light blocking cover and is tangent to the profile line of the finger is 60 degrees or less in a plane perpendicular to an axis of the finger placed on the placing unit.</li></ol></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">When the external-light blocking cover is used for the finger vein authentication apparatus, it is possible to block incoming radiation of ambient light to the imaging unit as well as to adjust the posture of the finger on an imaging surface easily while visually recognizing the finger from the outside of the external-light blocking cover through the window portion. As a result, the reduction of authentication accuracy in the finger vein authentication apparatus can be suppressed.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the external-light blocking cover, the angle made by the first tangent line and the second tangent line is a visible angle of the finger limited by the window portion. When the angle is limited to 60 degrees or less, a user can definitely grasp the contrast between the external-light blocking cover and the finger visually recognized from the window portion as compared with a case where the visible angle of the finger limited by the window portion is larger than 60 degrees, and thus, it is possible to adjust the posture of the finger easily.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><ul><li>2.
