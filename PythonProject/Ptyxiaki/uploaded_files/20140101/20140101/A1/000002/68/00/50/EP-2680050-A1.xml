TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an optical fiber head which has a leading end portion of an optical fiber and an optical element held by a casing, and particularly to an optical fiber head which can be preferably used as a head for a fiber optic optoelectronic switch.</p><heading id="h0003">2. RELATED ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The optical fiber head is for appropriately performing light beam control on light to be emitted from a leading end face of the optical fiber or light entered the leading end face of the optical fiber by an optical element, and is configured to have the leading end face of the optical fiber and a back end face of the optical element arranged to face each other by making the casing hold the leading end portion of the optical fiber and the optical element. Here, a lens, a mirror, a polarization filter, an aperture, or the like is generally used as the optical element.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the optical fiber head, it is required for the optical fiber and the optical element to be highly precisely aligned and fixed to the casing so that the optical axis of the optical fiber matches with the optical center of the optical element. Insufficient alignment prevents the optical fiber from providing desired optical properties, thus decreasing a yield.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Therefore, adhesives or crimping rings are conventionally used to fix the optical fiber to the casing so as to highly precisely fix the optical fiber to the casing.

That complicates the assembly operation, and accordingly, raises the manufacturing cost. Further, in order to ensure the sufficient holding power of the casing to hold the optical fiber, it is required to strictly control matters such as the application quantity of the adhesive and the cure condition. That also raises the manufacturing cost.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">On the other hand, in the case where a crimping ring is used to fix the optical fiber to the casing, a process of exposing the core wire is not needed.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> As a result, the assembly operation becomes relatively simple, though, the number of parts increases, which also raises the manufacturing cost. In order to ensure the sufficient holding power of the casing to hold the optical fiber, it is required to strictly control accuracy of dimension of the parts including the crimping ring.

The crimping portion 22 has a thinner wall than the body part 21 does and has the shape of a regular hexagonal prism. A male screw portion 21a is provided on an outer peripheral surface of the body part 21. The male screw portion 21a is used in setting the optical fiber head 1A.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The lens 30 is formed of an optical transparent member, for example, an injection molding made of resin material represented by acrylic resin or the like.

The truncated cone portion 32 has a diameter reduced toward the back end side of the casing 20. The lens 30 has a gate mark 30d, which is made in injection<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> molding, on an outer peripheral surface 30c of the truncated cone portion 32 which is positioned near to the back end face 30b of the lens 30.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As the lens 30, glass lens or the like may be used other than the above described resin lens which is made of an injection molding.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As described above, both of the leading end portion of the optical fiber 10 and the lens 30 are accommodated in the through-hole provided in the casing 20.

The crimping portion 22 is a part of the casing 20 along the axial direction which is plastically deformed such that the part of the casing 20 is virtually equally reduced in diameter in a circumferential direction. The crimping portion 22 holds the optical fiber 10 by pinching the optical fiber 10 inserted in the casing 20 when the crimping portion 22 is reduced in diameter.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">More specifically, since the core wire including the core 11 and the clad 12 at the leading end portion of the optical fiber 10 which is held by the crimping<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> portion 22 is covered by the coating 13, the suitably elastic coating 13 is pressed and deformed by the crimping portion 22 when the crimping portion 22 is reduced in diameter, and as a result, when the crimping portion 22 bites the outer peripheral surface 10b of the coating 13, the crimping portion 22 tightly hold the optical fiber 10. Further, since the elastic coating 13 is interposed between the crimping portion 22 and the core wire, deformation of the core wire is suppressed, therefore, the interposition can prevent the crimping of the optical fiber 10 from degrading the optical properties of the optical fiber 10.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Here, it is required to virtually equally reduce the crimping portion 22 in diameter in a circumferential direction. Such a virtually equal reduction of the crimping portion 22 in diameter in a circumferential direction enables highly precise positioning of the optical fiber 10 with respect to the casing 20, and accordingly, enables prevention of a shift of the optical axis of the optical fiber 10. Therefore, it is preferable that the outer contour of the crimping portion 22 in the crimping state is a regular polygonal prism or a cylinder, and in the present embodiment, it is a regular hexagonal prism as described above.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">On the other hand, the lens 30 is held by the casing 20 when the lens 30 is press fitted and fixed to the casing 20. The process of press fitting and fixing the lens 30 to the casing 20 is mainly performed by pressing the cylindrical portion 31 of the lens 30 into the through-hole of the casing 20 with a large pressure, and as a result, when the outer peripheral surface 30c of the lens 30 is pressed against the inner peripheral surface 20a of the casing 20, the lens 30 is held by the casing 20. By using the press-fitting, the lens 30 can be highly precisely held to the casing 20, so that a shift of the optical center of the lens 30 can be prevented.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Here, the outer peripheral surface 30c of the lens 30 has fine projections and recessions (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 4B and 4C</figref>). Since the lens 30 is adapted to have these fine projections and recessions on its outer peripheral surface 30c, the projections among the fine projections and recessions function as a squeeze in press-fitting, enabling the lens 30 to be press fitted into the casing 20 more smoothly and tightly.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Therefore, the above described configuration enables both of the optical fiber 10 and the lens 30 to be positioned and fixed to the casing 20, thus, enables the optical axis of the optical fiber 10 and the optical center of the lens 30 to be easily match, so that the optical fiber head can be adapted to provide desired optical properties.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Here, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, the crimping portion 22 is provided at the back end side of the casing 20 at a distance from the place where a leading end face 10a of the optical fiber 10 is positioned along the axial direction of the casing 20. That configuration can prevent the pressing out effect of the optical fiber 10 in the axial direction of the casing 20 caused by the crimping of the optical fiber 10 by the crimping portion 22 from affecting the leading end face 10a of the optical fiber 10, therefore, enable highly precise positioning of the leading end face 10a of the optical fiber 10.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">By arranging the leading end face 10a of the optical fiber 10 to abut against the back end face 30b of the lens 30 as described above by using this configuration, the leading end face 10a of the optical fiber 10 is pressed against the back end face 30b of the lens 30 when the optical fiber 10 is pressed out in the axial direction of the casing 20, therefore, the shift of the optical axis of the optical fiber 10 can be prevented more securely.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0044" num="0044"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4A</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of optical paths in the optical fiber head illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 4B and 4C</figref> are enlarged cross-sectional views of main parts illustrating detailed structures of the optical fiber head.

On this occasion, the light exited from the leading end face 10a of the optical fiber 10 at a relatively large angle with respect to the optical axis is reflected mainly from the outer peripheral surface 30c of the cylindrical portion 31 of the lens 30, changes the angle and reaches the front end face 30a of the lens 30.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The light other than which passes through the optical center of the lens 30 of the light which has reached the front end face 30a of the lens 30 is refracted at the front end face 30a of the convex lens surface and exits the lens 30 from the front end face 30a. The light passed through the optical center of the lens 30 of the light which has reached the front end face 30a of the lens 30 is transmitted through the lens 30 without being refracted at the front end face 30a and exits the lens 30 from the front end face 30a.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0047" num="0047">As a result, an irradiation light 100 emitted from the optical fiber head 1A is condensed within measure.

Especially the light exited at a remarkably large angle with respect to the optical axis largely changes the angle and is repeatedly reflected in the lens 30. As a result, the light attenuates and hardly reaches the front end face 30a of the lens 30.
