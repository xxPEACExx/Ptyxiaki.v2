with reference to the drawings, an embodiment will be explained. Specific structures shown in the embodiment are one aspect of the invention, and not to be construed in a limited manner on the basis of any specific disclosure or explanation of the embodiment. The drawings are used for the sake of explanation. Therefore, they may be simplified as appropriate and may not reflect exact dimensions or the like.</p><heading id="h0011">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">As will become apparent from the following explanation, a smartphone 100 (see <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">Figs. 1 to 4</figref>) according to the present embodiment includes a battery cover 60 attached to a body, and a locking member 70 that is rotatably held by the body and that rotates in accordance with a force received from the battery cover 60 to engage with the battery cover 60. This structure can facilitate attaching the battery cover 60 to the body. Note that the term "the body" of the smartphone 100 should be construed in a broad sense, and the body is not necessarily completed.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to the present embodiment, the user is saved the trouble of manually switching the locking apparatus from the unlocked state to the locked state after the battery cover 60 is attached to the smartphone body, and the locking apparatus will not be left in such an unlocked state. Thus, the smartphone 100 according to the present embodiment is made with due consideration of the actual usage manner of the user, and exhibits effects in addition to the facilitated attachment work. For example, as will become apparent from the following explanation, since the locking apparatus is built into the smartphone 100, the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> locking apparatus is prevented from being unintentionally switched from the locked state to the unlocked state. Further, since the locking apparatus is located inside the smartphone 100, flexibility in designing the smartphone 100 can be increased. Note that the effects explained in connection with the embodiment are merely of an exemplary nature, and the technical scope of the present invention should not be narrowly construed on the basis of the explanation.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the following, with reference to the drawings, the first embodiment will be explained more specifically. As schematically shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the smartphone (mobile communication terminal (electronic device)) 100 includes a top case assembly 10, a display assembly 20, a circuit board assembly 30, a bottom case assembly 40, a battery pack 50, and a battery cover (cover member) 60.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The top case assembly 10 is an integrated component that is made up of a touch panel 15, which protects the display portion of the display assembly 20, and a top side case (a molded product made of resin or the like). The display assembly 20 is a composite component that includes a display component such as an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and the like. The circuit board assembly 30 is a composite component in which circuit elements (a processor, a memory, logic chips, capacitors, LEDs and the like) are mounted on an insulating substrate. The bottom case assembly 40 is a component in which lines, connection terminals and the like are integrated with a bottom side case (a molded product made of resin or the like). The battery pack 50 is a flat plate-like member into which a secondary battery is built, and to the exterior of which a plurality of external connection terminals are provided. The battery cover 60 is a molded product made of resin or the like.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Note that the touch panel 15 provided to the top case assembly 10 is, for example, of the capacitive type, and detects the position where a manipulation instruction from the user is input based on the detection of a change in the capacitance, which is caused by a touch pen or the user's finger touching the touch panel 15. Note that, though the position detection carried out by the touch panel 15 is executed by a dedicated circuit installed in the touch panel 15, the present invention is not limited thereto and the position detection may be executed by a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> circuit in the circuit board assembly 30. On the display such as the LCD provided to the display assembly 20, arbitrary images such as icons for receiving an input of a manipulation instruction from the user are displayed. Based on the touched position detected by the touch panel 15, the smartphone 100 senses whether or not any of the icons shown on the display is selected by the user. Then the smartphone 100 executes a prescribed process indicated by the icon in accordance with the sensing that the icon is selected. Note that the process executed by the smartphone 100 is realized by a central processing unit (CPU), which is mounted on the circuit board assembly 30, executing a program. During such software processing, peripheral devices (a transmitter, a receiver, and various sensors) and the like mounted on the circuit board assembly 30 are driven under control.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the bottom case assembly 40 is a member having a frame portion 41 in a rectangular shape as seen from above. The bottom case assembly 40 further has a storage portion 42 for storing the circuit board assembly 30 and the display assembly 20. After the circuit board assembly 30 and the display assembly 20 are assembled into the top case assembly 10, the top case assembly 10 is screwed to the bottom case assembly 40. The top case assembly 10 being screwed to the bottom case assembly 40 allows the circuit board assembly 30 and the display assembly 20 to be stored in the housing.

The battery pack 50 is attached to the storage portion 43 of the bottom case assembly 40, and the position of the battery pack 50<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> is fixed thereto. In this state, by the battery cover 60 being pressed against the bottom case assembly 40, the battery cover 60 is locked to the bottom case assembly 40 through the locking member 70. Thus, the battery pack 50 is stored in the smartphone 100.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The electrical connection between the battery pack 50 and the circuit board assembly 30 can be secured in any manner. For example, by the battery pack 50 being disposed in the storage portion 43 of the bottom case assembly 40, the battery pack 50 is electrically connected to the circuit board assembly 30 via the bottom case assembly 40. That is, the external connection terminals of the battery pack 50 and the connection terminals of the bottom case assembly 40 are brought into contact with each other or the like, whereby an electrical connection is established between them. Thus, power is supplied from the battery pack 50 to the circuit board assembly 30 through the lines provided to the bottom case assembly 40. Power may be directly supplied from the battery pack 50 to the circuit board assembly 30.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to the present embodiment, by the battery cover 60 being pushed into the bottom case assembly 40, the battery cover 60 is locked to the bottom case assembly 40.

In this case also, the battery cover 60 is prevented from jumping out of the bottom case assembly 40, which may otherwise be caused by the shock associated with the smartphone 100 being dropped or the like. Therefore, the shock resistance of the smartphone 100 will not be impaired. As a result, it becomes possible to facilitate attaching the battery cover of the smartphone 100 without impairing the shock resistance of the smartphone 100.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Note that, when the smartphone 100 is subjected to the drop test and the deformation process of the smartphone 100 is observed with a high-speed camera or the like, the smartphone 100 may be deflected, e.g., bowed, in some cases. In such cases, since deflection of the battery pack 50 is small relative to that of the bottom case assembly 40, the battery pack 50 may jump out of the bottom case assembly 40. In order to prevent the battery pack 50 from jumping out, it is<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> desirable that the battery cover 60 is strongly fixed to the bottom case assembly 40.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Taking into consideration of the power consumption of the smartphone 100 not being small, it is expected that the battery pack will be further increased in size in the future.

According to the present embodiment, as described above, attaching the battery cover 60 of the smartphone 100 can be facilitated without impairing the shock resistance of the smartphone 100.

Note that, though the deformed state of the sealing member 65 is not explicitly shown in the drawings, those skilled in the art can equally read it from the drawings.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0021 f0022 f0023">Figs. 21 to 24</figref>, the manner of the bottom case assembly 40 holding the locking member 70 is supplementarily explained. Note that <figref idrefs="f0022">Fig. 23</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view taken along XXIII-XXIII in <figref idrefs="f0022">Fig. 22</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0023">Fig. 24</figref> is a schematic enlarged view of the area around a dashed circle 24 in <figref idrefs="f0022">Fig. 23</figref>.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0021">Fig. 21</figref>, the locking member 70 is pressed downward by the holding portion 46 at three points P10 to P12 and held thereby. Since the locking member 70 is held at a plurality of points, the rotary shaft AX10 of the locking member 70 can be more accurately positioned.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0055" num="0055">As schematically shown in <figref idrefs="f0023">Fig. 24</figref>, the ring-like portion 71c of the locking member 70 is held as being interposed between the holding portion 46 and the substrate 47. The holding portion 46 is previously provided with a receiving portion 46c for receiving the ring-like portion 71c of the locking member 70. Though the height of the entrance of the receiving portion 46c is smaller than the diameter of the circular portion 71c1, the ring-like portion 71c can be easily pushed into the receiving portion 46c because the holding portion 46 and the substrate 47 are made as separate members. By the projection 71c2 provided to the circular portion 71c1 abutting on the entrance portion of the holding portion 46, the rotation of the locking member 70 in the counterclockwise direction, when <figref idrefs="f0023">Fig. 24</figref> is seen from the front, is restricted. By the projection 71c2 provided to the circular portion 71c1 abutting on the substrate 47, the rotation of the locking member 70 in the clockwise direction, when <figref idrefs="f0023">Fig. 24</figref> is seen from the front, is restricted.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">According to the present embodiment, the locking member 70 is attached to the bottom case assembly 40 by being pushed into the bottom case assembly 40. This can avoid complication associated with assembling the locking mechanism to the smartphone 100.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">According to the present embodiment, the projections that function as the rotation restriction portions to the locking member 70 are provided. Thus, the rotation range of the locking member 70 can be suitably restricted, and it becomes possible to effectively prevent impairment of the locking operation itself by an unexpected rotation of the locking member 70.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Note that the battery cover 60 can be easily removed from the bottom case assembly 40 by being forcibly pulled from the battery cover 60. Any method can be employed for assembling the smartphone 100, and those skilled in the art can easily understand the method from the drawings of the present application.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The present invention is not limited to the embodiment explained above, and can be changed as appropriate within the range not departing from the gist of<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> the present invention.
