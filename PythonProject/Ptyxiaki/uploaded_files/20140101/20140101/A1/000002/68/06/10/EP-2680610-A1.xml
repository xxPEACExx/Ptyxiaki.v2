Tinnitus is considered a phantom sound, which arises in the auditory system. For example, a ringing, buzzing, whistling, or roaring sound may be perceived as tinnitus. Tinnitus can be continuous or intermittent, and in either case can be very disturbing, and can significantly decrease the quality of life for one who has such an affliction.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Tinnitus can, to date, not be surgically corrected and since, to date, there are no approved effective drug treatments, so-called tinnitus maskers have become known.
