The thermistor described in Patent Document 1 has a flat-plate metal substrate that also serves as an electrode, a temperature-sensitive resistor film formed on either main surface of the substrate, and an electrode film formed on the temperature-sensitive resistor film.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the structure of this thermistor, however, one of the electrodes is the flat-plate metal substrate and the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> other is the uppermost electrode film. Mounting this thermistor on a substrate or the like thus requires the electric connection to the electrode film should be established by wire bonding; it is impossible to mount this thermistor into an extremely small space. For example, when a thermistor of this type is used as a temperature sensor for an IC component packaged on a printed wiring board, there is a very narrow gap of 150 to 200 µm between the printed wiring board and the IC package and it is preferred to mount the thermistor into this gap. However, it is substantially difficult to mount an electronic component into such a very small gap by wire bonding.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">According to Patent Document 1, furthermore, the temperature-sensitive resistor film is formed on the wiring board by sputtering. Although the resistor film formed by sputtering is in good contact with the flat-plate metal substrate, sputtering is not suitable for production because performing sputtering requires costly production equipment. Solid-phase formation is desired; however, the use of this method results in the rate of shrinkage of the flat-plate metal substrate being different from that of the temperature-sensitive resistor film because of the different thermal expansion coefficients of the two elements. Even if the flat-plate metal substrate and the temperature-sensitive<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> resistor film can be bonded together, therefore, the bonding strength of the interface may be insufficient, depending on the external environment.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Document</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP61245502A"><text>61-245502</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a thermistor that can be mounted by soldering and offers excellent bonding strength even when formed by a solid-phase method and a method for producing this thermistor.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">A first aspect of the invention has a metal substrate, a semiconductor ceramic layer on the metal substrate, and a pair of split electrodes on the semiconductor layer. The semiconductor ceramic layer is formed by a solid-phase method. The metal substrate contains ceramic particles, and the thickness of the substrate is not interrupted by the ceramic particles or a pillar formed by a chain of the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> ceramic particles.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The inventor proposed a thermistor having a metal substrate, a semiconductor ceramic layer on the metal substrate, and a pair of split electrodes on the semiconductor ceramic layer in a previous PCT application (<patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2010064089W"><text>PCT/JP2010/64089</text></patcit>). Such a structure allows the thermistor to be mounted on a printed wiring board by soldering processes such as reflow soldering. The semiconductor ceramic layer and the metal substrate are obtained by firing intermediate thin films together.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Even in this configuration, however, solid-phase formation results in the rate of shrinkage of the metal substrate being different from that of the semiconductor ceramic layer because of the different thermal expansion coefficients of the two elements, even when the intermediates for the two elements are fired together. Even if the metal substrate and the semiconductor ceramic layer can be bonded together, therefore, the value of resistance greatly varies depending on the environment; for example, exposure to a high-temperature and a high-humidity environment causes moisture to penetrate into the bonding interface, breaking the bond between the metal substrate and the semiconductor ceramic layer. In the present invention,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> it has been found that mixing a ceramic powder in the metal substrate improves the strength of the bonding between the semiconductor ceramic layer and the metal substrate. This is probably because the anchor effect of the ceramic powder and an increase in the area of the contact between the semiconductor ceramic layer and the metal substrate make some contributions. Furthermore, the metal substrate is not interrupted in the direction of thickness by the ceramic particles or a pillar formed by a chain of the ceramic particles. This improves the strength of the bonding between the metal substrate and the semiconductor ceramic layer without affecting flexibility or the strength of the metal substrate.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The expression <i>the metal substrate is interrupted in the direction of thickness by the ceramic particles or a pillar formed by a chain of the ceramic particles</i> means that a single ceramic particle or a pillar of ceramic particles is exposed on both the front and the back of the metal substrate.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Preferably, the metal substrate and the ceramic layer of the electronic component have a thickness of 10 to 80 µm and 1 to 10 µm, respectively (a second aspect of the invention).<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A low-profile electronic component having such a structure can be mounted into an extremely narrow space as small as 200 µm or less and is also given flexibility because the semiconductor ceramic layer and the metal substrate are obtained by firing intermediate thin films together. As a result, the ceramic layer is unlikely to crack even when the electronic component is exposed to stress, and the electronic component can be mounted even on a bumpy, stepped, or similarly uneven space.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">It is also preferred that each of the metal substrate and the ceramic layer is in the form of a sheet (a third aspect of the invention).</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Furthermore, it is preferred that the sheet-shaped metal substrate and the sheet-shaped ceramic layer are obtained by stacking intermediates for them and firing the intermediates together (a fourth aspect of the invention).</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A thermistor according to an aspect of the invention is preferably produced by this method.

It therefore becomes easier to improve the strength of the bonding between the metal substrate and the semiconductor ceramic layer without affecting the flexibility of the entire thermistor.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">It is also preferred that the semiconductor ceramic layer is made of an NTC ceramic material and the ceramic particles are made of the same material as the semiconductor ceramic layer or an iron oxide (a sixth aspect of the invention).</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The use of such materials allows the strength of the bonding between the metal substrate and the semiconductor ceramic layer to be improved without any adverse effects on the characteristics of the semiconductor ceramic layer or reduced flexibility.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> It is also preferred that the split electrodes contain ceramic particles (a seventh aspect of the invention).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Such a configuration is highly advantageous in that the strength of the bonding between the semiconductor ceramic layer and the split electrodes is also improved.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">An eighth aspect of the invention is a method for producing a thermistor having a metal substrate, a semiconductor ceramic layer on the metal substrate, and a pair of split electrodes on the semiconductor ceramic substrate. This method includes applying a predetermined thickness of a ceramic slurry to a carrier film to form a ceramic greensheet as an intermediate for the semiconductor ceramic film, applying a predetermined thickness of a metal paste containing a ceramic powder to the ceramic greensheet to form a metal sheet as an intermediate for the metal substrate, applying a predetermined thickness of an electrode-forming paste to the surface of the ceramic greensheet opposite to the metal sheet to form a pattern of electrodes as an intermediate for the split electrodes, and firing the metal sheet, the ceramic greensheet, and the pattern of electrodes together.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In such a production method, firing the metal sheet and<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the ceramic greensheet together allows the ceramic powder to provide ceramic particles into the interface between the metal substrate and the semiconductor ceramic layer, and the ceramic particles produce unevenness on the surface of the metal substrate.
