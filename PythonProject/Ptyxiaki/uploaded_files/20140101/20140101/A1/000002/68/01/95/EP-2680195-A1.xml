As used in the present specification and claims, however, unless specified to the contrary, the following terms have the meaning indicated.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">An unexplored research avenue/ promising challenge: An unexplored research avenue/ promising challenge shall be defined as a set of sentences extracted from a set of publications, which inferred from user preference and statistical analysis, indicates the presence of a topic that can be of interest to a user.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Publication: A publication shall be defined as any document or set of information that is available for view by a population, for a fee or otherwise. In an embodiment, the publication can be from any field such as legal, medical, hi-tech, and/ or pharmaceuticals. In an embodiment, for example, the disclosed embodiments can be used to identify ideas of interest/ challenge from scholarly articles and/or statutes, judicial decisions, and other official documents from the legal domain. It will be appreciated by a person having ordinary skill in the art that<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the various fields listed above are provided only as an example and are not meant to limit the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Citation: A citation shall be defined as a note in a publication which indicates that the publication either refers or is referred by another publication.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Forward Citation: A forward citation for a particular publication shall be defined as a publication which refers that particular publication.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Backward Citation: A backward citation for a particular publication shall be defined as a publication which is referred by that particular publication.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Citation Map: A citation map shall be defined as a graphical representation of the backward and forward citations of a publication.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Hub Value: Hub value for a publication shall be defined as the number of backward citations of a publication, or a metric at least partially related to that number. A higher hub value will represent higher number of backward citations and a lower hub value will represent a lower number of backward citations. Further, it will be appreciated by a person having ordinary skill in the art that the hub value of a publication can change over time depending on new backward citations being added to the publication.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Authority Value: Authority value of a publication shall be defined number of forward citations of a publication, or a metric at least partially related to that number. A higher authority value will represent higher number of forward citations and a lower authority value will represent a lower number of forward citations. Further, it will be appreciated by a person having ordinary skill in the art that the authority value of a publication can change over time depending on new forward citations being added to the publication.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The present disclosure is best understood with reference to the detailed figures and description set forth herein. Various embodiments are discussed below with reference to the figures. However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to these figures is just for explanatory purposes as the method and the system extend beyond the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> described embodiments. For example, those skilled in the art will appreciate, in light of the teachings presented, recognizing multiple alternate and suitable approaches, depending on the needs of a particular application, to implement the functionality of any detail described herein, beyond the particular implementation choices in the following embodiments described and shown. The detailed description of the embodiments will now be presented in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">A method, system, and a computer program product for identifying scientific literature containing promising challenges are disclosed.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating elements of a computer system 100 for parsing publications in accordance with an embodiment. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> comprises a publication database 102, a citation map generator 104, a ranking module 106, a language processing engine 108 a display 112, and a text database 110. In an embodiment, a publication refers to a scientific publication.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The publication database 102 can be any known database which contains various publications of one or more scientific fields. For example, the publication database 102 can be the IEEE Xplore database in an embodiment. In another embodiment, the publication database 102 can be the PUBMED database. The publication database 102 contains publications from various domains. It will be understood by a person having ordinary skill in the art that a user can sort the publication database 102 by scientific fields of interest. For example, a user can sort the publication database 102 to look only at publications from a telecommunications domain in an embodiment. In another embodiment, the user can look at only a pharmaceutical focused scientific literature. The publication database 102 is communicatively coupled with the citation map generator 104. Once the user has identified all the publications from his/ her area of interest, the publications can be downloaded from publication database 102 and parsed through the citation map generator 104. The citation map generator 104 creates a citation map of each of the downloaded publication. A citation map of a publication<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> is a graphical representation of the degree of citation of the publication. The degree of citations can enable a user to see how well the document is cited or citing in the given scientific domain.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In an embodiment, the citation map is not displayed to the user. The user can define various parameters of interest and publications for which the citation map closely matches the user specified parameters can directly be used for a hub and authority value calculation.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Further, the citation map generator 104 also allocates a numerical value to each of the publications on the basis of the number of forward and backward citation of the publication. The numerical value assigned to the publication on the basis of its backward citations indicates the publication's hub value. The numerical value assigned to the publication on the basis of its forward citations indicates the publication's authority value. The concept of hub and authority values and the process of calculating the same are well known in the art. Any known technique for calculating the hub and authority values can be used by the citation map generator 104. For example, the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm (Kleinberg et al), can be used. A citation map is created for each of the publications downloaded from a database. On the basis of the citation maps, a ranking of the publications, on the basis of its authority/ hub value, is computed by the citation map generator 104. Any known ranking technique for achieving the aforesaid can be used. For example, the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm (Kleinberg et al), can be used. The citation map generator 104 uses the HITS algorithm to rank each of the publication on the basis of its authority/ hub value.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The ranking of the hubs and authorities by the HITS algorithm is based on a mutual reinforcing relationship between a hub value and an authority value. According to this relationship, a "good" authority is pointed to by many "good" hubs and vice versa. In an embodiment, a good authority can be described as a very influential publication in a given scientific domain. In the same embodiment, a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> good hub represents an acknowledged source for referencing various important publications.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The HITS algorithm can be used to calculate the authority values and the hub values of the publications. For the purpose of identifying promising challenges from publications, it is assumed that the publications with a high authority value will rarely contain ideas that are yet to be explored. Similarly, a publication with a very high hub value will generally be a very good source of reference for other publications, but is not expected to contain new ideas in its own subject matter. Hence, in an embodiment, the publications ranked by the citation map generator 104, on the basis of their authority and hub value using the HITS algorithm are pruned in order to create a first sub-set of publications. In an embodiment, a user can define a threshold value for the authority value of publications. If a publication's authority value is beyond the first pre-defined threshold, then these publications will be removed from the dataset. Similarly, a second user-defined threshold can be used to prune publications whose hub value is beyond the second user-defined threshold. The first and second pre-defined threshold, as set by the user, can be entered in to the citation map generator 104 through any known data input means. The citation map generator 104 will then use these values to remove publications from the dataset and output the first sub-set of publications.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The first sub-set of publications is then passed through the ranking module 106 for further pruning by using at least one technique. It will be appreciated by a person ordinarily skilled in the art that even the first sub-set of publications will be significantly large given the large corpus of publications available in various databases. In order to further sift through the large volume of publications, the ranking module 106, uses at least one technique in order to rank the publications. In an embodiment, the PageRank™ (Brin and Page et al) technique, is used.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The PageRank™ technique uses a recursive calculation to rank publications (or web pages) according to their importance. According to the PageRank™ technique, a publication X, which is cited by many publications is considered as a good publication if the publications citing X are also cited by many other publications. Hence, the worth of a publication with a high authority value can be further checked by checking whether it is being cited by publications which are equally popular in the domain. In an embodiment, the ranking module 106 further ranks the first sub-set of publications using the PageRank™ technique.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In an embodiment, the ranking module 106 further applies Social Network Analysis (SNA) measures to the ranked set of publications to narrow down the ranked set of publications to publications which have a higher potential of containing promising challenges. SNA measures are used in an embodiment to determine the importance of the ranked publications. In an embodiment, various SNA-based centrality measures can be used to determine the importance of the publications in a group of publications. In an embodiment, the ranking module 106 is configured to use centrality measures in order to short-list publications which can contain promising challenges.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In an embodiment, the various centrality measures that can be applied by the ranking module 106 are Degree Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and Closeness Centrality. In an embodiment, 'Degree Centrality' can be used to further filter down to publications which can potentially contain the promising challenges. Degree centrality measure helps identify publications which are extremely popular in terms of the number of forward citations. Hence, a user can choose to consider a publication, from the ranked set of publications, with a high authority value.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In another embodiment, 'Betweenness Centrality' can be used to further filter down to publications which can potentially contain promising challenges. 'Betweenness Centrality' can be employed when a user expects to identify interdisciplinary challenges. The 'betweenness centrality' measure identifies<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> publications which cite or are cited by publications from different fields/ research topics.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In another embodiment, 'Closeness Centrality' measure can be used to further filter down to publications which can potentially contain promising challenges. The 'closeness centrality' measure identifies publications that act as hubs for publications from varied fields. A user can choose to use this measure if he/she is interested in identifying publications that act as a reference to various publications from different fields.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">It will be understood by a person skilled in the art that various SNA measures listed above have been provided as examples. The ranking module 106 can be configured to apply any SNA measure depending on the specific requirements of a user.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The ranking module 106 outputs a set of publications which can potentially contain promising challenges representing unexplored research avenues. These publications are provided as input to the language processing engine 108. The language processing engine 108 applies natural language processing techniques on the ranked publications in order to identify publications which contain promising challenges. Based on various rules, the language processing engine 108 identifies various sentences from the publications. The identification of these sentences indicates the presence of promising challenges/unexplored research avenues in the ranked publication. Further, these sentences are continuously stored in the text database 110. The language processing engine can be pre-programmed with various rules to identify sentences which can lead to promising challenges. Techniques and rules for programming the language processing engine 108 to identify sentences which can lead to promising challenges are disclosed in the following patents: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US7689411B"><text>US 7,689,411</text></patcit> 'Concept matching' issued March 30, 2010 to Xerox Corporation; and <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US7809551B"><text>US 7,809,551</text></patcit> 'Concept matching system' issued October 5, 2010 to Xerox Corporation, the disclosures of which is incorporated herein by reference in its<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> entirety. Through these techniques, the language processing engine 108 is able to identify if the ranked documents contain sentences which can indicate promising challenges.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Once the sentences are identified by the language processing engine 108, in the publications, labels are assigned to these sentences.

More labels can be defined and used in order to capture other ideas from the publications.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Once the sentences indicating the presence of the promising challenges in a publication have been ascertained, the user can be presented with the paragraph containing that sentence. In an embodiment, the paragraph comprising the sentence which indicates a promising challenge in a publication is displayed to the user on the display 112. The display 112 also displays a pointer indicating the publication from which the paragraph has been sourced.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart detailing the steps involved in the identification of publications containing promising challenges from a corpus of publications. At 602, citation maps for the corpus of scientific literature specific to a domain are created. Using the HITS algorithm, publications with high authority or hub values are removed from the downloaded literature and a first sub-set of publications are created at 604. For removing publications, a user can set a first and second pre-defined threshold. As has been set forth in the description for <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the threshold for removing publications on the basis of their hub/ authority value will be defined by the user. At 606, in an embodiment, PageRank™ technique is used to rank the first sub-set of publications according to their importance in the domain. It will be understood by a person skilled in the art that the PageRank™ technique has been used only as an example and various other ranking techniques can be employed without departing from the scope of the disclosed embodiments. The results obtained by using PageRank™ can be further fine-grained by the application of SNA measures. The definition and application of SNA measures has been discussed in detail in the description for <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">FIGS. 1-5</figref>. Once the publications which can potentially contain promising challenges have been identified, language processing means are used to identify a set of sentence in the text of the publications at 608. These set of sentences indicate the presence of promising challenges. The process of identifying the set of sentences in the publications, through concept matching, has been discussed in detail in the description for <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">FIGS. 1-5</figref>. At 610, paragraphs containing the set of sentences in the publications are displayed to the user along with pointer to the relevant publication.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In an embodiment, newly released publications can also be considered for identifying promising challenges through the disclosed embodiments. A newly released publication will take some time to be cited by other publications. However, the new publication will have backward citations and hence a hub value. This hub value can be used as a parameter to rank the new publication and to consider it for identification of unexplored research avenues. It will be understood by a person having ordinary skill in the art that a newly released publication will, however, be comparatively lower ranked in the overall publications set.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The method, system and computer program product described above have numerous advantages.
