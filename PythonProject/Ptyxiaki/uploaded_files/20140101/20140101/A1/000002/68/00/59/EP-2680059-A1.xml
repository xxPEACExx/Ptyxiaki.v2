The lens barrel 16 can be formed of, for example, metal such as SUS, glass, or plastic.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> -->In the lens barrel 16, an imaging device side end 16a and an object side end 16b are open.<br/>
Both the lenses 14 and 15 in the illustrated example are plano-convex lenses, and have flat portions 14a and 15a on one side and convex portions 14b and 15b on the other side along the optical axis.<br/>
These plano-convex lenses 14 and 15 are fixed by making the convex portions 14b and 15b face each other and performing bonding, engagement, fitting, or the like between side surfaces 14c and 15c and the inner surface of the lens barrel 16.<br/>
A transparent cover member 18 is provided on the object side of the lens unit 13.<br/>

Accordingly, when fixing the lens unit 13 to the cover member 12 on the imaging device 11 side using an adhesive or the like, the aligning of the optical axis of the lens unit 13 with respect to the light receiving section 11a can be easily performed by rubbing the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> flat portion 14a of the plano-convex lens 14 and the surface 12a of the cover member 12, which are planes, against each other without interference of the end 16a of the lens barrel 16.

Although the shape and size of each portion of the lens unit 13 are not particularly limited, the convex portion 15b of the lens 15 on the object side is a spherical surface having a radius of 1 mm and the convex portion 14b of the lens 14 on the imaging device side is a spherical surface having a radius of 2 mm in an embodiment.<br/>
The internal diameter of the lens barrel 16 is 0.6 mm, the length of the lens barrel 16 is 0.8 mm, the wall thickness of the lens barrel 16 is 0.03 mm, and the length of the flat portion 14a of the imaging device side plano-convex lens 14 from the lens barrel end 16a to the protruding portion is 0.1 mm.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Each component of the imaging mechanisms 10 and 100 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> can be manufactured by using a manufacturing method including the following steps (1) to (3).<br/>

Accordingly, the position of the imaging device 11 and the lens unit 13 can be aligned while actually observing light (image) received by the imaging device 11 through the lens unit 13.<br/>
When fixing the plano-convex lens 14 and the cover member 12 to each other using an adhesive 19, the optical axis of the lens unit 13 and the optical axis of the light receiving section 11a are aligned by displacing the plano-convex lens 14 (lens unit 13) or the cover member 12 (imaging device 11) while the adhesive 19 is not cured and has fluidity.<br/>
As the adhesive 19, a thermosetting adhesive, a chemical reactive adhesive, and the like can be mentioned. However, since a light curing adhesive can be cured quickly and an uncured state can be made to continue when necessary, the light curing adhesive is preferable.<br/>
As the irradiation light, ultraviolet light and visible light can be mentioned.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> -->As the optical adhesive, silicone, epoxy, fluorinated epoxy, acrylic, epoxy acrylate, fluorinated epoxy acrylate, and the like can be mentioned.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In addition, according to the lens unit 13 in the illustrated example, the lens unit 13 can be combined without changing the specifications of the lens unit 13 even if the light receiving section 11a is disposed at a position biased to the outer peripheral portion of the surface 11b of the imaging device 11 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref> or even if the light receiving section 11a is disposed in a central portion of the surface 11b of the imaging device 11 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1B</figref>.<br/>
In this manner, the degree of freedom when designing the position of the light receiving section 11 a in the imaging device 11 together with the positions of other circuits, terminals, or the like is improved.<br/>
As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref>, a part of the flat portion 14a of the plano-convex lens 14 can also be fixed in a state where it protrudes outward from the surface 12a of the cover member 12.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">When fixing the flat portion 14a of the plano-convex lens 14 to the cover member using a light curing adhesive, it is preferable to cure a light curing adhesive 20 by emitting light 21 from the object side of the lens unit 13 and also emitting light 22 from the side surface of the outer periphery of the plano-convex lens 14 protruding from the end 16a of the lens barrel 16 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>.<br/>
In addition, <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> show a state where the adhesive 20 are not completely cured.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> -->Since the main irradiation light 21 emitted from the object side of the lens unit 13 is emitted to a region including a portion, through which image light passes at the time of actual observation, it is possible to cure most of the adhesive 20.<br/>
In addition, the auxiliary irradiation light 22 emitted from the outer periphery of the plano-convex lens 14 can reliably cure the adhesive 20 of the periphery.<br/>
In particular, when aligning the lens unit 13 with respect to the light receiving section 11a, even if the amount of the adhesive 20 running off the plano-convex lens 14 is increased, it is possible to suppress a situation where the adhesive 20 remains uncured.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Since the plano-convex lens 14 and the cover member 12 allow light to be transmitted therethrough, it is necessary to suppress the influence of emission light (light leakage) emitted laterally or incident light (noise) incident from the side.<br/>
Therefore, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005">FIGS. 4A to 5B</figref>, it is preferable to cover the side surface of the outer periphery of the plano-convex lens 14, which protrudes from the lens barrel 16, and the outer surface of the cover member 12 with a light shielding material 23.<br/>
As the light shielding material 23, a resin, adhesive, and the like in which a colorant, an absorption material, or the like is mixed can be used.<br/>
It is preferable to use a thermosetting resin, in which a black material (powder) such as carbon is dispersed, as the light shielding material 23 since the thermosetting resin is excellent in light shielding and heat resistance.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> show examples in which the inside of an outer cylinder 31, which covers each of the imaging mechanisms 10 and 100, is filled with the light shielding material 23.<br/>

In this case, it is also possible to bond the light shielding material 23 to each of the imaging mechanisms 10 and 100 and then house them in the outer cylinder 31.<br/>
In addition, a space 36 between the outer cylinder 31 and each of the imaging mechanisms 10 and 100 may be a cavity, or the space 36 may be filled with a filling material or sealant, such as resin, so that the outer cylinder 31 is sealed.<br/>
This sealant or filling material may block light or may allow light to be transmitted therethrough.<br/>
The space 36 may also be filled using a resin or adhesive having a fluidity of viscosity of approximately thousands of CPS, and then the resin or adhesive may be solidified or cured.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">When a hard resin is used as the light shielding material 23, sealant, or filling material, heat shrinkage is unlikely to occur.
