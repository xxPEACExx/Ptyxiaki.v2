In other words, the gradient of the falling line when the anode pressure is decreased to the lower limit pressure in the downward transient operation may be changed in accordance with the operation state of the fuel cell system 1.</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">For the above description, the contents of Japanese Patent Application No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2011037675A"><text>2011-37675, filed on February 23, 2011</text></patcit> are hereby incorporated by reference.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56976735" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A fuel cell system for generating electricity by supplying a fuel cell with an anode gas and a cathode gas, the fuel cell system comprising:
