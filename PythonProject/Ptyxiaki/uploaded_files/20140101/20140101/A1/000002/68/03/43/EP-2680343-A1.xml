Also, in addition to the compact use, it is also expected to be used for the automobiles. Under such situation, it is in demand to make the lifetime of the lithium ion secondary battery longer and to have higher capacity, and to further improve the safety.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the lithium ion secondary battery, generally in order to prevent the short circuit between the positive electrode and the negative electrode, polyolefin based organic separator such as polyethylene or polypropylene or so is used. The polyolefin based organic separator has a physical property which dissolves at 200°C or less, thus in case the temperature of the inside of the battery becomes high due to the stimulus from the outside and/or the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> inside; shrinking or melting may occur, which causes to change the volume. As a result, the short circuit of the positive electrode and the negative electrode, and the explosion due to the release of the electrical energy or so may happen.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Hence, in order to solve such problems, conventionally it is proposed to form the porous membrane (hereinafter it may be referred as "porous membrane") which includes non-conductive particle such as in organic particle on the electrodes or the separators.<br/>
For example, Patent document 1 discloses the porous membrane comprising plate shape particles as the insulating fine particles and the binder having the rupture elongation of 300% or more. According to Patent document 1, this porous membrane is arranged in a certain direction, thus it has better safety than using the spherical particles.

As a result of keen examination, the present inventors has found that when the planer shape particle is used as the non-conductive particle, it easily precipitates; hence when the porous membrane is produced using this slurry, the binder localized during the drying step; and as a result the powder fall-off from the obtained porous membrane occured.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Thus, as a result of further keen examination, the present inventors have found that by forming the porous membrane using the slurry for the porous membrane including the non-conductive particle having a specific shape, the binder having specific monomer unit, aqueous polymer having sulfonic acid group and water; the orientation of the non-conductive particle<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> in the porous membrane improves, further the sliding property improves, thus when the porous membrane is wound simultaneously with the electrodes and the separators or so, the powder fall-off is suppressed.

According to the present invention, as shown by Examples 1 to 16, by using the sulfonic acid group as the aqueous polymer, the slurry for the porous membrane excellent in the dispersibility and the storage stability can be obtained. By forming the porous membrane using this slurry for the porous membrane, the orientation or the thermal shrinkage of the porous membrane improves and the powder fall off can be suppressed. Thereby, the high temperature cycle characteristic, the rate characteristic and the safety of the secondary battery comprising the porous membrane can be enhanced.</p><p id="p0246" num="0246">On the other hand, in case the aqueous polymer including the sulfonic acid group is not used (Comparative examples 1 to 4), the storage stability and the dispersibility of the porous membrane slurry deteriorates, and the thermal shrinkage and the powder fall off of the obtained porous membrane deteriorate.
