Especially in a situation where networks of different RAT (radio access technology) coexist, how to utilize different networks to provide services in a more economic way is a hotspot widely discussed in the industry.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Currently, overlapping coverage seen in a plurality of networks of different RAT is usually handled by deactivating a network thereof given that a certain condition is met, thereby reducing the entire energy consumption of the current communication network to achieve energy saving. An example that overlapping coverage occurs between an LTE (Long Term Evolution) network and a GSM (Global System of Mobile communication, Global System of Mobile communication)/UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) network is taken, where the system may, during low traffic hours at night, deactivate all channels of LTE cells, namely, deactivate all service channels and common broadcast control channels, and only retain channels of the GSM network or UMTS network.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, during the implementation of the foregoing process of implementing network energy saving by deactivating a network of a certain format, the inventor finds that the prior art at least has the following problems:<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Although the foregoing solution of deactivating a network of a certain RAT has some effects in the aspect of energy saving in communication networks, the GSM/UMTS network fails to bear high-rate data services; therefore, after the LTE network is deactivated, a high-rate data service, if initiated by a terminal, will fail to be set up because the GSM network fails to bear the high-rate data service, finally degrading user experience.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">Embodiments of the present invention provide a communication method, a network device, and a communication system for a multi-RAT network, which are used to implement network energy saving while ensuring normal running of communication services.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The embodiments of the present invention, to achieve the foregoing purpose, adopt the following technical solutions:</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A communication method for a multi-RAT network is provided, where a network in an overlapping coverage area of the multi-RAT network serves as a basic network, the communication method including:
