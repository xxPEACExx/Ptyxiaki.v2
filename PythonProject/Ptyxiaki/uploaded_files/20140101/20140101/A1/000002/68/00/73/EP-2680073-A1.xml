The organic light emitting layer is sandwiched between the ITO anode, which is thin and transparent, and the metal cathode. When holes from the anode and electrons from the cathode combine in the organic light emitting layer, the organic material in the organic light emitting layer will be excited to emit light. Active matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) display panels are a kind of OLED display panels. Compared to conventional liquid crystal display panels, AMOLED panels have characteristics of faster response speed, higher contrast, wider viewing angle, etc., and have wide application prospective.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A conventional manufacturing process for an OLED display panel may broadly include the following two steps:</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">1.

It is obvious that the described embodiments are just a part but not all of the embodiments of the invention. Based on the described embodiments of the invention, those ordinarily skilled in the art can obtain other embodiment(s), without any inventive work, which should fall within the scope sought for protection by the invention.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In an OLED display panel according to an embodiment of the invention, fabrication of a pixel defining layer is carried out after fabrication of an active array and anodes of pixels is completed and before an organic light emitting layer is formed. The active<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> array comprises switch transistors functioning as switch elements of pixels, driving transistors for driving OLEDs, connecting lines between the switch transistors and the driving transistors, scan lines, data lines, driving lines, etc.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Regarding a conventional pixel defining layer, a specifically designed mask plate is generally used for patterning of the pixel defining layer. However, embodiments of the invention do not need a specialized pixel-defining-layer mask plate. Fabrication of the active array has already been completed prior to fabrication of the pixel defining layer, and the scan lines, the data lines, the driving power lines, etc. have already been formed on a substrate. Such a structure is, for example, the structure as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In the array substrate according to an embodiment of the invention, the scan lines and the data lines are disposed so as to cross each other, for example, the scan lines and the data lines may be disposed perpendicular to each other; the data lines and the driving power lines are usually parallel to each other, and the scan lines and the data lines (or the driving power lines), perpendicular to each other, separate each pixel from each other. According to the embodiment of the invention, these data lines function as a mask plate for the pixel defining layer, with which the pixel defining layer is patterned, so that a specific mask plate and a positioning process are no longer required.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Please referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, a method for manufacturing a pixel defining layer of an organic light emitting diode display panel according to an embodiment of the invention may comprises the following steps.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Step 31, a photoresist layer is coated on a transparent substrate with an active array formed thereon, the active array comprising driving power lines, data lines, scan lines, and a plurality of pixel units which are defined by crossing of the scan lines and the data lines, the pixel units comprising first electrodes which are transparent, wherein the scan lines and at least one kind of lines of the data lines and the driving power lines are opaque.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The photoresist is coated on the surface of the active array on the transparent substrate to cover the active array.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Here, a substrate, such as a glass substrate; a quartz substrate, a plastic substrate or the like, can be used for the transparent substrate. The scan lines are opaque; and the driving power lines and the data lines may be both opaque; alternatively, only one of them<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> is transparent. For example, the driving power lines are opaque while the data lines are transparent; or, the data lines are opaque while the driving power lines are transparent. Regarding the structure shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, for each pixel, the driving power line 105 is closer to the transparent electrode 106a compared to the data line 102b, and thus the driving power line 105 is preferably opaque.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The above scan lines/driving power lines/data lines, which are opaque, can be formed with a lighttight conductive material, such as Mo, Al, Ti, or the like.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">As such, due to existence of the opaque scan lines and the driving power lines and/or data lines, which cross the scan lines and are opaque, a plurality of pixel units can be defined by such crossing. For example, scan lines and data lines, which are perpendicular to each other and are both opaque, cross each other and define a plurality of pixel units.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, each of the pixel units may specifically include a first electrode (for example an ITO anode) 106a which is transparent, and may further include a switch transistor 109, a driving transistor 110 or other transistor device(s). However, in the embodiment of the invention, the specific connection relationship between the switch transistor, the driving transistor, the scan line, the data line and the driving power line is not limited, and may be a known structure (for example the structure shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) or a structure that will be developed in future, therefore its details being omitted here.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Step 32, from the side of the transparent substrate opposed to the photoresist layer, exposure is performed on the photoresist layer, wherein the scan lines and the at least one kind of lines are used as a mask plate to prevent exposure of the photoresist in correspondence with them, so that a photoresist remaining region can be formed with the photoresist layer.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Here, the exposure is conducted from the side of the transparent substrate without the coated photoresist, and thereby the corresponding photoresist is sheltered by utilizing the opaque characteristic of the data lines and the driving power lines (and/or the data lines) so as to avoid it from being exposed. Thus, the photoresist that has not been exposed forms the photoresist remaining region, and the remaining region will be retained after development.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Step 33, a development treatment is conducted on the photoresist layer, so that<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the photoresist outside the photoresist remaining region is removed and the photoresist in the photoresist remaining region is retained to form the pixel defining layer.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Here, through the development treatment, the part of the photoresist which is not sheltered during exposure will be removed and the photoresist layer in the photoresist remaining region will be retained, so that the retained photoresist forms a specific structure of the pixel defining layer.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">As can be seen, in a photolithograph process for forming the pixel defining layer according to the embodiment, the scan lines and the data lines (or the driving power lines) which are opaque are used as a mask plate, so that a specific mask plate is no longer required and moreover a mask positioning process in prior art can be reduced. Thus, it is possible that the producing flow can be greatly simplified, production costs are decreased, and yield of products is increased.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In the embodiments of the invention, the pixel defining layer may be in a one-layered or two-layered structure, and may also be a compound hierarchy structure comprising a plurality of layers. For example, when a two-layered structure is adopted, different hydrophilic materials may be used, and the material close to the first electrode, which is transparent, is transparent. In this case, a method for manufacturing a pixel defining layer of an organic light emitting diode display panel according to an embodiment of the invention may includes the following steps.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Step 41, with a material which is transparent and has hydrophilicity, a hydrophilic material layer is formed on a transparent substrate with an active array formed thereon.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Here, the active array comprises driving power lines, data lines, scan lines, and a plurality of pixel units which are defined by crossing of the scan lines and the data lines, and the pixel units comprises first electrodes which are transparent, wherein the scan lines and at least one kind of lines of the data lines and the driving power lines are opaque. Silicon nitride may be specifically used for the hydrophilic material layer, and therefore the hydrophilic material layer can be obtained by covering a layer of silicon nitride on the surface of the active array of the transparent substrate by way of chemical deposition.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Step 42, a photoresist layer is coated on the hydrophilic material layer.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Step 43, from the side of the transparent substrate opposed to the photoresist layer, exposure is performed on the photoresist layer, wherein the scan lines and the at least one kind of lines are used as a mask plate to prevent exposure of the photoresist in correspondence with them, so that a photoresist remaining region is formed by the photoresist layer.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Step 44, a development treatment is conducted on the photoresist layer, so that the photoresist outside the photoresist remaining region is removed and the photoresist in the photoresist remaining region is retained to form a first pixel defining layer.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Step 45, the hydrophilic material layer outside the photoresist remaining region is removed, and a second pixel defining layer constituted by the remaining hydrophilic material layer is obtained. For example, this step is performed by using wet etching or dry etching with the formed first pixel defining layer as an etching mask.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The resulted pixel defining layer through the above treatments has a two-layered structure, which comprises the first pixel defining layer formed by the photoresist in the photoresist remaining region and further comprises the second pixel defining layer constituted by the remaining hydrophilic material layer, where the first pixel defining layer is located over the second pixel defming layer. Silicon nitride can be used as the material for the second pixel defining layer in the underlying layer, and polyimide can be used as the material for the first pixel defining layer in the upper layer. Silicon nitride is hydrophilic while polyimide is hydrophobic. This structure will be helpful to form a desired thickness distribution for a hole transportation layer, a hole injection layer or a light emitting layer of an organic light emitting device in subsequent procedures.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">After coating of the materials of two layers for the pixel defining layer is completed, an exposure and development treatment is performed in such a way as the above steps 44∼45, and then etching, stripping-off and other process(es) are performed on materials, thereby completing patterning of the double-layered pixel defining layer.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">With the above method according to the embodiment, the pixel defining layer is patterned with the lighttight metal lines in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> (such as scan lines, data lines, driving power lines) as an exposure mask plate.

The pattern constituted by these metal lines and devices, which are opaque, is collectively denoted by 108 in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>. In this example, the pattern 108 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref> is used as a mask plate, and after coating of the materials for the pixel defining layer, exposure is performed from the backside of the substrate. The photoresist over the part of the pattern 108. in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref> is not exposed and will be left on the substrate after development, while those parts that lie outside of the pattern 108 are exposed and the photoresist will be removed after development. In such a way, the pixel defining layer in the same shape as the pattern 108 is formed on the substrate. In the shape of the pattern 108, there is a larger closed space 111 where the first electrode which is transparent is located, and the organic light emitting layer can be formed over the first electrode in the closed space. Thus, the whole area of the first electrode which is transparent can be used for display, and accordingly, the pixel unit can be fully utilized.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Application of the invention to fabrication of organic light emitting diode display panels will be further introduced below.
