In actual application, the higher the frequency band is, the faster the radio wave propagation attenuation will be and the shorter the transmission distance will be. Therefore, in the same coverage area, more base stations are needed to ensure the continuous coverage. However, since the cost of base station is high, this will undoubtedly increase the cost of network layout. In order to solve the problems concerning network layout cost and coverage, various manufacturers and standard organizations begin the research on introducing relay node (RN) into cellular system so as to increase network coverage.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is the diagram of the network architecture of existing LTE-A system after RN is introduced therein. RN accesses core network through donor cell under the DeNB (Donor evolved Node B), but there is no direct wired interface between RN and core network. Each RN can control one or more cells. Under such architecture, the interface between UE (User Equipment) and RN is Uu interface, while that between RN and DeNB is Un interface.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Backhaul link refers to the link between access network and core network. Un interface is a part of the backhaul link, and is a kind of wireless backhaul link. In order to avoid interference, DeNB and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> RN shall discuss with RN on which sub-frames data shall be sent and received. For example, when DeNB sends downlink data to RN on some sub-frames, RN cannot send downlink data to UE on the same sub-frames, or it will cause inner equipment co-frequency interference of RN. When it is determined that sub-frame shall be divided between DeNB and RN, DeNB shall be responsible for completing sub-frame configuration and sending the allocated backhaul sub-frame configuration information to RN through RN reconfiguration process.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Establishing process of X2 is used for configuration data of application layer on interactive X2 interface between the two eNBs to make the two eNBs intercommunicate normally through X2 interface.

described in the background of the present invention, the purpose of introducing relay node (RN) in LTE-A system is to increase network coverage. RN connects DeNB in a wireless mode. The<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> wireless interface between them is called Un interface. However, there is a lack of configuration program of corresponding backhaul link resource in the process of donor cell handover of RN. Based on the above issues, the embodiments of the present invention put forward a method for configuration of backhaul resource in relay scene when DeNB handover occurs due to change of Relay position.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The technical solution put forward in the embodiments of the present invention is to use the existing handover process, through necessary information exchange between target DeNB and source DeNB, to complete the configuration of backhaul sub-frame between RN and target DeNB during the handover process, thereby reducing the influence on RN service of the handover, ensuring service continuity for users as far as possible, and reducing the number of lost packets.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref> is the flow diagram of a resource allocation method put forward by the embodiments of the present invention, which comprises the following steps:
<ul><li>Step S501, when the relay node under the first DeNB needs to be handed over to the second donor station, the second DeNB receives the handover request sent by the first DeNB.<br/>
Wherein, handover request carries the frequency information used for relay node.<br/>
In the specific application scene, there are two methods specifically as below for receiving the aforementioned handover request:
<ul><li>Method I, the second DeNB receives the handover request directly sent by the first DeNB.</li><li>Method II, the second DeNB receives the handover request sent by the MME (Mobility Management Entity) to which the first DeNB belongs.</li></ul>
The difference between the aforementioned two methods is whether to perform corresponding information exchange through MME. Such method selection can be adjusted according to the actual requirement, and the selection of the specific method for sending and receiving the corresponding request will not influence the protection scope of the present invention.<br/>
At the same time, if one of the above methods is selected for receiving handover request, then the information exchanging method in subsequent processing will also be determined, which will be described in detail in the following steps.<br/>
It should be noted that, the frequency information used for relay node and carried in the aforementioned handover request is specifically the frequency information of Uu interface of relay<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> node, which can be acquired through the following method:
<ul><li>The first DeNB can acquire it through the establishing process of X2 interface with relay node; or,</li><li>The first DeNB can acquire it through the configuration update process of base station with relay node; or,</li><li>The first DeNB can acquire it through RRC signaling with relay node.</li></ul>
Which method will be selected for acquiring the aforementioned frequency information will not influence the protection scope of the present invention.<br/>
On the other hand, in order to provide reference for determination of backhaul link resource information of the second DeNB, the following information can be carried in the handover request in this step:
<ul><li>If relay is subject to backhaul link sub-frame limit when it belongs to the first DeNB, the handover request sent by the first DeNB and received by the second DeNB also includes backhaul sub-frame configuration information of the relay node.</li></ul></li><li>Step S502, the second DeNB judges, according to frequency information, whether it is necessary to allocate corresponding backhaul link resource for relay node.<br/>
If the judgment result is yes, step S503 will be executed;<br/>
If the judgment result is no, step S505 will be executed.<br/>
In actual application, the detailed treatment process of this step is that the second DeNB judges whether it is necessary to allocate corresponding backhaul link resource for relay node according to the frequency information used for relay node and that of the target cell to which the relay node needs to be handed over.</li><li>Step S503, the second DeNB allocates corresponding backhaul link resource for relay node, comprising:<br/>
The second DeNB allocates backhaul link resource for relay node according to the backhaul link resource information allocated for relay node by the first DeNB and the corresponding preset rules.<br/>
Wherein, the backhaul link resource allocated for relay node by the first DeNB can be acquired through the following methods:<br/>
The second DeNB acquires, through the received handover request sent by the first DeNB, the backhaul link resource information allocated for relay node by the first DeNB; or,<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> -->The second DeNB acquires, through the received information sent by relay node, the backhaul link resource information allocated for relay node by the first DeNB.

Wherein, there are two methods as below for configuring the allocated backhaul link resource information:
<ul><li>Method A, complete configuration.<br/>
The second DeNB configures the complete information of backhaul link resource allocated for relay node to relay node.</li><li>Method B, increment configuration.<br/>

In the aforementioned step S504 and step S505, there are two methods as below for configuring corresponding configuration information to relay node:
<ul><li>Configuration method I, configure directly to relay node.<br/>
After the completion of donor cell handover of relay node, the second DeNB configures the backhaul link resource information allocated for relay node to relay node through a reconfiguration process or notifies relay node of the indication information that indicates it is unnecessary to allocate backhaul link resource information.</li><li>Configuration method II, forward the configuration information through a DeNB.<br/>
The second DeNB carries the backhaul link resource information allocated for relay node in handover command and returns the information to the first DeNB, and the first DeNB configures the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> backhaul link resource information to relay node.<br/>
Which configuration method will be adopted will not influence the protection scope of the present invention.</li></ul>
It should be further noted that when configuration II is adopted, for the difference of the methods for receiving handover request in corresponding step S501, there are two kinds of return processes as below for corresponding information in step S504 and Step S505:
<ul><li>Method I, it corresponds to method I in step S501, which is to communicate with the first DeNB directly.<br/>
The second DeNB carries the backhaul link resource information allocated for relay node (corresponding to step S504), or the indication information (corresponding to step S505) that it is unnecessary to allocate backhaul link resource, in handover command, and returns them to the first DeNB directly.</li><li>Methods II, it corresponds to method II in step S501, which is to forward corresponding communication information to the first DeNB through corresponding MME.<br/>
The second DeNB carries the backhaul link resource information allocated for relay node, or the indication information that indicates it is unnecessary to allocate backhaul link resource, in handover command, and sends them to the MME to which the second DeNB belongs;</li></ul>
The MME to which the second DeNB belongs forwards the handover command to the MME to which the first DeNB belongs;<br/>
The MME to which the first DeNB belongs forwards the handover command to the first DeNB. Compared with the prior art, the technical solution put forward by the embodiments of the present invention at least has the following advantages:<br/>
By use of the technical solution provided in the embodiments of the present invention, when a donor cell handover of a relay node occurs, the target DeNB allocates through information exchange between itself and a source DeNB, and according to corresponding frequency information, a corresponding backhaul link resource to the relay node, this allows completion of sub-frame configuration of the backhaul link during the handover process, thereby reducing the influence on normal services of the relay node, ensuring service continuity for users accessing a network through the relay node, and reducing the number of lost packets during a transmission process, thus providing<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> a better network experience to users.<br/>
According to the technical ideas of the technical solution put forward by the embodiments of the present invention, when a donor cell handover of a RN occurs, the target DeNB determines whether it is necessary to allocate resource for this RN, and the detailed processing ideas are as follows.<br/>
Source DeNB sends the frequency information of Uu interface of RN to target DeNB, and the target DeNB judges whether it is necessary to allocate special sub-frame used for Uu interface to RN according to the frequency information of RN Uu interface and that of target cell. If it is necessary, target DeNB allocates corresponding sub-frame for RN, and sends the new sub-frame configuration to RN in handover command, or sends the new sub-frame configuration to RN through RN reconfiguration process after completion of the handover.<br/>
The technical solution put forward by the embodiments of the present invention is explained in a detailed way with reference to the specific application scene in the present invention. Implementation scene I<br/>
<figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref> is the flow diagram of a resource allocation method in implementation scene I put forward by the embodiments of the present invention, which comprises the following steps in detail:</li><li>Step S601, source DeNB acquires frequency information of RN.<br/>
Before the handover, if RN has established X2 interface with source DeNB, or the eNB configuration update process has been carried out between RN and source DeNB, or RRC process has been carried out between RN and source DeNB, source DeNB can acquire the frequency used for Uu interface of RN.</li><li>Step S602, source DeNB determines to hand over RN.</li><li>Step S603, source DeNB sends handover request to target DeNB.<br/>
When source DeNB sends handover request to target DeNB, it sends the frequency information of Uu interface of RN to the target DeNB.<br/>
If RN has backhaul sub-frame limit in source DeNB, source DeNB can send the sub-frame configuration information of RN to target DeNB in handover request message, such as putting the sub-frame configuration information in handover preparation information.<br/>
Certainly, the aforementioned sub-frame configuration information of RN may not be carried, but through other processes, or the aforementioned sub-frame configuration information of RN are not<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> fed back to target DeNB, and such changes will not influence the protection scope of the present invention.</li><li>Step S604, after receiving the handover request, target DeNB determines whether to allocate backhaul sub-frame for RN according to information like the selected frequency of target cell, Uu interface frequency of RN, etc.<br/>
If target cell and RN have different Uu interface bands, it will be unnecessary to allocate backhaul sub-frame for RN. Otherwise, it is necessary to allocate backhaul sub-frame for RN.</li><li>Step S605, target DeNB sends handover command to RN through source DeNB, namely, RRC connection reconfiguration message.<br/>
If the target DeNB allocates backhaul sub-frame for RN, these backhaul sub-frame configuration information can be put in RRC connection reconfiguration message and sent to RN.<br/>
If target DeNB receives the original sub-frame configuration information of RN in handover request message, it can refer to the sub-frame configuration information of RN for determination of the new sub-frame configuration; for example, it can adopt the same sub-frame configuration and send it to RN.<br/>
When target DeNB allocates sub-frame configuration for RN, it can send the complete sub-frame configuration information to RN, and it also can send only the changed information to RN, viz. increment configuration. If the increment configuration is adopted, when target DeNB determines that resource partitioning is unnecessary, DeNB needs to give an instruction to RN, or RN will mistake that sub-frame configuration information dose not change.<br/>
When the complete configuration method is adopted in step S605, if the RRC connection reconfiguration message received by RN includes backhaul sub-frame configuration information, the new sub-frame configuration information will be used. Otherwise, RN will not be limited by sub-frame at Un interface.<br/>
When the increment configuration method is adopted in step S605, if the RRC connection reconfiguration message received by RN includes backhaul sub-frame configuration information, the existing sub-frame configuration information will be updated. If DeNB instructs that resource partitioning is unnecessary, RN will not be limited by sub-frame at Un interface.<br/>
Processing flows of step S606 to step S614 are existing process programs, hereby, they will not be<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> described again.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0006">Implementation scene II</heading><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 7</figref> is the flow diagram of a resource allocation method in implementation scene II put forward by the embodiments of the present invention, which comprises the following steps in detail:

In actual application scene, before this step, RN also can send corresponding sub-frame configuration information to target DeNB in the RRC connection reconfiguration completion message in this step. Changes of the feedback time of the specific sub-frame configuration information will not influence the protection scope of the present invention.<br/>
In step S704, if target DeNB determines to allocate backhaul sub-frame for RN, step S707 will be executed.</li><li>Step S707, after RN accesses target DeNB, target DeNB initiates reconfiguration process of RN, puts new sub-frame configuration information in the RN reconfiguration message and sends them to RN.<br/>
If target DeNB receives the original sub-frame configuration information of RN in handover request message or in RRC connection reconfiguration completion message, it can refer to the sub-frame configuration information of RN for determination of the new sub-frame configuration. For example, it can adopt the same sub-frame configuration and send it to RN.<br/>
When target DeNB allocate sub-frame configuration for RN, it can send the complete sub-frame configuration information to RN, and it also can send only the changed configuration information to RN, viz. increment configuration. If increment configuration is adopted, when target DeNB determines that resource partitioning is unnecessary, target DeNB needs to give an instruction to RN, or RN will mistake that sub-frame configuration information dose not change.</li><li>Step S708, after receiving RN reconfiguration message, RN applies the new sub-frame configuration<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> information, and returns the message of RN reconfiguration completion to target DeNB.<br/>
Processing flows of step S709 to step S714 are existing process programs, hereby, they will not be described again.<br/>
It should be noted that, there is no strict chronological order for RN reconfiguration process in the aforementioned step S707 and step S708 and for the processing of step S709. Such changes of the order will not influence the prevention scope of the present invention.<br/>
Compared with implementation scene I, in the technical solution of implementation scene II, when RN returns the message of RRC connection reconfiguration completion to target DeNB (viz. step S706), since target DeNB does not configure new backhaul sub-frame information for RN, RN may not be subject to the limit of backhaul sub-frame.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0007">Implementation scene III</heading><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 8</figref> is the flow diagram of a resource allocation method in implementation scene III put forward by the embodiments of the present invention, which comprises the following steps in detail:

Wherein, if it is determined in step S806 that it is necessary to allocate backhaul sub-frame for RN, target DeNB will allocate backhaul sub-frame for RN, and put these backhaul sub-frame configuration information in the information forwarded from step S807 to step S809 and send them to source DeNB, and finally source DeNB will carry these backhaul sub-frame configuration information in RRC connection reconfiguration message and send them to RN (and step S810).
