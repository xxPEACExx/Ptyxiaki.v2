Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method used in a wireless communication system and related communication device, and more particularly, to a method of handling collisions among channel state information (CSI) reports in a wireless communication system and related communication device.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A long-term evolution (LTE) system, initiated by the third generation partnership project (3GPP), is now being regarded as a new radio interface and radio network architecture that provides a high data rate, low latency, packet optimization, and improved system capacity and coverage. In the LTE system, a radio access network known as an evolved universal terrestrial radio access network (E-UTRAN) includes a plurality of evolved Node-Bs (eNBs) for communicating with a plurality of user equipments (UEs) and communicates with a core network including a mobility management entity (MME), serving gateway, etc for NAS (Non Access Stratum) control.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">An LTE-advanced (LTE-A) system, as its name implies, is an evolution of the LTE system. The LTE-A system targets faster switching between power states, improves performance at the coverage edge of an eNB, and includes advanced techniques, such as carrier aggregation (CA), coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission/reception, uplink (UL) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), etc. For a UE and an eNB to communicate with each other in the LTE-A system, the UE and the eNB must support standards developed for the LTE-A system, such as the 3GPP Rel-10 standard or later versions.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the LTE system, channel state information (CSI) is needed at transmission points (TPs) for realizing adaptive transmissions. The UE is required to measure channel conditions and transmit corresponding CSI reports to the TPs on a physical uplink control channel (PUCCH). Collision of CSI reports may occur when multiple CSI reports have to be reported at a reporting instance.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the prior art, if a CSI report with PUCCH reporting type 3, 5, or 6 of one serving cell collides with a CSI report with PUCCH reporting type 1, 1a, 2, 2a, 2b, 2c, or 4 of the same serving cell, the latter CSI report with PUCCH reporting type 1, 1a, 2, 2a, 2b, 2c, or 4 has lower priority and may be dropped.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">If the UE is configured with more than one serving cell (e.g., the UE and the eNB support CA), the UE transmits a CSI report of only one serving cell in any given subframe. For a given subframe, if a CSI report with PUCCH reporting type 3, 5, 6, or 2a of one serving cell collides with a CSI report with PUCCH reporting type 1, 1a, 2, 2b, 2c, or 4 of another serving cell, the latter CSI with PUCCH reporting type 1, 1a, 2, 2b, 2c, or 4 has lower priority and may be dropped. For a given subframe, if a CSI report with PUCCH reporting type 2, 2b, 2c, or 4 of one serving cell collides with a CSI report with PUCCH reporting type 1 or 1a of another serving cell, the latter CSI report with PUCCH reporting type 1, or 1a has lower priority and may be dropped.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">For a given subframe, if collision among CSI reports of different serving cells with PUCCH reporting type of the same priority occurs, the CSI of the serving cell with lowest serving cell index is reported, and CSI of all other serving cells are dropped.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In other words, when collision of CSI reports occurs, CSI reports with PUCCH reporting type 3, 5, 6, or 2a have higher priority than CSI reports with PUCCH reporting type 2, 2b, 2c, or 4, and CSI reports with PUCCH reporting type 2, 2b, 2c, or 4 have higher priority than CSI reports with PUCCH reporting type 1, or 1a. If CSI reports of different cells have the same priority, the CSI report for the serving cell<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> having the lowest serving cell index is selected. In short, only PUCCH reporting type and serving cell index are considered for prioritizing CSI reports in the collision handling method of the prior art.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">For a wireless communication system supporting CoMP transmission/reception, a cell may correspond to multiple TPs. In case of collision among CSI reports of different TPs corresponding to the same serving cells with PUCCH reporting type of the same priority, the priorities of the CSI reports may be the same according to the prior art. Since the benefit of the CoMP technology originates from coordination among TPs, it is inappropriate to follow the conventional method to set priorities of CSI reports in the CoMP technology. Thus, solving collisions among CSI reports while maintaining the benefit of the CoMP technology is a topic to be addressed and discussed.</p><heading id="h0004">Summary of the Invention</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention therefore provides a method and related communication device for handling collisions among channel state information (CSI) reports while taking into account of coordination among transmission points (TPs).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention discloses a method of handling collisions among CSI reports for a user equipment in a wireless communication system supporting a technology of coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission/reception. The method includes separating a plurality of CSI reports into report sets according to channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS) resources; determining priorities of the report sets; and transmitting a CSI report having a superior priority among the plurality of CSI reports to a network of the wireless communication system according to the priorities when the plurality of CSI reports have to be reported at a reporting instance.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present invention further discloses a method of handling collisions among CSI reports for a user equipment in a wireless communication system supporting a technology of CoMP transmission/reception. The method includes separating a plurality of CSI reports into report groups according to non-zero power (NZP) CSI-RS resources; determining first priorities of the report groups; separating a plurality of CSI reports in each of the report groups into report sets according to CSI-RS resources for interference measurement; determining second priorities of the report sets in each of the report groups; and transmitting a CSI report among the plurality of CSI reports to a network of the wireless communication system according to the first priorities and the second priorities when the plurality of CSI reports have to be reported at a reporting instance.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present invention further discloses a communication apparatus for handling collisions among CSI reports in a wireless communication system supporting a technology of CoMP transmission/reception. The communication apparatus includes a processing means, a storage unit, and a program code. The program code is stored in the storage unit to instruct the processing means to execute the following steps: separating a plurality of CSI reports into report sets according to CSI-RS resources; determining priorities of the report sets; and transmitting a CSI report having a superior priority among the plurality of CSI reports to a network of the wireless communication system according to the priorities when the plurality of CSI reports have to be reported at a reporting instance.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">These and other objectives of the present invention will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment that is illustrated in the various figures and drawings.</p><heading id="h0005">Brief Description of the Drawings</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of a wireless communication system according to an example of the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram of a communication device according to an example of the present invention.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart of a process according to an example of the present invention.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart of a process according to an example of the present invention.</p><heading id="h0006">Detailed Description</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">Please refer to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, which is a schematic diagram of a wireless communication system 10 according to an example of the present invention. The wireless communication system 10 is briefly composed of two cells (i.e. base stations) CEL1-CEL2 and a user equipment UE1. The cell CEL1 corresponds to transmission points TP1-TP3, and the cell CEL2 corresponds to transmission points TP4-TP5, wherein each of the transmission points TP1-TP5 can perform data transmissions and receptions with the user equipment UE1. The wireless communication system 10 may be a wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) system such as a universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS). Alternatively, the wireless communication system 10 may be an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system and/or an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system, such as a long term evolution (LTE) system, an LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) system or a successor of the LTE-A system.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The user equipment UE1, cells CEL1-CEL2 and the transmission points TP1-TP5 associated with the cells CEL1-CEL2 are simply utilized for illustrating a structure of the wireless communication system 10. Practically, the transmission points TP1-TP5 can be referred as NodeBs (NBs) in a universal terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN) of the UMTS. Alternatively, the transmission points TP1-TP5 can be evolved NodeBs (eNBs), relay nodes and/or remote radio heads (RRHs) in an evolved UTRAN (E-UTRAN) of the LTE system or the LTE-A system, and are not limited herein. The user equipment UE1 can be mobile devices such as mobile phones, laptops, tablet computers, electronic books, and portable computer<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> systems. In addition, a transmission point and the user equipment UE1 can be seen as a transmitter or a receiver according to transmission direction, e.g., for an uplink (UL), the user equipment UE1 is the transmitter and the transmission point is the receiver, and for a downlink (DL), the transmission point is the transmitter and the user equipment UE1 is the receiver.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Moreover, the wireless communication system 10 can be seen as a multi-point cooperative network composed of multiple transmission points. That is, the UE may transmit a signal (e.g., a packet) to a first set of the transmission points TP1-TP5, and the UE may receive signals transmitted by a second set of the transmission points TP1-TP5, wherein the first set and the second set may be the same or different. As a result, signal quality of the signals is improved. For example, when the wireless communication system 10 is referred to the LTE-A system, it means that the wireless communication system 10 supports coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission/reception. The CoMP can be configured as Joint Processing (JP) (e.g., joint transmission (JT) or dynamic point selection) or Coordinated Scheduling/Beamforming (CS/CB), and is not limited. Further, without loss of generality, the transmission point TP1 can be seen as a serving TP for the user equipment UE1, wherein link quality between the transmission point TP1 and the user equipment UE1 is better than link qualities between other transmission points and the user equipment UE1.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Please refer to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, which is a schematic diagram of a communication device 20 according to an example of the present invention. The communication device 20 can be the user equipment UE1 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, but is not limited herein. The communication device 20 may include a processing means 200 such as a microprocessor or Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), a storage unit 210 and a communication interfacing unit 220. The storage unit 210 may be any data storage device that can store a program code 212, accessed and executed by the processing means 200. Examples of the storage unit 210 include but are not limited to a subscriber identity module (SIM), read-only memory (ROM), flash memory, random-access memory (RAM), CD-ROM/DVD-ROM, magnetic tape, hard disk and<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> optical data storage device. The communication interfacing unit 220 is preferably a transceiver and is used to transmit and receive signals (e.g., messages or packets) according to processing results of the processing means 200.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Please refer to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, which is a flowchart of a process 30 according to an example of the present invention. The process 30 can be utilized in the user equipment UE1 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, for handling collisions among channel state information (CSI) reports in the wireless communication system 10 supporting a technology of coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission/reception. The process 30 may be compiled into the program code 212 and includes the following steps:</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Step 300: Start.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Step 302: Separate a plurality of CSI reports into report sets according to channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS) resources.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Step 304: Determine priorities of the report sets.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Step 306: Transmit a CSI report having a superior priority among the plurality of CSI reports to a network of the wireless communication system 10 according to the priorities when the plurality of CSI reports have to be reported at a reporting instance.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Step 308: End.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">According to the process 30, the user equipment UE1 may first separate a plurality of CSI reports into report sets according to CSI-RS resources. Then, the user equipment UE1 may prioritize the report sets so as to transmit a CSI report having a superior priority among the plurality of CSI reports to the network when the plurality of CSI reports have to be reported at a reporting instance (i.e., in the same subframe).</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In detail, each CSI report is associated with a non-zero power (NZP) CSI-RS resource which is assigned to a transmission point. In addition, each CSI report is derived under one interference hypothesis corresponding to CSI-RS resources for interference measurement. Therefore, CSI reports with the same NZP CSI-RS and the same interference hypothesis may be grouped as a report set. When CSI reports<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> belonging to different report sets have to be reported in the same reporting instance, priorities for transmitting these CSI reports may be given by determining the priorities of the report sets. Thus, transmitting CSI reports according to the priorities of report sets may solve collisions among CSI reports while considering conditions of the transmission point and interference from other transmission points, and thereby taking coordination among transmission points TP1-TP5 into account.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Note that, the process 30 is an example of the present invention. Those skilled in the art should readily make combinations, modifications and/or alterations accordingly. In an embodiment, the priorities of the report sets may be determined based on channel qualities among transmission points TP1-TP5. For example, report sets corresponding to a transmission point with higher channel quality may be given higher priorities. The channel qualities of the transmission points TP1-TP5 may be indicated by channel quality indicators (CQIs), reference signal received power (RSRP), or reference signal received quality (RSRQ).</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In another embodiment, the priorities of the report sets may be determined by a transmission scheme. As mentioned previously, a report set is associated with an NZP CSI-RS resource and an interference hypothesis. That is, each report set is corresponded to a transmission scheme. Therefore, the user equipment UE1 may adjust the priorities of the report sets by upgrading a priority for a report set corresponding to a current transmission scheme. For example, the priority of the report set corresponding to the current transmission scheme may be adjusted to a higher priority. In such a condition, the priorities of report sets corresponding to other transmission schemes may remain unadjusted or may be adjusted according to the channel qualities.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In addition, the priorities of the report sets may be determined according to indexes of the report sets. The report sets may be indexed by the NZP CSI-RS resource and CSI-RS resources used to measure interference. More specifically, each CSI-RS resource is designated with a configuration index, and an index of a report<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> set may be derived by an arithmetic combination of the configuration index of the NZP CSI-RS resource with configuration indexes of the CSI-RS resources used for interference measurement. In such a situation, report sets with larger index may be given, for example, higher priority.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In the above embodiments, the CSI reports are transmitted according to the priorities of the report sets, and the report sets are determined by considering NZP CSI-RS resources and CSI-RS resources for interference measurement simultaneously. In other embodiments, the CSI reports may be transmitted by considering NZP CSI-RS resources first and then CSI-RS resources for interference measurement. For example, please refer to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, which is a flowchart of a process 40 according to an example of the present invention. The process 40 can be utilized in the user equipment UE1 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, for handling collisions among channel state information (CSI) reports in the wireless communication system 10 supporting a technology of coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission/reception. The process 40 may be compiled into the program code 212 and indudes the following steps:</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Step 400: Start.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Step 402: Separate a plurality of CSI reports into report groups according to non-zero power (NZP) channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS) resources.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Step 404: Determine first priorities of the report groups.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Step 406: Separate a plurality of CSI reports in each of the report groups into report sets according to CSI-RS resources for interference measurement.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Step 408: Determine second priorities of the report sets in each of the report groups.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Step 410: Transmit a CSI report among the plurality of CSI reports to a network of the wireless communication system 10 according to the first priorities and the second priorities when the plurality of CSI reports have to be reported at a reporting instance.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Step 412: End.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0042" num="0042">According to the process 40, the user equipment UE1 may separate a plurality of CSI reports into report groups according to NZP CSI-RS resources (i.e. transmission points), and determine priorities of the report groups. Then, the user equipment UE1 may further separate the CSI reports in each of the report groups into report sets according to CSI-RS resources for interference measurement (i.e. interference hypotheses), and determine priorities of the report sets. As a result, when the plurality of CSI reports have to be reported at a reporting instance (i.e. in the same subframe), the user equipment UE1 may consider the priorities of the report groups first and then consider the priorities of the report sets, so as to transmit a CSI report to the network.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Implementation of the process 40 is not limited. For example, in an embodiment, the priorities of the report groups may be determined according to fairness among transmission points TP1-TP5. For example, the priorities of the report groups may be determined according to a historical record of the user equipment UE1. The historical record may list an amount of CSI report transmissions for each of the report groups (i.e. for each of the transmission points TP1-TP5). Therefore, the report group which has been reported more times in the historical record has lower priority.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In another embodiment, the priorities of the report groups with CSI reports having better channel quality are given higher priority. The channel quality may be determined through channel measurement indexes such as CQI, RSRP or RSRQ.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Furthermore, a report group of a serving TP may be given higher priority. For example, the user equipment UE1 may adjust the priorities of the report groups by upgrading a priority for a report group corresponding to a serving transmission point. The priorities for other report groups may remain unadjusted. Alternatively, the priorities for other report groups may be given the same priority or adjusted according to the channel qualities or the fairness among transmission point as abovementioned embodiments.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0046" num="0046">After determining the priorities of the report groups, the report sets in the same report group may be prioritized according to the channel qualities and/or the transmission scheme. Namely, the report set with higher channel quality is given higher priority, which may be determined through channel measurement indexes such as CQI, RSRP or RSRQ. Alternatively, the report set corresponds to the current transmission scheme is given higher priority.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Note that, detail of a CSI report mentioned above is not limited. For example, the CSI report may include one or more fields which include a Channel Quality Indicator (CQI), a Precoding Matrix Index (PMI), a Rank Indicator (RI) and/or a Precoder Type Indicator (PTI).</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In addition, when CSI reports in the same report set have to be reported in the same instance (i.e. in the same subframe), the collision may be solved by further considering the PUCCH reporting type of the CSI reports. For example, a CSI report with PUCCH reporting type 3, 5, or 6 in a report set is given higher priority than a CSI report with PUCCH reporting type 1, 1a, 2, 2a, 2b, 2c, or 4 in the same report set.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In addition, if multiplexing multiple CSI reports in one reporting instance is not allowed in the wireless communication system 10, the user equipment UE1 may select the CSI report with the highest priority to transmit to the network. If multiplexing multiple CSI reports is supported in the wireless communication system 10, the user equipment UE1 may multiplex and then transmit the CSI reports according to the corresponding priorities.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Those skilled in the art should readily make combinations, modifications and/or alterations on the abovementioned description and examples. The abovementioned steps of the processes 30, 40 including suggested steps may be realized by means of a hardware, a firmware known as a combination of a hardware device and computer instructions and data that reside as read-only software on the hardware device, or an electronic system.

The method may consider fairness, channel qualities, transmission schemes, and the serving transmission point among transmission points in a wireless communication system. Thus, collisions among CSI reports may be solved and coordination among transmission points may be taken into account as well, which is especially suitable for a wireless communication system supporting a technology of CoMP transmission/reception.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Those skilled in the art will readily observe that numerous modifications and alterations of the device and method may be made while retaining the teachings of the invention.
