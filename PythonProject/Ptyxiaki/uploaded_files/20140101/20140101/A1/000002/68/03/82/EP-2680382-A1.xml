In various solutions, it may be necessary to provide a protection, for example against the infiltration of dust and water (IP6x protection).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For this purpose, it is possible to use a sleeve with a gland to be inserted into the hole prior to passing the cable through it. This solution requires additional operations during the assembly (for example, in the case of LED lighting sources, during the assembly of the LED modules). In addition, a large part of the sleeve can protrude outside of the housing, which makes bending the cable difficult right at the exit from the housing and limits the overall flexibility of application of the module in the framework of lighting sources (luminaire). In various solutions, it can then be necessary to screw in a fixing screw operating on the internal side of the housing, in a place where there is normally not much space available.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Other solutions may include the use of a water-tight seal or grommet made of rubber or of supple elastomer and designed to be inserted into the hole prior to inserting the cable. These solutions can have drawbacks such as the insufficient retaining action on the cable, with the consequent requirement for providing auxiliary retaining systems (for example clamps with screws) inside the housing, with a consequent increase in the complexity of the assembly operation and of the costs.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The possibility then exists of using through connectors, capable of providing the protection against dust and water and comprising complementary elements designed to be assembled together, which may give rise to rather bulky solutions.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Within the application context considered here by way of example, it is desirable for the assembly operations to be reduced to a minimum, while conserving the possibility of bending the electrical cable also immediately at the exit of the hole passing through the housing. It can thus be desirable for the operations relating to the passage of the cable to be, at least for the most part, carried out from the outside of the electrical equipment given that the space available inside the housing may be somewhat limited.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>Purpose and summary</u></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">Thus, there is a need to find solutions able to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks and various embodiments aim to provide a response to such a need.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In various embodiments, such a goal can be achieved thanks to a method having the features claimed specifically in the claims that follow. The invention also relates to a device for the implementation of the method.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The claims form an integral part of the technical teachings presented here in relation to the invention.</p><heading id="h0005"><u>Brief description of the figures</u></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><p id="p0011" num="0011">Various embodiments will now be described, purely by way of non-limiting example, with reference to the appended figures, in which:

It will be appreciated that such a representation is here given purely by way of example and for simplicity of illustration: the housing P in which the hole H is present may, in reality, have any given configuration and structure.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In various embodiments, the cable C can be passed through the hole H in such a manner as to form sealing conditions, for example against dust and water (IP6x protection, for example).</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In various embodiments, the diameter dimensions of the hole H could correspond to the diameter dimensions of the cable C so as to form a passage condition that, on the one hand, does not end up being excessively slack (with the risk of allowing the undesirable passage, for example, of dust and/or fluids through the hole H notwithstanding the presence of the cable C) and, on the other hand, does not end up being too tight (with the risk of giving rise to undesirable phenomena from crushing of the cable C).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In various embodiments, a device may be fitted around the cable C, indicated overall with 10 and comprising two parts (illustrated separately in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 2</figref>), as follows:

<ul><li>reduction of the assembly operations, virtually reconcilable to a single operation,</li><li>simplification of the activity associated with the process of production (for example of LED modules): for example, it is possible to avoid carrying out screwing operations with a tool inside the housing,</li><li>reduction of the solicitations, in particular on the cable, in as much as it is possible to carry out an action for retaining the cable against its extraction without having to dispose of a retaining element, for example a clamp, inside the housing,</li><li>reduction of the part of the device situated outside of the housing, which allows, for example, the cable C to be bent by 90° immediately at the exit of the housing,<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></li><li>removal of the device that restrains the cable in the hole is only permitted to those disposing of a suitable tool, which improves the characteristics of safety and of reliability of the equipment with which the device is associated.</li></ul></p><p id="p0045" num="0045">It goes without saying that, still keeping to the principle of the invention, the particulars of implementation and the embodiments could vary, even significantly, with respect to that illustrated here purely by way of non-limiting example, without however straying from the scope of protection of the invention; such a scope of protection is defined in the appended claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56976708" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A method for passing an electrical cable (C) through a hole (H) in a housing (P) of a unit of electrical equipment, the method comprising:
