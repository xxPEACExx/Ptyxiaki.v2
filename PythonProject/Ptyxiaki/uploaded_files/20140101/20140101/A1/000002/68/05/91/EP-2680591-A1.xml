In this case, there is a problem of a reproduction characteristic of a high-frequency image signal, and there is an issue in which it is important that high-resolution is achieved by expanding a reproduction band while suppressing occurrence of color moire (false color) because, in the color imaging device, aliasing is easily generated in a captured image as compared with a monochrome imaging device.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In a primary color system Bayer array that is a color array that is widely used in the single-panel color imaging device, because green (G) pixels are arranged in a checkered pattern, and red (R) pixels and blue (B) pixels are arranged line-sequentially, there is a problem of reproduction accuracy when a high frequency signal is generated in the diagonal directions for the G signal and reproduction accuracy when a high frequency signal is generated in the horizontal and vertical directions for the R and B signals.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In a case in which a monochrome vertical stripe pattern (high frequency image) as illustrated in (A) portion of <figref idrefs="f0017">Figure 22</figref> enters an imaging device of a Bayer array illustrated in (B) portion of <figref idrefs="f0017">Figure 22</figref>, when the entered pattern is allocated to a Bayer color array and compared for each color, as illustrated in (C) to (E) portions of <figref idrefs="f0017">Figure 22</figref>, a color image of R in light flat, a color image of B in dark flat, and a color image of G in light/dark mosaic are generated, and the original monochrome image in which there is no<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> concentration difference (level difference) between R, G, and B becomes in a state of being colored depending on a color array and an input frequency.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Similarly, in a case in which a diagonal monochrome high frequency image as illustrated in (A) portion of <figref idrefs="f0018">Figure 23</figref> enters an imaging device of a Bayer array illustrated in (B) portion of <figref idrefs="f0018">Figure 23</figref>, when the entered pattern is allocated to a Bayer color array and compared for each color, as illustrated in (C) to (E) portions of <figref idrefs="f0018">Figure 23</figref>, color images of R and B in light flat and a color image of G in dark flat are generated, and when it is assumed that a black value is 0 and a white value is 255, the diagonal monochrome high frequency image becomes in green because only G becomes 255. As described above, in the Bayer array, the diagonal high frequency image cannot be reproduced appropriately.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Generally, in an imaging apparatus that uses a single-panel type color imaging device, an optical low pass filter that is constituted by a birefringence material such as crystal is arranged in the front of the color imaging device, and a high frequency is avoided so as to be optically reduced. However, in this method, coloring by the folding of the high frequency signal can be reduced, but there is a problem that the resolution is reduced due to the adverse effect.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In order to solve such a problem, a color imaging device has been proposed in which a color filter array of the color imaging device is a three-colors random array that satisfies an array restriction condition in which a given focused pixel is adjacent to any of three colors including a color of the focused pixel or the four sides of the focused pixel (PTL 1).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In addition, an image sensor of a color filter array has been proposed that includes a plurality of filters having different spectral sensitivities, and in which a first filter and a second filter out of the filters are alternately arranged in one diagonal direction of a pixel grid of the image sensor in a first certain cycle and are alternately arranged in the other diagonal direction in a second certain cycle (PTL 2).</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In addition, a color array has been proposed in which, in a color solid imaging device of three primary colors of R, G, and B, appearance probabilities of R, G, and B are equalized and a given straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal straight line) on an imaging surface passes through all of the colors by arranging sets of 3 pixels in which<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> R, G, and B are horizontally arranged so that the sets are shifted in a zig-zag manner vertically (PTL 3).</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In addition, a color imaging device has been proposed in which R and B out of three primary colors of R, G, and B are arranged in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction in every three pixels, and G is arranged between R and B (PTL 4).</p><heading id="h0003">{Citation List}</heading><heading id="h0004">{Patent Literature}</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011"><ul><li>{PTL 1} Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004308080A"><text>2004-308080</text></patcit></li><li>{PTL 2} Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2005136766A"><text>2005-136766</text></patcit></li><li>{PTL 3} Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP11285012A"><text>11-285012</text></patcit></li><li>{PTL 4} Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP8023543A"><text>8-23543</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">{Summary of Invention}</heading><heading id="h0006">{Technical Problem}</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The color imaging device discussed in PTL 1 has a random filter array, and in the color imaging device, it is necessary that optimization is performed for each random pattern when subsequent synchronization (interpolation) processing is executed, so that there is a problem that the synchronization processing becomes complicated. In addition, the random array is effective in low-frequency color moire, and is not effective in a false color of a high frequency part.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In addition, in the image sensor discussed in PTL 2, the G pixels (brightness pixels) are arranged in the checkered pattern, so that there is a problem that pixel reproduction accuracy in a limit resolution area (particularly, in the diagonal directions) is not excellent.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the color solid imaging device discussed in PTL 3, there is an advantage that occurrence of a false color can be suppressed because filters for all of the colors exist on the given straight line, however, there is a problem that the high frequency reproducibility is reduced as compared with a Bayer array because ratios of the number of pixels of R, the number of pixels of G, and the number of pixels of B are equal. Note that in the case of the Bayer array, a ratio of the number of G pixels that help most to<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> obtain a brightness signal is twice as great as each ratio of the number of R pixels and the number of B pixels.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">On the other hand, the color imaging device discussed in PTL 4 is not effective in a false color of a high frequency part in the horizontal or vertical direction because a ratio of the number of G pixels to each ratio of the number of R pixels and the number of B pixels is higher than that of the Bayer array, and a line of only G pixels exists in the horizontal or vertical direction.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The present invention is made in view of these circumstances, and an object of the present invention is to provide a color imaging device that can reduce occurrence of a false color, achieves high resolution, and simplify subsequent processing as compared with a conventional random array.</p><heading id="h0007">{Solution to Problem}</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">In order to attain the object, a color imaging device according to an aspect of the present invention is a single-panel type color imaging device in which a color filter of a certain color filter array is disposed on a plurality of pixels that are constituted by photoelectric conversion devices that are arranged in a horizontal direction and a vertical direction, and in the color imaging device, the color filter array includes a basic array pattern of NxN (N: odd number of 3 or more), in which a first filter that corresponds to a first color that contributes most to obtaining a brightness signal and second filters that correspond to two or more second colors other than the first color are arranged, and the basic array pattern is repeatedly arranged in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction, the first filter is arranged on two diagonal lines in the basic array pattern, and a ratio of the number of pixels of the first color that correspond to the first filter is greater than a ratio of the number of pixels of each of the second colors that correspond to the second filters.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the color imaging device according to the aspect of the present invention, the basic array pattern of NxN (N: odd number of 3 or more), in which the first filter that corresponds to the first color that contributes most to obtaining a brightness signal and the second filters that correspond to the two or more second colors other than the first color are arranged is repeatedly arranged in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction. As a result, subsequent synchronization (interpolation) processing can be<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> repeatedly executed in accordance with the pattern when the processing is executed, so that the subsequent processing can be simplified as compared with the conventional random array.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In addition, reproduction accuracy of the synchronization processing in a high frequency area can be improved because the first filter that corresponds to the first color that contributes most to obtaining a brightness signal is arranged on two diagonal lines in the basic array pattern, that is, the one or more first filters are arranged in each line of the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal (NE and NW) directions of the color filter array. In addition, aliasing can be suppressed and the high frequency reproducibility can be improved because a ratio of the number of pixels of the first color that corresponds to the first filter is made different from a ratio of the number of pixels of each of the second colors that respectively correspond to the second filters, and in particular, the ratio of the number of pixels of the first color that contributes most to obtaining a brightness signal is made greater than the ratio of the number of pixels of each of the colors of the second colors that respectively correspond to the second filters.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In a color imaging device according to another aspect of the present invention, it is desirable that the basic array pattern includes 3 x3 pixels. That is, it is the most desirable that the basic array pattern includes 3×3 pixels.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In a color imaging device according to another aspect of the present invention, it is desirable that the first filter and the second filters are arranged so that the color filter array and a color filter array that is obtained by down-sampling the color filter array to 1/2<sup>n</sup> (n: natural number) in the horizontal direction or the vertical direction are substantially identical. As a result, imaging processing at the time of capturing a still image and imaging processing at the time of capturing a moving image can be set as common processing.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In a color imaging device according to another aspect of the present invention, it is desirable that the first filter and the second filters are arranged so that the color filter array and a color filter array that is obtained by down-sampling the color filter array to 1/4<sup>n</sup> (n: natural number) in the horizontal direction or the vertical direction are substantially identical. As a result, the imaging processing at the time of capturing a still image and the imaging processing at the time of capturing a moving image can be set as common processing.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In a color imaging device according to another aspect of the present invention, it is desirable that the first filters are arranged so that an array of the first filters in the color filter array and an array of the first filters in a color filter array that is obtained by down-sampling the color filter array to 1/2<sup>n</sup> (n: natural number) in the horizontal direction or the vertical direction are substantially identical. That is, an arrangement of the first filter that is the main of the imaging processing is substantially identical regardless whether or not down-sampling/reading-out processing is executed. As a result, load of the imaging processing can be reduced.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In a color imaging device according to another aspect of the present invention, it is desirable that the one or more first filters are arranged in each line of horizontal, vertical, upper right diagonal, and lower right diagonal directions of the color filter array. The above-described case is satisfied when the first filter is arranged on the two diagonal lines in the basic array pattern.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In a color imaging device according to another aspect of the present invention, it is desirable that the color filter array includes a square array that corresponds to 2x2 pixels that are constituted by the first filter.
