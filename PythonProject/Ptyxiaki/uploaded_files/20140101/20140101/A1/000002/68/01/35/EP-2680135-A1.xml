One method for updating an application is to obtain, for example, by downloading from a server to the mobile device, a complete copy of the updated application. The outdated version of the application is then replaced with the updated version. Because a complete copy of the updated application is transmitted from a server to the mobile device, the bandwidth costs associated with this transmission are based on the size of the complete copy of the updated application, regardless of the extent of the changes that were made to the application in the updated version as compared to the version that is being replaced.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">The disclosure relates to methods for updating applications.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">One aspect of the disclosed embodiments is a method that includes receiving, from a remote computing device, an update request, the update request including a first signature corresponding to a client-side application package that is stored at the remote computing device.

An application package can be, for example, a single file that contains all of the components of a software application, such as code, graphics, and / or other media files. One example of an application package is the Android application package file format, also known as the APK file format, which is used by the Android operating system.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A differential update patch is selected or created based on the version of the application that is installed at the remote computing device and the current version of the application. Creating the differential update patch can include selecting an application package file from a server-side repository based on a signature that is received from the remote computing device, so that the differential update patch is created using an application package file that is substantially identical to the one that is installed at the remote computing device, without transmitting the application package file itself to the server. Creating the differential update patch can include unpacking (e.g. decompressing) the application package for each of the versions of the application, and creating patching instructions that update the components of the binary update package individually. One example of a patching instruction is a binary data delta. To apply the differential update patch at the remote computing device, the application package at the remote computing device is unpacked, the differential update is applied to the individual components, for example, by applying a binary data delta to each of the individual components, the components are packed (e.g. compressed) to create an updated application package for the application.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a system 100 in accordance with one implementation. The system 100 includes a computing device 110. The computing device 110 is connected to one or more server computers by a network 120. The one or more server computers can include an update manager 130, an update delivery service 140, a repository 150, a cache service 160, and a patch generator 170. All of these can be in communication with one another and with the computing device 110 via the network 120.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The computing device 110 can be a smart phone, tablet computer, laptop computer, or other mobile computing device that can connect to one or more server computers via the network 120. An application can be present and/or installed at the computing device 110 in the form of an<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> application package file. An example of an application package file is a file that serves as a container for component files corresponding to the application. The application package file can be compressed and/or encrypted. In some implementations, the computing device 110 is operable to unpack (decompress) the application package, resulting in a plurality of component files corresponding to the application.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The network 120 can include multiple networks of varying types, including LANs, WANs, and the internet in any combination. Wired and / or wireless communications protocols can be used.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The update manager 130 is operable to receive a request for an update from the computing device 110. The request can identify a currently installed version of an application package and, optionally, can also identify a requested version of the application package. The currently installed version of the application and the requested version of the application can be identified in the request by signatures. The signatures can be unique or non-unique signatures in any suitable form and can be generated, for example, by an algorithm that will always generate the same output when given a specified input. In some implementations, the signatures can be fixed like alphanumeric strings that are many orders of magnitude shorter than the application package files which they correspond to. As any example, the signatures can be hash codes, such as an SHA256 digest. The request can also include additional information, such as hardware or software information corresponding to the computing device 110.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The update manager 130, using the information contained in the requested, can transmit information to the computing device 110. The information can include one or more options for updating the application, as will be discussed herein. The information can also include metadata regarding updating the application, such as storage space requirements for installation of the updated version of the application.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The update delivery service 140 is operable to cause transmission of an update package to the computing device 110. The update package can be in the form of a patch, also referred to herein as a differential update package, that is selected based on the currently installed version of the application package and the requested version of the application package. The transmission can be made using a repository 150 or a cache service 160.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The patch generator 170 is operable to generate a patch that can be applied at the computing device 110 to modify the application package file or the component files corresponding to the application. The patch corresponds to a specific pair of versions for the application. For example, where there are three versions of an application package that are designated v1, v2, and v3, a first<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> patch can be generated that is applied to v1 to result in an updated application package that is functionally equivalent to v3, and a second patch can be generated that is applied to v2 to result in an updated application package that is functionally equivalent to v3.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A patch can be automatically generated by the patch generator without access to the prior version of the application package that is installed at the computing device 110 in response to the update request that is received from the computing device 110. The computing device 110 can transmit information that identifies the installed version of the application package. The information can be, as examples, a version number or signature, such as an SHA-1 hash or an SHA256 hash. A local copy of the corresponding application package is accessed by the patch generator 170. The signature can be used to identify a copy of the application package at the repository 150, which indicates that the application package located at the repository 150 is identical to the application package located at the mobile device 110, and thus can be used as a basis for generating an update package that can be applied to the application package at the mobile device 110.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of an example of a hardware configuration for the computing device 110.

Alternatively, the CPU 220 can be any other type of device, or multiple devices, capable of manipulating or processing information now-existing or hereafter developed. Although the disclosed examples can be practiced with a single processor as shown, e.g. CPU 220, advantages in speed and efficiency can be achieved using more than one processor.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The computing device 110 can include memory 222, such as a random access memory device (RAM). Any other suitable type of storage device can be used as the memory 222. The memory 222 can include code and data 224 that can be accessed by the CPU 220 using a bus 226. The memory 222 can further include an operating system 228 and one or more application programs 230. The application programs 230 can include programs that permit the CPU 220 to perform the methods described here.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">A storage device 232 can be optionally provided in the form of any suitable computer readable medium, such as a hard disc drive, a memory device, a flash drive or an optical drive. One or more input devices 234, such as a keyboard, a mouse, or a gesture sensitive input device, receive user inputs and can output signals or data indicative of the user inputs to the CPU 220. One or more output devices can be provided, such as a display device 236. The display device 236, such as liquid<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> crystal display (LCD) or a cathode-ray tube (CRT), allows output to be presented to a user, for example, in response to receiving a video signal.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Although <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> depicts the CPU 220 and the memory 222 of the computing device 110 as being integrated into a single unit, other configurations can be utilized. The operations of the CPU 220 can be distributed across multiple machines (each machine having one or more of processors) which can be coupled directly or across a local area or other network. The memory 222 can be distributed across multiple machines such as network-based memory or memory in multiple machines performing the operations of the computing device 110. Although depicted here as a single bus, the bus 226 of the computing device 110 can be composed of multiple buses. Further, the storage device 232 can be directly coupled to the other components of the computing device 110 or can be accessed via a network and can comprise a single integrated unit such as a memory card or multiple units such as multiple memory cards.

In most cases, this allows for a much reduced data download size as compared to downloading a complete copy of the updated version of an application package, which results in reduced bandwidth costs. In this example an original version 310 and an updated version 320 of an application are present on the server side, such as at the patch generator 170. Each of the original version 310 and the updated version 320 can be an application package file. A differential patch generation process 330 is performed using the original version 310 and the updated version 320 as inputs, and a patch 340 is generated as a result. The patch 340 is made based on differences between the application package files that are utilized as inputs. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the patch 340 can be generated without first unpacking or decompressing the application package files. Instead, the patch 340 can be generated by a binary data delta process that uses the application package files corresponding to the original version 310 and the updated 320 as inputs. The patch 340 includes binary data delta information that allows the updated version 320 to be recreated by applying the patch 340 to the original version 310.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Binary data delta generation is known.

The patch 340 is then applied to a client-side copy 350 of the original version 310 of the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> application (also referred to as a client side application package), which produces a client-side reproduction 360 of the updated version 320 of the application.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is an illustration showing an example of updating the contents of an application package.

Original resource files 415 and updated resource files 425 are generated as a result. A differential patch generation process 440 is applied to each pair of the original resource files 415 and the updated resource files 425, resulting in a binary data delta corresponding to each file pair.

The request can be generated by execution of an application, in response to receipt of signals or data, or in response to user input. The request indicates a desired version of the application. The computing device determines whether a previous version of the application is currently installed. In transmission 510, the computing device sends information to the update manager 130 that identifies the currently installed version of the application (if available) and the desired version of the application.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In some implementations, the update manager 130 determines whether a patch exists corresponding to the installed and desired versions of the application (e.g. a patch to update from v1 to v3). The update manager 130 can respond, in transmission 520, with any or all of a URL for the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> patch (if available), a URL for the entire application package corresponding to the desired version of the application, and metadata relating to the patch. In other implementations, the update manager does not determine whether a patch exists corresponding to the installed and desired versions of the application, but instead generates and/or transmits to the computing device 110 a URL that can be used to request the patch if it exists. In such an implementation, when the patch is requested, it can be delivered if it exists or the complete application package file can be delivered when the patch is requested but does not exist using server-side redirection.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Based on the information received from the update manager 130, the computing device 110 determines whether the currently installed version of the application can be patched, based on, for example, whether a patch is available and / or the metadata relating to the patch. Other examples of situations where it is determined that the application cannot be patched include, the software at the computing device 110 not having enough functionality to support binary data deltas, the computing device 110 lacking sufficient available storage to store and process the binary data deltas, the currently installed application package cannot be read (e.g. protected) to apply the binary data deltas, where the currently installed application package does not match a package that is stored at the repository 150 (based on package signatures), and where the patched package does match the expected package (based on package signatures.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">If the application cannot be patched, the computing device 110 can request the complete application package file corresponding to the updated version of the application, and can update the application by installing the complete application package file. If the application can be patched, a transmission 530 can be sent from the computing device 110 to the update delivery service, for example, using the patch URL that was received from the update manager. The update delivery service can validate the request and send a redirection transmission 540 to the computing device 110. The redirection transmission 540 causes the computing device 110 to attempt to retrieve the patch from the cache service 160 via a transmission 550 from the computing device 110 to the cache service 160. The transmission 550 can, for example, use a URL that was supplied by the update delivery service 140.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In response to the transmission 550, the cache service 160 attempts to locate the patch.

The patch is then stored at the cache service 160, and transmitted to the computing device 110 via transmission 560.

If a generation of a particular delta has previously failed, this can be tracked so that it is not attempted again. Also, a tunable decision limit can be used to determine whether an update package should be used for a particular upgrade scenario as opposed to processing the full application package.
