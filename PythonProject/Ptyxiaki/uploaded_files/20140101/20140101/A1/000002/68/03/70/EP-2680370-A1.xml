Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an electric connector configured so as to fix a signal transmission medium by moving an actuator.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In general, in various electric apparatuses and others, various electric connectors are widely used as a device for electrically connecting various signal transmission media such as a flexible printed circuit (FPC) and a flexible flat cable (FFC). For example, in an electric connector for use as being mounted on a printed wiring board as described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004071160A"><text>2004-71160</text></patcit>, a signal transmission medium formed of an FPC, an FFC, or the like is inserted into the inside of an insulating housing (an insulator) from its opening on a front end side, and then an actuator (connecting operation device) held at a "connection release position" for freeing the signal transmission medium at the time of insertion is rotated so as to be, for example, pushed down, toward a connecting action position on a front side or a rear side of the connector with an operating force of an operator.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">When the actuator (connecting operation device) is operated to be rotated to a "connection acting position" for interposing the signal transmission medium, a cam member provided in the actuator presses conductive conducts. With this, the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> conductive contacts are displaced to be in press-contact with the signal transmission medium (such as FPC or FFC), thereby fixing the signal transmission medium. On the other hand, when the actuator at the "connection acting position" is rotated toward the original "connection release position" so as to, for example, rise upward, the conductive contacts are displaced in a direction of being spaced apart by their elasticity from the signal transmission medium (such as FPC or FFC), thereby causing the signal transmission medium to become in a free state.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As such, the actuator for the electric connector is configured to be operated to reciprocate between the "connection release position" and the "connection acting position" as, for example, being operated to rotate about a rotation center extending in a longitudinal direction of the actuator. As the size of the electric connector as a whole has been decreased in recent years, the size and height of the actuator itself has been decreased, and the stiffness of the actuator tends to decrease, thereby posing the following problems, for example. That is, when an actuator with its stiffness decreased due to decrease in size and height receives an operating force leaning to one direction in the longitudinal direction of the actuator, the actuator as a whole is deformed as being twisted, and the original operating force is not transmitted to a part of conductive contacts, thereby possibly causing a state in which the conductive contacts are not press-contacted and connected to the signal transmission medium (such as FPC or FFC) in a good condition.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Also, as downsizing of the actuator together with the entire electric connector is advanced, it becomes difficult to visually recognize to which position the actuator has<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> been rotated, in particular, the state of the actuator rotated to the "connection acting position", thereby making it disadvantageously difficult to check the connection state of the conductive contacts.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an electric connector capable of preventing, with a simple structure, deformation such as a twist of an actuator at the time of moving operation and easily checking the operation state of the actuator, thereby allowing an electrical connection to be easily and reliably established.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">To achieve the above-described object, in the present invention, in an electric connector in which an actuator pinching or freeing a signal transmission medium is provided so as to be rotatable about a rotation center extending in a longitudinal direction of the actuator, a structure is adopted in which inclined surface parts extending to form an appropriate angle with respect to the longitudinal direction are provided in outer end faces in a radial direction regarding the rotation center of the actuator and at both end portions in the longitudinal direction of the actuator.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the present invention with the above-described structure, to rotate the actuator from the "connection release position" to the "connection acting position", when a fingertip of an operator presses a rising wall when, for example, the actuator stands at the "connection release position", the fingertip of the operator is difficult to be hooked at the inclined surface parts provided at both end portions in the longitudinal<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> direction. With this, the pressing force tends to be added to the center portion in the longitudinal direction of the actuator. On the other hand, the pressing force added to each of the inclined surface parts provided at both end portions in the longitudinal direction also acts in a direction at an approximately right angle with respect to the inclined surface of the inclined surface part, that is, from both ends side to a center side in the longitudinal direction of the actuator. For this reason, the operation pressing force added from the operator as a whole tends to uniformly act on a full length of the actuator. Thus, a situation that the actuator is pressed as being twisted, which conventionally occurs, is difficult to occur, and the actuator is rotated as a whole by keeping an approximately flat plane. With this, the action of pinching the signal transmission medium by the rotation of the actuator is excellently performed.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Furthermore, the outer shape is such that the inclined surface parts are disposed at both end parts in the longitudinal direction of the actuator. Thus, when the entire outer appearance of the actuator is viewed, it is visually recognized as a characteristic odd form having an approximately trapezoidal shape. Therefore, the rotation state of the actuator is easily and reliably checked in a visual manner.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Also, preferably in the present invention, a flat part extending in the longitudinal direction is provided in a portion between the inclined surface parts provided at the both end portions in the longitudinal direction, and the inclined surface parts are formed so as to smoothly continue from both end parts in a longitudinal direction of the flat part.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> According to the present invention with the above-described structure, when the operating force is added to the actuator, a corner that causes concentration of stress at a boundary between the inclined surface parts and the flat part is not present. Therefore, it is possible to prevent possible damage due to the rotating operation of the actuator and others.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Still further, preferably in the present invention, rising wall parts extending in an approximately flat shape along a rotational radial direction of the actuator are provided at both end edge parts in the longitudinal direction of the actuator, and the inclined surface parts are provided so as to continue from outer end edges in a rotational radial direction of the rising wall parts.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to the present invention with the above-described structure, compared with the case in which no rising wall part is provided, the stiffness of the actuator is increased by the rising wall parts. Thus, damage when the operating force is added to the actuator and others can be prevented.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Still further, preferably in the present invention, the appropriate angle formed by the inclined surface parts with respect to the longitudinal direction is set in a range of 4 degrees to 15 degrees.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to the present invention with the above-described structure, it has been found that when the actuator is actually operated as being rotated, excellent uniformity of the operation pressing force over the full length of the actuator and<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> stiffness of the full length of the actuator can be both obtained simultaneously.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Still further, preferably, each of the inclined surface parts in the present invention is provided with an operation prevention aiding part formed of a separate inclined surface adjacently disposed along the inclined surface part, and the inclined surface configuring the operation prevention aiding part extends from the inclined surface part to an outer end edge in a radial direction of a rising wall part extending in an approximately flat shape along a rotational radial direction of the actuator and along the longitudinal direction of the actuator to form an appropriate angle with respect to the rotational radial direction of the actuator.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to the present invention with the above-described structure, the tendency that the fingertip of the operator is difficult to be hooked at the inclined surface parts at the time of operating the actuator as described above becomes more apparent with the operation prevention aiding part additionally provided to the inclined surface part, and the operation pressing force added from the operator further uniformly acts over the full length, making it difficult to cause a situation that the actuator is pressed as being twisted. The actuator is rotated as a whole by keeping an approximately flat plane, and the action of pinching the signal transmission medium by the rotation of the actuator is excellently performed.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Still further, preferably in the present invention, the operation prevention aiding part is disposed so as to face an operating force added to the actuator when the actuator is operated in a pinching direction from a state of freeing the signal<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> transmission medium.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to the present invention with the above-described structure, when the actuator is operated in a pinching direction, the fingertip of the operator is reliably difficult to be hooked at the inclined surface parts.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Still further, preferably in the present invention, an operation support part formed of a concave part or a convex part extending along the longitudinal direction of the actuator is provided at a center portion in a longitudinal direction, the rising wall part extending in an approximately flat shape along a rotational radial direction of the actuator and along the longitudinal direction of the actuator, the operation support part being provided in a portion where an operating force is added in a pinching direction from a state of freeing the signal transmission medium or a portion where an operating force is added in a freeing direction from a state of pinching the signal transmission medium. Here, the concave part or the convex part configuring the operation support part is preferably formed in a shape allowing engagement of a fingertip part or a nail part of an operator of the actuator.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to the present invention with the above-described structure, at the time of operating the actuator, the nail part or the fingertip part of the operator of the actuator is easily hooked at the operation support part at the center portion in the longitudinal direction, and the operation pressing force added from the operator is positively received at the center portion of the actuator. With this, uniform operability can be reliably obtained.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Still further, preferably in the present invention, the operation support part is formed so as to extend in a curve or a straight line along the longitudinal direction of the actuator.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to the present invention with the above-described structure, the nail part of the operator easily and reliably engages with the curved operation support part, and the fingertip part of the operator easily and reliably engages with the linear operation support. Therefore, the curved or liner operation support part is disposed as appropriate according to the state of the rotating operation, thereby obtaining excellent operability.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As described above, in the electric connector according to the present invention, inclined surface parts are provided in end faces outside of a rotation radius of the actuator pinching or freeing a signal transmission medium to approximately uniformly act the entire pressing force of the operator over the full length of the actuator. With this, a situation that the actuator is pressed as being twisted is eliminated, the action of pinching the signal transmission medium is excellently performed, and the rotation state of the actuator is easily and reliably checked in a visual manner. Thus, it is possible to prevent, with a simple structure, deformation such as a twist of an actuator at the time of moving operation and easily check the operation state of the actuator, thereby allowing an electrical connection to be easily and reliably established and significantly increasing the quality and reliability of the electric connector at low cost.<!-- EPO <DP n="9">

From an upper end part of each rising surface part 12b3, the inclined surface part 12b1 is contiguously provided.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">As such, in the present embodiment, since the inclined surface parts 12b1 are provided on both end parts of the open/close operating part 12b of the actuator 12, the following advantages can be obtained. That is, when the actuator 12 is rotated from the "connection release position" to the "connection acting position", the rising wall part on a front side, which is the front end face (the left-side end face in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 10</figref>) with the actuator 12 standing at the "connection release position" (refer to <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 10</figref>), is pressed with a fingertip of the operator. If the inclined surface parts 12b1 are provided on both end portions of the open/close operating part 12b of the actuator 12 as described above, the pressing force of the operator is difficult to be exerted onto portions on both end sides in the longitudinal direction where the inclined surface parts 12b1 are provided.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> With this, the pressing force tends to be added onto a center portion of the actuator 12 in the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">On the other hand, the pressing force added onto portions where the inclined surface parts 12b1 on both sides of the actuator 12 in the longitudinal direction are provided is added in an approximately right angle direction with respect to the inclined surfaces of the inclined surface parts 12b1. For this reason, the pressing force of the operator approximately uniformly acts over the full length of the actuator 12, preventing the occurrence of a situation that the entire actuator 12 is pressed as being twisted. The actuator 12 is rotated as a whole by keeping an approximately flat plane. As a result, the action of pinching the signal transmission medium (such as FPC or FFC) F by the rotation of the actuator 12 is excellently performed.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Furthermore, when the entire external view of the actuator 12 is visually checked, in particular, as depicted with a two-dot-chain line denoted as a reference character A in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>, it is visually recognized as having an odd form with an approximately trapezoidal shape. In particular, with the actuator 12 being rotated to the "connection acting position" (refer to <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>), the entire external view of the actuator 12 is visually conspicuous as having an approximately trapezoidal shape in a planar view. Therefore, the rotation state of the actuator 12 to the "connection acting position" is easily and reliably checked.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Still further, as in the present embodiment, with the structure in which the inclined surfaces configuring the inclined surface parts 12b1 smoothly continue from<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> the flat part 12b2, if the operating force is added onto the actuator 12, no corner part is present that causes concentration of stress at a boundary between the surface parts 12b1 and 12b2, and therefore damage on the actuator 12 due to the operation of rotating the actuator and others can be prevented.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In addition, as in the present embodiment, with the inclined surface parts 12b1 being provided via the both-end-side rising wall parts 12b3, the stiffness in the open/close operating part 12b of the actuator 12 can be increased accordingly to the provision of the both-end-side rising wall parts 12b3, thereby making it possible to prevent damage and others when the operating force is added onto the actuator 12.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">By contrast, in a second embodiment depicted in <figref idrefs="f0016 f0017">Fig. 18 to Fig. 20</figref> with same components provided with the same reference character as that of the first embodiment described above, in addition to the inclined surface parts 12b1, operation prevention aiding parts 12b4 each formed of a separate inclined surface is provided at both end side portions in the connector longitudinal direction of the actuator 12. Each of these operation prevention aiding parts 12b4 is disposed at an upper end portion with the actuator 12 standing at the "connection release position" (refer to <figref idrefs="f0017">Fig. 20</figref>) and closer to the front on both side in the longitudinal direction. The operation prevention aiding part 12b4 is disposed at a position facing the operating force added to the actuator 12 when the actuator 12 is pushed down in a pinching direction from the state of freeing the signal transmission medium (such as FPC or FFC) F.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">That is, each operation prevention aiding part 12b4 is formed of a separate<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> inclined surface adjacently disposed along the inclined surface part 12b1. The inclined surface configuring the operation prevention aiding part 12b4 is disposed so as to be along a front side of the inclined surface part 12b1. More specifically, one end edge of the inclined surface of the operation prevention aiding part 12b4 is adjacently disposed so as to configure an end edge that is common as an end edge of the inclined surface on a front end side forming the inclined surface part 12b1, and extends from one end edge (common edge) of the operation prevention aiding part 12b1 to an outer end edge of a front-side rising wall part 12b5 in a radial direction, the front-side rising wall part 12b5 extending in an approximately flat shape along the rotational radial direction of the actuator 12 and also along the longitudinal direction of the actuator 12. The inclined angle of the operation prevention aiding part 12b4 at which it extends is set as appropriate downward with respect to the rotational radial direction of the actuator 12.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Also, the front-side rising wall part 12b5 described above extends so as to form a front end face (a left end face in <figref idrefs="f0017">Fig. 20</figref>) with the actuator 12 standing at the "connection release position" (refer to <figref idrefs="f0017">Fig. 20</figref>). An upper end edge of the front-side rising wall part 12b5 and the other end edge of the inclined surface of each operation prevention aiding part 12b4 are adjacently disposed so as to configure a common edge edge. As such, each operation prevention aiding part 12b4 is inclined so as to go down toward outside in the connector longitudinal direction together with the inclined surface forming each inclined surface part 12b1, and is also inclined so as to go down toward the front side.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">As such, according to the second embodiment including the operation prevention<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> aiding parts 12b4 extending so as to be inclined toward the front side in addition to the inclined surface parts 12b1 according to the first embodiment described above, the fingertip of the operator further tends not to be hooked at the front portion on both side in the longitudinal direction of the actuator 12. As a result, at the time of operation of rotating the actuator 12, the operation pressing force added from the operator tends to further uniformly act over the full length, and the action of pinching the signal transmission medium (such as FPC or FFC) F by the rotation of the actuator 12 is excellently performed.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Furthermore, first and second operation support parts 12b6 and 12b7 each formed of a concave part are provided on an approximately center portion in the longitudinal direction of the actuator 12. These first and second operation support parts 12b6 and 12b7 are provided so as to extend along the longitudinal direction on front and rear rising walls of the actuator 12, that is, the front-side rising wall part 12b5 described above and a rear-side rising wall part on an opposite side, respectively.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Of these, the concave part configuring the first operation support part 12b6 is formed in the front-side rising wall part 12b5, that is, a front end face (a left-side end face in <figref idrefs="f0017">Fig. 20</figref>) with the actuator 12 standing at the "connection release position" (refer to <figref idrefs="f0017">Fig. 20</figref>), and is formed of an elongated groove approximately linearly extending along the connector longitudinal direction. The concave part is formed to have a shape allowing engagement of a fingertip of the operator of the actuator 12 when the actuator 12 is operated as being rotated from the state of freeing the signal transmission medium (such as FPC or FFC) F to a pinching direction.<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --></p><p id="p0071" num="0071">By contrast, the second operation support part 12b7 is formed in the rear-side rising wall part of the actuator 12, that is, a lower end face (a lower-side end face in <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 11</figref>) with the actuator 12 being laid at the "connection acting position" (refer to <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 11</figref>), and is formed of a recessed part extending in an approximately curved line along the connector longitudinal direction. The curved line forming an outer line of this second operation support part 12b7 is shaped with its center portion in the longitudinal direction swells approximately in the shape of an arc toward inside in the rotational radial direction of the actuator 12, and is shaped so that a nail part of the operator of the actuator 12 can be engaged when the actuator 12 is operated from the state of pinching the signal transmission medium (such as FPC or FFC) F to a freeing direction.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">According to the present embodiment with the above-structured first and second operation support parts 12b6 and 12b7, at the time of operation of rotating the actuator 12, the finger tip part or the nail part of the operator of the actuator 12 is easily hooked at the first and second operation support parts 12b6 and 12b7 at the center portion in the longitudinal direction. That is, the fingertip part of the operator can be easily and reliably engaged with the linearly-shaped first operation support part 12b6, and the nail part of he operator can be easily and reliably engaged with the curve-shaped second operation support part 12b7. Therefore, with these linear and curved operation support parts 12b6 and 12b7 disposed as appropriate on the front and rear rising walls according to the state of rotating operation of the actuator 12, excellent rotation operability can be obtained.
