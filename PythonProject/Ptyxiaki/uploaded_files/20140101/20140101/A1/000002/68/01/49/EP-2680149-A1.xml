id="h0002">Background</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventionally, a server where two CPUs (Central Processing Units) are mounted on one system board is present. The reasons are such that an advantage of scale is enabled to be brought by a number of use purposes for executing processes with the two CPUs, and cost reductions are achieved by sharing parts. Another reason is such that since a plurality of CPUs are present, business operations are able to be continued by excluding a faulty CPU even if a fault occurs in one of the plurality of CPUs.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the meantime, with the recent development of semiconductor technologies, it has become possible to shrink transistors, and to incorporate many functions into one semiconductor chip. For example, since it has become possible to include a memory controller within a CPU, the CPU and a memory have been directly connected.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG 1</figref>. illustrates an outline of a system board 100 included in a server.<br/>
The system board 100 includes CPUs 0 and 1, memories 101 and 102, memories 111 and 112, an IO hub 120, a legacy IO (Input/Output) controller 130, and a BCM (Board Control Management unit) 140.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Since the CPU 0 includes a memory controller, the CPU 0 is enabled to be directly connected to the memories 101 and 102. Since also the CPU 1 includes a memory controller, the CPU 1 is enabled to be directly connected to the memories 111 and 112.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the meantime, the IO hub 120 includes a LIO (Legacy IO) bus controller 121, and a PCI (Peripheral Component<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Interconnect) bus controller 122. The CPU 0 and the CPU 1 share the IO hub 120.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">For example, the CPU 0 exchanges data with a disk and a LAN (Local Area Network), which are connected to the legacy IO controller 130, via the LIO bus controller 121 within the IO hub 120. Moreover, the CPU 0 exchanges data with an IO (Input/Output) device connected to a PCI socket via the PCI bus controller 122 within the IO hub 120.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Similarly, the CPU 1 exchanges data with the disk and the LAN, which are connected to the legacy IO controller 130, via the LIO bus controller 121. Moreover, the CPU 1 exchanges data with the IO device connected to the PCI socket via the PCI bus controller 122.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Accordingly, for example, even if the CPU 1 is in a faulty state, the CPU 0 is able to exchange data with the disk and the LAN, which are connected to the legacy IO controller 130, and the IO device connected to the PCI socket via the IO hub 120 as described above.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In relation to the above described technique, a complex computer system where bus adapters that are directly linked to respective memory buses in first and second computers are connected is known. The bus adapters respectively include a burst access mechanism and a random access mechanism, which are fundamentally configured with a request mechanism for the side of a memory bus, and independently perform operations. Since the bus adapters having a small amount of hardware are directly connected to the memory buses, a data transfer is enabled to be performed finely at high speed.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Additionally, a scalable shared memory multiprocessor computer system where a bus mechanism within a node of a specific type connects each system cell within each node to another cell within the same node is known. In this system, a plurality of nodes are able to share an inter-node bus.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Additionally, a shared nonvolatile memory embedded or integrated in a circuit used in a multiprocessor device is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> known.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPHEI05143561B"><text>HEI05-143561</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2001147903A"><text>2001-147903</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 3: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2004522235A"><text>2004-522235</text></patcit></li></ul></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Additionally, with the recent development of semiconductor technologies, it has become possible to incorporate many functions into one semiconductor chip.

The system board 200 includes, CPUs A and B, memories 101 and 102, memories 111 and 112, a legacy IO controller 130, and a BCM 140.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The CPUs A and B include a LIO bus controller and a PCI bus controller in addition to a memory controller. In this case, for example, the CPU A is able to directly connect to the legacy IO controller 130. Moreover, the CPU A is able to directly connect also to a PCI socket.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Here, one legacy IO controller is sufficient in many cases.

In this case, when a fault occurs in the CPU A, the CPU B is disabled to access a disk and<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> a LAN, which are connected to the legacy IO controller 130, and an IO device and the like connected to the PCI socket.
