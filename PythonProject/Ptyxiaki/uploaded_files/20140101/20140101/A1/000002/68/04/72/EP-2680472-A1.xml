Such an access network is also preferably called a passive optical network (PON).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The optical line terminal (OLT) is located in a so-called central office, at which the interconnection between the access network and the core network is given.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In a classical access network, the optical line terminal transmits a downstream signal at a downstream wavelength into an optical fiber, preferably called optical feeder fiber. This optical feeder fiber is connected to a remote node, which splits the downstream signal onto different optical branches, wherein one or more optical network units are connected to an optical branch. A customer may connect one or more devices to an optical network unit (ONU) for the purpose of data transmission. An optical network unit is also preferably called an optical network terminal, in the case that only one customer device is connected to the optical network unit.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the mentioned classical access network, data transmission in the upstream direction is performed from the customer towards the core network, in that the optical network unit transmits data at an upstream wavelength into one of the optical branches. The remote node then combines all the different upstream signals of the different optical branches and provides the combined upstream signal via the optical feeder fiber to the optical line terminal. Data transmission of the different optical network units is coordinated, in that the transmission technique of time division multiplexing (TDM) is employed. Therefore, each optical network unit is assigned one or more time slots for transmitting data in the upstream direction. Furthermore, each optical network unit is assigned a unique identifier by the optical line terminal in a so-called ranging process.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">An example of a classical access network is a so-called XG-PONI network, in which the optical line terminal transmits its downstream signal with a downstream wavelength that can vary within a pre-defined wavelength bandwidth. This ensured, by selecting the transmitter of the optical line terminal after manufacturing according to a give manufacturing tolerance and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> also by a temperature tuning of this transmitter within the optical line terminal. This temperature tuning is not aimed at tuning the transmission wavelength over the full transmission bandwidth. The temperature tuning may be achieved by a thermoelectric element relying on the Peltier effect. The pre-defined wavelength bandwidth is preferably of 5nm bandwidth.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In other words, the pre-defined bandwidth is broad enough, such that the downstream signal falls within the pre-defined bandwidth without having to fully stabilize the laser transmission unit of the optical line terminal. The optical network units of the network are then able to receive the downstream signal within the pre-defined downstream wavelength bandwidth.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Furthermore, in an XG-PONI network, an optical network unit transmits its upstream signal with an upstream wavelength that falls within a pre-defined upstream wavelength bandwidth, preferably 20 nm. For the optical network units, the laser transmission units are unstabilized in temperature , such that the upstream wavelength may vary, while it is taken care, that the upstream wavelength falls within the pre-defined upstream wavelength bandwidth. This is taken care of, by choosing the transmission units of the optical line terminal and the optical network units after manufacturing, such that the respective wavelengths fall within the pre-defined respective wavelength bandwidth for transmission for a pre-defined temperature range without any tuning.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Thus, there is no need for filtering out a downstream signal at an optical network unit and also no need for tuning an upstream laser transmission unit of an optical network unit to a specific upstream wavelength.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In a PON network using not only TDM, but also wavelength division multiplexing (WDN), preferably called TWDM PON, multiple downstream signals are generated by an optical line terminal at respective downstream wavelengths, while the laser transmission units for generating these multiple downstream signals are stabilized, preferably via temperature stabilization, such that the downstream wavelengths do not show a significant variation. The downstream signals are spaced by a pre-defined wavelength difference, wherein this wavelength difference is preferably a grid of 100GHz separating the different downstream wavelengths. Preferably, four downstream wavelength signals with such a spacing fall within a downstream wavelength bandwidth window of 400GHz.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In a TWDM PON, an optical network unit shall receive data via one specific downstream signal with one specific downstream wavelength. Thus, in an optical network unit of a TWDM PON, there is a need to filter out a specific downstream wavelength at the optical network unit, before processing the received optical signal for the purpose of data reception.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary</b></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">Proposed is an optical network unit for an optical access network.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The optical network unit contains different sub-devices.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The unit contains an optical interface, which is operable to receive an optical downstream signal from an optical fiber.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Furthermore, the unit contains a tunable optical filter, which is operable to filter out a respective tunable wavelength bandwidth from the received optical downstream signal.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Even furthermore, the unit contains an optical reception unit, which is operable to convert the filtered optical downstream signal to an electrical signal.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Finally, the optical network unit contains at least one control unit, which is operable to observe a signal power of the filtered optical downstream signal, using the electrical signal. The control unit tunes the wavelength bandwidth of the optical filter, such that the signal power of the filtered optical downstream signal is maximized, using the electrical signal.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In order to grasp the advantages of the proposed optical network unit, the following aspects have to be taken into consideration.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The proposed optical network unit contains a tunable optical filter, which filters out a respective tunable wavelength bandwidth from the received optical downstream signal. This filtered out wavelength bandwidth is preferably smaller than a bandwidth, within which a downstream signal may be transmitted, such as in an access network not employing the technique of WDM. Such filtering is not foreseen for an optical network unit of an optical access network, in which no WDM technique is employed. Thus, the optical filter may suppress the downstream wavelength of the one single downstream signal in an optical access network not employing the technique of WDM. Therefore, it is foreseen, that the control unit of the proposed optical network unit observes the signal power of the filtered downstream signal and tunes the optical filter, such that the signal power of the received and filtered optical downstream signal is maximized. Thus, it is ensured, that the optical network unit proposed herein properly receives a downstream signal of an unstabilized downstream wavelength, when being used in an access network not employing the technique of WDM.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Furthermore, by observing the signal power of the filtered downstream signal and tuning the optical filter in the proposed manner, there is no need to foresee an optical by-pass for the received optical downstream signal from the optical interface towards the optical reception unit. Although it would be a possible solution to use such an optical by-pass, which by-passes the received optical downstream signal from the optical interface around the tunable optical<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> filter directly to the optical reception unit, the optical by-pass would cause a need for additional sub-devices in the optical network unit, which in turn would require more space within the optical network unit and thus might interfere with space restrictions.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">To summarize the above, the proposed optical network unit works properly, when being used in an optical access network without employing the technique of WDM, while downstream signals may be generated by an optical line terminal with an unstabilized laser transmission unit causing a variation of the optical downstream signal. This is ensured, in that the control unit tunes the wavelength bandwidth of the filter in the proposed manner.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Furthermore, the optical network unit proposed herein may also be used in a TWDM PON, in which an optical line terminal generates multiple downstream signals with respective different downstream wavelengths, generated using stabilized laser transmission units, such that the different downstream wavelengths do not significantly vary. The bandwidth of the tunable filter is preferably smaller than a bandwidth used for downstream transmission, and furthermore, the bandwidth of the tunable filter has a passband bandwidth, which corresponds to a channel spacing used for downstream transmission. Since the control unit of the proposed optical network unit tunes the wavelength bandwidth of the optical filter, such that the signal power of the filtered optical downstream signal is maximized, it is insured, that the wavelength bandwidth of the optical filter is tuned to one of the multiple downstream wavelengths at which the optical line terminal transmits signals towards the optical network unit.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Since furthermore, in an optical access network there is usually foreseen a time window, during which an optical network unit may receive configuration data from the optical line terminal via each of the downstream wavelengths, and then choose one of the specific different downstream wavelengths indicated by the configuration data, the optical network unit is able to tune the optical filter at a later point of time to another of the downstream wavelengths, in the case that that downstream wavelength, to which the filter was initially tuned, was not the one, to which the optical line terminal assigns the optical network unit via the configuration data.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>Brief description of the Figures</b></heading><p id="p0024" num="0024"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows an optical access network.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2a, b, c</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0003">d and e</figref> show different downstream and upstream wavelengths.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 3</figref> shows an optical access network employing the technique of TDM and WDM at the same time.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 4a</figref> shows a proposed optical network unit.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 4b</figref> shows sub-devices of the proposed optical network unit according to a preferred embodiment.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b>Description of embodiments</b></heading><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows an optical access network PON, in which only one wavelength is used for downstream transmission and one other wavelength is used for upstream transmission.
