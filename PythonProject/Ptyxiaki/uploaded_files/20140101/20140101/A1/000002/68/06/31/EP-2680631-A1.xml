Another important feature of the next generation networks lies in coexistence of a plurality of radio technologies to form heterogeneous radio access networks.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of heterogeneous radio access networks in the prior art. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1</figref>, there are a variety of heterogeneous radio access networks which can be divided into a Wide Area Network (WAN), a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), a Local Area Network (LAN) and a Personal Area Network (PAN) in terms of their coverage ranges, a point-to-multipoint single-hop network, a multi-hop network, a mesh network and an ad-hoc network in terms of their network architectures, etc. All or a part of these radio access network access an IP-based core network in a wired or wireless manner to obtain service for a user. Thus, the access networks can be connected to a heterogeneous access network manager by which the access networks are managed.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The heterogeneous radio access networks are significant from the respective perspectives of a radio technology, a coverage range, a network architecture, network performance, etc., and they form three-dimensional coverage in terms of geographical distribution and cooperate to provide a user with ubiquitous radio multimedia services with various contents. Radio spectrum resources available to these access networks are relatively rare.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the next generation networks, the radio access networks interconnected over the IP-based core network can exchange information to offer an opportunity for an improved utilization rate of resources on one hand. On the other hand, the heterogeneous radio access networks form three-dimensional coverage with resource contention and interference to make it difficult to utilize the resources effectively. It is thus desirable to design an effective antenna management apparatus and method for efficient utilization of the resources of the next generation networks.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">A brief summary of the invention is given below to provide basic understanding on some aspects of the invention.

In the step S710, the resource use efficiency analyzer 330 determines access networks with a low resource utilization rate by analyzing the resource use state data collected by the resource use information collector 310. For example, the resource use efficiency analyzer 330 can inquire the resource use state database 340 and selects access networks with a resource utilization rate below a predetermined threshold <i>UtilizationRate<sub>Th</sub></i> as a set <i>U</i> of objects under examination.

The resource utilization rate may be lower due to numerous factors, for example, a smaller number of active users, a low total amount of required traffic bandwidth, interference from another access network, etc. Typically, antenna scheduling need to be performed only if the resource utilization rate is lower due to interference. By way of an example, the resource use efficiency analyzer 330 can judge whether the resource utilization rate is lower due to interference as follows: the analyzer examines the average signal to noise ratio <i>SNR</i> over a specific past period of time of each access network in the set U of access networks selected in the step S710. If the average signal to noise ratio is below a predetermined threshold <i>SNR<sub>Th</sub></i>, then it indicates that the access network is subject to relatively large interference, and it can be considered that the resource utilization rate thereof is lower due to interference. If the average signal to noise ratio is above the predetermined threshold <i>SNR<sub>Th</sub></i>, then it indicates that the access network is subject to relatively small interference, it can be considered that the resource utilization rate thereof is lower due to another factor than interference, and the access network can be removed from the set <i>U.</i> Elements in the set <i>U</i> of access networks finally obtained in this method are access networks with a low resource utilization rate and strong interference<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> for which antenna scheduling are required.

This can be performed by sending an antenna scheduling request signaling <i>AntennaSchedule_request</i> to the antenna scheduler 320.

For a network with a central control node, one uplink wireless link cluster between an infrastructure and a user represents a plurality of wireless links with the same receiving node but with different transmitting nodes. When a bandwidth demand vector of a downlink wireless link cluster is formed, uplink bandwidth requirements of uplink wireless links in respective bandwidth requirement regions corresponding thereto are summed as a bandwidth requirement vector of an uplink wireless link cluster symmetric to the downlink wireless link cluster, and also a beam of the uplink wireless link cluster is hereby determined. Due to symmetry of a wireless communication link, when communication directions of the respective wireless links in the downlink wireless link cluster are reversed, these reversed wireless links form the uplink wireless link cluster symmetric to the downlink wireless link cluster, and a transmitting node in the downlink wireless link cluster is a receiving node in the uplink wireless link cluster symmetric thereto, and a receiving node in the downlink wireless link cluster is a transmitting node in the uplink wireless link cluster symmetric thereto, or vice versa. Still taking the part (b) of <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 10</figref> as an example, a bandwidth requirement of the bandwidth requirement region <i>C</i>1 of the uplink wireless link cluster is defined as the sum of uplink bandwidth requirements of all the wireless links formed of nodes in the region <i>C</i>1 and the antenna <i>0</i>, and a beam of the uplink wireless link cluster is represented as an envelope of beams of all the uplink wireless links formed of the nodes in the region <i>C</i>1 and the antenna <i>0</i>, and the same applies to <i>C</i>2 and <i>C</i>3. The bandwidth requirement vector of the uplink wireless link cluster (corresponding to a first bandwidth requirement which can be predetermined, for example, typically as actual bandwidth requirement) is a one-dimension vector including three elements formed of the uplink bandwidth requirements of <i>C</i>1, <i>C</i>2 and <i>C</i>3.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0095" num="0095">With the bandwidth demand vector of a wireless link cluster, a bandwidth requirement of an access network can be zoned in order for a finer granularity of antenna scheduling and a further improved resource utilization rate.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">When the antenna scheduler 320 allocates wireless resources to the wireless link clusters of the access networks in the antenna scheduling set, it is necessary to have interference between the wireless link clusters within a predetermined range. Since access networks in the antenna scheduling set use the same spectrum resource, interference may arise from transmission of data between wireless link clusters over the same resource at the same time, which can also be referred to as exclusion restriction of antenna scheduling.

Other values represent exclusion degrees between the two, where a larger value represents a higher exclusion degree. For example, if there is a sufficiently long distance between two wireless link clusters <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, and when they use the same resource, interference of a transmission signal of <i>a</i> to a receiver of the wireless link cluster <i>b</i> can be neglectable (with a signal to noise ratio above a very high threshold), and then exclusion of <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> can be considered as 0, denoted as <i>a</i> ↦ <i>b =</i> 0. In another example, there are two wireless link clusters <i>C</i> and <i>d</i> between a specific transmitting node and two different signal receiving nodes, and if the transmitting node is equipped with only a single transmitting system, then <i>C</i> and <i>d</i> can not operate concurrently, so <i>C</i> and <i>d</i> are absolutely exclusive, denoted as <i>c</i> ↦ <i>d</i>=1 and <i>d</i> ↦ <i>c</i>=1.

Stated otherwise, transmission of data from the relay node can not precede its reception of the corresponding data. This restrictive relationship is described as a preceding restriction.
