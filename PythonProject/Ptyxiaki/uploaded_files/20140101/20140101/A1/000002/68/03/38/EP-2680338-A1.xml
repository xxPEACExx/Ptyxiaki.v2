An example of such an arrangement includes a battery case and a protection circuit and the like provided thereon as disclosed by <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2009152183A"><text>JP 2009-152183 A</text></patcit>.</p><heading id="h0003">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">The disclosed arrangement has a space for providing the protection circuit on the battery case because a battery pack having a relatively large size is used. However, if a battery is made of a flat battery such a coin battery, a substrate provided with a protection circuit, terminals and other elements thereon could be larger than the flat battery because the flat battery has a significantly small size as compared to the battery pack. This can increase the size of the battery unit as a whole, which, in some cases, makes it difficult to apply the unit to a small-size device that may operate with a flat battery.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a battery unit including a flat type battery and a substrate having a circuit thereon that allows the battery unit as a whole to be compact.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A battery unit according to one embodiment of the present invention includes a flat battery in a flat shape having an upper surface and a bottom surface and a substrate fixed to one of the upper surface and the bottom surface of the flat battery, a circuit component is mounted on a surface of the substrate on the flat battery side, and a positive electrode terminal<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> electrically connected to a positive electrode side of the flat battery and a negative electrode terminal electrically connected to a negative electrode side of the flat battery are formed on a surface of the substrate on an opposite side to the flat battery (a first configuration).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to the above-described configuration, the substrate is fixed to one surface of the flat battery, and therefore the substrate and the flat battery can be provided in a compact manner in their thickness-wise direction. Furthermore, the positive electrode terminal and the negative electrode terminal are provided on the surface of the substrate on the opposite side to the flat battery, and therefore the positive electrode terminal and the negative electrode terminal can be formed in a position that overlaps the flat battery when viewed in the direction in the substrate and the flat battery are placed on each other. In this way, in the battery unit including the flat battery and the substrate, the flat battery can be compact in the radial direction of the flat battery.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Furthermore, circuit components are mounted on the surface of the substrate on the flat battery side, and therefore the positive electrode terminal and the negative electrode terminal can be formed on the surface of the substrate on the opposite side to the flat battery, so that the battery unit can be reduced in thickness. In addition, the circuit components are mounted on the surface of the substrate on the flat battery side, so that a user can be prevented from directly touching the circuit components for example during battery exchange.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the first configuration, the flat battery has a cylindrical exterior can with a bottom and a sealing can adapted to cover an opening side of the exterior can, and the substrate is fixed on the upper surface formed by the sealing can (a second configuration). In a flat battery in general, a sealing can is less likely to deform than an exterior can. Therefore, fixing the substrate on the upper surface formed by the sealing can as described above can prevent the substrate from being affected by the deformation of the flat<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> battery. More specifically, if the flat battery deforms, electrical contact between the substrate and the flat battery can be secured in the above-described structure.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the second configuration, the positive electrode terminal is electrically connected to one of the sealing can and an outer circumferential side part of the exterior can fitted to the sealing can, and the negative electrode terminal is electrically connected to the other of the sealing can and the outer circumferential side part of the exterior can to which the positive electrode terminal is not electrically connected (a third configuration).</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In this manner, the positive electrode terminal and the negative electrode terminal can be electrically connected to the sealing can and the exterior can. In this way, the first and second configurations can be implemented.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In one of the first to third configurations, the substrate is fixed to the flat battery at such a distance to the flat battery that the circuit component does not contact the flat battery (a fourth configuration).</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In this way, there is a distance between the circuit component mounted on the substrate and the flat battery that keeps them from contacting each other, and therefore the circuit component can be prevented from contacting the flat battery and deforming as a result even when the flat battery deforms to some extent.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the fourth configuration, a spacer adapted to provide the distance is provided between the substrate and the flat battery (a fifth configuration). In this way, the above-described fourth configuration can be implemented easily.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In one of the first to fifth configurations, the substrate has a shape<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> and a size equal to an outer shape of the flat battery as the substrate is provided on the flat battery (a sixth configuration). In this way, the battery unit having the substrate fixed on the flat battery can be reduced in size.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In one of the first to sixth configurations, a layered body including the flat battery and the substrate has at least a side surface covered with a resin material (a seventh configuration). In this way, the layered body including the flat battery and the substrate may have improved strength and the side surface of the layered body may have improved appearance.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In the seventh configuration, outer circumferential sides of both end surfaces of the layered body are covered with the resin material (an eighth configuration). In this way, the layered body may be held in the thickness-wise direction by the resin material, and the strength of the layered body may be further improved. In addition, in this way, a step as thick as the resin material forms at an end surface of the layered body, and therefore when the battery unit is provided for example on a flat board, the end surface of the battery unit (a substrate surface in particular) can be prevented from directly contacting the flat board. This further ensures that damage to the positive electrode terminal and the negative electrode terminal formed on the substrate can be prevented.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">An electrical device according to one embodiment of the present invention includes a case capable of storing the battery unit according to any one of first to eighth configurations, and the case has a plurality of openings from which the positive and negative electrode terminals of the battery unit are exposed (a ninth configuration).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the above-described configuration, the positive and negative electrode terminals of the battery unit are exposed to the case of the electrical device and therefore the battery unit can be charged while the battery unit is still mounted to the electrical device.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to one embodiment of the present invention, a battery unit as a whole that includes a flat battery and a substrate having a circuit thereon can be provided in a compact manner.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0020" num="0020"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a view of a general structure of a battery unit according to an embodiment of the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> is a top view of the battery unit.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> is a sectional view of a general structure of a flat battery.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> is a view of a general structure of a spacer.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref> shows how the battery unit is mounted on an electrical device.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref> shows how a circuit portion is formed in an example of a method of manufacturing a battery unit.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref> shows how a flat battery is assembled to a circuit portion in an example of a method of manufacturing a battery unit.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 8</figref> is a view of a general structure of a spacer for use in a battery unit according to a modification of the embodiment.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which the same or corresponding portions are designated by the same reference characters, and their description will not be repeated.</p><heading id="h0006">Overall Structure</heading><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a view of a general structure of a battery unit 1 according to an embodiment of the present invention. The battery unit 1 includes an integral arrangement of a coin shaped flat battery 2 and a circuit portion 3. The battery unit 1 is for example used as a power source for a small size device that uses a coin type battery such as a pedometer, a hearing aid, an electronic key for automobile, an IC tag, and a sensor unit.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> More specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, in the battery unit 1, the circuit portion 3 is provided on an upper surface of the flat battery 2 and adhesively fixed for example with an elastic adhesive. The circuit portion 3 has a size and a shape equal to those of the outer shape of the flat battery 2 as viewed in a direction in which the flat battery 2 and the circuit portion 3 are placed on each other. In this way, the flat battery 2 and the circuit portion 3 can be arranged in a compact manner in the thickness-wise direction while the battery unit 1 can have a size and a shape equal to those of the outer shape of the flat battery 2 as viewed in the direction in which the flat battery 2 and the circuit portion 3 are placed on each other. Note that the use of the elastic adhesive for adhering the flat battery 2 and the circuit portion 3 further ensures that even members having different thermal deformation amounts can be adhered with each other by the adhesive.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As will be described in detail, various terminals 66 to 69 (that will be described) are formed on a surface of a circuit substrate 61 of the circuit portion 3 on the opposite side to the flat battery 2. In this way, in the battery unit 1, while the flat battery 2 and the circuit portion 3 are assembled as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, only the terminals 66 to 69 are exposed as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>. (Only the output terminal 67 and the charging terminal 68 are shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.)</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a side surface of the layered body including the flat battery 2 and the circuit portion 3 fixed as they are layered on each other is covered with a tube 4 (resin member) of a thermally shrinkable resin material such as PET (polyethylene terephthalate). The tube 4 covers not only the side surface of the layered body but also outer circumferential sides of both end surfaces of the layered body (an outer circumferential side of the substrate 61 of the circuit portion 3 and an outer circumferential side of the bottom of the exterior can 10 of the flat battery 2). In this way, said layered body may have improved strength and the side surface of the layered body may have improved<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> appearance. A step as thick as the tube 4 forms at an end surface of the layered body, so that the terminals 66 to 69 formed at the outer surface of the circuit portion 3 positioned at the end surface of the layered body are provided on the inner side than the tube 4 and thus less prone to damage.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the following, referring to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figs. 1 to 4</figref>, the flat battery 2 and the circuit portion 3 will be described in detail.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, the flat battery 2 includes a positive electrode can 10 as a cylindrical exterior can with a bottom, a negative electrode can 20 as a sealing can that covers the opening of the positive electrode can 10, a gasket 30 provided between the outer circumferential side of the positive electrode can 10 and the outer circumferential side of the negative electrode can 20, and an electrode member 40 stored in a space formed between the positive electrode can 10 and the negative electrode can 20. Therefore, the flat battery 2 is formed to have a flat coin shape as a whole as the positive electrode can 10 and the negative electrode can 20 are joined. A non-aqueous electrolyte (not shown) is also enclosed in the space formed between the positive electrode can 10 and the negative electrode can 20 in addition to the electrode member 40. Note that according to the embodiment, the flat battery 2 is formed as a lithium ion battery.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The positive electrode can 10 is made of a metal material such as stainless steel and formed to have a cylindrical shape with a bottom for example by press-molding. The positive electrode can 10 includes the circular bottom 11 and a cylindrical circumferential wall 12 formed continuously with the bottom 11 at its outer circumference.
