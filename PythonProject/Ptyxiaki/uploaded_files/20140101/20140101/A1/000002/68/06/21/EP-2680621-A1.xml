Increasingly, many of these systems have wireless capability for communicating with other devices.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">One aspect relates to a computer-implemented method for using one or more media systems. According to the method, an input at a user device may be received for scheduling use of multiple media systems. The multiple media systems may be in a vehicle. A schedule of media system is generated at the user device use based on the input. Use instructions based on the media system use schedule may be transmitted so that use of the multiple media systems is enabled in accordance with the media system use schedule.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In some embodiments, data representing the schedule of media system use generated at the user device may be transmitted to a media system control module. The media system control module may store the schedule of media system use and transmit the use instructions to at least one media system of the multiple media systems based on the media system use schedule. In some embodiments, the media system control module may be a vehicle head unit. In other embodiments, the media system control module may be a consumer device.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In some embodiments, the use instructions may enable an automatic change to another media system of the multiple media systems based on the media system use schedule. The multiple media systems may include a radio (am/fm), satellite radio, a personal media player, a CD player, a DVD player, and the like.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In some embodiments, the schedule may include timings for playing specific media from the multiple media systems.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In some embodiments, the method may also include monitoring a period of time in order to instruct a media system change based on the media system use schedule. Upon a passage of the period of time, a media system change may be instructed.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Another aspect relates to a vehicle system for scheduling media system use. The system may include a vehicle computer, e.g., (and without limitation) a head unit. The vehicle computer may be configured to receive information establishing a schedule for using multiple media systems in a vehicle. The schedule may be stored in memory. A clock, such as (and without limitation) a vehicle clock, GPS clock, or satellite clock, may be monitored to determine when to transmit use instructions for at least one media system in the vehicle. The use instructions may be according to the media system use schedule. The use instructions may be transmitted based on the media system use schedule and a clock status to one or more of the multiple media system. Use of the multiple media systems may be enabled in accordance with the media system use schedule.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In some embodiments, the vehicle computer is further configured to receive user input at the vehicle computer defining a selection of the multiple media systems and the use schedule for the multiple media systems. The information received at the vehicle computer may includes the selection of the multiple media system and the user defined use schedule. Based on the information, the media system use schedule may be generated. The selection of multiple media system may be selected from a menu of standard media systems available in the vehicle.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In some embodiments, the vehicle computer may establish a connection with a user device. The information establishing the schedule may be received from the user device communicating with the vehicle computer.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In some embodiments, the use instructions may include instructions for changing from one media system to another media system.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In some embodiments, the vehicle computer may be further configured to determine, based on the clock and the media system use schedule, whether use of a currently used media system is complete. Instructions to suspend further use to the currently used media may be transmitted if use is complete.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In some embodiments, usage of one or more of the multiple media systems may be tracked. Based on the usage, use of at least one of the multiple media systems may be recommended. Additionally or alternatively, when one or more of the multiple media systems are<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> used may be stored in memory. Based on the timing information and the media system use schedule, a determination may be made if a scheduled media system is the same as the media system previously used at the same time. If not the same, a recommendation may be output to include the media system previously used at the same time.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Another aspect relates to a system for scheduling media system use in which the at least one computer is configured to receive information establishing a schedule for using multiple media systems in a vehicle. Usage characteristics of one or more media systems may be stored. A clock may be monitored to determine when to transmit use instructions for at least one media system in the vehicle. The monitoring may be performed according to the media system use schedule.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Based on the media system use schedule, the usage characteristics, and the clock, the computer may determine if a change to the media system use schedule is recommended. If recommended, a recommendation is output for a change to the media system use schedule. If the recommendation is accepted, the media system use schedule may be modified based on the recommendation. Media system use instructions based on the modified media system use schedule may be transmitted to one or more of the multiple media systems. Use of the multiple media systems may be enabled in accordance with the modified media system use schedule. The usage characteristic may include, but is not limited to, a frequency of use and/or a time of usage.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">The figures identified below are illustrative of some embodiments of the invention.

Further, the media systems may be in different locations such as in a home and in a vehicle. For example, a user may desire to listen to music in the morning from a CD player at home. On the commute to work, the user may desire to listen to the news on satellite radio in a vehicle. After the news program is over, the user may like to switch to a connected media player. On the commute home, the vehicle user may want to listen to the traffic report, which is<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> reported at a specific time, and then sports from the analog (am/fm) radio. Inconveniently, the vehicle user has to manually switch to each of these different media systems.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> illustrates a media system scheduling system for enabling use of the media systems based on the schedule. Using a user device 102, a user may input 100 one or more schedules for use of one or more media systems. The user device may or may not be portable. Non-limiting examples of a user device 102 may be a mobile phone, a tablet, a laptop, a personal media player, a desktop computer, or the like. The schedule(s) may be based on clock time and/or time periods. On the user device, a software application 104 may be stored which, when run from the user device 102, may provide an interface for enabling the user, from the user device 102, to input a schedule for utilizing the one or more media systems (described in further detail below). The schedule defines when a media system is switched for another and/or made active for use by the user.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The user device 102 may communicate with a media system control module 106 via a wired or wireless connection 108.

If the monitoring is performed at the module 106, the schedule may be output from the application 104 and transmitted from the user device 102. For example, the schedule may be transmitted to the module 106 after a connection is established between the user device 102 and the module 106. The schedule may be transmitted in response to manual input or automatically. The schedule may be stored on the module 106 and the tracking may occur at the module 106.
