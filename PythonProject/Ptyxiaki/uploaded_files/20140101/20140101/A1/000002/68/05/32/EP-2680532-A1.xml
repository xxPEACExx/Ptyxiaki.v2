One of these technologies, known as VNC (<i>Virtual Network Computing</i>), allows a user of a first device to access to a second remote device. A copy of the display of a second device is shown on the display of the first device, and the user of the first device can interact with the second device by making inputs on specific elements of the user interface of the first device (such as mouse/pointer button press, keyboard input, touch gestures, etc) that are communicated to the second device, which triggers commands according to these inputs. Other similar technologies include RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) and X11 Forwarding.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Such technologies comprise two components that, while requiring mutual synchronization, can be considered essentially independently. The first component is a means by which the display of a second remote device is shown in real-time on a first device, for example using some video display encoding and transmission algorithm designed to optimize the trade-off between the quality of the display shown on the first device and the network data bandwidth required between the two devices. The second component is a means by which inputs on specific elements of the user interface of the first device are captured and communicated as control messages to the second remote device, and then the commands intended to be triggered by the captured inputs are carried out by the second remote device as if these captured inputs had been directly captured by the user interface of the second remote device itself.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">There are many situations in which the user of a first local device may wish to take control of a second remote device. For example, it may be the case when the second remote device may have particularly high computing capabilities or specialized software and therefore its resources are shared between multiple users in a cost-efficient way by allowing remote access. It may be another case when a user may require to interact with a remote device in a fixed location no matter where he or she is, e.g. to interact with a remote device at work while at home or travelling. It may be a further case when the remote device may require maintenance or reconfiguration by a technician, and it is more efficient and cost effective to access the device remotely than to travel to access it locally.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Recently, compact mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets have been developed and become commercially very successful with hardware capabilities that rival those of conventional computer devices, and correspondingly their operating systems and software are becoming increasingly complex. Hence, there is a need for remote access capabilities also being available for such mobile devices. For example, a computer terminal user at the technical support call centre of a mobile operator, business or service provider may be able to remotely access the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> mobile devices of remote users in order to perform remote diagnosis and fix when the users of the mobile devices experience some trouble.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, the needs of the users of mobile devices to receive remote access services are not limited to troubleshooting call centre scenarios. For example, users may wish to receive remote guidance and coaching in the use of their devices - including, for example, the operating system itself, installed applications and web browser-based services. This remote guidance could take the form of actually performing the steps needed to achieve a certain objective on behalf of the remote mobile device user, but equally it could take the form of teaching the user how to perform those steps themselves.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Given this wide range of guidance scenarios, it is clear that there is a need for such remote access services to be provided not only by technical support call centre staff, but also by the users' friends, family, members of other social groups or other third-parties. For example, in order to avoid possible support fees, increase convenience and peace-of-mind, users may often prefer to seek guidance from a member of their own peer group rather than from an unknown professional.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Such peer group guidance would also allow for collaborative experiences between users and their guiders - for example jointly browsing items using an e-commerce application on the remote device, or co-browsing a web site using a browser application on the remote device - where both user and remote guider can simultaneously see the same view of the application, while the guider assists the user to navigate the application.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">However, no matter whether guidance is provided by a call centre or a member of the user's peer group, and despite the fact that the user may basically trust the person guiding them, many users may still feel uncomfortable about that person having complete control over their device, in case the remote guider (accidently or maliciously) is able to view or obtain private or confidential information available from the device (such as reading personal emails, bank account details, etc). Further, they may feel uncomfortable about the potential risk of being defrauded by a malicious actor posing as someone they trust, or some other potential vector by which unauthorized remote access by a third-party to the mobile device could be obtained.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Therefore, there is a strong need for technologies to solve these issues.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is then an objective of the present invention to overcome disadvantages and/or make improvements in the prior art.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In that respect, the present invention relates to a method of communication between a first device and a second device, the second device comprising a user interface with a display, the method comprising the following steps executed by the second device:
<ul><li>exchanging one or more messages with the first device in order to establish a communication session with the first device,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></li><li>on completion of the message exchange, establishment of a communication session in guidance mode, whereby the user of the first device will provide remote guidance to the user of the second device,<br/>
while in the guidance mode,</li><li>receiving, from the first device, a message comprising at least one parameter representing each of at least one input at a specific element of the user interface of the first device, where each input is intended to be applied to a specific element of the user interface of the second device in order to cause, as a result of the inputs, a command to be triggered on the second device,</li><li>determining, from the parameters in the received message, each input at a specific element of the user interface represented by the parameters,</li><li>identifying, from the inputs at specific elements of the user interface represented in the message, an action by the user of the first device that caused the inputs on specific elements of the user interface to occur</li><li>making an output that guides the user of the second device in the action to make the same inputs on specific elements of the user interface of the second device, and thus trigger the intended command on the second device.</li></ul></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Such a method of communication allows a user of the first device to guide a user of the second device to trigger a specific command on their device, without actually requiring direct control of the second device.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">When in the guidance mode, the display of the first device is showing a remote view of the display of the second device. The first device detects inputs on specific elements of the user interface of the first device, for example a touch input on a certain part of a touch screen, and at least one parameter representing each input on a specific element of the user interface is sent in a message to the second device.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Then, since the second device is in the guidance mode, and in contrast to prior-art technologies such as VNC, the second device does not inject the inputs on specific elements of the user interface determined from the parameters in the received message directly into its operating system (and hence, does not permit for the second device to be directly controlled by the first device). Instead, the second device identifies from the determined inputs on specific elements of the user interface an action (for example, a pinching action made with two fingers over certain parts of a touch screen) made by the user of the first device that caused the inputs on specific elements of the user interface to occur, and then makes an output (for example, a graphical animation, overlaid on the display in a position corresponding to where the inputs were made, of a computer-generated hand making the same action). This output guides the user of the second device to make the same action themselves, thus cause the corresponding inputs on specific elements of the user interface of the second device to occur, which therefore triggers the specific command on the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> second device that was intended by the user of the first device. In this way, a remote guidance service can be provided to the user of the second device, where only the user of the second device is able to make inputs that trigger commands on their device, and hence solving the issues described above. It will be understood hat step 4 above could alternatively be performed by the first device rather than the second device, if the first device were to be informed of the means by which the second device identifies a given gesture from certain parameters. In this case, the messages sent from the first device to the second device would allow the identified gestures to be determined and graphically represented by the second device. Such a method may be preferred where, for example, the processing capabilities of the first device are greater than those of the second device.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">It will also be understood by those normally skilled in the art that step 4 could be omitted altogether, and subsequently step 5 modified so that the second device displays a graphical representation of the input based on the parameters in the received message (rather than of the gesture identified from those inputs). For example, in the case that the guiding user of the first device makes input to a touch-screen, the graphical representation could take the form of a real-time pressure map overlaying the display of the second device. The guiding user of the first device may also be able to control the display of this graphical animation so that, for example, the animated pressure map sequence corresponding to the intended gesture may be repeated several times, or removed from view once shown. While such raw graphical representation of the inputs from the guiding user of the first device may offer less intuitive guidance from the point of view of the user of the second device, it may be preferred where, for example, the processing capability of both devices is low or a reduced-complexity implementation is desired, since the relatively complex step of identifying a gesture and creating a suitable graphical representation can be omitted.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The electronic device of the user may be, for example, a mobile phone, a smartphone, a tablet, a laptop, an e-reader, etc. The first and second devices comprise a display, and one or more means of physical input such as a keyboard or pointer (e.g. mouse). In some embodiments of the invention, the display and the means of physical input may be one and the same, as is the case for the example of touch-screens.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Thus, a specific element of the user interface can be a particular point or area on the display, which may correspond to specific graphical components on the display such as a text box or button, a particular key on a keyboard or pointer, etc.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">An input can be a press of a key or combination of keys on a keyboard, the press down or release of a button on the pointer, a press or other contact with a specific area of a touch-screen, activation of other input means of physical input such as accelerometer, microphone, gyroscope that form part of the device, etc.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A gesture can be one or more inputs that collectively are identified by software (operating system and/or an application) on a device as representing a specific command from a user, e.g. a swipe over an area of the screen that constitutes a command to scroll a view shown on the display, unlock the device etc. Other examples of such gestures include keystrokes, pointer button clicks, one or more simultaneous and/or consecutive presses on a touch-screen, and combinations of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> these with movements, giving rise to well-known commands such as clicking a user interface button, highlighting certain text, clutch or pinch touch gestures, and so on. Further, and in contrast to prior-art remote access technologies such as VNC, a gesture may also be one or more specified inputs by the guiding user of the first device that collectively are identified by the second device as representing any specified action that the user of the second device should take in order to achieve a particular objective in use of that device. For example, one or more inputs by the guiding user of the first device may be specified to represent a gesture to rotate the device by 90 degrees or depress one a special hardware button.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The method of displaying graphical representation of gestures on the display of the device, and the exact form of these graphical representations, is not material to the current invention. However, for the avoidance of any doubt, one exemplary method for a touch-screen device may involve first the determination of the physical movements of the user's hands that would be required to make the gesture with their device, second the creation of an artificial Computer Graphics animation of these movements observed from the approximate viewpoint of the user's eyes over the scope of the observed display, and third overlaying this animation on the device's display by, for example, blitting the non-transparent parts of this animated graphic completely or partially (e.g. with partial transparency) over the display frame-buffer of the device. In, for example, the case of non-touch-screen devices, or the latter type of gestures described above where the action is not an input to the display (e.g. to rotate the whole device by 90 degrees), other types of animation or graphical notifications may be displayed on the screen which are intuitive to guide the user as to what action to take.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the above method, there are no special consequences from whatever gestures the user of the second device may take. For example, if the user of the second device makes an incorrect gesture (i.e. that does not correspond to the animated gesture), the corresponding incorrect commands will still be executed by the second device, and the guiding user of the first device may have to make further gestures in order to (if possible) undo the previous incorrect gesture, which in some cases may be undesirable. Therefore, according to another characteristic of the invention, the method of communication further comprises, while in guidance mode, the steps of :

The error threshold is necessary because in practice, due to the high resolution of typical displays and input sensors, it is very difficult for the user of the second device to make inputs with parameters that precisely match those made by the guiding user of the first device, and generally unnecessary since the same commands will be executed if they are adequately similar.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Note that there is no compulsion on the user of the second device to make any gesture at all, and normally they would be able to terminate the guidance session at any time, so the benefits of avoiding full remote control of the second device are preserved while the guidance session may be more efficient since the chance of incorrect gestures being made is reduced. In addition, the user of the second device may also have the chance to efficiently practice making a gesture several times, without the risk of making a mistake while they are learning.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the above methods, while the user of the first device may be able to deduce whether or not the gestures being made by the user of the second device are correct or not by observing if the corresponding commands are carried out through remote observation of the display (possibly in combination with voice discussion in a simultaneous phone call), in some cases the user of the first device may have difficulty to make the correct gestures and it may be difficult for the user of the first device to know what the user is doing wrong and how to correct him/her. Therefore, according to another characteristic of the invention, the method of communication comprises, following the establishment of a session in step (2), and concurrent with the steps carried out while in guidance mode, the steps of:

For example, in the case of input to the touch-screen, this may be displayed overlaid on the remote view shown on the first device in the form of a real-time pressure map. As such, the guiding user of the first device can thoroughly and intuitively understand the inputs that the user of the second device is making, and hence guide the user how to modify these inputs to form the correct gesture that is required.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the above methods, while the risk of incorrect gestures being made by the user of the second device is reduced, effective guidance is conditional on the ability of the user of the second device to (at least eventually) be able to make the correct gestures. While in many cases this may be the desired behavior, in certain cases, such as when the user of the second device is physically disabled, it may be very difficult and frustrating for them to correctly make these gestures by themselves. Therefore, according to another characteristic of the invention, the method of communication comprises, after the step of displaying the graphical representation of the input on a specific element of a user interface, a step of :

Since it is much easier for the user of the second device to press a button rather than make a particularly complicated gesture, even physically disabled users could be efficiently guided.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Note that there is no compulsion on the user of the second device to make an input on this other specific element (e.g. button), and normally they would be able to terminate the guidance session at any time, so the benefits of avoiding full remote control of the second device are preserved while the guidance session may be more efficient since the necessity for the user of the second device to accurately make the intended gestures is removed.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">One object of the invention concerns computer programs, in particular computer programs on or in an information medium or memory, suitable for implementing the methods of communication object of the invention.
