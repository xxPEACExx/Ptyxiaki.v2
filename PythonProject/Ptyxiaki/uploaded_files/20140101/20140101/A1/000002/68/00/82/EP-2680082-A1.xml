The formed electrostatic latent image is then developed with a toner to form a toner image. The formed toner image is further transferred onto a recording medium to obtain an image with high quality. For forming the toner image, typically, toner particles (toner base particles) with an average particle diameter of from 5 µm to 10 µm are used, which are obtained by mixing a binder resin, such as a thermoplastic resin, with toner components such as a colorant, a charge control agent, a release agent, a magnetic material, and then by subjecting the mixture to a kneading step, a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> pulverizing step, and a classifying step. In order to provide flowability and preferable electrostatic properties to the toner and/or to provide easy cleaning ability of the toner from the photosensitive drum surface, silica and/or inorganic fine particles such as those of titanium oxide are externally added to the toner base particles.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Such a toner is desired to have excellent fixability at low temperatures, which can be properly fixed without heating a fixing roller as much as possible, in terms of saving energy and the minimization of devices. In the production of a toner having excellent fixability at low temperatures, however, binder resins having a low melting point or a low glass transition point, or release agents having a low melting point are often used. For that reason, there are disadvantages in which such a toner is easily aggregated when it is stored at a high temperature, or filming easily occurs. The filming refers to a phenomenon in which a part of components contained in the toner are melted and they adhere to a surface of a latent image bearing member.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In order to obtain a toner capable of both suppressing filming and forming an image having a desired image density with good image quality, a method for producing a toner is proposed in which a binder resin including a polyester resin having units derived from a polyvalent carboxylic acid in a pre-determined amount, and having specific physical properties is neutralized and emulsified in an aqueous medium to thereby obtain a resin emulsion, and then resin fine particles in the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> resin emulsion are aggregated and coalesced to obtain a toner.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The method described above, however, has a problem that it is difficult to contain a sufficient amount of a release agent in toner particles. For this reason, according to the method described above, it is difficult to obtain a toner which can be properly fixed across a wide range of temperatures.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">Toner particles in a toner for electrostatic latent image development according to a first aspect of the present disclosure are formed by aggregating fine particles containing a binder resin and fine particles containing a release agent in an aqueous medium to form aggregated particles, or by aggregating fine particles containing a binder resin and a release agent in an aqueous medium to form aggregated particles, and heating the resulting aggregated particles in an aqueous medium to coalesce components contained in the aggregated particles.

The toner for electrostatic latent image development includes toner particles and the toner particles are formed by aggregating fine particles containing a binder resin and fine particles containing a release agent in an aqueous medium to form aggregated particles, or by aggregating fine particles containing a binder resin and a release agent in an aqueous medium to form aggregated particles, and heating the resulting aggregated particles in an aqueous medium to coalesce components contained in the aggregated particles. The toner particle contains a polyester resin as the binder resin. The component ratio of oligomers having a molecular weight of 1000 or less<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> in the toner, measured in a pre-determined method, is 1000 mass ppm or less. In the present disclosure, the toner may consist of only toner particles or consist of toner particles and one or more components other than toner particles.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The toner particles in the toner of the first embodiment may contain optional components such as a colorant, a charge control agent and a magnetic powder, in addition to the binder resin and the release agent. The toner particles may have an external additive which is attached to the surface thereof, as required. The toner may be mixed with a desired carrier and used as a two-component developer. The binder resin, the release agent, the colorant, the charge control agent, the magnetic powder, and the external additive, which are essential or optional components of the toner particles in the toner of the first embodiment, and the carries, which are employed when the toner is used as the two-component developer, are explained below in order.</p><heading id="h0007">[Binder Resin]</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">The toner particles in the toner of the present disclosure contain a polyester resin as the binder resin. The toner particles in the toner of the present disclosure has a component ratio of oligomers having a molecular weight of 1000 or less, which is measured in a pre-determined method, of 1000 mass ppm or less. Therefore, a polyester resin whose component ratio of oligomers having a molecular weight of 1000 or less is decreased is used as the binder resin contained in the toner particles in the toner according to the first embodiment.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">When the toner particles are prepared using the polyester resin as the binder resin, a toner, which can be properly fixed at a wide temperature range and has excellent chromogenics, is easily produced. The polyester resin can be appropriately selected from polyester resins which have hitherto been used as a binder resin for toner. A polyester resin obtained by employing a method of condensation polymerization or co-condensation polymerization of an alcohol component and a carboxylic acid component can be used as the polyester resin. Components used in the synthesis of the polyester resin are exemplified by the following dihydric or tri- or more-hydric alcohol components and by bivalent or tri-or more-valent carboxylic acid components.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Specific examples of the divalent, trivalent or higher-valent alcohol components may be exemplified by diols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,2-propylene glycol, 1,3-propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, neopentyl glycol, 1,4-butenediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,4-cyclohexane dimethanol, dipropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, and polytetramethylene glycol; bisphenols such as bisphenol A, hydrogenated bisphenol A, polyoxyethylenated bisphenol A, and polyoxypropylenated bisphenol A; and trivalent or higher-valent alcohols such as sorbitol, 1,2,3,6-hexanetetrol, 1,4-sorbitane, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, tripentaerythritol, 1,2,4-butanetriol, 1,2,5-pentanetriol, glycerol, diglycerol, 2-methylpropanetriol, 2-methyl-1,2,4-butanetriol,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane, and 1,3,5-trihydroxymethylbenzene.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Specific examples of the divalent, trivalent or higher-valent carboxylic acid components include divalent carboxylic acids such as maleic acid, fumaric acid, citraconic acid, itaconic acid, glutaconic acid, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, azealic acid, 1,10-decanedicarboxylic acid, malonic acid, or alkyl or alkenyl succinic acids including n-butyl succinic acid, n-butenyl succinic acid, isobutylsuccinic acid, isobutenylsuccinic acid, n-octylsuccinic acid, n-octenylsuccinic acid, n-dodecylsuccinic acid, n-dodecenylsuccinic acid, isododecylsuccinic acid, isododecenylsuccinic acid; and trivalent or higher-valent carboxylic acids such as 1,2,4-benzene tricarboxylic acid (trimellitic acid), 1,2,5-benzene tricarboxylic acid, 2,5,7-naphthalene tricarboxylic acid, 1,2,4-naphthalene tricarboxylic acid, 1,2,4-butane tricarboxylic acid, 1,2,5-hexane tricarboxylic acid, 1,3-dicarboxyl-2-methyl-2-methylene carboxypropane, 1,2,4-cyclohexane tricarboxylic acid, tetra(methylenecarboxyl)methane, 1,2,7,8-octanetetracarboxylic acid, pyromellitic acid, and Enpol trimer. These divalent, trivalent or higher-valent carboxylic acids may be used as ester-forming derivatives such as an acid halide, an acid anhydride, and a lower alkyl ester. Here, the term "lower alkyl" means an alkyl group of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The polyester resin has preferably an acid value of 10 mg KOH/g or more and 40 mg KOH/g or less. When toner particles are produced using a polyester resin whose acid value is too low, the aggregation of fine particles may be improperly advanced depending on the formulation in a step (II) described below. A toner, which includes toner particles containing a polyester resin whose acid value is too high as the binder resin, may possibly have impaired toner properties under high humidity conditions due to the moisture. The acid value of the polyester resin can be controlled by controlling a balance of hydroxyl groups in the alcohol component, and carboxyl groups in the carboxylic acid component, used in the synthesis of the polyester resin.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The polyester resin has preferably a softening point of 70°C or higher and 140°C or lower. In cases of using a toner, which includes toner particles containing a polyester resin with an excessively high softening point as the binder resin, it may be difficult to properly fix the toner at lower temperatures. In cases of using a toner, which includes toner particles containing a polyester resin with an excessively low softening point as the binder resin, heat-resistant storage stability may degrade such that the toner agglomerates during storage at higher temperatures. The softening point of the polyester resin can be measured in accordance with the method below.</p><heading id="h0008">Method of Measuring Softening Point</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">The softening point of the polyester resin (toner) is<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> measured using an elevated flow tester (CFT-500D, manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation). A polyester resin of 1.5 g is used as a sample, and a die of 1.00 mm height and 1.00 mm diameter is used. Measurement is performed under conditions of a temperature-increase rate 4°C/min, pre-heat time 300 seconds, load 5kg, and measuring temperature range from 60°C to 200°C.

The ratio of an area of a part of RVS or less on the low molecule side to the whole area of the peak of the GPC chromatogram is calculated. In this step, a differential refractometer is usually used as the detector, but only an oligomer part is separately fractionated by a preparative liquid chromatography, and the monomer composition of the oligomer part is detected by using an apparatus including thermal cracking gas chromatography, an infrared spectrophotometer, or a proton nuclear magnetic resonance measuring apparatus. At this time, when the composition of the oligomer part is the same as the composition of the whole copolymer, it can be assumed that there is no difference in the index of refraction between the oligomer part and the whole copolymer, and a peak area ratio of the oligomer part to the whole copolymer can be expressed as a mass ratio of the oligomer part to the whole copolymer.
