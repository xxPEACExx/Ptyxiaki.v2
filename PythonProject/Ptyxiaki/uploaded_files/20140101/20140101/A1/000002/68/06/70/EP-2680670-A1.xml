Since LED elements are small, various types of LED elements may be combined to form a variable color unit.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A lighting device including an LED is often designed to have a general color rendering index of 80 or greater to satisfy the indoor lighting conditions specified by Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) Z9110:2004. The general color rendering index Ra is used to quantitatively evaluate the level a color can be truly reproduced under a subject light source in comparison with a reference light. Thus, when a light source has a high general color rendering index Ra, the light source ensures reproduction of a color appearance under the reference light. However, when the plane of a paper appears to be colored by light of various colors, the general color rendering index Ra cannot be used to evaluate the light source. Thus, even when the general color rendering index Ra is high, the plane of a paper may appear to be colored. This may decrease the contrast between characters and the background and make it difficult to read characters.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Accordingly, it is desirable that the whiteness of a paper plane be quantitatively evaluated to provide light that is suitable for reading. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2002013982A"><text>2002-13982</text></patcit> describes a method for calculating the whiteness level from the spectrum of a fluorescent lamp. The whiteness level is used as an index quantitatively indicating the whiteness of a paper plane under lighting. In Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2002013982A"><text>2002-13982</text></patcit>, a lighting device uses a fluorescent lamp as a light source, and the chromaticity range is limited to the proximity of 5000 K and the proximity of 8000 K in correlated color temperature.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, the lighting device of the publication uses the fluorescent lamp as the light source and has a spectrum that differs greatly from a lighting device that uses an LED as a light source. Thus, it is difficult to directly apply an LED element to the above light device. Further, as described above, when a colored light is evaluated with only the general color rendering index Ra, the paper plane may appear to be colored making it difficult to read characters. When increasing only the whiteness of a paper plane under lighting, a low general color rendering index Ra may lower the reproductivity of chromatic colors and result in colors appearing strange to a user.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to provide a lighting device that improves the visibility of characters on a viewed subject by increasing the whiteness of the viewed subject under lighting while maintaining high color rendering.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">One aspect of the present invention is a lighting device provided with an LED light source including a light bulb color LED, a blue LED, and a green LED.

The chroma calculated value is obtained by performing a calculation specified by CIECAM97s, and the chroma value indicates the colorfulness intensity. A color having a lower chroma value has low colorfulness and is perceived as having a high whiteness.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As apparent from <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, a wavelength range effective for a chroma decrease is from approximately 415 nm to approximately 495 nm, preferably, from 455 nm to 475 nm, and more preferably, from 460 nm to 470 nm.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The inventor of the present invention conducted a subjective evaluation test to check the easiness for reading characters on a viewed subject (e.g., paper plane) based on whiteness under a lighting, that is, to check improvements in legibility. The test was conducted on five persons, or test subjects. A liquid crystal filter was added to a xenon lamp and a testing device realizing a certain spectral distribution was used to reproduce reference light with a conventional white LED having a color temperature of 5000 K. The testing device was used to reproduce three types of light having the color temperatures of 3000 K, 5000 K, and 6700 K as test light having a spectrum realized by adding a blue LED having a peak wavelength at 470 nm and a green LED having a peak wavelength at 530 nm to a white LED having a color temperature of 2800 K. The reference light and the test light were set to an illuminance of 300 Ix. The viewed subject of the test was a newspaper, and the distance between the test subject and the newspaper (viewing distance) was set to 50 cm. Each test subject was given five minutes to adapt to the surrounding environment and then fifty seconds to adapt to the reference light. Then, the test subject was given ten seconds to read the same section of the newspaper. Here, a magnitude estimation method was used to evaluate the legibility of the newspaper in which the color appearance under the reference light was expressed by 100. The test subject gave a number higher than 100 when the newspaper was easier to read than under the reference light and a number lower than 100 when the newspaper was harder to read than under the reference light. At the same time as when the evaluation test was conducted, the test subject gave a five-grade evaluation on the legibility in which the test subject evaluated the easiness to read was graded as "extremely easy to read," "rather easy to read," "can be read normally," "rather difficult to read," and "extremely difficult to read."</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 6</figref> shows the results of the subjective evaluation test conducted in accordance with the magnitude estimation method. The horizontal axis in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 6</figref> represents the chroma difference of the newspaper, and the vertical axis represents the evaluation value of the legibility. An assessment of the significance difference (P&lt;0.05) indicated a significant difference in legibility between 3000 K, 5000 K, and 6700 K. Further, the simultaneously conducted five-grade evaluation indicated that the correlation with the magnitude evaluation value was high. Due to the correlation, the magnitude evaluation value of approximately "100" corresponded to "can be read normally" in the five-grade evaluation and the magnitude evaluation value of approximately "110" corresponded to "rather easy to read" in the five-grade evaluation. More specifically,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> between 5000 K and 6700 K, 80% of the test subjects changed their five-grade evaluation from "can be read normally" to "rather easy to read" or higher. In this case, the chroma difference was approximately 2.4.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Consequently, it may be understood that the whiteness of a viewed subject under lighting increases when the chroma value decreases, thereby improving the easiness to read characters on the viewed subject (legibility). It may also be understood that the test subjects perceived a difference in legibility between light colors.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 8</figref> shows a chart, for each correlated color temperature, of the chroma calculation result in accordance with CIECAM97s under the lighting of the LED module 12 obtained by adding a combination of a B wavelength (blue LED 32) and a G wavelength (green LED 33) to the white LED 31 having the color temperature of 2800 K. In <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 8</figref>, the solid lines show the chroma value of the LED module 12, the dotted lines show the chroma value of the light bulb color white LED 31, and the single-dashed lines show the chroma value of a typical white LED formed by combining a YAG fluorescent body with a blue LED having a color temperature of 4200 K, 5200 K, and 7200 K.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 8</figref>, the chroma value is approximately 17 for the light bulb color white LED 31 having a color temperature of approximately 2800 K. In the range in which the color temperature is 4200 K or greater, the chroma value of the LED module 12 is approximately 12 or less, and the chroma value is decreased by about 5. Thus, an improvement in the legibility can be recognized. When the correlated color temperature is the same, light having a Duv, which represents a color shift (shift from Planckian locus), in the range from approximately ±3 is generally recognized as having a similar light color.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Further, it can be understood from <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 8</figref> that the spectral distribution of the LED module 12 obtained by adding the blue LED 32 and the green LED 33 to the white LED 31 having a color temperature of 2800 K has a lower chroma value than a typical, commercially available white LED (combination of blue LED and YAG fluorescent body). When the chroma value of the LED module 12 is low, the whiteness of a viewed subject is higher under the lighting of the LED module 12. This improves the legibility of characters on the viewed subject.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 9</figref> shows the calculation result of the general color rendering index Ra of the LED module 12 obtained by adding the combination of the B wavelength (blue LED 32) and the G wavelength (green LED 33) to the white LED 31 having the color temperature of 2800 K. In <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 9</figref>, the solid lines show the general color rendering index Ra of the LED module 12, and the dotted lines show the general color rendering index Ra of 80. As apparent from <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 9</figref>, in accordance with the correlated color temperature, the combination of the B wavelength (blue LED 32) and the G wavelength (green LED 33) is restricted when satisfying the condition of a general color rendering index Ra that is greater than or equal to 80.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Based on the results shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figs. 8</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">9</figref>, with regard to the wavelength combination of the blue LED 32 and the green LED 33 added to the white LED 31, the inventor of the present invention has studied the chroma value and color rendering for other color temperatures (4400 K, 5300 K, and 7100 K). The results are shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 10</figref>. In each box of <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 10</figref>, a circle at the left side indicates that the general color rendering index Ra was 80 or greater, and a cross at the left side indicates that the general color rendering index Ra was less than 80. Further, in each box of <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 10</figref>, a circle at the right side indicates that the chroma value for the combination of a light bulb color white LED, a blue LED, and a green LED is lower than the chroma value for a typical white LED. A cross at the right side indicates that the chroma value for the combination of the light bulb color white LED, the blue LED, and the green LED is greater than or equal to the chroma value for the typical white LED. Thus, a box containing two circles indicates a range in<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> which the reading easiness (legibility) and the color appearance have both been improved.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The results show that when the correlated color temperature is in the range from 3250 K to 4400 K and the color shift Duv is in the range from 3 to -3, the reading easiness and the color appearance may both be improved by adding, to the light bulb color white LED 31, the combination of the blue LED 32 having a peak wavelength in the range from 450 nm to 480 nm and the green LED 33 having a peak wavelength in the range from 505 nm to 530 nm.

Here, JIS Z9112:2004 specifies the upper limit (7100 K) of the color temperature of daylight color, which is a light color classification of a relatively high color temperature, as the light color for white light. In the present embodiment, this upper limit is specified as the upper limit for the color temperature of the LED module 12. When further decreasing the chroma (increase whiteness), it is preferable that the blue LED 32 have a peak wavelength in the range from 455 nm to 465 nm.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Since the blue LED 32 and the green LED 33 are added to the light bulb color white LED, the luminous flux may be set to be low at a low color temperature and set to be high at a high color temperature. Generally, a light color having a low color temperature is used for a relaxing situation, and a light color having a high color temperature is used for a reading situation. These situations have different desirable illuminance levels. Low illuminance is desirable for a relaxing situation, and high illuminance is desirable for a reading situation. Thus, when adding the blue LED 32 and the green LED 33 to the light bulb color white LED 31, at a high color temperature, the legibility of characters resulting from the whiteness of a paper plane and the illuminance may be drastically improved.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The lighting device of the present embodiment has the advantages described below.
