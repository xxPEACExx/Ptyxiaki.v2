Such wire faults may include physical damage to the wires (also known as cable damage) and signal leakage (for example, due to improper shielding of wires). Cable damage may cause an impedance mismatch in the system and signal leakage may cause interference in the system.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Such wire faults may impact service quality. For example, in a television network, such as a cable-based television network, an impedance mismatch (which may be caused, for example, due to cable damage) may create a micro-reflection which may result in ghosting of the video. That is, a second image, which is offset in time and amplitude, may appear to the right of the incident signal.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Wire faults may also cause service quality problems to arise in other types of wired networks. For example, for Internet service provider (ISP) systems, wire faults may cause packets to be dropped and throughput to be slowed down. In telephone networks, wire faults may cause micro-reflections which result in dropped packets and the occurrence of voice interrupts and echoes.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Wire fault detection has previously been a laborious process. For example, where cable damage is suspected, a long stretch of cable may be manually inspected in order to identify the location of the fault. This can be particularly time consuming in networks where cables are buried.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of an example wired network in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of an example customer equipment device in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart of a method for detecting a wire fault in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates example tap energies and example groups created using those tap energies;</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart of a method for detecting a wire fault in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart of a method for detecting a wire fault in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates example groups and new groups in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Like reference numerals are used in the drawings to denote like elements and features.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</u></b></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">In one aspect, the present disclosure describes a processor implemented method of detecting a wire fault in a wired network.

The wired network 100 may be a service provider network which provides one or more services to subscribers in the wired network 100. For example, in some embodiments, the wired network 100 may be a content delivery system which is configured to deliver content from a content source system to a content destination. The content delivery system may, for example, be a broadcast television system which delivers television content such as broadcast television shows.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The wired network 100 may, in some embodiments, act as in Internet service provider (ISP) to allow a plurality of subscribers connected to the wired network 100 to access the Internet. For example, a modem associated with a subscriber may be used to send and receive data packets to online servers or systems. In some embodiments, the ISP system may be a cable Internet system which is configured to provide broadband Internet access over a cable television infrastructure. For example, in at least some embodiments, the wired network 100 may be configured to deliver services accordingly to the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS). DOCSIS is an international telecommunications standard that permits high-speed data transfer to occur over cable TV (CATV) infrastructure. Accordingly, in at least some embodiments, components of the wired network 100 described below may be configured to operate according to the DOCSIS specification. It will be appreciated that other specifications may be used in other embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, the ISP system may be a digital subscriber line (DSL) system which is configured to provide Internet access over the wires of a local telephone network.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In some embodiments, the wired network 100 may be configured for providing telephone services. That is, the wired network 100 may provide telephone services to a plurality of subscribers connected to the wired network. The telephone services may, in some embodiments, be voice over internet protocol (VOIP) services. In<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> other embodiments, the wired network 100 may be a traditional telephone network which may, for example, utilize copper wires.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">It will be appreciated that the wired network 100 may, in at least some embodiments, provide a plurality of subscription based services. For example, the wired network 100 may provide any combination of Internet, telephone, television, or other services.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The wired network 100 includes back-end systems which provide services to subscribers. In the example illustrated, the back-end system is referred to as a head end system 102. The specific configuration of the back-end systems will depend on the nature of the services provided by the wired network 100 and on the specific wired network 100 technology.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">For example, as noted above, the wired network 100 may be configured for providing content delivery services to subscribers. In some embodiments, the wired network 100 may be configured to deliver television programming. In at least some such embodiments, the head end system 102 is configured to deliver content to a customer equipment (CE) device 104, such as a receiver. A receiver may be connected to a media player, such as a television, on which content received at the receiver may be displayed. In at least some example embodiments, the receiver, or parts thereof, may be internal to a media player (e.g. the television). For example, a receiver may be a component of a television which is included in the television at the time of manufacture. In other embodiments, a receiver may be an external receiver which is connected to the media player (e.g. the television) through a wired or wireless transport medium.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">One or more of the receivers which are serviced by the head end system 102 may, in at least some example embodiments, be a set top box. A set top box is a device which connects to a television (or other display) and an external source of signal, turning the signal into content which may be displayed on the television (or other display). The term set top box includes devices which do not, necessarily, sit on top of a television. That is, the term set top box may refer to any device which is external to a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> television (or other display) and which receives an external signal, turns the signal into content and displays the signal on the display. The receivers may also take other forms including, for example, a gaming console, a cable card, a personal computer, a tablet device, a smartphone, etc. The receivers may be any electronic devices at which content from a head end system 102 may be received.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Where the wired network 100 is configured to deliver content to subscribers, the head end system 102 may include or connect to a content acquisition system 115. The content acquisition system 115 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrated as a plurality of satellite dishes. Such satellite dishes may be configured to receive content from one or more satellites. In various embodiments, the content acquisition system 115 may be configured to receive content through other means instead of, or in addition to, the satellite dishes. For example, the content acquisition system 115 may include one or more antennas which receive radio frequency signals, such as signals transmitted through a terrestrial based network. In at least some embodiments, the content acquisition system 115 may be configured to receive content through a network, such as the Internet. In at least some embodiments, the content acquisition system 115 may be configured to receive content though a wired transport medium such as, for example, a cable. The cable may, in some example embodiments, include a coaxial cable and/or a fibre optic cable. The content received through the content acquisition system 115 may include, for example, broadcast content which may be received in streaming fashion from one or more television networks. Such content may be referred to as source broadcast streams.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In order to prevent unauthorized access to content (such as source broadcast streams), such content may be scrambled or otherwise encrypted. The head end system 102 may receive scrambled and/or encrypted content (such as encrypted source broadcast streams). Such encrypted and/or scrambled content may, for example, be received at the content acquisition system 115. The head end system 102 may be configured to decrypt or decode such content.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As also noted above, in some embodiments, the wired network 100 may be configured to provide Internet services to subscribers. In some such embodiments, the head end system 102 may be configured to provide such Internet services. More particularly, the head end system 102 may connect to the Internet 117 and may include or be connected to subsystems which may be useful for providing Internet services to subscribers. Such subsystems may, for example, include a domain name server (DNS), routers, and other subsystems.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In embodiments in which the head end system 102 is configured to provide Internet services, the head end system 102 may provide the Internet services to customer equipment (CE) device 104 which may be referred to as modems. For example, a subscriber may be associated with a cable or DSL modem which sends data to and receives data from the Internet via the back end systems of the wired network 100 (such as the head end system 102).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In some embodiments, the wired network 100 may be configured to provide telephone services to subscribers. Accordingly, the head end system 102 may be configured to support such telephone services. For example, the head end system 102 may be connected to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) 119. In embodiments in which the head end system 102 provides VolP telephone services, the head end system 102 may be configured to map a phone number associated with a subscriber to an IP address associated with customer equipment device 104 for that subscriber. For example, the phone number may be mapped to an IP address for an IP phone associated with the subscriber.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The head end system 102 may be owned and/or operated by a service provider such as a content service provider (e.g. a television service provider), a telephone service provider and/or an Internet service provider.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In the example embodiment illustrated, the back end system which provides the services is referred to as a head end system 102 and the system for which the services are provided is referred to as customer equipment (CE) device 104.

Similarly, the head end system 102 and the customer equipment devices 104 are configured to provide for upstream communications from one or more of the customer equipment devices 104 to the head end system 102 (and/or other components of the wired network 100). The upstream communications (i.e. communications originating from a customer equipment device 104 which are sent to the head end system 102) may operate on the same transport mediums 195, 197, 199 and/or transport protocol as the downstream communications (downstream communications are communications originating from the head end system 102 which are sent to one or more customer equipment devices 104). For example, in a wired television system, such as a cable television system, communications originating from a customer equipment device 104 may be sent to the head end system 102 through the wired transport mediums 195, 197, 199.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The upstream communications permit the customer equipment devices 104 to communicate with the head end system 102.

Such pre-equalization coefficients may be used to detect wire faults 121 such as physical damage to wired transport mediums 195, 197, 199 in the wired network 100 and, in at least some embodiments, to estimate the location of the wire fault.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">To detect such wire faults 121, in at least some embodiments, the wired network 100 may include or be connected to a fault detection system 116.

However, it will be appreciated that the fault detection system 116 may be located in other components within the wired network 100 or may be a separate stand-alone system operating within or connected to the wired network 100. For example, in some embodiments, fault detection systems 116 are included in the termination systems 113.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The fault detection system 116 will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">FIGs. 2 to 7</figref>.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">An example wire fault 121 has been shown in a wired transport medium 197 in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.

As will be discussed in greater detail below, the fault detection system 116 may be used to detect the existence of a wire fault 121 and, in at least some embodiments, to detect the location of the wire fault 121. More particularly, since the wire fault 121 affects a plurality of customer equipment devices 104, the wire fault may be detected by observing how the customer equipment devices 104 are compensating for micro-reflections.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The wire fault 121 may, in at least some embodiments, cause a micro-reflection to occur in the wired network 100. A micro-reflection is a copy of a communication signal. A micro-reflection may occur when an upstream signal (i.e. a signal sent from a customer equipment device 104) encounters an impedance mismatch somewhere in its upstream path. For example, an impedance mismatch caused by a wire fault may be encountered. This impedance mismatch may cause redirection of a fraction of the signal's energy back towards the customer equipment device 104.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">To detect such micro-reflections (and thus, to detect wire faults), operators of wired networks 100 typically summarize calls from customers at specific areas and then field technicians use instruments to verify possible damage spots in the signal path. Such techniques are inefficient and time consuming. Other techniques have been proposed for automatically identifying wire faults. However, prior methods require a<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> huge amount of time to analyze data. More particularly, prior methods have used required a frequency domain division of one customer equipment devices frequency domain with another customer equipment devices frequency domain. If the two responses are exactly the same, a resulting quotient frequency response will be unity at all frequencies with a flat phase response at zero degrees. The customer equipment devices frequency domain is calculated with FFT128 with a set of coefficients. A 128 point fast fourier transform (FFT) is used to find an impulse response associated with the frequency domain. The technique involves comparing all customer equipment devices 104 using a 128 point FFT.

More particularly, these taps are excluded from selection.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Similarly, in some equalizers, some of the taps (e.g. T9 and T10) may be used to correct for on-premises wire issues. On-premises wire issues, which may also be referred to as in-home wire issues, are problems that are caused at a specific subscriber's location and which would not be expected to affect other customer equipment devices 104. In at least some embodiments, the taps that are used to correct for on-premises wire issues are ignored at 310. More particularly, these taps are excluded from selection. In some embodiments, two taps may be used for correcting for on-premises wire issues.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Thus, in at least some embodiments, at 310 the fault detection system 116 selects the lowest order tap that is used to correct for micro-reflections in the wired network 100 (i.e. micro-reflections which may be caused by wire problems in a shared portion of the wired network 100) and ignores taps that are not used to correct for micro-reflections in the wired network (such as taps used to correct for group delay and on-premises wire issues).</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">At 312, the fault detection system 116 defines groups for the selected tap. For example, in some embodiments the fault detection system 116 may examine the tap energies for the selected tap for a plurality of the customer equipment devices 104 (e.g. for all of the customer equipment devices 104 from which pre-equalization coefficients were obtained at 302 or for a selected subset of those customer equipment<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> devices 104). As will be described in greater detail below, these groups will be used for grouping customer equipment devices based on tap energy.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">In at least some embodiments, the fault detection system 116 is configured to prevent a customer equipment device 104 from being assigned to a group based on a tap energy if the tap energy for the customer equipment device is outside of a minimum threshold. The minimum threshold may, for example, be a number in the range of -35dB to -45dB. In some embodiments, the minimum threshold is -40dB. If a tap energy is less than the minimum threshold, then that tap energy may not be assigned to a group.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">In order to exclude tap energies that are outside of this minimum threshold, the groups defined at 312 may be defined to exclude the tap energies that are outside of the minimum thresholds. For example, in at least some embodiments, the fault detection system 116 identifies the tap energy at the selected tap that is closest to the minimum threshold without being outside of the minimum threshold.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">Referring briefly to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, the group definition procedure which may be performed at 312 will be described in greater detail with reference to the example data of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>. In the example, the ninth tap T9 operates as a selected tap 404. That is, the ninth tap T9 is selected at 310. A minimum threshold of -40dB may be used for the purposes of the example. Two tap energies for the selected tap fall outside of this minimum threshold. These are illustrated using shading and have values of-46.93 and - 42.63 in the example (a first excluded value 406 has been labelled for illustrative purposes). These tap energies are excluded from consideration since they are determined to be too low to represent a problem in the wired network 100. The fault detection system 116 identifies the tap energy at the selected tap 404 that is closest to the minimum threshold but not outside of the minimum threshold. This tap energy forms a first threshold 409 for a first group (which is labelled group 1 in the example). In the example,38.24 is selected.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">The fault detection system 116 also identifies a maximum tap energy 408 for the selected tap 404. In the example illustrated, the maximum tap energy 408 is -26.59.<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> Then, the fault detection system 116 uses a predetermined group range 422 (which is 5 dB in the example) to define thresholds for the groups. As noted above, a first threshold 409 has already been defined for the first group (group 1 in the example given). Using this first threshold 409 and the predetermined group range 422, a second threshold 421 for the first group is determined (in the example the second threshold is - 33.24dB). This second threshold 421 for the first group also acts as a first threshold for the second group. Then, another threshold 423 (-28.24dB in the example) for the second group is determined using the first threshold for the second group and the predetermined group range 422. This process of determining thresholds is repeated until a maximum threshold 420 is reached that is higher than the maximum tap energy 408. In the example, the maximum threshold 420 energy of -23.24 is greater than the maximum tap energy 408 of -26.59; thus, the group definition process ends. Thus, groups are defined such that every tap energy greater than the minimum threshold will fall within the range of a group.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">It will be appreciated that other techniques for defining groups may be used in other embodiments. For example, in at least some embodiments, the group thresholds may be predetermined.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Referring again to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, at 314 customer equipment devices 104 are assigned to groups. More particularly, each of a plurality of the customer equipment devices 104 may be assigned to one of a plurality of groups (i.e. one of the groups defined at 312). At 314, the tap energy of the selected tap (i.e. the tap selected at 310) of a customer equipment device 104 is compared to the thresholds 409, 421, 423, 420 associated with the groups.

More particularly, the fault detection system 116 may determine that a wire fault is probable when one of the groups includes at least a threshold number of customer equipment devices 104. In some embodiments, the threshold number may be three.

For example, in a 24 tap equalizer, taps 1 to 8 may be used for group delay, taps 9 and 10 used for on-premises wire issues, and taps 11 to 24 used for correcting for micro-reflections in the wired network. For such systems, 312, 314 and 316 may be performed for each tap that is used for correcting for micro-reflections in the wired network. For example, these steps may be performed independently for each of taps 11 to 24 in this 24-tap example. Thus, at 318, the fault detection system 116 may determine whether steps 312, 314 and 316 have not yet been performed for a tap that is used for correcting for micro-reflections in the wired network. If the steps 312, 314, 316 were performed for all such taps, then the method 300 may end.<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --></p><p id="p0100" num="0100">If, however, the fault detection system 116 determines at 318 that there is another tap to consider, then at 320 another tap is selected.

As noted in the discussion of 310 above, in some embodiments, during 310, the lowest tap that is used to correct for micro-reflections in the wired network is selected. In some such embodiments, at 320 the fault detection system 116 selects a tap that is adjacent to the lowest tap that is used to correct for micro-reflections in the wired network and that is also used to correct for micro-reflections in the wired network. For example, the next-highest ordered tap may be selected at 320. By way of example, if tap 9 was selected at 310 then tap 10 may be selected at the first iteration of 320, tap 11 at the second iteration of 320, and so on.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">After a new tap is selected at 320, the method 300 resumes at 312 where groups are newly defined based on the data for the newly selected tap. 312 may be performed in the same manner discussed above, but uses the data from the tap selected at 320 rather than the data from the tap selected at 310. Then, at 314, for each of a plurality of customer equipment devices, the fault detection system 116 assigns the customer equipment device to one of a plurality of the newly defined groups (which may be referred to as other groups) by comparing the tap energy for the tap selected at 320 to thresholds associated with the newly defined groups. Similarly, at 316, the fault detection system again evaluates whether a wire fault is probable. More particularly, at 316 the fault detection system may determine that a wire fault is probable when one of the newly defined groups contains at least a threshold number of customer equipment devices.

The determination of whether a wire fault is probable (at 316) may be performed using the customer equipment devices that were grouped at 314. Thus, the determination of whether a wire fault is probable is based on the customer equipment devices of the newly selected pre-group.</p><p id="p0118" num="0118">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, an example of another method 600 of detecting wire faults is illustrated. The method 600 includes many steps discussed above with reference to the method 300 of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. These steps are illustrated using common reference numerals and the discussion of these steps will not be repeated at length. It will be appreciated that the additional features of the method 600 may, in at least some embodiments, be included in the method 500 of <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> discussed above.</p><p id="p0119" num="0119">The method 600 allows the groups defined in 312 of the methods 300, 500, 600 to be dynamically re-defined to determine whether, based on a different grouping, a wire fault may be detected.<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --></p><p id="p0120" num="0120">At 302, pre-equalization coefficients may be obtained as described above with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. At 304, tap energies are determined in the manner described above with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. At 310, a tap is selected in the manner described above with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. In some embodiments (not shown), pre-grouping may be performed as described above with reference to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>. Then, at 312, groups may be defined for the selected tap in the manner described above with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> or <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> and, at 314, customer equipment devices may be assigned to groups in the manner described above with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> or <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>. Then, at 316, the fault detection system may determine whether a wire fault is probable. At 317, a location of a wire fault is determined.</p><p id="p0121" num="0121">In at least some embodiments, at 602, the fault detection system may create new groups by adjusting the thresholds associated with the groups defined at 312. The new groups may have the same predetermined group range 422 (<figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>) as the groups created at 312. However, the groups may have different thresholds.</p><p id="p0122" num="0122">By way of example, reference is briefly made to <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> which illustrates a plurality of groups 702a, 702b, 702c which were defined at 312. A first group 702a has a first threshold of -38.24 dB and a second threshold of -33.24 dB, a second group 702b has a first threshold of -33.24 dB and a second threshold of -28.24 dB and a third group 702c has a first threshold of -28.24 dB and a second threshold of -23.24 dB. The predetermined group range 422 for each of these groups is the same; 5dB in the illustrated example. The fault detection system may (at 602) create new groups 704a, 704b by adjusting these thresholds. In the illustrated example, two new groups are created at 602 - a first new group 704a having a range of -35dB to -30dB and a second new group 704b having a range of -30dB to -25dB. The predetermined group range 422 of each of the new groups is the same and the predetermined group range 422 of the new groups 704a, 704b is the same as the predetermined group range 422 of the previous groups 702a, 702b, 702c. The thresholds for the new groups may be selected using one or more predetermined rules. For example, in some embodiments, the thresholds for the new groups may be midway between the thresholds for the old groups.<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --></p><p id="p0123" num="0123">Referring again to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, after the new groups are defined, at 604, the fault detection system 116 may re-assign the customer equipment devices 104 to the new groups by comparing the tap energy for the selected tap for the plurality of customer equipment devices to the thresholds associated with the new groups. 604 may operate in the same manner as 314 but may use the new groups defined at 602 rather than the old groups defined at 312.</p><p id="p0124" num="0124">Then, at 606, the fault detection system 116 determines whether a wire fault is probable. 606 may operate in the same manner as 316 but may be based on the number of customer equipment devices 104 assigned to the new groups (i.e. the groups defined at 602) rather than the old groups (i.e. the groups defined at 312). More particularly, the fault detection system 116 may determine that a wire fault is probable when one of the new groups includes at least the threshold number of customer equipment devices.</p><p id="p0125" num="0125">As described above with reference to the method 300 of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the fault detection system may then determine whether another tap needs to be considered and, if so, may select another tap at 320. Based on tap energy values associated with the newly selected tap, the process of determining whether a wire fault exists is again performed.</p><p id="p0126" num="0126">In some embodiments (not shown), the steps 602, 604, 606 involving the new groups may only be performed if a particular condition is satisfied. For example, in some embodiments, prior to creating the new groups (at 602), the fault detection system may identify a group that does not include at least a threshold number of customer equipment devices (e.g. in some embodiments, it identifies a group that does not have at least 3 customer equipment devices). The fault detection system may determine whether the identified group and another one of the groups, which is adjacent to the identified group collectively include at least the threshold number of customer equipment devices. If a pair of adjacent groups do not individually contain the threshold number of customer equipment devices but collectively contain the threshold number of customer equipment devices, then the steps 602, 604, 606<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> involving the new groups may be performed. That is, if this condition is satisfied, then new groups may be created.</p><p id="p0127" num="0127">This condition will be further discussed with reference to <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>. In the example of <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>, the second group 702b includes two customer equipment devices 104 and the third group 702c includes one customer equipment device 104. If the threshold for determining that a wire fault is probable is set to three then the third group and the second group would not, themselves, suggest any wire faults. However, since these groups are adjacent to one another and collectively have at least the threshold number of customer equipment devices (i.e. together they have three customer equipment devices), then one or more new groups 702a, 702b may be formed. That is, steps 602, 604, 606, may be performed. The second new group 702b then includes the threshold number of customer equipment devices, suggesting (at 606) that a wire fault is possible.</p><p id="p0128" num="0128">The various embodiments presented above are merely examples and are in no way meant to limit the scope of this disclosure.
