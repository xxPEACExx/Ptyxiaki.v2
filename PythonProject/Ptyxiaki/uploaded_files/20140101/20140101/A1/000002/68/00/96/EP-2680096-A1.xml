More particularly, the present disclosure relates to automatically controlling the movement of a vehicle in an unpredictable manner.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Manned and unmanned air vehicles may be used to perform a variety of military and other missions. For example, one type of mission that may be performed by an air vehicle is a surveillance mission. In this case, the air vehicle may be flown from a base location to a location near a point of interest. The air vehicle then may be flown in an area near the point of interest while surveillance equipment on the air vehicle is trained on the point of interest. The surveillance equipment may include, for example, imaging systems and other systems on board the air vehicle for obtaining information about the point of interest.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The point of interest that is the target of a surveillance mission or other mission by an air vehicle may be stationary or moving. For example, the point of interest may be a building, a fixed weapon system, or another stationary military, industrial, or other object of interest. Alternatively, the point of interest may be a moving person, a vehicle, a convoy of vehicles, or another moving object of interest.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Various constraints may limit the manner in which an air vehicle may be controlled to perform a mission in an area near a point of interest. These constraints may be imposed, for example, by the capabilities of the air<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> vehicle, by the capabilities of equipment on the air vehicle that is being used to perform the mission, by weather or other environmental conditions, by particular details of the mission to be performed, or by other factors or combinations of factors.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The performance capabilities of an air vehicle may limit the altitude and speed at which the air vehicle may be flown in an area near the point of interest during a mission. Capabilities of surveillance equipment or other equipment on board the air vehicle may dictate the maximum distance from the point of interest at which the air vehicle may be flown while performing a surveillance mission or other mission.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Topography, weather, or other environmental conditions may limit the area near a point of interest that may be used by an air vehicle to perform a mission. For example, a storm, enemy radar emplacements, or other conditions or combinations of conditions may create "no-fly zones" near the point of interest through which an air vehicle should not be flown. Time on station limitations, surveillance image quality requirements, or other particular requirements of a surveillance mission or other mission also may constrain how an air vehicle is flown in an area near a point of interest during the mission.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It may be desirable that an air vehicle is not detected by hostile forces as the air vehicle performs a mission in an area near a point of interest. Detection of an air vehicle performing a mission near the point of interest may allow hostile forces to take action to thwart the mission. For example, in response to detecting the presence of an air vehicle flying near the point of interest, objects of interest may be moved or hidden by hostile forces in an<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> attempt to prevent successful completion of a surveillance mission by the air vehicle.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Detection of the presence of an air vehicle performing a mission near a point of interest may lead to an attack on the air vehicle by hostile forces. Such an attack may force the air vehicle to abandon the mission. In the worst case, such an attack may lead to loss of the air vehicle.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Current systems and methods for controlling the flight of an air vehicle may provide little, if any, help to a pilot controlling the movement of the air vehicle in a manner that satisfies the various constraints for performing a mission in an area near a point of interest. Currently, automated navigation systems may be used for controlling the flight of an air vehicle from one location to another location. In the context of performing a mission in an area near a point of interest, an automated navigation system may be used to control automatically the flight of the air vehicle from a base location to a location near the point of interest. However, current automated navigation systems are not adapted for controlling the movement of an air vehicle in an area near a point of interest to perform a surveillance mission or other mission in the area. In particular, current systems and methods for controlling the movement of an air vehicle in an area near a point of interest may not reduce the likelihood that the air vehicle is detected by hostile forces while performing a mission in the area.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Accordingly, it would be beneficial to have a method and apparatus that takes into account one or more of the issues discussed above as well as possibly other issues.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0002"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">An illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method for controlling movement of a vehicle.

"A number", as used herein with reference to items, means one or more items. For example, "a number of different considerations" means one or more different considerations.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that an air vehicle may be moved from a base location to a location near a point of interest to perform a surveillance mission. The air vehicle may be placed in a static flight path around the point of interest after the vehicle arrives at a location where surveillance sensors on the air vehicle can see the point of interest. The air vehicle may repeat the same flight path around the point of interest until enough information has been gathered. The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that an air vehicle that is flown in a repeated pattern around a point of interest may be more likely to be detected by hostile forces. The use of a repeated flight path around a point of interest has resulted in the loss of air vehicles to hostile action in the past.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The different illustrative embodiments also recognize and take into account that a current procedure for reducing the likelihood that an air vehicle flying in an area near a point of interest is detected by hostile forces is for the pilot of the air vehicle to manually vary the flight path of the vehicle near the point of interest. However, piloting an air vehicle on a flight path that is continually varying and non-repeating creates an operational burden on the pilot and increases pilot fatigue. As a result, it may be difficult for the pilot to maintain a flight path for the air vehicle that does not repeatedly pass through or near<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> the same point several times during the performance of a surveillance mission or other mission in an area near the point of interest.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The different illustrative embodiments also recognize and take into account that a pilot also may have to manually adjust the flight path of an air vehicle near a point of interest in order to avoid no-fly zones or to satisfy other constraints. Manually adjusting the flight path of an air vehicle to satisfy such constraints may further increase pilot fatigue.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The different illustrative embodiments also recognize and take into account that current systems and methods for controlling the flight of an air vehicle with respect to a point of interest may assume that the point of interest is stationary. Current systems and methods for controlling the flight of an air vehicle with respect to a point of interest may not be adapted to adjust the flight path of the air vehicle in response to movement of the point of interest during the performance of a surveillance mission or other mission at the point of interest.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The different illustrative embodiments provide a system and method for controlling the movement of a vehicle, such as an air vehicle, in an area near a point of interest in a manner that reduces the likelihood that the vehicle may be detected by hostile forces while also satisfying various mission constraints. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment, a vehicle may be controlled to move in an unpredictable pattern in an area near the point of interest. An algorithm may be employed to automatically control the movement of the vehicle in a manner that minimizes a number of times that the vehicle presents the same state during the performance of a mission in the area near the point of interest. For example, an air vehicle that is controlled to<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> fly an unpredictable flight path may mimic natural objects, thereby enabling the air vehicle to hide in natural clutter. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment, the movement of the vehicle in the area near the point of interest may be adjusted automatically in response to movement of the point of interest during the performance of a mission by the vehicle at the point of interest.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Turning first to <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Figure 1</b></figref><b>,</b> an illustration of unpredictable navigation of an unmanned air vehicle is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.

For example, flight path <b>114</b> may be determined by the automatic navigation system in a manner such that the number of times that unmanned air vehicle <b>100</b> passes through the same point, or otherwise presents the same state of movement, during the course of performing a mission at point of interest <b>102</b> is minimized.
