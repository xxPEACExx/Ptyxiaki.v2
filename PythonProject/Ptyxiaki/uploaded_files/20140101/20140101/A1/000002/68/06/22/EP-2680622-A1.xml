More particularly, the present invention relates to techniques for sharing various forms of media during group communication sessions between wireless telecommunication devices.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In wireless telecommunication devices, such as cellular phones, PDAs, mini-laptops, and advanced pagers, the devices typically communicate over long distances by bridging telephone calls through existing cellular telephone networks and passing data packets across the network. These wireless communication devices often have data processing and computing capabilities, and can accordingly send and receive software programs, in addition to voice, across the telephone network.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">There exists a wireless telecommunication service that provides a quick one-to-one or one-to-many communication that is generically referred to as "Push-To-Talk" (PTT) capability. The specific PTT group of recipient devices for the communicating wireless communication device is commonly set up by the carrier. A PTT communication connection is typically initiated by a single button-push on the wireless communication device that activates a half-duplex link between the speaker and each member device of the group and once the button is released, the device can receive incoming PTT transmissions. Existing PTT systems have advantages over traditional cellular systems because they have faster call setup times, e.g., setup times ideally in the range of 1 second as opposed to cellular voice channels that can take more than 5 seconds to establish. In some arrangements, the PTT speaker will have the "floor" where no other group member can speak while the speaker is speaking. Once the speaker releases the PTT button, any other individual member of the group can engage his or her PTT button and he or she will have the floor. Generally speaking, the PTT system uses standard voice-over internet protocol (VoIP) technologies. Voice information is sent in digital form over IP-based data networks. In PTT scenarios, instead of using the standard cellular infrastructure a call is formed by combining separate point-to-point connections between each IP endpoint in the network. Initiating the PTT system generates a call to the target device. The call originator's voice can be sent through the carrier's network to the target handset.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In existing PTT systems, member devices will only communicate voice data between the devices during a communication session. It is difficult to include other data in the group<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> communication because of the size of the data and the device resources necessary to handle non-voice data. The existing wireless communication devices therefore send non-voice data, such as data packages, through specific data channels established between the device and a wireless communication network.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a system and method for a wireless communication device to economically send data packages and other data packages to others during a PTT or other group communication session.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>SUMMARY</u></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present system and method provide for the queuing and forwarding of data packages intended to be sent in a group communication session between wireless communication devices. An exemplary embodiment describes a method that includes, but is not limited to configured to receive a request to send a data package to a target over a group communication channel; determine that at least one group communication channel is not established with ; circuitry configured to selectively store the data package in a queue; configured to determine that a group communication channel has been established ; and configured to send all queued data packages to at least the group communication server via the established group communication channel. The queued data packages do not necessarily all have to be intended for the same target member wireless communication device of the communication group.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">An exemplary embodiment includes a method that includes, but is not limited to receiving, at a wireless communication device, a request to send a data package to a target over a group communication channel; determining that the size of the data package is less than a predetermined size and storing the data package in a queue; and upon a group communication channel being open, sending, from the wireless communication device, all queued data packages.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">An exemplary embodiment includes a computer system, such as a group communication server, that is configured to receive a data package to from an originating wireless communication device over a group communication channel, the data package intended to be sent to one or more target group members of a communication group. The server is further configured to determine that at least one target group member of the communication group does not have a group communication channel established thereto, and is also configured to selectively store the data package in a queue and determine that a group communication channel has been established with the at least one target group member. The service is then configured to send all queued data packages to the at least one target group member via the established group communication channel.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">An exemplary embodiment includes a method, which can be performed on a group communication server controlling group communications between wireless telecommunication devices, including the steps of receiving over a group communication channel, at a at a group communication server, a data package sent from an originating wireless communication device to at least one target wireless communication device of a communication group; determining if a group communication channel is open for a target wireless communication device; upon the determination that a group communication channel is not open for a target wireless communication device, determining that the size of the data package is less than a predetermined size; storing the data package in a queue; and upon a group communication channel being open to the target wireless communication device, sending all stored data packages in the queue for that wireless communication device.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In addition to the foregoing, other aspects are described in the claims, drawings, and text forming a part of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present system and method are therefore advantageous in that they allow a wireless communication device to economically send data packages and other data packages to others during a PTT communication session. Furthermore, the method of queuing and forwards bundles of data packages can also be performed at the group communication server if the system is so embodied. The system and method thus have industrial applicability as they can be implements on a group communication system and prevent the uneconomical opening of group communication channels unless they can be optimally utilized for data package transmission. The foregoing is a summary and thus contains, by necessity, simplifications, generalizations and omissions of detail. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> describes an example environment for practicing aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> depicts an example wireless communication device.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> depicts an example system for sharing data packages.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example wireless network.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example operational procedure 500.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure of <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure of <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure of <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure of <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an example operational procedure 1000.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure of <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref>.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates an example operational procedure 1200.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure of <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure of <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 13</figref>.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates an example operational procedure 1500.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure of <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 15</figref>.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0016">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure of <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 16</figref>.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates an example operational procedure 1800.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure of <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 18</figref>.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates an example operational procedure 2000.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0018">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure of <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 20</figref>.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates an example operational procedure 2200.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 23</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure of <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 22</figref>.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0020">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure of <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 23</figref>.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</u></heading><p id="p0036" num="0036">In this disclosure, the terms 'communication device,' 'wireless telephone,' 'wireless communications device,' 'PTT communication device,' 'handheld device,' 'wireless communication device,' and 'handset' are used interchangeably. The terms 'call' and 'communication' are also used interchangeably. The term 'group communication' is intended to encompass a half duplex, or virtual half-duplex communication channel used for one-to-many communications, such as push-to-talk half duplex communications, but can also embrace one-to-one communication where there are two only two group members present and communicating. The term 'exemplary' means that the disclosed element or embodiment is only an example, and does not indicate any preference of use. Further, like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several drawings, and the articles "a" and "the" include plural references, unless otherwise specified in the description. It can be appreciated by one of skill in the art that one or more various aspects of the disclosure may include but are not limited to circuitry and/or programming for effecting the herein-referenced aspects of the present disclosure; the circuitry and/or programming can be virtually any combination of hardware, software, and/or firmware configured to effect the herein-referenced aspects depending upon the design choices of the system designer.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Embodiments may execute on one or more computers. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief general description of a suitable computing<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> environment in which the disclosure may be implemented. One skilled in the art can appreciate that computer systems disclosed herein can have some or all of the components described with respect to computer 100 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The term circuitry used throughout the disclosure can include hardware components such as hardware interrupt controllers, hard drives, network adaptors, graphics processors, hardware based video/audio codecs, and the firmware/software used to operate such hardware. The term circuitry can also include microprocessors configured to perform function(s) by firmware or by switches set in a certain way or one or more logical processors, e.g., one or more cores of a multi-core general processing unit. The logical processor(s) in this example can be configured by software instructions embodying logic operable to perform function(s) that are loaded from memory, e.g., RAM, ROM, firmware, and/or virtual memory. In example embodiments where circuitry includes a combination of hardware and software an implementer may write source code embodying logic that is subsequently compiled into machine readable code that can be executed by a logical processor. Since one skilled in the art can appreciate that the state of the art has evolved to a point where there is little difference between hardware, software, or a combination of hardware/software, the selection of hardware versus software to effectuate functions is merely a design choice. Thus, since one of skill in the art can appreciate that a software process can be transformed into an equivalent hardware structure, and a hardware structure can itself be transformed into an equivalent software process, the selection of a hardware implementation versus a software implementation is trivial and left to an implementer.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, an exemplary computing system 100 is depicted. Computer system 100 can include a logical processor 102, e.g., an execution core. While one logical processor 102 is illustrated, in other embodiments computer system 100 may have multiple logical processors, e.g., multiple execution cores per processor substrate and/or multiple processor substrates that could each have multiple execution cores. As shown by the figure, various computer readable storage media 110 can be interconnected by a system bus which couples various system components to the logical processor 102. The system bus may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. In example embodiments the computer readable storage media 110 can include for example, random access memory (RAM) 104, storage device 106, e.g., electromechanical hard drive, solid state hard drive, etc., firmware 108, e.g., FLASH RAM or ROM, and removable storage devices 118 such as, for example, CD-ROMs, floppy disks, DVDs, FLASH drives, external storage devices, etc. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable storage media can be<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> used to store data, such as magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, Bernoulli cartridges, etc.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The computer readable storage media provide storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer 100. A basic input/output system (BIOS) 120, containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the computer system 100, such as during start up, can be stored in firmware 108. A number of applications 124 and an operating system 122 may be stored on firmware 108, storage device 106, RAM 104, and/or removable storage devices 118, and executed by logical processor 102.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Commands and information may be received by computer 100 through input devices 116 which can include, but are not limited to, keyboards and pointing devices. Other input devices may include microphones, joysticks, game pads, scanners or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the logical processor 102 through a serial port interface that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port, game port or universal serial bus (USB). A display or other type of display device can also be connected to the system bus via an interface, such as a video adapter which can be part of, or connected to, a graphics processor 112. In addition to the display, computers typically include other peripheral output devices (not shown), such as speakers and printers. The exemplary system of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> can also include a host adapter, Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) bus, and an external storage device connected to the SCSI bus.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Computer system 100 may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer. The remote computer may be another computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically can include many or all of the elements described above relative to computer system 100.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">When used in a LAN or WAN networking environment, computer system 100 can be connected to the LAN or WAN through a network interface card 114 (NIC). The NIC 114, which may be internal or external, can be connected to the system bus. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer system 100, or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. It will be appreciated that the network connections described here are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used. Moreover, while it is envisioned that numerous embodiments of the present disclosure are particularly well-suited for computerized systems, nothing in this document is intended to limit the disclosure to such embodiments.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, it illustrates an example wireless telecommunication device that can be a wireless communication device 200 with a PTT button 202 that opens the direct communication to a target device, e.g., an endpoint associated with an IP address. The wireless communication device 200 is also shown as having a graphics display 204. The wireless communication device 200 can include a computer platform 206 that can handle voice and data packets, execute software applications, and transmit information across a wireless network. The computer platform 206 includes, among other components, a processor 208 such as an application-specific integrated circuit ("ASIC") or a RISC processor such as those that implement the ARM architecture. The processor 208 is installed at the time of manufacture of the wireless communication device 200 and is not normally upgradeable. The processor 208 or other processor executes an application programming interface ("API") layer 210, which includes the resident application environment, and can include the operating system loaded on the processor 208. The resident application environment interfaces with any resident programs in the memory 212, e.g., a computer readable storage medium of the wireless communication device 200. An example of a resident application environment is the "binary runtime environment for wireless" (BREW) software developed by QUALCOMM® for wireless communication device platforms.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">As shown here, the wireless communication device 200 can be a wireless communication telephone, with a graphics display 204, but can also be any wireless device with a computer platform 206 as known in the art, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), a pager with a graphics display 204, or even a separate computer platform 206 that has a wireless communication portal, and may otherwise have a wired connection to a network or the Internet. Further, the memory 212 can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform 206 can also include a local database 214 for storage of software applications not actively used in memory 212. The local database 214 is typically comprised of one or more flash memory cells, but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EPROM, EEPROM, optical media, tape, or soft or hard disk. The graphics display 204 can present not only information about the ongoing group call, but also the information about the data package in order to generate a preview as is more fully described herein.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The computer platform 206 can also include a direct communication interface 216 that can open a direct communication channel. The direct communication interface 216 can also be part of the standard communication interface for the wireless communication device 200 which ordinarily carries the voice and data transmitted to and from the wireless communication device<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 200. The direct communication interface 216 typically is comprised of hardware as is known in the art.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Continuing with the description of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, additionally depicted is a diagram of one embodiment of the software layers of the group application client that can include, but is not limited to, PTT functionality and data package functionality. While the embodiment shown herein is implemented in a PTT session, the present system can be utilized in any group communication session setup for transmission of voice and/or data substantially simultaneously among group members. In an embodiment, the computer platform 206 in the wireless communication device environment can include a series of software "layers" developed on top of the Wireless communication Station Modem (MSM) 218 and the Advanced Wireless communication Subscriber Software (AMSS) 220, developed by QUALCOMM®. In this example the underlying MSM chipset can implement the software protocol stack for the entire suite of CDMA communication technologies that include CDMA2000 1X and CDMA2000 1xEV-DO. In this example the AMSS 220 can be configured to support a wireless communication operating system layer 222, which in an embodiment is BREW®, also developed by QUALCOMM®. The wireless communication operating system layer 222 can provide an application programming interface for chip or device-specific operations, while providing an isolation layer that eliminates direct contact to the AMSS 220 and any OEM software on the computer platform. The wireless communication operating system layer 222 can enable application development that uses wireless communication device features without having to rewrite the application each time a new release of the device-specific software is released.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In this example the wireless communication operating system 222 can include a PTT client 226 that is configured to offer access to PTT services through an external interface, here shown at a PTT-aware UI 224. The PTT client 226 can include all the functions required to enable wireless communication operating system 222 applications, such as the media client 228. In an embodiment, the PTT client 226 can maintain access to PTT services, respond to communication requests, process all PTT-aware wireless communication operating system applications requests for PTT services, process all outgoing PTT requests, collect and package vocoder packets for originating PTT talk spurts, and parses packets of vocoder data for terminated PTT talk spurts.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The media client 228 can be a wireless communication operating system-based application that extends PTT services for access to media types other than the traditional half duplex voice communications (VoIP-PTT media). The media client 228 can provide access to media services through an external interface such as a media aware API that is an application<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> that may be developed entirely as a wireless communication operating system-based application or used in combination with an AMSS 220 interface. The media client 228 can service requests from the user and inform the user of the result of any group-directed media request. The media client 228 can additionally be configured to handle incoming notifications that indicate there is data package to download from a media server 316 of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> and described in more detail below. For example, the media client 228 can be configured in one embodiment to download data packages immediately or in other embodiments the media client 228 can be configured to download the data package at a predetermined time period, e.g., at 10:00 pm daily, or it can be configured to prompt the user via the PTT UI 224 to determine whether and/or when to download the file. Other push-to-talk applications 230 or applications than can receive and transmit data across the group communication channel can also be resident on the platform.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example embodiment of a system 300 for sharing data packages among one or more wireless telecommunication devices in a PTT group 302, such as the wireless communication device 200, smart pager 304 and personal digital assistant (PDA) 306, with other wireless communication devices. In the system 300, each wireless telecommunication device 200, 302, and 306 can be capable of selectively directly communicating across the wireless communication network 308 with a target set of one or more other wireless telecommunication devices. For example, the target set for wireless communication telephone 200 can be all devices in the communication group 302 or a subset thereof, such as pager 304 and PDA 306.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In an embodiment, the wireless telecommunication device (such as wireless communication telephone 200) can send a flag to at least the communications server 310 that can have components similar to computer 100 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, which is present on a server-side LAN 312 across the wireless network 308. The flag in this example can be used by the server to determine that the wireless device is present, i.e. accessible, on the wireless network 308. The communication server 310 can share this information with a set of target wireless telecommunication devices designated by the first wireless telecommunication device or it can also share this with other computer devices resident on the server-side LAN 312 or accessible across the wireless network 308. The group communication computer 310 can have an attached or accessible database 314 to store the group identification data for the wireless devices. A media server 316 (that can include components similar to computer 100 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) can additionally include circuitry for a file management server the can be present on the server-side LAN 312. It should be appreciated that the number of computer components resident on server-side LAN 312, or across the wireless network 308, or Internet generally, are not limited.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The communications server 310 can establish point to point IP PTT channels between devices in the group 302. A PTT channel can be established through a half-duplex channel (true or virtual) between the communicating wireless telecommunication device 200, 304, and/or 306 and the one or more other wireless telecommunication devices of the target set. Also, the group communication server 310 can attempt to bridge the requested direct communication with the target set if at least one of the wireless telecommunication devices of the target set have informed the group communication server 310 of their presence on the wireless network 308.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The communications server 310 can also inform the wireless telecommunication device 200, 304, and 306 of the inability to bridge a direct communication to the target set 302 upon none of the wireless telecommunication devices (or at least one) of the target set not having informed the group communication server 310 of their presence on the wireless network 308. Further, while the communications server 310 is shown here as having the attached media server 316 of group identification data, the group communication computer device 310 can have group identity data resident thereupon, and perform all storage functions described herein.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In overview, the system 300 can include at least one wireless communication device, such as wireless communication telephone 200, that can be a member of a communication group 302 of wireless communication devices. The wireless communication devices in this example can be configured to communicate with each other or communicate as a group across a wireless communication network 308. In addition, at least one of the wireless communication devices can be configured to selectively send data packages to other members of the communication group 302. At least one communications server 310 is configured to store information on communication groups 302 on the wireless communication network 308, the information including the identity of the specific member wireless communication devices of one or more communication groups. The communications server 310 is further configured to selectively receive data packages from a sending wireless communication device, such as wireless communication telephone 200, of a communication group 302.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The media server 316 can be configured to receive the data packages from the wireless communication device (such as wireless communication phone 200) and selectively permit members of the communication group 302 to access the stored data packages across the wireless communication network 308. In an embodiment data packages can include, but is not limited to, pictures in JPEG, TIF, and the like, audio files such as MP3, MP4, WAV, and the like, documents, and/or presentations. The data packages can additionally include streaming media, such as a multimedia application (Powerpoint, MOV file, and the like). Also, the data packages could be half-duplex video conferencing among members of the communication group wherein<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the picture of the speaker is broadcast to the other group members in substantial real-time, or in delay.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The size of the data package files can be very large and because of the potential delay of sending the media, or inability of the receiving wireless communication device to handle the sent media, the system 300 can use a media server 316 to store the data packages such that target members of the communication group 302 can selectively access the stored media without interrupting other PTT communications. Alternatively, in one embodiment, if the data packages are stored at the media server 316, the media server 316 can be configured to send a hypertext link to the originating device or the target wireless communication devices of the communication group 302. The hypertext link in this example can provide a link to the stored group-directed media at the media server 316. Upon receipt of data packages by at least one of the member wireless devices of the communication group 302, the communications server 310 can send an acknowledgement indicating to the wireless communication device 200, 304, and 306 that at least one member wireless communication device of the communication group 302 received the data package.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The wireless communication device 200, 304, 306 can send communication group identification data to the communications server 310 at the time of sending a data package, e.g. a target list, and thus, the media server 316 can be configured to send or store the data package to or for the member wireless communication devices identified in the communication group identification data based upon a variety of criteria as is further discussed herein. Alternately, prior to the wireless communication device sending data packages, the wireless communication device 200, 304, and 306 can request member data for a communication group 302 from the communications server 310, and the server 310 can send one or more addresses or communication group addresses to the wireless communication device 200, 304, and 306. In one embodiment, the communications server 310 can filter the potential communication groups available based upon their member devices' capability to received data packages.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">As is further described herein, the wireless communication device 200, 304, and 306 can be engaged in a group communication with the member wireless communication devices of the communication group 302, and send data packages during the group communication in the same communication session, either to all members or a subset thereof. Alternately, the data packages can be sent independently of the group-communication session.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> shows an exemplary wireless network in a common cellular telecommunication configuration. The wireless network in this example can include a series of communications servers 310 that control communications between the wireless communication devices of set group members (devices 200-A through D) in a PTT system. The wireless network is merely<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> exemplary and can include any system whereby remote modules communicate over-the-air between and among each other and/or between and among components of a wireless network, including, without limitation, wireless network carriers and/or servers. A series of communications servers 310 are connected to a group communication server LAN 312. Wireless telephones can request packet data sessions from the group communications server(s) 310 using a data service option.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Continuing with the description of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, the communications server(s) 310 in this example can be connected to a wireless service provider's packet data service node (PDSN) such as PDSN 414, shown here resident on a carrier network 416. When a wireless communication device access the wireless data network to obtain services, the PDSN 414 can interface with an authentication, authorization, and accounting server "AAA" 428 to authenticate the wireless communication devices 200, 304, and/or 306. The AAA 428 can be coupled to a database operable to store information such as user accounts and privileges. Each PDSN 414 can interface with a base station controller 418 of a base station 320 through a packet control function (PCF) 422. The PCF 422 can be located in the base station 420. The wireless network 308 can control messages (generally in the form of data packets) sent to a messaging service controller ("MSC") 424. The carrier network 308 in this example can communicate with the MSC 424 by a network, the Internet and/or POTS ("plain ordinary telephone system"). Typically, the network or Internet connection between the wireless network 308 and the MSC 424 transfers data, and the POTS transfers voice information. The MSC 424 can be connected to one or more base stations 420. In a similar manner to the carrier network, the MSC 424 is typically connected to the branch-to-source (BTS) 426 by both the network and/or Internet for data transfer and POTS for voice information. The BTS 426 ultimately broadcasts and receives messages wirelessly to and from the wireless devices, such as cellular telephones 200-A through D, by short messaging service ("SMS"), or other over-the-air methods known in the art. It should also be noted that carrier boundaries and/or PTT operator network boundaries do not inhibit or prohibit the sharing of data as described herein.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Cellular telephones and wireless communication telecommunication devices, such as wireless telephone 200, are being manufactured with increased computing capabilities and are becoming tantamount to personal computers and hand-held PDAs. These "smart" cellular telephones allow software developers to create software applications that are downloadable and executable on the processor of the wireless device. The wireless device, such as cellular telephone 200, can download many types of "data packages," which are discrete segments of computer code, such as applications, web pages, applets, MIDlets, multi-media, picture, games and simple data. In wireless devices that have designated a communication group 302 (such as<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> depicted by <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>), the wireless communication device can directly connect with the other member of the set and engage in voice and data communication. However, such direct group communications will occur through, or at the control of, the group communication computer device 302. All data packets of the devices do not necessarily have to travel through the communication server 302 itself, but the communication server 302 must be able to ultimately control the communication because it will typically be the only server-side component that is aware of and/or can retrieve the identity of the members of the communication group, or direct the identity of the members of the communication group 302 to another computer device.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">The following are a series of flowcharts depicting operational procedures. The flowcharts are organized such that the initial flowcharts present implementations via an overall viewpoint. Those having skill in the art can appreciate that the style of presentation utilized herein, e.g., beginning with a presentation of a flowchart(s) presenting an overall view and thereafter providing additions to and/or further details in subsequent flowcharts, generally allows for a rapid and easy understanding of the various operational procedures.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> depicts an operational procedure for practicing aspects of the present disclosure, as shown by the Figure, the operational procedure includes operations 500-510. As shown by the figure, operation 500 begins the procedure and operation 502 depicts configured to receive a request to send a data package to a target over a group communication channel. For example, and referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the processor 208 can execute instructions indicative of the PTT-aware UI 224 and a user interface can be displayed by display 204. The user input interface of wireless communication device 200, e.g., a keyboard, touchpad, mouse, trackball, etc., can receive a request to send a data package, e.g., a picture, over a push to talk communication channel. In a specific example, a user may wish to quickly send a picture of something to a member of his or her group 302 and thus, decide to send the picture via push to talk instead of by email.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Continuing with the description of the operational procedure, operation 504 shows determine that at least one group communication channel is not established with the target wireless communication device. For example, the processor 208 can determine that a push to talk communication channel does not exist between the originator, e.g., device 200, and a target, e.g., device 304 or communications server 310 of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, from, for example, information obtained from the PTT client 226. In a specific example media client 228 can be executed and the PTT client 226 can receive a request for information that identifies whether a PTT channel is opened with the target. The PTT client 226 can be run and a signal indicative of the fact that such a channel is not established can be returned to the media client 228.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Turning to operation 506, it shows circuitry configured to selectively store the data package in a queue. In an embodiment, processor 208 can execute instructions and store the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> data package can be stored in a queue, e.g. memory 212. For example, storing the data package in the queue can include storing a pointer to the data package in an area of memory identified as the queue or it can include physically storing a copy of the data package in an area identified as the queue. In this example, instead of establishing a PTT channel, the data package can be stored and sent at a later point when a communication is established to one or more or the targets.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Operation 508 shows configured to determine that a group communication channel has been established with the target wireless communication device. For example, sometime after the data package has been stored in the queue, a PTT channel may be established between the originator, e.g., device 200, and some other PTT enabled target such as the communications server 310 or another device, e.g., device 304. In a specific example, the media client 228 could have configured the processor 208 to listen for connections made between the originator and the target. In this example when a channel is opened with the target the media client 228 can receive information indicating that a channel has been opened.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">In a specific example a signal indicating that the device 200 has the floor can be used to notify the media client 228 that a PTT session has been established with the target. When a PTT channel is requested the communications server 310 can receive a call setup request message indicating that a user of device 200, 304, or 306 wants to establish a push to talk session. The call setup request can contain, for instance, the target device's address, and an indication that data packages are to be shared, and information that identifies the media server 316 that stores media for the wireless communication device 200. The call setup request may also be sent with a DataOverSignaling Access channel message. In this example the communications server 310 can be configured to perform PTT call setup functions, including locating the target, opening up IP channels between various IP endpoints in the network 308, applying call restrictions, selecting a vocoder and location and/or assign a media server 316 to handle storing any data packages uploaded during the PTT session. The media server 316 can then be notified that a media PTT session is being created and the identities of both the originator device and the target device. In this example the communications server 310 can include circuitry operable to determine whether wireless communication device 200 is allowed to send/receive data packages and/or whether the target is authorized to send/receive data packages. If for example, both devices are allowed to send/receive data packages and the target is available for a PTT session the communications server 310 can send the acknowledgment message to the originating wireless communication device 200 and the originating wireless communication device can obtain the floor.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Operation 510 shows configured to send all queued data packages to at least the group<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> communication server via the established group communication channel. For example, the originating device can send the data package to the target via the established PTT channel. In a specific example, the media client 228 can be executed by the processor 208 and the processor 208 can send the data package to the target via a transceiver of the device 200. Since the data package is sent during a PTT channel that is already established, the cost of setting up sessions on the network is reduced.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">In a specific example, the data package can be sent in conjunction with voice during a PTT talk spurt. In response to receiving the floor grant message, the media client 228 can request permission send data that includes voice and the data package. That is, in this example there is only a single floor control mechanism that is used for both the PTT call and sharing media and when the channel is opened the media client 228 can send media during a talk spurt. The media client 228 can request that the PTT client 226 add a data package to the existing PTT call. The add-media request can contain an indication that the media is to be shared using the same floor control mechanism as the PTT Client 226. The PTT Client 226 can request that the communications server 310 add a new media type to the existing call. The communications server 310 can verify that the target can support the new media type. After the new media type has been successfully added to the PTT call, the data package can be sent.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">In another specific example the media client 228 can be configured to send a data package to the target using a different floor control mechanism than the PTT call. That is, the data package can be sent independently from voice data over a media PTT channel. In an embodiment when the media client 228 receives a signal indicating that a channel has been opened with the target, the media client 228 can send the data package. In this scenario, the user of wireless communication device 200 can participate in a PTT call and when the channel is opened the processor 208 can be interrupted and run media client 228 instructions that direct it to send the data package from the queue. The media client 228 can be configured to determine that the data package is intended to be shared using a separate floor control mechanism than the PTT call, i.e. independent of the floor control mechanism being used for the PTT call, and send a request to the PTT client 226 to add a new media type to the existing PTT call. The add media request can contain an indication that the data is to be shared using a different floor control mechanism than the PTT call. The PTT Client 226 can send a request to the communications server 310 to add a new media type to the existing call. The communications server 310 can be configured to verify that one or more of the call participants can support the new media type and then the communications server 310 can send a notification to the call participants indicating that a new media type is being added to the call. In an embodiment, the notification to the call<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> participants can contain a floor identifier for a separate media floor, in addition to a new destination port number on the media server 316 for the distribution of the data package.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">After the new media type is successfully added to the PTT call, the processor 208 can configure the media client 228 to request permission to send group directed media to the target. The PTT request from the PTT client 226 can contain the floor identifier assigned to the group-directed media floor. The communications server 310 can verify that the data floor is available prior to granting the floor request. The PTT client 226 can then notify the media client 228 that the floor request was granted and the data package can be sent to the target.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">Turning now to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, it shows an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure 500 of <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> including additional operations 612, 614, and 616. In an embodiment, sending the data package can include, but is not limited to, sending the media object to a media server. For example, in an embodiment the target can be the media server 316. In this example processor 208 can execute instructions indicative of the media client 228 and send one or more packets of information indicative of a data package to a media server 316. The media server 316 can then be configured to either send the data package to the target or store the data package.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">Continuing with the description of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, operation 614 illustrates circuitry configured to send all queued data packages to a target wireless communication device. For example, in an embodiment the target can be another wireless communication device e.g., device 304. The communications server 310 can establish a PTT channel between the originating device and the target device, e.g., device 304. In this example, when the PTT channel is established the media client 228 can be executed by the processor 208 and the processor 208 can obtain the data package from the queue and send it to the target via a transceiver of the device 200.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">As shown by <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, operation 616 illustrates that in an embodiment the queue includes a plurality of data packages. For example, in an embodiment, the queue, e.g., an area of memory 212, can include multiple data packages that can be addressed to one target and/or multiple targets. In this example, when the PTT channel is established the media client 228 could receive information from the PTT client 226 indicating that a channel has been opened and the media client 226 can be executed by the processor 208 and the processor 208 can obtain the data packages from the queue.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">In an example embodiment when a PTT channel is opened between the originating device and the media server 316, all the data packages addressed to different target devices, e.g., devices 304 and 306 can be uploaded to the media server 316. In this example, the media server 316 can sort the data packages by the target's addresses and store them in database 314 so that they can be sent at a later time. In another example, data packages addressed to a single target can be uploaded and stored in database 314 or data packages associated with a subset of targets<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> can be uploaded.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">In an example embodiment, when a PTT channel is opened between the originating device and remote wireless communication device, e.g., device 304, all the data packages addressed to the target can be sent via the PTT channel. In this example the communications server 310 can handle the call setup functions and a copy of the data package(s) can be stored by the media server 316.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Turning now to <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>, it illustrates an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> including operation 718 which shows configured to determine that the memory size of a plurality of queued data packages is less than a predetermined memory size threshold. In an embodiment, the processor 208 can execute instructions that configure it to determine how large the data packages in the queue are, e.g., by adding up the memory size of each data package, and compare this value to a predetermined amount. In an embodiment, if the total size of the memory objects is in the queue less than the predetermined value then the device can be configured to wait until a PTT channel is opened before the data packages are sent.

In this example, the hypertext links can then be sent to the targets and when an operator of the target clicks on the hypertext link the media server 316 can receive the request; obtain the data package associated with the hypertext link; and send the data package to the target.</p><p id="p0114" num="0114">Turning now to <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 20</figref>, it depicts an operational procedure for practicing aspects of the present disclosure including operations 2000 through 2008. Operation 2000 begins the procedure and operation 2002 illustrates receiving, by a computer system, a data package from an originating device, the data package addressed to a target device, the data package having a memory size. In an embodiment a media server 316, e.g., a computer system that can include components similar to computer system 100 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, can receive a data packages from an originating device, e.g., device 200. In this example the data package can be addressed to a target, e.g., it can include the telephone number of device 306, and the data package can have a quality that identifies its size.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">Continuing with the description of <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 20</figref>, operation 2004 shows determining, by the computer system, that the memory size is less than a predetermined memory size threshold. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the computer system, e.g., circuitry, can determine how large the data package is and compare this value to a predetermined value. In an embodiment, if the size of the memory object is less than the predetermined value then the media server 316 can be configured to wait until a PTT channel is opened with the target before sending the data package. In a specific example, the predetermined threshold could be set to 5 megabytes. In this case, if the data package is 1 megabyte in size, then the total would be less than the predetermined threshold.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">Continuing with the description of <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 20</figref>, operation 2006 shows storing, by the computer system, the data package in a queue. In this example the media server 316 can<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> determine that the size of the data package is less than the predetermined threshold the data package, or a pointer to the data package can be stored in a queue, e.g. memory of the media server 316. In this example, instead of establishing a PTT channel, the data package can be stored and sent at a later point.</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">Turning now to <figref idrefs="f0018">FIG. 21</figref>, it illustrates an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure 2000 of <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 20</figref> including operations 2108-2114. Operation 2108 shows determining, by the computer system, that a predetermined amount of time has elapsed; and sending, by the computer system, an email to the target device, the email including the data package. In an exemplary embodiment, when the data package is queued a timer can be set to expire after a predetermined amount of time. If the timer expires an interrupt can be sent to processor of media server 102 and the processor 102 can execute specific interrupt handler instructions. For example, in a specific embodiment the interrupt handler instructions can be executed by processor 102 and it can send the data package to the target via an email.</p><p id="p0118" num="0118">Continuing with the description of <figref idrefs="f0018">FIG. 21</figref>, operation 2110 shows determining, by the computer system, that a predetermined amount of time has elapsed; and sending, by the computer system, a multi-media message to the target device, the multi-media message including the data package. In an example embodiment when the data package is stored queued a timer can be set to expire after a predetermined amount of time. If the timer expires, an interrupt can be sent to processor of media server 102 and the processor 102 can execute specific interrupt handler instructions. In this exemplary embodiment, the processor 102 can execute instructions that generate a multi-media message that includes the data package. For example, the wireless communication device 200 can pass the address of the target and the data package to multi-media message client which can generate a multi-media message that includes the data package. The multi-media message can then be sent to the address associated with the target.</p><p id="p0119" num="0119">Continuing with the description of <figref idrefs="f0018">FIG. 21</figref>, operation 2112 shows receiving, by the computer system, a second data package from the originating device, the second data package addressed to the target device, the second data package having a memory size; determining, by the computer system, that a total memory size value of data packages stored in the queue is greater than the predetermined memory size threshold; and sending data packages in the media queue to the target device via a push to talk communication channel. For example, processor 102 can determine that the total memory size of the plurality of data packages in the queue is larger than a predetermined memory size threshold. For example, in an embodiment a processor 102 of a computer system can run instructions when a data package is added to the queue that direct it to, for example, add the size of each data package in the queue to obtain a total; and compare the total to a predetermined value. If the total is larger than the predetermined memory<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> size threshold then information indicative of the result of the operation can be stored in memory. After the determination is made the data packages can be sent to the target via an established PTT channel.</p><p id="p0120" num="0120">Continuing with the description of <figref idrefs="f0018">FIG. 21</figref>, operation 2114 shows determining, by the computer system, that a push to talk communication channel has been opened between the originating device and target device; and sending the data package to the target device. For example, sometime after the data package has been stored in the queue, a PTT channel may be established between the originator, e.g., device 200, and a target device. In this example, the communications server 310 can receive a call setup request message identifying the target and the originator. In this example the communications server 310 can send a signal to the media server 316 which can determine that a connection has been made between the originator and the target. The media server 316 can signal the communications server 310 indicating that a data package is queued that is addressed to the target and the communications server 310 can setup a channel that includes media handling capabilities and send the data package to the target device.</p><p id="p0121" num="0121">Turning now to <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 22</figref>, it illustrates an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure 2200 of <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 22</figref> including operations 2200-2206. Operation 2202 shows sending a request to setup a push to talk channel with a target to a remote computer. In an example embodiment an originating device, e.g., device 200, can establish a PTT channel with a target device, e.g., device 304. For example, a user of device 200 can press a PTT button 202 that directs the wireless communication device 200 to send a PTT call setup request to communications server 310. In this example the communications server 310 can setup a PTT channel between the originator and the target, e.g., the communications server 310 can allocate separate point-to-point connections between each IP endpoint in the network.</p><p id="p0122" num="0122">Continuing with the description of <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 22</figref>, operation 2204 shows determining that a data package was previously queued, the data package addressed to the target. For example, after a PTT channel has been setup between the originator and the target, a processor 208 can determine that a data package was previously queued, the data package being addressed to the target. In a specific example processor 208 can be interrupted and the media client 228 can be executed. The processor 208 can determine that a data package addressed to the target has been queued by checking information in, for example, a data structure stored in memory 212.</p><p id="p0123" num="0123">Turning now to operation 2206, it illustrates sending, via the push to talk channel, the data package to the target device. For example, a transceiver of device 200 can send one or more packets of information indicative of the data package over the push to talk channel to the<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> target device. In a specific example, the processor 208 can run media client 228 and information can be sent to the transceiver. The transceiver can then send the data package to the target via the network 308.</p><p id="p0124" num="0124"><figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 23</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure 2200 of <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 22</figref> including additional operation 2308 which illustrates queuing a plurality of data packages, at least one data package addressed to a second target. For example, in an embodiment, a plurality of data packages, at least one being addressed to a second target, can be queued. For example, information identifying that the data packages have been queued can be stored in a data structure that is stored in memory 212 and used by media client 228.</p><p id="p0125" num="0125"><figref idrefs="f0020">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the operational procedure 2200 of <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 22</figref> including additional operations 2410 and 2412. Operation 2410 illustrates sending, via the push to talk channel, the at least one data package addressed to the second target to a media server. For example, in an embodiment the communications server 310 can establish a PTT channel by combining separate point-to-point connections between each IP endpoint in the network, one of which can be the media server 316. In this example, when the PTT channel is opened the processor 208 can be interrupted and media client 228 can be executed. The processor 208 can determine that a data package addressed to the target has been queued by checking information in, for example, a data structure stored in memory 212 and since a channel is opened, it can be used to send additional data packages. The data package addressed to the second target however can be sent to the media server 316 since a channel has not been established with the second target. The media server 316 can then store the data package addressed to the second target and it can be sent to the second target at a later point.</p><p id="p0126" num="0126">Operation 2412 illustrates determining that a predetermined amount of time has elapsed; and sending the at least one data package addressed to the second target. For example, in an example embodiment when the data package is queued, a timer can be set to expire after a predetermined amount of time. The predetermined value can be set by a network administrator and can be based on various conditions. In an example embodiment when the timer expires an interrupt can be sent to processor 208 and interrupt handler instructions can be executed by processor 208. The interrupt handler instructions can direct processor 208 to execute the media client 228 and the processor 208 can send the data package to the target via a transceiver of the device. In this example, delay can be introduced into the process of sending a data package until, for example, the predetermined amount of time elapses or a PTT channel is established with the any target.<br/>
