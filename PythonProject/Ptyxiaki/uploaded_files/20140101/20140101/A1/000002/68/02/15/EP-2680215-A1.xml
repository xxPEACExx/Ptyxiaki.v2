Generally speaking, a social network refers to an application or service that facilitates the building of online communities of people who share interests and activities, or who are interested in exploring the interests and activities of others. Many social network services are web-based and provide a variety of ways for users to interact, such as e-mail and instant messaging services.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In many social networks, a particular user may allow their social contacts to view various actions taken by the particular user. As an example, the user may use a social bookmarking web service to perform the action of bookmarking a web Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and tagging it with a descriptive tag. As another example, the user may use a social networking site relating to movies to perform the action of rating and/or reviewing a movie. As a further example, the user may perform the action of writing a review of a product in a personal blog, such as a status update in a social networking application. As yet another example, the user may perform the action of "checking in" to a particular venue.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The user's social contacts may view the user's actions on the social network and may be interested in performing the same or similar actions (e.g., visiting a website tagged by the user in social bookmarking website, purchasing or renting a movie reviewed by the user at the movie-related social networking site, or purchasing a product reviewed on the user's personal blog). Accordingly, the user may be said to have influenced actions performed by his or her social contacts. In a social network, such actions may further propagate to contacts of the user's contacts. Such a user influence pattern may be referred to as "social capital."<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><u>SUMMARY</u></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, a method may include calculating an influence score relating to an action performed by a user of a social network, the influence score for the user being based on performance of the action by a contact of the user and occurring after performance of the action by the user and calculating an action score based on the influence score for the user.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Technical advantages of the present disclosure may be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the figures, description and claims included herein.

Particular implementations of the invention operate in a wide area network environment, such as the Internet, including multiple network addressable systems. Network cloud 160 generally represents one or more interconnected networks, over which the systems and hosts described herein can communicate. Network cloud 160 may include packet-based wide area networks (such as the Internet), private networks, wireless networks, satellite networks, cellular networks, paging networks, and the like.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref> illustrates, a particular implementation of the invention may operate in a network environment comprising network application hosting site 120, such as an informational web site, social network site and the like. Although <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref> illustrates only one network application hosting site, implementations of the invention may operate in network environments that include multiples of one or more of the individual systems and sites disclosed herein. Client nodes 182, 184 may be operably connected to the network environment via a network service provider or any other suitable means.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A client node may include a computer or computing device including functionality for communicating over a computer network. A client node may include a personal computer 82 (e.g., a desktop, laptop, notebook, or tablet computer, etc.) or a mobile devices 84 (e.g., a cellular telephone, a smartphone, a personal digital assistant, etc.). A client node may execute one or more client applications, such as a web browser, to access and view content over a computer network. In particular implementations, the client applications allow users to enter addresses of specific network resources to be retrieved. These addresses can be Uniform Resource Locators, or URLs. In addition, once a page or other resource has been retrieved, the client applications may provide access to other pages or records when the user "clicks" on hyperlinks to other resources. In some implementations, such hyperlinks are located within web pages and provide an automated way for the user to enter the URL of another page and to retrieve that page. The pages or resources can be data records including as content plain textual information, or more complex digitally encoded multimedia content, such as software programs or other code objects, graphics, images, audio signals, videos, and so forth.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The networked systems described herein may communicate over the network 160 using any suitable communications protocols. For example, client nodes 182, as well as various servers of the systems described herein, may include Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) networking stacks to provide for datagram and transport functions. Of course, any other suitable network and transport layer protocols can be utilized.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In addition, hosts or end-systems described herein may use a variety of higher layer communications protocols, including client-server (or request-response) protocols, such as the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and other communications protocols, such as HTTP-S, FTP, SNMP, TELNET, and a number of other protocols, may be used. In addition, a server in one interaction context may be a client in another interaction context. Still further, in particular implementations, the information transmitted between hosts may be formatted as HyperText Markup Language (HTML) documents. Other structured document languages or formats can be used, such as eXtensible Markup Language (XML), and the like.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In some client-server protocols, such as the use of HTML over HTTP, a server generally transmits a response to a request from a client. The response may include one or more data objects. For example, the response may include a first data object, followed by subsequently transmitted data objects. In one implementation, for example, a client request may cause a server to respond with a first data object, such as an HTML page, which itself refers to other data objects. A client application, such as a browser, will request these additional data objects as it parses or otherwise processes the first data object.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Mobile client nodes 184 may use other communications protocols and data formats. For example, mobile client nodes 184, in some implementations, may include Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) functionality and a WAP browser. The use of other wireless or mobile device protocol suites is also possible. In addition, the network environment may also include protocol translation gateways, proxies or other systems to allow mobile client nodes 184, for example, to access other network protocol environments. For example, a user may use a mobile client node 184 to capture an image and upload the image over the carrier network to a content site connected to the Internet.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Network application hosting site 120 may be a network addressable system that hosts a network application accessible to one or more users over a computer network. The network application may be an informational web site where users request and receive identified web pages and other content over the computer network. The network application may also be a search platform, an on-line forum or blogging application where users may submit or otherwise configure content for display to other users. The network application may also be a social network application allowing users to configure and maintain personal web pages. The network application may also be a content distribution application, (e.g., a music store/library, a podcasting server), that displays available content, and transmits content to users.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Network application hosting site 120, may include one or more physical servers 122 and content data store 124. The one or more physical servers 22 may be operably connected to computer network 160 via a router 126. The one or more physical servers 122 may host functionality that provides a network application (e.g, a news content site, etc.) to a user. As discussed in connection with <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 2</figref>, the functionality hosted by the one or more physical servers 122 may include web or HTTP servers, ad serving systems, geo-targeting systems, and the like. Still further, some or all of the functionality described herein may be accessible using an HTTP interface or presented as a web service using SOAP or other suitable protocols.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Content data store 124 may store content as digital content data objects. A content data object or content object, in particular implementations, is an individual item of digital information typically stored or embodied in a data file or record. Content objects may take many forms, including: text (e.g., ASCII, SGML, HTML), images (e.g., jpeg, tif and gif), graphics (vector-based or bitmap), audio, video (e.g., mpeg), or other multimedia, and combinations thereof. Content object data may also include executable code objects (e.g., games executable within a browser window or frame), podcasts, etc. Structurally, content data store 124 may connote a large class of data storage and management systems. In particular implementations, content data store 24 may be implemented by any suitable physical system including components, such as database servers, mass storage media, media library systems, and the like.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Network application hosting site 120, in one implementation, provides web pages, such as front pages, that include an information package or module describing one or more attributes<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> of a network addressable resource, such as a web page containing an article or product description, a downloadable or streaming media file, and the like. The web page may also include one or more ads, such as banner ads, text-based ads, sponsored videos, games, and the like. Generally, web pages and other resources include hypertext links or other controls that a user can activate to retrieve additional web pages or resources. A user "clicks" on the hyperlink with a computer input device to initiate a retrieval request to retrieve the information associated with the hyperlink or control.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 2</figref> illustrates a client host server environment 200, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. As <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 2</figref> illustrates, network application hosting site 120 may include one or more network clients 205 and one or more client hosts 210 operating in conjunction with one or more server hosts 220. The foregoing functional modules may be realized by hardware, executable modules stored on a computer readable medium, or a combination of both. The functional modules, for example, may be hosted on one or more physical servers 122 and/or one or more client computers 182, 184.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Network client 205 may include a web client hosted on client computers 182, 184, a client host 210 located on physical server 122, or a server host located on physical server 122. Client host 210 may be an executable web or HTTP server module that accepts HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) requests from network clients 205 acting as a web clients, such web browser client applications hosted on client computers 182, 184, and serving HTTP responses including contents, such as HyperText Markup Language (HTML) documents and linked objects (images, advertisements, etc.). Client host 210 may also be an executable module that accepts Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) requests from one or more client hosts 210 or one or more server hosts 220. In some embodiments, client host 210 may have the capability of delegating all or part of single or multiple requests from network client 205 to one or more server hosts 220. Client host 210, as discussed above, may operate to deliver a network application, such as an informational web page or an Internet search service.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In a particular implementation, client host 210 may act as a server host 220 to another client host 210 and may function to further delegate requests to one or more server hosts 220 and/or one or more client hosts 210. Server hosts 220 host one or more server applications, such<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> as an ad selection server, sponsored search server, content customization server, and the like.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In a social networking service, each user of the social network may create a network profile (e.g., username, password, and/or biographical information) via a client node 182, 184. For example, a user may access the social network via an application program available at the client node and/or via a website for the social network. Via client nodes 182, 184, each user may also specify other users in the social network to which the user has a social tie. In this disclosure, the terms "social tie" and "tie" may be used to indicate a social relationship between two users in a social network (e.g., a "friend," "buddy," "connection," "link," etc.), while the term "contact" may be used to indicate a user for which a user has a social tie. In addition to a social tie existing based on a declared relationship between users, a social tie may also be derived by the social networking service on the basis of shared interests and/or biographical information of the users. The social networking application, user biographical information, social ties, and contact information may be hosted at network application hosting site 120. Users using client nodes 182, 184 may access the social networking application via network cloud 160.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Once a user's contacts have been identified, a user may be able to access the social networking application website and/or application to view some or all of the profile information of his or her contacts, including, for example, actions performed by the contacts.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 3A</figref> illustrates an example graph 300 of users and social ties in a social network, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. In <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 3</figref>, vertices of graph 300 indicate users in the social network, and the edges of graph 300 depict the existence of social ties between users in the social network. For example, an edge connecting two vertices may indicate that such users are contacts (e.g., "friends"). For example, as depicted in graph 300, user u1 is a contact of users u2, u3, and u4, but not a contact of users u5, u6, and u7.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 3B</figref> illustrates an example action log 302 for a social network represented by graph 300, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. As seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 3B</figref>, action log 302 may be a relation <i>Actions</i> (<i>User, Time</i>), including one or more tuples (<i>u, t</i>) indicating that a user u performed a particular action at time t. Such an action log may include such a tuple for one or more actions performed by one of more users of the social network. By linking the actions of a social graph and an action log, the propagation of influence for various<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> actions, and thus the social capital of a user with respect to such action, can be determined.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In operation, a network application may calculate a score for a particular action based on the social capital of one or more users of a social network, as explained in greater detail below. An influence score for an action for each user may be calculated based on occurrences of the action or a derivative action of the action by other users that occur after the user performs such action. For example, the influence score may be a function of the number of times the action or a derivative action is performed by contacts of the user after the performance of the action by the user and/or the frequency of performance of the action or a derivative action by contacts of the user. In addition or alternatively, the influence score for an action for a user may be a function of the influence scores for the action of contacts of the user, such that the influence score for a user may account for the propagation of the user's influence through the social network. In addition or alternatively, the influence score including portions thereof (e.g., the number of times the action or a derivative action is performed by contacts of the user after the performance of the action by the user, the frequency of performance of the action or a derivative action by contacts of the user, influence scores of a user's contacts) may be a function of the time that subsequent actions or derivative actions by a user's contacts are performed after the initial performance of the action by the user, such that later-occurring instances of the action or a derivative action have lesser weight in calculating the influence score than those occurring earlier. In some embodiments, an initial influence score may be assumed for each user, and a final influence score for each user may be iteratively and/or recursively calculated based on the influence scores of contacts of each user.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">After influence scores for an event have been calculated for users in a social network, the network application may calculate an action score associated with the action. Such action score may be the sum of the individual influence scores of the users of a social network respective to the action. By analyzing action scores for numerous actions, the actions may be ranked according to action score. Accordingly, the network application may recommend actions to users of a social network based on social capital of its users (e.g., recommendation of song based on influence as determined by the action of downloading of the song by users of the social<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> network, recommendation of a restaurant based on influence as determined by the action of "checking in" to the restaurant, etc.).</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As used herein, a "derivative action" of a particular action may be an action that is related to, based on, and/or similar to, but not necessarily identical to the particular action. For example, a first user may perform the action of reviewing a restaurant, and a second user may perform the derivative action of checking in to the restaurant.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 4</figref> illustrates a flow chart of an example method 400 of calculating an action score, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure.

As described above, such influence score may be based on one or more of the number of times the action or a derivative action is performed by contacts of the user after the performance of the action by the user, the frequency of performance of the action or a derivative by contacts of the user, the influence scores for the action of contacts of the user, and/or the time that subsequent actions or derivative actions by a user's contacts are performed after the initial performance of the action by the user.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In operation 404, the network application may calculate an action score. The action score may be equal to the sum of individual influence scores of the individual users performing the action.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Although <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 4</figref> discloses a particular number of operations to be taken with respect to method 400, method 400 may be executed with greater or lesser operations than those depicted in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 4</figref>.
