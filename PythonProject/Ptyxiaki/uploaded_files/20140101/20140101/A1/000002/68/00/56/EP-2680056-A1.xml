The printer 100 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref> is a so-called black-and-white printer. However, in other embodiments, the image forming apparatus may be a color printer, a facsimile machine, a multifunction peripheral having these functions, or another apparatus for forming a toner image on a sheet. Note that directional terms, such as "top", "bottom", "above", "below", "front", "rear", "right", and "left", used herein are simply for ease of explanation and not at all intended to limit the principle of the image forming apparatus.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> The printer 100 includes a housing 200 in which various devices for forming an image on a sheet P are contained. The housing 200 includes an upper wall 201 defining a top surface of the housing 200, a bottom wall 220 defining a bottom surface of the housing 200, a back wall 230 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>) standing between the upper wall 201 and the bottom wall 220, and a front wall 235 standing opposite to the back wall 230. A paper output section 210 is disposed in the center of the upper wall 201. The paper output section 210 is formed of an inclined surface inclined downward from a front portion to a rear portion of the upper wall 210. The paper output section 210 is a section to which a sheet P having an image formed thereon in an image forming section 120 to be described later is to be output. A manual feed tray 240 is disposed in the front wall 235. The manual feed tray 240 is pivotable up and down (in the direction of the arrow D1 in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>) about its lower end. When the upper end of the manual-feed tray 240 is pivotally moved downward, an opening 290 formed in the housing 200 is open. The opening 290 is communicated with a main body internal space 260 (installation space) inside the housing 200. The user can access, through the opening 290, various devices housed in the main body internal space 260 in the housing 200. When the manual-feed tray 240 is pivotally moved upward, the opening 290 is closed. Thus, unnecessary access of the user to the main body internal space 260 is prevented.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The printer 100 includes a cassette 110, a pick-up roller 112, a first paper feed roller 113, a second paper feed roller 114, a conveyance roller 115, a registration roller pair 116, and an image forming section 120.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The cassette 110 is configured to contain a plurality of sheets P. The cassette 110 includes a lift plate 111 capable of supporting the sheets P. The lift plate 111 is inclined to lift up the leading edges of the sheets P.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The pick-up roller 112 is disposed above the leading edges of the sheets P lifted up<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> by the lift plate 111. When the pick-up roller 112 rotates, the sheets P are pulled out of the cassette 110 one by one.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The first paper feed roller 113 is disposed downstream of the pick-up roller 112. The first paper feed roller 113 forwards the sheet P downstream. The second paper feed roller 114 is disposed near the pivot point of the manual feed tray 240. The second paper feed roller 114 feeds the sheet P on the manual feed tray 240 into the housing 200. The user can selectively use the sheet P contained in the cassette 110 or the sheet P placed on the manual-feed tray 240.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The conveyance roller 115 is disposed downstream of the first paper feed roller 113 and the second paper feed roller 114. The conveyance roller 115 conveys the sheet P forwarded by the first paper feed roller 113 and the second paper feed roller 114 more downstream.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The registration roller pair 116 defines the position of the sheet in a direction orthogonal to a direction of conveyance. Thus, the position of an image to be formed on the sheet P is adjusted. The registration roller pair 116 supplies the sheet P to the image forming section 120 to coincide with the timing of image formation of the image forming section 120.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The image forming section 120 includes a photosensitive drum 121, a charger 122, an exposure device 123 (optical scanning device), a developing device 124, a toner container 125, a transfer roller 126, and a cleaning device 127.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The photosensitive drum 121 has an approximately cylindrical shape.

The exposure device 123 is configured to irradiate the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 121 charged by the charger 122 with laser light. The laser light is emitted according to image data output from an external device (not shown), such as a personal computer, which is connected to the printer 100 to allow communication with the printer 100. As a result, an electrostatic latent image corresponding to the image data is formed on the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 121. The exposure device 123 will be described in detail later.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The developing device 124 is configured to supply toner to the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 121 on which the electrostatic latent image is formed. The toner container 125 is configured to supply toner to the developing device 124. The toner container 125 supplies toner to the developing device 124 sequentially or as needed. When the developing device 124 supplies toner to the photosensitive drum 121, the electrostatic latent image formed on the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 121 is developed (made visible).

The housing 80 includes a housing body 80G and the housing top 80T (see <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>). The housing body 80G is defined on the right, rear, left, and front sides by a right wall 810, a rear wall 811, a left wall 812 (first wall portion), and a front wall 813 (second wall portion), respectively. The housing top 80T is fitted over the housing body 80G and directly mounted to the right wall 810, the rear wall 811, the left wall 812, and the front wall 813. The interior of the housing 80 is formed into an internal space S in which various optical elements are arranged.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The laser diode 81 modulates an image data signal, which is generated by and output from an image memory located outside of the figures, into laser light and emits (outputs) the laser light. The laser diode 81 is disposed in the inside of the right wall 810 of the housing 80. The laser diode 81 is electrically connected to an unshown circuit board configured to control the timing of emission of the laser light and so on. The lens elements 82, 83 are formed of, for example, a collimator lens or a prism and have the function of converting the incident laser light to collimated light.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The polygon motor unit 7 is disposed in a substantially central portion of the housing 80. The polygon motor unit 7 includes a polygon motor 71 mounted on a board and a polygon mirror 72. The polygon motor 71 is configured to input a drive current and thereby rotate the polygon mirror 72 at a predetermined rotational speed. The polygon mirror 72 is formed in a flat-plate shape of regular hexagon in plan view and includes a plurality of mirror surfaces. The polygon mirror 72 is driven into rotation in the direction of the arrow DP in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>. In other words, the polygon motor 71 rotates the polygon mirror 72 so that the plurality of mirror surfaces of the polygon mirror 72 sequentially face the left wall 812 and then face the front wall 813. While being rotated by the polygon motor 71, the polygon mirror 72 deflects the laser light coming from the lens element 83 to direct it toward the fθ lens 85.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The fθ lens 85 is disposed forwardly of the polygon motor unit 7 along a right-and-left direction. The fθ lens 85 is disposed between the polygon motor 71 and the front wall 813 to extend in a direction perpendicular to the left wall 812. The fθ lens 85 has an approximately arched shape in top view. Particularly, the midportion of the fθ lens 85 protrudes toward the polygon mirror 72 and both ends thereof protrudes toward the fold mirror 86 (and the front wall 813). The fθ lens 85 has the function of refracting the laser light deflected by the polygon mirror 72 to allow the laser light to scan the photosensitive drum 121 at a constant speed. The fold mirror 86 is provided to reflect the laser light coming from the fθ lens 85 and guide it to the photosensitive drum 121.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The housing 80 further includes an extension 801. The extension 801 is a wall portion provided in the internal space S and extended from the inside wall surface of the left wall 812. The extension 801 partitions the corner between the left wall 812 and the front wall 813 into a portion near the left wall 812 and a portion near the front wall 813. The extension 801 is extended rightward from the inside wall surface of the left wall 812, then bent rearward, and then bent toward the polygon motor unit 7. A left end portion LA of the fθ lens 85 is located immediately on the right of the extension 801. Furthermore, a distal end portion 802 (partition) of the extension 801 is located behind the left end portion LA of the fθ lens 85 and extended toward the mirror surfaces of the polygon mirror 72. In other words, the distal end portion 802 of the extension 801 is disposed to face a surface end region of the fθ lens 85 located near the left wall 812 and facing the polygon mirror 72.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In this exposure device 123, the laser light emitted from the laser diode 81 is guided through the lens elements 82, 83 to the polygon mirror 72. The laser light incident on the rotating polygon mirror 72 is reflected and deflected by the mirror surfaces of the polygon mirror 72. Then, the laser light passes through the fθ lens 85, is reflected by the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> fold mirror 86, and is then guided to the drum surface of the rotating photosensitive drum 121. During this time, the photosensitive drum 121 rotates about the axis orthogonal to a predetermined scanning direction (in the sub-scanning direction, or the direction of the arrow B in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>) while the laser light horizontally scans the drum surface of the photosensitive drum 121 in the predetermined scanning direction (the main scanning direction, or the direction of the arrow A in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>).</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">When the polygon motor 71 is driven into rotation, heat generated from the polygon motor 71 is diffused into the housing 80 by a laminar airflow formed with the rotation of the polygon motor 71. Then, as shown by an area H in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, the warmed air is distributed over an area extending from the polygon motor unit 7 to a corner formed between the left wall 812 and the fθ lens 85. As a result, the left end portion LA of the fθ lens 85 (a portion thereof near the left wall 812) reaches a higher temperature than a right end portion LB (a portion thereof away from the left wall 812) to cause a temperature gradient in the fθ lens 85. Thus, the left end portion LA may be thermally expanded to a greater degree than the right end portion LB, so that the fθ lens 85 may have refractive index differences in the right-and-left direction (the direction of extension) of the fθ lens 85. The refractive index differences induce distortion of the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum 121, resulting in a defective image formed by the image forming apparatus 1.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Even in the above case of heat diffusion, in this embodiment, the temperature gradient of the fθ lens 85 in the right-and-left direction can be appropriately reduced. <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective view of the exposure device 123 according to this embodiment similar to, but different from <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> in that the exposure device 123 includes the housing top 80T. <figref idrefs="f0006">FIGS. 6</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">7</figref> are cross-sectional views of the exposure device 123. <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along the line H1-H2 of <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along the line L1-L2 of <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The exposure device 123 includes a heat-insulating room 50.

The recess 80D is defined on the front, rear, and bottom sides by a recess front wall 80T2, a recess rear wall 80T3, and a recess bottom wall 80T1, respectively. The heat transferred from the high-temperature fθ lens 85 through the recess bottom wall 80T1 into the recess 80D is released as an upward airflow to an upper region of the exposure device 123. Specifically, since the plate 500 does not cover a region of the recess 80D located above<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> the left end portion LA of the fθ lens 85, the heat transferred into the recess 80 is released to the upper region of the exposure device 123.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">On the other hand, referring to <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>, the heat-insulating room 50 is disposed above the fθ lens 85 (its right end portion LB). An air layer is formed inside the heat-insulating room 50. The heat-insulating room 50 is defined by the recess 80D and the plate 500 disposed above the recess 80D. The housing top 80T includes a recess inner wall 80T4 above the right end portion LB of the fθ lens85. Thus, the recess 80D is defined by the recess inner wall 80T4, the recess bottom wall 80T1, and the recess front wall 80T2.

However, the heat is insulated by the heat-insulating room 50 and is therefore less likely to be released to the upper region of the exposure device 123. Therefore, the amount of heat transferred from the fθ lens 85 to the recess bottom wall 80T1 can be reduced to reduce the temperature drop of the fθ lens 85 (its right end portion LB). When the heat-insulating room 50 is disposed in contact with the top surface of the fθ lens 85, the above heat insulating effect can be further ensured to provide a uniform temperature inside the housing 80. For example, the recess bottom wall 80T1 is preferably disposed in contact with the top surface of the fθ lens 85. Furthermore, in this embodiment, the standing wall 80T5 defines the left side of the heat-insulating room 50.

In other words, since the standing wall 80T5 separates the region of the recess 80D located above the left end portion LA of the fθ lens 85 from the region of the recess 80D located above the right end portion LB of the fθ lens 85, the heat transferred to the region of the recess 80D located above the left end portion LA can be prevented from transferring toward the region (heat-insulating room 50) of the recess 80D located above the right end portion LB.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">As described previously, the housing 80 includes the extension 801 provided in the internal space S and extended from the inside wall surface of the left wall 812.

The airflow taken in the main body internal space 260 by the fan 550 flows through the air passage 555 along the housing top 80T from the left wall 812 toward the right wall 810 (see the arrows A1 and A2 in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>). During this flow, the airflow passes by a portion of the housing top 80T located above the portion of the fθ lens 85 near the left wall 812. As a result, the airflow promotes the heat release from the portion of the fθ lens 85 near the left wall 812. Subsequently, the airflow passes above the heat-insulating room 50. Therefore, the heat taken from above the portion of the fθ lens 85 near the left wall 812 can be supplied to the heat-insulating room 50.

As a result, a temperature gradient occurs between the portion (left end portion LA) of the fθ lens 85 near the left wall 812 and the portion (right end portion LB) thereof away from the left wall 812. The temperature gradient may induce thermal expansion differences among portions of the fθ lens 85, so that the fθ lens 85 may have refractive index differences in the direction of extension of the fθ lens 85. To cope with this, in the structure of this embodiment, the heat-insulating room 50 insulating heat radiated from the internal space S is disposed above the portion of the fθ lens 85 away from the left wall 812. Therefore, in an area around the portion of the fθ lens 85 located away from the left wall 812 and likely to have a lower temperature than the portion thereof near the left wall 812, heat release from inside to outside of the exposure device 123 can be restricted.
