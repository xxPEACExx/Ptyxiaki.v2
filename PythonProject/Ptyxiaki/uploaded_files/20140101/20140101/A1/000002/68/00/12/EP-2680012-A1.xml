Other uses of this technology are found in biomedical industry, nanotechnology, and scientific applications. In particular, AFM may be used for critical defect metrology (CD-metrology), particle scanning, stress- and roughness measurements. AFM microscopy allows visualization of surfaces at very high accuracy, enabling visualization of surface elements at sub-nanometer resolution.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The very high resolution and accuracy of this technology however comes at the cost of performance in terms of throughput. Atomic force microscopy is performed by tracing of a sample surface in a scanning motion using a probe tip touching or tapping (i.e. repeatedly touching) the surface, while accurately measuring disposition of the probe tip in a direction transverse to the sample surface (z-direction) using for example a high<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> precision optical sensing system, e.g. using beam deflection or an interferometer. Scanning is performed by vibrating the tip in the z-direction, while performing the scanning motion across the surface to be mapped. To accurately map a given section of a sample surface, e.g. a structure on a wafer surface, the probe tip requires to be scanned such that every fraction of the section with sub-nanometer dimensions is touched or tapped by the probe tip at least once. As will be appreciated, this process may be rather slow.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Further development of the SPM technology has provided AFM systems comprising a probe head upon which a plurality of probes are mounted side by side. Each probe comprises a cantilever and a probe tip, and each probe tips position in z-direction is measureable independently. This allows for scanning of a plurality of 'scanning lanes' at one pass of the scanning head, and as will be appreciated, the speed at which a single section may be scanned is multiplied by the number of probe tips present on the head.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Even though the above has lead to an improvement in throughput, the scanning of multiple sites on a sample surface still takes a considerable amount of time. For this and other reasons, application of this technique in industrial environments, for example for the testing of wafers in semiconductor industry, is far from ideal.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary of the invention</u></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to alleviate the abovementioned problems of the prior art, and to provide a scanning probe microscopy device that allows for high speed high throughput scanning of multiple sites on a sampling surface.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The above mentioned and other objects of the invention are achieved in that there is provided an scanning microscopy device for mapping nanostructures on a sample surface of a sample, comprising a plurality probes for scanning the sample surface, and one or more motion actuators for enabling motion of the probes relative to the sample, wherein each of said<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> plurality of probes comprises a probing tip mounted on a cantilever arranged for bringing the probing tip in contact with the sampling surface for enabling the scanning, the device further comprising a plurality of Z-position detectors for determining a position of each probing tip along a Z-direction when the probing tip is in contact with the sample surface, wherein the Z-direction is a direction transverse to the sample surface, for enabling mapping of the nanostructures; wherein the plurality of probes are mounted on a plurality of heads, each head comprising one or more of said plurality of probes; wherein each of said heads is mounted on a support base associated with said head, each support base being arranged for individually moving its associated head relative to the sample; and wherein, for enabling said individual motion of the associated head, each support base comprises a plane actuator unit comprising at least one of said motion actuators for moving the head associated with the support base relative to the sample in at least one direction parallel to the sample surface, wherein the plane actuator unit is located at a first mounting position along said support base, said first mounting position being remote from a second mounting position, wherein the head associated with the support base is mounted on the second mounting position on the support base.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The scanning probe microscopy device of the present invention may for example be an atomic force microscopy (AFM) device. Although in the present document reference will be made to particularly the embodiment of an atomic force microscopy device, the teachings of this document are not restricted to such an application, and may be applied to similar devices in the field of: BEEM, ballistic electron emission microscopy; CFM, chemical force microscopy; C-AFM, conductive atomic force microscopy; ECSTM electrochemical scanning tunneling microscope; EFM, electrostatic force microscopy; FluidFM, fluidic force microscope; FMM, force modulation microscopy; FOSPM, feature-oriented scanning probe microscopy; KPFM, kelvin probe force microscopy; MFM, magnetic force microscopy; MRFM, magnetic resonance force microscopy; NSOM, near-field scanning optical<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> microscopy (or SNOM, scanning near-field optical microscopy); PFM, Piezoresponse Force Microscopy; PSTM, photon scanning tunneling microscopy; PTMS, photothermal microspectroscopy/microscopy; SCM, scanning capacitance microscopy; SECM, scanning electrochemical microscopy; SGM, scanning gate microscopy.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In accordance with most embodiments, the support bases comprising the probe heads will be embodied as support arms. With respect to such embodiments, the term 'support base' used in this document is to be interpreted as 'support arm'. As will be appreciated, the concept of the invention may be implemented using different type of support bases.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A scanning probe microscopy device, such as an atomic force microscopy device, uses actuators for enabling motion of it's probing tips in three orthogonal directions relative the sampling surface. As already indicated, the tip must be movable in the z-direction which is usually implemented by applying a vibration to the probe tip in this direction. For scanning the surface, the probe tip is to be moved in two orthogonal directions parallel to the sampling surface.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In accordance with the inventive principle, the actuators for moving a head comprising the at least one probe tip parallel to the sampling surface, are located remotely from the mounting position of the head on the support base or support arm. The plane actuator unit for moving the head in-plane with respect to the sampling surface is placed at a distance away from the head, where there is more room available for accommodating the actuators. This released constraints on the head, and enables to provide the head being much smaller. As a result, the inventive atomic force microscopy device can be equipped with multiple support bases or arms, each base carrying a head, and each head comprising one or more probes with probing tips. Each arm comprises its own plane actuator unit, allowing individual motion of each support base, independently from other bases.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As a result, the atomic force microscopy device of the invention allows for the simultaneous scanning of multiple remote sites on a single sampling surface, where each site may be scanned at the typical scanning speeds of a conventional microscope. The throughput is therefore multiplied by the number of support bases or support arms applied, which reduces the processing time considerably. For example, suppose that a convention AFM method requires 40 seconds for scanning a single site of 10µm*10µm. A wafer comprising 50 sites to be tested will take more than half an hour when it is tested using the conventional AFM method. Suppose the inventive AFM method is applied in an AFM device with 50 individually movable and controllable support bases or arms, this wafer may be tested in only 40 seconds. As will be appreciated, the amount of support bases or arms provided is only limited by the design of the device, and is not restricted to the specific example of 50 bases or arms. A device with 30 bases or arms would require 80 seconds for scanning all sites: the first 30 sites in the first pass, and the remaining 20 sites in a second pass.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In a specific embodiment, the first mounting position is located near a first end of the support arm, and wherein the second mounting position is located near a second end of the support arm. In this embodiment, the actuators may be placed aligned with the axial direction through the support arm, in the extended direction thereof. Most flexibility in the design is achieved in this manner, and it further allows more support arms to be placed adjacent each other (due to absence of actuators and control parts to the side of the support arms), thereby increasing throughput.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Although in principle, any two orthogonal directions according to any coordinate system may be used, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, for one or more of said support bases or arms, the plane actuator unit of each of said one or more support arms comprises at least one of an X-direction motion actuator and a Y-direction motion actuator. Here the X- and<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> Y-direction may be perpendicular directions parallel to the sampling surface corresponding to a Cartesian coordinate system.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In a particular embodiment, the X-direction actuator comprises a linear shift actuator for moving the second end along the X-direction. In another particular embodiment, the Y-direction actuator comprises a rotational actuator for pivoting the support base or arm such as to move the second end in the Y-direction. With respect to this latter embodiment, it is to be said that the pivoting action of the support bases or arms for providing the Y-directional motion avoids conflicts between support arms obstructing each other during scanning.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to a particular embodiment, the rotational actuator comprises a hinge element for rotating the support arm in a plane parallel to the sample surface in use, said hinge element cooperating with a further linear shift actuator for providing the rotating action of the support arm. This allows for a very precise positioning of the probe tip relative to the sampling surface in the Y-direction. Moreover, to even increase precision, in accordance with a further embodiment, the hinge element comprises at least one element of a group comprising a cross hinge, a Haberland hinge, or a hinge comprising one or more leaf springs. Furthermore, again for allowing high precision positioning of the probe tip, in some embodiments the further linear shift actuator cooperating with the hinge element is arranged for acting on said support arm in a direction parallel to an axial direction through the arm and in an off-axis position thereof such as to enable pivoting of the arm by means of the hinge element.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In an atomic force microscopy device in accordance with embodiments of the invention, each support base or arm may further comprises a Z-direction actuator for moving the probing tip in the Z-direction. The Z-direction actuator may comprise a Z-positioning actuator for bringing the probing tip to and from the sample surface, and/or a Z-vibration actuator for vibrating the probing tip in the Z-direction adjacent the sampling surface<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> for enabling said scanning of said sample surface. According to some embodiments, the Z-direction actuator is located at the second mounting position of the support base or arm, mounted on or near the head. Mounting the Z-direction actuator on the head allows for the very precise and accurate stroke required in this direction.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Embodiments of the atomic force microscopy device in accordance with the invention may further comprise a motion control locator unit arranged for determining in use a current position of each of the heads relative to the sample surface in at least a direction parallel to the sample surface. As will be appreciated, the motion control locator allows for controlling motion of the support bases or arms by providing precise information on the location of each head and associated arm. This may be implemented in that the motion control locator unit comprises a grid formed by an arrangement of optical references, and wherein each head comprises an optical sensor for detecting the optical references, wherein said grid is arranged substantially parallel to the sample surface at an opposite position of the support bases or arms relative to the sample surface, such that the support bases or arms are in between the sensor grid and the sample surface in use. The references may comprise optically contrasting regions, e.g. reflective regions and absorptive regions. In conventional AFM methods, the location of the head (i.e. X-Y-position) is measured from the side of the sampling surface with optical sensors. In the present invention, an optical path from the side to some of the heads may become obstructed by other arms and heads. Therefore, a new type of locator unit has been developed for use in some embodiments of the invention where the above problem of obstructed view may play part. The location is measured using a grid at an opposite side of the arm and head with respect to the sampling surface in use.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As will be appreciated, an atomic force microscopy device in accordance with the invention, may further comprise a sample carrier arranged for receiving said sample in use, such as a wafer. Moreover, in<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> accordance with some particular embodiments, relative to a gravitational direction, the heads are located above the optical reference grid, and the sample carrier is located above the heads, wherein the sample carrier is arranged for exposing the sample surface at a side facing the heads. This is a very convenient arrangement of functional layers in the device, as having the sample carrier on top allows for easy access to the sample carrier such as to replace the sample efficiently. At the same time, having the optical reference grid directly underneath the arms, opposite to the sample surface allows for accurate determination of the location of the heads and the probe tips at close distance. As a further improvement, the support base associated with each head can be locked with high stiffness to the grid, thus providing a stable reference for the topography measurement. The term actuator used throughout this document may include any high precision actuator available and known to the skilled person, including piezo-electric actuators, stepper motors, and the like.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to a further embodiment, the plane actuation unit associated with each support base is mounted directly on the support base, providing actuation forces between the support base and a support structure below the support base.

As will be appreciated the teachings of the invention may be applied to any microscopy device that is based on the principles of scanning a surface region using a probe. Particular fields of applications have been mentioned earlier in this document.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> schematically illustrates the working principle of a typical prior art atomic force microscope. In <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, a probe head 2 comprises piezo type drivers 3 for the X-, Y-, and Z-directional motion of a probe 8. The probe 8 consists of a cantilever 9 having a probe tip 10 arranged for scanning a sample surface 5. During scanning, a dither piezo (not shown) may drive the cantilever in vibrational mode, for example close to resonant frequency, to enable tapping of the probe tip on the surface. The manner of applying a vibrational motion to the probe tip is known to the skilled person.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Scanning of the sample surface 5 is performed by moving the probe tip 10 in the X- and Y direction parallel to the sample surface 5 (or alternatively, by moving the substrate surface while maintaining the position of the probe tip fixed in the X- and Y-directions). The probe tip 10 is brought in close proximity to the surface 5 by means of a z-directional piezo driver. Once in the position, the probe tip 10 is vibrated in the z-direction such that it repeatedly touches the surface 5 during scanning thereof. At the same time, a laser 16 illuminates the probe tip with laser beam 15. The precise position in the z-direction is determined using photo diodes 18 which receive the reflected laser beam 15.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The sample surface 5 is carried using a sample carrier 4. Driving of the piezo drivers 3 located on the probe head 2 is performed using the detector and feedback electronics 20. At the same time, the detector and feedback electronics 20 receive the detected z position as determined using photo diodes 18. This principle allows for very precise mapping of surface elements, such as surface element 13 on the sample surface. As described herein above, since the mapping of the surface has to be performed with great precision, the speed at which the method is performed is rather slow.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> schematically illustrates an atomic force microscope device according to the present invention. <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> in particular illustrates the working principle of the AFM microscope of the present invention.
