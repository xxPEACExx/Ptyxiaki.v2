Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Electronic apparatuses such as cellular phones and smartphones have been reduced in size and thickness, and in response to this, the form of mounting parts on a printed circuit board (hereinafter abbreviated to "board") provided inside apparatuses has mostly shifted to the surface mounting of chip parts.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In these electronic apparatuses, a ground (GND) line of the board is connected to a conductor panel of the enclosure (so-called frame grounding [FG]) in order to protect electronic parts mounted on the board and to deal with noise. Frame grounding is also performed between boards. In this case, a surface-mount contact member is used to connect respective conductors of the boards.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Usually, an automatic mounting apparatus is used to mount electronic parts on the surface of a board. In the case of a large electronic part, the automatic mounting apparatus holds the electronic part by clamping the electronic part with claws, and mounts the electronic part at a predetermined position. On the other hand, in the case of a small electronic part, the electronic part is held by attraction and adhesion using a suction nozzle. Accordingly, such a small electronic part subjected to mounting by the automatic mounting apparatus has an attracted part that is attracted and adhered to a suction nozzle.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Furthermore, it is desired that a contact<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> member used for frame grounding be connected to a board with electrical stability. Therefore, while there has been a demand for size reduction, the design of the shape of a spring member has become important.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Such conventional contact members used for surface mounting include the following.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">For example, Patent Document 1 (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2009272237A"><text>2009-272237</text></patcit>) discloses a surface-mount contact with an attracted surface that is attracted and adhered to a suction nozzle.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Patent Document 2 (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2002015801A"><text>2002-015801</text></patcit>) discloses a contact member provided with an attracted surface part.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to an aspect of the present invention, a contact member that electrically connects a first board and a second board includes a first joining part including a first surface to be joined to the first board; a contact point part to come into contact with the second board; a first contact part that faces and comes into contact with a second surface of the first joining part opposite to the first surface; a first bent portion formed by bending a portion of the contact member between the first joining part and the first contact part; a second bent portion formed by bending a portion of the contact member between the first contact part and the contact point part in a direction opposite to a direction in which the first bent portion is bent; and an attracted part that extends from the contact point part in a direction away from the second bent portion.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, and 1F</figref> are a plan view, a left side view, a front view, a right side view, a bottom view, and a perspective view, respectively, of a contact member according to a first embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the contact member, taken along a plane including line A-A in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1D</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3A through 3C</figref> are diagrams illustrating a displacement of the contact member according to the first embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is an enlarged view of a contact point part according to the first embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIGS. 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E, and 5F</figref> are a plan view, a left side view, a front view, a right side view, a bottom view, and a perspective view, respectively, of a contact member according to a second embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> are diagrams illustrating the mounting of a contact member on a board according to the second embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> are a perspective view and a bottom view, respectively, of a contact member according to the second embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> are a perspective view and a bottom view, respectively, of a contact member according to the second embodiment; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> is a diagram illustrating soldering of a contact member.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0006">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">As described above, Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2 illustrate conventional contact members with an adhesion and attraction surface. However, according to these contact members, the attracted surface is provided at a position that is<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> displaceable with a single spring. Therefore, when a suction nozzle of an automatic mounting apparatus presses the attracted surface, the attracted surface tilts with the bending of the single spring. Accordingly, a gap may be formed between the end of the nozzle and the contact member, thus causing a vacuum leak to end up in attraction failure. Specifically, in Patent Document 1, the upper surface of a surface-mount contact is an attracted surface, and the attracted surface tilts with the bending of a bent part. Likewise, in Patent Document 2, the attracted surface part of a metal terminal part is caused to tilt by the bending of a spring part, thus making the attracted surface less attractable.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to an aspect of the present invention, a contact is provided that has better attractability in an automatic mounting apparatus and has good electrical characteristics.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">A description of embodiments of the present invention is given below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h0007">[a] First Embodiment</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1A through 1F</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> are diagrams illustrating a contact member according to a first embodiment. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, and 1F</figref> are a plan view, a left side view, a front view, a right side view, a bottom view, and a perspective view, respectively, of a contact member 1 according to the first embodiment. <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the contact member 1, taken along a plane including line A-A in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1D</figref>.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The contact member 1 according to this embodiment has a spring characteristic and electrically connects respective contacts of two boards.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As a material for the contact member 1, an<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> electrically-conductive metal plate of, for example, phosphor bronze, beryllium copper, or stainless steel is used that has a spring characteristic. The contact member 1 is formed by processing a metal leaf spring of, for example, 0.08 mm to 0.15 mm in thickness into the graphically illustrated shape by press working. Furthermore, the contact member 1 may be partly or entirely plated with nickel, copper, or gold as desired.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In order to describe the directions of bending of a leaf spring by press working, a direction in which a surface of the leaf spring on the same side as an attracted part 15 (of the contact member 1) is bent inward (folded in "valley fold") in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is referred to as "first bending direction" and a direction in which a surface of the leaf spring on the same side as the attracted part 15 is bent outward (folded in "mountain fold") in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is referred to as "second bending direction."</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1A through 1F</figref>, the contact member 1 includes a first joining part 2 to be joined to a board surface by, for example, soldering, a rising part 3 that is bent in the first bending direction from the first joining part 2 to rise from the board surface, an intermediate part 4 that is continuous with the rising part 3 and is spaced from the board surface, and a second joining part 5 that extends from an opening part 4a formed in the intermediate part 4 to come into contact with the board surface. The opening part 4a is a part of the intermediate part 4 that has become an opening as a result of the piercing of the intermediate part 4 by pressing, with the second joining part 5 being left. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1C</figref>, the second joining part 5 is so bent as to extend downward from a surface of the intermediate part 4.

The bent parts and spring parts of the first bent portion and the second bent portion, however, are not limited to the above-described configuration. For example, the first bent part 6, the first spring part 7, the second bent part 8, and the second spring part 9 may be formed as a single bent portion having the first spring constant. Likewise, the second bent portion as well is not limited to the shape illustrated in this embodiment. The shapes of the bent portions in this embodiment are examples of shapes as a contact member according to the first embodiment.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Next, a description is given, with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3A, 3B, and 3C</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, of the displacement of the contact member 1 according to the first embodiment. <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3A through 3C</figref> are diagrams sequentially illustrating, from <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A to FIG. 3C</figref>, a displacement of the contact member 1 mounted on a surface of a first board 100 as the contact member 1 according to the first embodiment is pressed by a second board 200. In <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3A through 3C</figref>, the first board 100 has an electrically conductive part (not illustrated) on its upper surface. The contact member 1 is mounted on the upper surface of the first board 100 with the first joining part 2 being joined to the electrically conductive part on the upper surface by soldering or the like. An upper part of the contact member 1 is in contact with an electrically conductive part (not illustrated) provided on a lower surface of the second board 200. As a result, frame grounding (FG) is established between the first board 100 and the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> second board 200.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates a state where the second board 200 has first come into contact with the contact member 1. In <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref>, the contact member 1 has not received a downward force from the second board 200, and the contact member 1 is not displaced. Accordingly, the attracted part 15 is substantially horizontal so as to have a large area of contact with the electrically conductive part on the lower surface of the second board 200.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates a state at a time when the second board 200 is depressed. In this embodiment, the first spring constant is determined to be smaller than the second spring constant. Therefore, when a downward force is applied to the attracted part 15 by the second board 200, the first bent portion having a smaller spring constant bends more than the second bent portion having a larger spring constant.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">How the bending of the first bent portion and the bending of the second bent portion affect the inclination of the attracted part 15 is described. When the first bent portion bends, the surface of the attracted part 15 rotates (moves) clockwise. On the other hand, when the second bent portion bends, the surface of the attracted part 15 rotates (moves) counterclockwise. Accordingly, when both the first bent portion and the second bent portion bend, the rotation directions of the attracted part 15 cancel out. Therefore, even when the entire contact member 1 is compressed by the pressure of the second board 200, the surface of the attracted part 15 is likely to be kept in a horizontal position. That is, this movement may be obtained by providing the attracted part 15 ahead of the first bent portion and the second bent portion. When the contact member 1 is depressed by the second<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> board 200, the contact member 1 moves in the same manner in the case where a suction nozzle of an automatic mounting apparatus depresses the attracted part 15. That is, even when the suction nozzle is pressed against the attracted part 15, the surface of the attracted part 15 is less likely to be inclined, so that it is possible to reduce attraction errors.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The first spring constant and the second spring constant may be suitably determined in accordance with mechanical characteristics desired of the contact member 1. For example, when the first spring constant is determined to be an even smaller value than the second spring constant, it is possible to cause the second bent portion to hardly bend before the first bent portion bends to have the first contact part 9a coming into contact with and stopped by the first joining part 2. On the other hand, when the first spring constant and the second spring constant are closer, the second bent portion also considerably bends in accordance with the second spring constant before the first contact part 9a is stopped by the first joining part 2.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The attracted part 15 is positioned so as not to affect the respective spring constants of the first bent portion and the second bent portion. Therefore, in designing the respective shapes of the first bent portion and the second bent portion, the shape of the attracted part 15 may not be taken into consideration in determining the spring performance.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates how the first contact part 9a comes into contact with and is stopped by the first joining part 2. The first contact part 9a reaches and is stopped by the first joining part 2 by a force commensurate to the first spring constant of the first bent portion and a distance from the first contact part 9a to the first joining part 2.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The contact of the first contact part 9a with the first joining part 2 shortens the electrical distance of a conductor, so that it is possible to reduce impedance. This reduction in impedance is particularly effective in the frame grounding of boards that use high frequencies.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">When the second board 200 is further depressed so as to be closer to the first board 100, the second bent portion bends, so that the second contact part 17a approaches the second spring part 9. At this point, the attracted part 15 rotates counterclockwise substantially about the first contact part 9a to be inclined. Therefore, with the inclination of the attracted part 15, a position of the electrically conductive part of the second board 200 at which the contact point part 15a comes into contact with the electrically conductive part gradually changes. This causes friction between the contact point part 15a and the electrically conductive part of the second board 200, so that an oxide film on the surface of a contact point is removed by a frictional force in the contact point part 15a. Thus, a so-called wiping effect is produced, so that it is possible to improve the performance of a contact point.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is an enlarged view of the contact point part 15a. In <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, the initial position of the attracted part 15 is denoted by 15-I. The attracted part 15 is substantially horizontal (parallel to the upper surface of the first board 100) at the initial position 15-I, while at a position 15-II, where the second board 200 is most depressed, the attracted part 15 is rotated counterclockwise relative to the initial position 15-I with the bending of the second bent portion, so as to be inclined toward the lower left in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>. Therefore, the contact point part 15a moves its<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> position of contact with the second board 200 in the rightward direction in accordance with the angle of inclination of the attracted part 15.</p><heading id="h0008">[b] Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p0039" num="0039"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIGS. 5A through 5F</figref> are diagrams illustrating a contact member according to a second embodiment. <figref idrefs="f0005">FIGS. 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E, and 5F</figref> are a plan view, a left side view, a front view, a right side view, a bottom view, and a perspective view, respectively, of a contact member 1a according to the second embodiment.

The smoothed part 15b is smoothed by pressing. Alternatively, the smoothed part 15b may also be smoothed by grinding, blasting, or plating. The smoothed part 15b may cause the contact member 1a to be more reliably attracted and adhered to a suction nozzle of an automatic mounting apparatus.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Furthermore, the contact member 1a includes a contact point part 19. The contact point part 19 has a shape projecting from the surface of the attracted part 15.

Furthermore, the contact point part 19 may be reduced in bending radius compared with the fifth bent part 14, so that the area of contact with the second board 200 is smaller in the contact point part 19 than in the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> contact point part 15a described in the first embodiment. As a result of the smaller area of contact of the contact point part 19 with the second board 200, a stronger contact pressure is generated between the contact point part 19 and the second board 200 so as to increase the wiping effect.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> are diagrams illustrating the mounting of the contact member 1a according to the second embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIGS. 5A through 5F</figref> on the first board 100. <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6A</figref> taken along a plane including line A-A.

By way of example, <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the contact member 1c described in the second embodiment. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>, the contact member 1c has the first joining part 2 and the second joining part 5 placed on an electrically conductive part of the first board 100 on which solder paste 300 is printed, by a suction nozzle of an automatic mounting apparatus (not illustrated). By heating the first board 100, the contact member 1c is soldered to the first board 100 at the first joining part 2 and the second joining part 5.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The contact member 1c includes the rising<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> part 3, which is bent from the first joining part 2 to rise from the surface of the first board 100, the intermediate part 4, which is spaced from the surface of the first board 100, and the second joining part 5 which extends from the opening part 4a of the intermediate part 4 to be joined to the surface of the first board 100. Therefore, an air gap is formed between the surface of the first board 100 and the intermediate part 4, and solder or flux provided in this air gap is prevented from moving up from the first board 100 to the contact member 1c. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent problems such as so-called solder wicking or flux wicking, which causes solder or flux to adhere to a surface of the contact member 1c other than its surface facing the first board 100.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>, soldering is performed on the entire surface of the first joining part 2 that is joined to the first board 100.
