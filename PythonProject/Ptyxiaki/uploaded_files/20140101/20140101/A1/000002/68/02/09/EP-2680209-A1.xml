Recommender systems are machines that shall help users to mitigate a potential information overload.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Users have to deal with the so-called "information overload" problem consisting of an overwhelming amount of (commercial) information they cannot cope with and that restricts their ability to find what they like, stay focused and concentrate on things that are worthwhile according to their interests.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Recommender systems are becoming a popular tool to deal with information overload. They allow retrieving from a vast amount of items, such as A/V content repositories, product catalogues and the like, only those items a user (or a group of users) likes. These recommenders are typically offered as a stand-alone service (e.g. Movielens) or as an add-on to an existing service (e.g. Amazon, iTunes). They increasingly appear in consumer devices, such as the TiVo digital video recorder and the products of APRICO Solutions.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Many internet video services, including YouTube.com, Hulu.com, etc., offer users the possibility of "recommending" a video to friends by either referring to it via a unique URL that can be embedded in an email or by directly connecting to a user's social network, such as facebook. Additionally, there exist also dedicated websites that offer sharing and reviewing services, such as Digg.com, Reddit.com and Delicious.com.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to enable a machine to generate recommendations, it is known to combine user ratings of an item with a user profile and to retrieve similar user profiles and to generate a recommendation to users that have a user profile similar to that of a user that gave a positive rating to an item.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">While this approach is successfully implemented by prior art recommender systems, there is still a need for new or alternative approaches. It is an object of the invention to meet this need.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the invention, this object is achieved by a device for automatic generation of recommendation for an item <i>p</i> to a user <i>u</i>, said device comprising or being at least indirectly connected to - and thus having access to -:
<ul><li>an item database containing information on available items,</li><li>a user profile database containing, for a user <i>v</i> of the system, information on which items the user has seen or purchased or rated, and</li><li>a user interrelation database containing information on connections existing among users <i>u</i> and v, wherein a direct connection is given if a user <i>v</i> belongs to contacts of user <i>u</i>.</li></ul></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The device comprises a standard recommender engine that is configured to access said item database and said user profile database and to calculate a score <i>s</i>(<i>p,u</i>) in a [0,1] interval indicating a "like" degree of an item <i>p</i> for user <i>u</i> based on a user profile of user <i>u</i>. The device further comprises a content discovery recommender that is configured to access said user interrelation database and to find at least users <i>v</i> that have a direct connection to user <i>u</i> and to further access said user profile database in order to determine a fraction of the users <i>v</i> that know an item <i>p</i> and to generate a recommendation<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> based on the score <i>s</i>(<i>p,u</i>) of an item <i>p</i> and the extent (that is the fraction of the users <i>v</i> that know an item <i>p</i>) the item is known among users <i>v</i> that have a direct connection to user <i>u</i>.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The user interrelation database may be a social network database.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The inventors have taken into consideration that people typically trust their friends more than they trust a recommender system. A recommendation made by a friend is usually rated higher in importance and relevance than a recommendation made by a machine, no matter how accurate or relevant the actual recommendation is. Moreover, people like to share their discoveries of new content or new items with friends. For a person, it can be considered very rewarding to be the first to introduce a new item (song, movie, etc.) into his/her community of friends, especially if this item is liked by many in this community. It can be a means to receive appreciation from friends. Many internet services and software applications support methods that allow users to share with their friends things they find and like.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Because the device also determines a fraction of the users <i>v</i> that know an item <i>p</i>, this fraction can be taken into account when generating a recommendation for an item. Preferably, the device is configured to generate an item recommendation for items if the fraction of the users <i>v</i> that know an item <i>p</i> is relatively small. In particular, the device is preferably configured to generate a modified score depending on a standard score <i>s</i>(<i>p,u</i>) and the fraction of the users <i>v</i> that know an item <i>p</i>. While this preferred approach appears counter-intuitive, it is based on the idea to recommend items to users that are known the least in their social network but have a high like-degree, not only for the users themselves but also for their friends. In this way, users are encouraged to try out new items that are potentially interesting for their whole social network and then be the first to claim of having "discovered" them.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Thus, an automatic device is made possible that can create item recommendations, even if the items are little known so far, which is more challenging than recommending well-established items.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to a preferred embodiment, the device is configured to determine the score <i>s(p, u)</i> for an item <i>p</i> in said item database based on a profile of a user <i>u</i> in the user<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> profiles database and wherein said content discovery recommender comprises a community statistics unit and a content discovery recommender unit that are configured to perform the following steps to generate N item recommendations for a given user <i>u</i>:

According to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, the device comprises a standard recommender system 12, a content discovery recommender unit 14 and a community statistics unit 16. The content discovery recommender unit 14 has an input connected to the standard recommender system 12 and a further input connected with a community statistics unit 16.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The device 10 further is connected to or has access to an item database 20, a user profile database 22 and a social network database 24. The social network database 24 is a user interrelation database that contains information about social contacts between users. User profiles of such users are stored in the user profiles database 22. Item database 20 contains information about items that potentially could be recommended to a user.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The standard recommender system 12 of device 10 is connected to or can access item database 20 and user profiles database 22 to generate a standard score for an item p, based e. g. on a feature-value pair evaluation approach as known in the art.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The community statistics unit 16 of device 10 is connected to or can access social network database 24 in order to determine the number of social contacts a user has. Social contacts of a particular user are further users that know the particular user or that are otherwise related to the particular user like "friends" in a well-known social network, such as facebook. The content discovery recommender unit 14 of device 10 can generate a recommendation of an item that is relatively "new" to a particular social community by taking into account a standard score for an item as determined by the standard recommender system 12 and further taking into account a degree of item awareness of a particular item in a particular social community.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The item database contains information on the items available in the system, while the user profiles database contains - for each user of the system - information on which items<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the user has seen or purchased or rated. The social network database contains information on the social connections existing among users and, therefore, more generally is called user interrelation database. Connections are more generally referred to as "contacts" in the context of this disclosure. Examples of social connections are "friend" or "colleague" relationships explicitly indicated by the users. Other connections can be determined by observing frequent email traffic or other forms of messaging and communication among users. External social networks could also be used.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The standard recommender system is a recommender system that calculates scores for items for a user based on the profile of this user in the user profiles database.
