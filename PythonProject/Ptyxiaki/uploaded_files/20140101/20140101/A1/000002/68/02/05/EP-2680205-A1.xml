Mobile payment is an alternative method of payment that, instead of using cash, checks, or credit cards, the user may use a mobile phone to pay for a wide range of goods and services. There are currently four models for conducting such mobile payments, SMS-based transactional payments, direct mobile billing, mobile web payments (using Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) technology), and contactless near field communications.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">SMS-based transactional payments require a user of the mobile device to send an SMS text message or the like, to a short code and a resulting premium charge is added to the user's phone bill or online wallet (as described below). The merchant in the transaction is then informed of the success of the payment and may release the goods, perform the services, etc. Unfortunately, this type of mobile payment has poor reliability, is slow, provides minimal security, high start-up and operating costs, and the like.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Direct mobile billing generally involves a two-factor authentication (e.g., PIN and one-time-password) following which the user's mobile device account is charged for the purchase. Such payment is typical of payments made using mobile phones via ITUNES and ANDROID MARKET, e.g., payment for purchase of games, apps, music, etc. The security for such billing is higher than the SMS-based transactions, faster, convenient (no pre-registration, input of credit/debit cards), and easy (for online purchases). However, this method is limited to online purchases from the aforementioned sites or sites operated by the user's carrier. Additionally, already large carrier telephone bills may present a substantial shock to the user when such purchases are added.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Mobile web payments provide for the display and usage of web sites or downloaded applications to make payments to vendors. This type of operation inherently includes the benefits and disadvantages associated with web-based<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> payments. For example, the user must still pre-register some form of credit card (unless directly billed to the carrier as set forth above); the process mirrors the typical online purchase format familiar to Internet users; if no pre-registration is available, the user must enter credit card information directly via the mobile device, which is prone to entry errors, and the like. Online wallets provided by PAYPAL, AMAZON PAYMENTS and GOOGLE CHECKOUT have mobile options, which involves online user registration. The user first provides a telephone number to one of the online wallet operators, whom then returns an SMS message having a PIN. The user then authenticates the number by entering the PIN and inputs credit card information or another payment method. Payments are then validated during a limited number of transactions. That is, the online wallets are useful for online purchases from a fixed location from online vendors. However, mobility is an issue as the online wallet is maintained by the providers and not on the mobile device, which is especially disadvantageous at a retail establishment that does not provide for online purchases.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Near Field Communication (NFC) is generally used in physical transactions, wherein the vendor and the user are in close physical proximity, e.g., at retail establishments, transportation services, restaurants, and the like. This type of mobile payment requires a specially designed mobile device equipped with a smartcard that is "swiped" by holding the mobile device in close physical proximity to a card reader. The transaction in question may involve direct billing, PIN-based authentication, bank billing, pre-paid.account, or the like. Unfortunately, this method requires a suitably equipped mobile device, as well as suitably equipped card readers at the point-of-sale. Widespread adoption of NFC has thus been hindered by users unwilling to purchase new phones equipped with NFC, vendors unwilling to purchase the equipment necessary to read NFC devices, mobile device manufacturers unwilling to incorporate additional features over which they have little control, etc.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A mobile wallet, in contrast to an online wallet, may include software, hardware, or a combination thereof, resident on a mobile device, that includes one or more linked accounts. However, current implementations of mobile wallets are<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> based on specific infrastructure and/or network acceptance. For example, STARBUCKS mobile wallet is only accepted at their corresponding coffee establishments, PAYPAL is only accepted when online merchants connect to PAYPAL, GOOGLE CHECKOUT (mobile wallet variant) only works if you use a CITIBANK credit card, in a specific region, and using a specific device.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Thus, it would be advantageous to provide a generic mobile wallet method and system that is ubiquitous and operable independent of specific infrastructure, device, or network acceptance.</p><heading id="h0002">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">In accordance with one aspect of the exemplary embodiment, a method for mobile wallet payment processing includes receiving a request for a virtual credit card from a mobile wallet operative on an associated mobile device, the request including a device identification and a predefined payment form. The method also includes dynamically issuing, with a processor, a virtual credit card responsive to the request, the virtual credit card associated with the device identification and the predefined payment form, and communicating the dynamically issued virtual credit card to the mobile wallet operative on the associated mobile device. The method further includes receiving a payment request from a vendor for payment for at least one of a good or a service, the payment corresponding to a charge to the virtual credit card, and verifying funds associated with the virtual credit card relative to the charge of the payment request. In addition, the method includes rendering the payment to the vendor using the virtual credit card responsive to a verification of the funds associated with the virtual credit card.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In another aspect, a mobile wallet payment processing system includes a virtual credit card issuer that is configured to dynamically issue a virtual credit card in response to a request received from a mobile wallet on an associated mobile device, the request including a device identification and a predefined payment form, and communicating the dynamically issued virtual credit card to the mobile wallet. The system also includes a payment processing component that is configured to analyze a payment request for payment of a transaction for at least<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> one of a good or a service, the payment corresponding to a charge to the virtual credit card. The payment processing component is also configured to verify funds associated with the virtual credit card relative to the charge of the payment request, and to render the payment to the vendor using the virtual credit card responsive to a verification of the funds associated with the virtual credit card. In addition, the system includes a processor which implements at least one of the virtual credit card issuer and the payment processing component.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In another aspect, a computer-implemented method for mobile wallet payment processing that includes selecting at least one predefined payment form corresponding to at least one of a checking account, a savings account, a credit card account, a debit card account, or a charge account. The method also includes linking, with a processor, the at least one selected predefined payment source to a mobile wallet on an associated mobile device, and receiving a dynamically issued virtual credit card from an associated payment processor, the virtual credit card funded from the at least one selected predefined payment source linked to the mobile wallet. Additionally, the method includes receiving an authorization request from a vendor for payment for at least one of a good or a service, the payment corresponding to a charge to the virtual credit card, and rendering the payment to the vendor using the virtual credit card responsive to an approval of the authorization request.</p><heading id="h0003">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref> is a functional block diagram of a system for mobile wallet payment processing in accordance with one aspect of the exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2</figref> is a flow chart which diagrammatically shows a method for mobile wallet payment processing in accordance with one aspect of the exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIGURE 3</figref> is a flow chart which diagrammatically shows a portion of a method for mobile wallet payment processing in accordance with one aspect of the exemplary embodiment.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIGURE 4</figref> is a flow chart which diagrammatically shows another portion of the method for mobile wallet payment processing in accordance with one aspect of the exemplary embodiment.</p><heading id="h0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">One or more implementations of the subject application will now be described with reference to the attached drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As described herein, there is provided a method for mobile wallet payment processing.
