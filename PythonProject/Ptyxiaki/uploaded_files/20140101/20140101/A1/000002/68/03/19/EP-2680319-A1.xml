For example, solar cell assembly and solar cell array which include one or more solar cells can be applied in communication devices, electric/electronic appliances, industrial facilities, and military and aerospace applications.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For increasing the total power amount of the solar cell array, it is a possible way to increase the numbers of the solar cells in a unit area. For example, an aerospace craft (satellite, aerospace station, aerospace telescope, or the like) may have very limited area (for example, solar wings) to mount solar cells or solar cell array thereon. Thus, density of solar cells would be a particularly important aspect for aerospace applications.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">On the other hand, reliability becomes a critical issue especially for aerospace applications because it is very hard, if not impossible, and costly to repair, replace, or even maintain the solar cell array mounted on an aerospace craft.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Further, since the solar wings of aerospace craft generally are folded or curled/rolled when the aerospace craft is launched into the space by a rocket or a space shuttle, it is advantageous if the aspect ratio of the solar cell array can be reduced to minimum. In other words, it is desirable to reduce the height of the solar cell array.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In addition, an aerospace craft, on which the solar cell assembly or array is mounted, generally operates in an aerospace environment in which there is no air circumference to block the space particle rays (cosmic rays). In such applications, a tip on the solar cell array may possibly cause electrical spark discharging in an aerospace environment, for example, due to the cosmic rays.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a solar cell assembly is provided which comprises: a solar cell, and a conductive interconnection member, the interconnection member comprising a first portion and a second portion attached to the first portion with an angle formed therebetween, wherein the first portion is attached to a top surface of the solar cell, wherein at least an end portion of the second portion is capable of being bended together with at least an end portion of an second portion of an interconnection member of another said solar cell assembly, in an operating state.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In another embodiment, a solar cell array is provided which may comprise: a first solar cell assembly comprising a first solar cell and a first conductive interconnection member, the first interconnection member comprising a first portion and a second portion attached to the first portion with an angle formed therebetween, wherein the first portion is attached to a top surface of the first solar cell, and a second solar cell assembly comprising a second solar cell and a second conductive interconnection member, the second interconnection member comprising a first portion and a second portion attached to the first portion with an angle formed therebetween, wherein the first portion of the second interconnection member is attached to a top surface of the second solar cell, wherein the first solar cell and the second solar cell are arranged adjacent to each other such that the second portion of the first interconnect member and the second portion of the second interconnection member are adjacent to each other, and wherein at least the end portion of the second portion of the first interconnection member is bended together with at least the end portion of the second portion of the second interconnection member.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">in an implementation of the embodiment, at least the end portions of the second portions of the first and second interconnect members are attached to each other prior to being bended.

An example of the solar cell 100 is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>; however, the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In some preferred embodiments, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, the solar cell 100 may include four (4) connection parts 102 through 105 (which can be referred as first connection parts hereinafter) formed on the top surface of the solar cell 100; however, the invention is not limited thereto as long as at least one connection part can be formed on the top surface 101 of the solar cell 100. In a preferred embodiment, there may be at least two connection parts formed on the top surface of the solar cell 100, one(s) for connection to a node of the first solar cell and other one(s) for connection to a cathode of the solar cell. Note that there may also be additional connection part(s) formed on the top surface of the solar cell for connection to/from a bypass circuit which can be formed in or external to the solar cell.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">It is be noted that the connection parts 102-105 as shown are just exemplary and not for limiting the scope of the invention. For example, the connection parts 102-105 can be flush with, or recessed from, the top surface 101, although they are illustrated as being projected from the top surface 101. As a more specific example, pads formed on the top surface of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> solar cell, which can be surrounded by for example a passivation layer, can be used as the connection part. Further, as the connection parts, for example, various terminals formed on the top surface of the solar cell can also be used as appropriate.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Further, it is preferable in some embodiments that the connection part is formed adjacent to an edge of the top surface of the solar cell. As shown In <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, two of the connection parts 102 and 103 are formed adjacent to an edge 110 of the top surface 101 while other two connection parts 104 and 105 are formed adjacent to an opposite edge 111 of the top surface 101.
