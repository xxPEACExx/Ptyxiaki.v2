Accordingly, for a character string abcdefgh, for example, a character string abc matches the character string described by the regular expression described above.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the case of converting this regular expression into a circuit, "a", "b", and "c" are first replaced by a character comparison shown in <figref idrefs="f0036">Fig. 37A</figref>, i.e., a circuit for detecting whether or not to correspond to each character. Next, a|b connects a sum shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3B</figref>, i.e., a circuit for character comparison with "a" and a circuit for character comparison with "b", according to a pattern using a logical OR. Then,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> (a|b)* connects a repetition shown in <figref idrefs="f0037">Fig. 37D</figref>, i.e., a circuit using a|b as a basic unit, according to a predetermined pattern. Lastly, (a|b)*c connects a concatenation shown in <figref idrefs="f0037">Fig. 37C</figref>, i.e., connects in series the circuit of (a|b)* shown in <figref idrefs="f0037">Fig. 37D</figref> and a circuit using a circuit for character comparison with "c" as a basic unit. As described above, the connection of the character comparison circuits according to the predetermined pattern by using each character comparison circuit as a basic unit makes it possible to systematically convert any regular expression into a circuit.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The character string matching circuit described above is illustrated by way of example. A device that determines whether specific functions are called in a specific order by use of regular expressions is also disclosed in Patent Literature 2, for example.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Further, Non Patent Literature 1 proposes a circuit for detecting an event sequence, which satisfies a specific condition, from a large number of events, by using a specific language different from a function type.

This information is not limited to one type. In other words, the term "event" refers to one type of information or a set of a plurality of types of information generated upon occurrence of a certain circumstance. Thus, an event is composed of one type of information or a plurality of types of information. The information constituting the event is referred to as "event information".</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">When a plurality of events defined as described above is generated in chronological order, the series of events are referred to as "event sequence". Assume herein that an event sequence includes a single event, for convenience of explanation.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">For an input event sequence, a predetermined event sequence is detected and predetermined processing is performed according to the detected event sequence in some cases. The processing for an event sequence is referred to as "event processing".</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The processing for an event sequence includes detection of an event sequence. Accordingly, it is also possible to apply the character string matching circuit disclosed in Patent Literature 1 to the event processing. However, in the case of applying the technique disclosed in Patent Literature 1 to the event processing, the following problems arise.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> The technique disclosed in Patent Literature 1 can deal with detection of each character within a character string by comparing characters, and detection of a character string described by a regular expression. Each character includes only information for identifying each character, for example, information about the type of each character.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">On the other hand, as described above, an event is composed of a plurality of pieces of event information in some cases. Accordingly, the technique disclosed in Patent Literature 1 cannot be applied to the detection of an event to be treated in the present invention. This is because when an event is composed of a plurality of types of event information, the technique can deal with only the detection of one type of event information and the detection of a sequence of one type of event information. Therefore, it is impossible to detect a general event and event sequence.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Moreover, in the technique disclosed in Patent Literature 1, only matching of a character string is originally assumed, and any computation corresponding to each character is not assumed. Accordingly, when the technique disclosed in Patent Literature 1 is applied to the processing for an event sequence, it is impossible to perform a computation on data corresponding to a matched event sequence, i.e., event information (e.g., temperature).</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Among the above-mentioned conditions, the technique disclosed in Patent Literature 1 cannot satisfy the following two conditions:
<ol><li>1) being able to detect an event sequence; and</li><li>2) being able to execute a computation of data associated with the event sequence.</li></ol>
As a result, it is impossible to systematically configure a circuit for event processing.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Further, the technique disclosed in Patent Literature 2 merely<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> detects a function calling order in a software manner. In other words, the technique is only able to detect a function calling order, but is not able to perform a calculation defined corresponding to an event sequence which is matched and expressed by a regular expression.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Furthermore, in the technique disclosed in Non Patent Literature 1, operators of regular expressions that express a repetition are not implemented in a circuit manner, and it is difficult to detect a complex event sequence. Also in a calculation defined corresponding to a matched event sequence, only a preliminarily fixed function can be used.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Moreover, the technique disclosed in Non Patent Literature 2 fails to disclose a technique for performing a calculation defined corresponding to a matched event sequence. This poses a problem that a calculation defined corresponding to an event sequence cannot be performed.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">That is, these related art techniques have a problem that it is extremely difficult to achieve both the detection of a complex event sequence and the calculation defined corresponding to a matched event sequence in the event processing.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problems, and has an object to provide a computation device and a computation execution method which are capable of detecting an event and performing a calculation defined corresponding to an event sequence.</p><heading id="h0008"><b>Solution to Problem</b></heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">The outline of the present invention that attains the above-mentioned object is described below.

Embodiments</heading><p id="p0027" num="0027">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings. In these exemplary embodiments, the present invention implements "computation of regular expressions using a function as an element", and is applied to a computation device, a computation execution method, and a program which are capable of achieving detection of a complex event and calculation defined corresponding to a matched event sequence.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Now, "computation of regular expressions using a function as an element" will be described. The computation device according to this exemplary embodiment performs a predetermined process defined for each function on an input event. The predetermined process includes detection as to whether the event matches a predetermined condition,<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> and a predetermined computation using the event. The term "event" herein described refers to "various information generated upon occurrence of a certain event, or a pair of pieces of information" as described above. The predetermined detection is, for example, detection as to whether information included in an event (hereinafter referred to as "event information") matches certain information. The predetermined computation is, for example, a computation using the event information.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In the case of inputting a plurality of events in chronological order, i.e., in the case of inputting an event sequence, continuous processes to be performed on each event constituting the event sequence can be defined. Specifically, "a function sequence", which indicates continuous functions, can be defined. As the function sequence, continuation or repetition of different processes, or execution of only one of the processes, for example, can be defined. Accordingly, the function sequence can also be represented by regular expressions, as in the case of a character string.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In this manner, "computation of regular expressions using a function as an element" is an expression of an execution order of computations to be continuously executed, execution conditions, and the like defined with functions, by use of regular expressions.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In exemplary embodiments of the present invention, automatic synthesis of computation devices can be performed using CAD (Computer Aided Design) or the like by employment of a systematic configuration method described below. Further, unlike an approach using a particular language as in the related art, user-friendly interfaces, such as a procedure-oriented language and a regular expression, are provided, which is suitable for development of various applications.</p><heading id="h0012">(1) First exemplary embodiment of the present invention</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --><p id="p0032" num="0032">A computation device according to this exemplary embodiment receives a data group (event) including one or more pieces of data (hereinafter referred to as "input data"), and executes a predetermined computation.

Further, the computation device outputs a comparison result of the input data as a return value, and executes a process for detecting an event by use of the return value of the function.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a diagram showing the computation device according to this exemplary embodiment. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a computation device 100 includes a data path element 3000 serving as data processing means, and a control path element 2000 serving as control processing means. The data path element 3000 includes a function processing unit 4000 that executes a computation specified in each function using event information, which configures an event 1000, as an argument.

The computation device according to this exemplary embodiment will be described below in more detail.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a diagram showing a computation device according to this exemplary embodiment which is a specific example of the computation device shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the computation device receives the event 1000 having one or more pieces of input data. The input data herein described corresponds to the above-mentioned event information. This computation device 1<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> includes the data element 3000 serving as the data processing means including the function processing unit 4000 which executes a function arithmetic processing, and the control path element 2000 serving as the control processing means for detecting an event by use of the return value ret of the function.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The function processing unit 4000 includes a data calculation unit (described later) that executes a computation specified in each function using the input data as an argument and outputs a computation result, and a control comparison unit (described later) that outputs, to the control path element 2000, a result of comparison with the input data as the return value. The data calculation unit stores, compares, or computes and outputs the input data.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The function processing unit 4000 is configured to execute a computation defined for each function designated by a user. The function processing unit 4000 receives the event 1000 and an input argument in, and outputs the return value ret and an output argument out. The input in herein described refers to a value obtained by selecting a part of a computation result d<sub>i</sub> of a preceding stage by a MUX 100, for example. An unnecessary portion of the computation result d<sub>i</sub> is not input to the function processing unit 4000, but is output as the output do together with the computation result out of the function processing unit 4000 through a register 102.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The control path element 2000 includes a circuit AND 101 that takes a logical AND of the return value ret of the function processing unit 4000 and a truth value of a preceding element, and a register 103 that stores the result of the AND 101. The data path element 3000 includes the function processing unit 4000 as well as the multiplexer MUX 100 that supplies arguments necessary for the function processing unit 4000 in the preceding calculation result and bypasses unnecessary arguments, and the register 102 that stores the output result of the function processing unit 4000 and the bypassed data.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The return value ret of the function herein described refers to a truth value indicative of whether the input data included in the event matches predetermined data for specifying the event as a result of checking the input event 1000, specifically, a truth value indicative of whether a specific event has occurred or not. For each of the arguments, the result of the predetermined computation using the event information included in the event 1000 is referred to or stored.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a diagram showing details of the function processing unit 4000 according to this exemplary embodiment. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the function processing unit 4000 includes a control comparison unit 4001 and a data calculation unit 4002. Upon receiving the event 1000 and the result of the computation executed in the data calculation unit 4002 or the calculated value obtained during the computation, the control comparison unit 4001 outputs the return value ret indicative of whether the event has occurred or not. On the other hand, the data calculation unit 4002 has the preceding calculation result as the argument in, executes the predetermined computation specified in each function based on the event 1000, and outputs the computation result as the argument out. Note that the control comparison unit 4001 may receive at least the event 1000. Depending on the computation specified in each function, the data calculation unit 4002 may use only the event 1000 as an argument.<br/>
The content of the computation specified in each function is not particularly limited. For example, the computation may be comparison with a predetermined character or character string. Alternatively, the computation may execute no processing. Specifically, the computation may include storing the preceding calculation result as the argument in, or merely storing the input data, and directly outputting the input data as the argument out.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">For example, when the control comparison unit 4001 of the function processing unit 4000 detects the event, "1" is output as the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> return value ret. At this time, when a signal c<sub>i</sub> to be input to the control path element 2000 is set to "1", "1" indicating the detection of the event can be output as an event detection result signal c<sub>0</sub> upon occurrence of the event. At the same time, the data calculation unit 4002 can execute a computation on the event and output the result signal d<sub>0</sub> through the output out, thereby obtaining the computation result upon detection of the event.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The regular expressions for the above-mentioned character string include no arguments contributing to the calculation. Accordingly, the matching processing for the character string can be considered as a function for simply performing a comparison inside to check whether the characters are given and returning a return value.<br/>
On the other hand, in this exemplary embodiment, at least one function processed in the function processing unit 4000 is defined as a function including an argument. For this reason, in this exemplary embodiment, not only the detection of an event sequence (including a single event) but also the definition of a computation to be executed on each event can be achieved.<br/>
Consequently, a computation device capable of detecting a complex event sequence and executing a predetermined computation on each event as needed can be configured using a combination of the computation devices. The details thereof will be described in the following exemplary embodiments.</p><heading id="h0013">(2) Second exemplary embodiment of the present invention</heading><p id="p0043" num="0043">Next, a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described. This exemplary embodiment illustrates a computation device that receives an event sequence composed of events, and executes a computation of regular expressions including one or more functions and operators.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a diagram for explaining operators according to this exemplary embodiment. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, examples of the operators<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> include a concatenation to describe execution of a computation for the next function subsequent to one function; a sum to describe selection of a result of a computation for one of two functions; and a repetition to describe continuous execution of one or more times of computation for each function.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The term "grouping" herein described refers to a notation provided for the sake of convenience in order to solve the ambiguity of each of functions and operators. Specifically, when a function sequence of e1e2|e3e4 is written, the grouping is used to discriminate whether the sum of e2 and e3 is present as the concatenation of e1 and e4 is present as the concatenation thereof, or to discriminate whether the function sequence indicates the sum of the concatenation of e1 and e2 and the concatenation of e3 and e4. When the function sequence indicates the former, the function sequence is described as e1(e2|e3)e4. When the function sequence indicates the latter, the function sequence is described as (e1e2)|(e3,e4). That is, the grouping is a notation necessary for interpreting the meaning of a function sequence, and is not substantially mapped into a specific circuit element.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In this exemplary embodiment, the function sequence is represented by regular expressions. Each of the functions constituting the function sequence receives an event. In other words, at least one of the functions of the function sequence represented by regular expressions includes one or more arguments. A part or the whole of the input data included in the event serves as the argument of the function. When the function refers to one or more computation results in the preceding-stage computation device, these computation results also serve as arguments. Then, the function outputs a truth value indicative of whether specific input data is detected or not as a return value.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In the computation device according to this exemplary embodiment, events including a plurality of pieces of input data are<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> input as an event sequence. For example, the computation device detects a specific event sequence from the received event sequence and outputs the computation result obtained at that time. As described above, the term "event" herein described refers to an event including data (event information) generated in association with a certain event. As a specific example of the event, the event information includes the name of a patient, the name of a medicine, an amount of a medicine, when to take a medicine, and a body temperature, for example. In this case, the computation device detects a case where a certain patient A takes medicines B1, B2, and B3 in this order, as an event sequence to be detected. Further, the computation device can output an average body temperature, for example, as a result of a computation defined in a function sequence including functions to be executed on the respective events.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">An event sequence includes a sequence of event information, i.e., successive pieces of information. Accordingly, specific examples of the event sequence include real-time information input from a sensor, a terminal, and the like. Though this exemplary embodiment is described assuming that an event includes a plurality of pieces of event information (input data), an event may include a single piece of input data.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In the case of detecting an event sequence and executing computations corresponding to the respective events as described above, a number of computation devices 1 described in the first exemplary embodiment corresponding to the number of detected events may be provided.

<ol><li>1) detecting the order of occurrence of events (for example, an event B occurs after an event A, and finally an event C occurs); and<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --></li><li>2) enabling a defined calculation on each event matching a predetermined condition (for example, calculating an average of a temperature received in the event A and a temperature received in the event B).</li></ol></p><p id="p0063" num="0063">As described above, it has been difficult to implement the above-mentioned two processes by hardware. On the other hand, in this exemplary embodiment, the computation device includes the function processing unit that executes a computation associated with a function using input data included in an event as an argument and outputs a result, and also outputs the comparison result of the input data as a return value. This enables detection of an event sequence by use of the return value, and allows the defined computation corresponding to the event to be executed by the function processing unit. Accordingly, the processing for an event sequence is executed by the computation device configured by hardware, thereby making it possible to process the event sequence at high speed.<br/>
Note that the present invention can also be configured by software. The details thereof will be described later. The implementation using software eliminates the need for providing a circuit exclusively used for event processing to the computation device.

Further, an operation stop request r<sub>i</sub> (hereinafter assuming that the request is input in the form of a digital signal having the value 0 or 1, and is referred to as a ready signal) output from the computation device located at the subsequent stage is input to the logical AND 105. The ready signal r<sub>i</sub> is a signal indicative of whether the computation device located at the subsequent state requests to stop the operation. The ready signal r<sub>i</sub> having the value 1 indicates that the operation stop is not requested, and the ready signal v<sub>i</sub> having the value 0 indicates that the operation stop is requested.<br/>
The computation device 1 can stop the processing of the data calculation unit 4002 when the ready signal r<sub>i</sub> indicates 0. For example, during execution of arithmetic processing, the subsequent-stage computation device having a low processing speed outputs the ready signal r<sub>i</sub> having the value 0 to the preceding-stage computation device.
