Further, the second communication unit 21 performs wired-communication with the second communication unit 21 of each of the controllers D1 and D3 via the communication line L4, and thus transmits a control signal for turning on or off the lighting apparatus selected from the lighting apparatuses A1 to Ak and C1 to Cn designated as the control objects of the controllers D1 and D3. For example, the second control unit 22 is realized by using a microcomputer. The second control unit 22 creates the operation instruction to be transmitted to the lighting apparatus selected from the lighting apparatuses B1 to Bm according to the set of coordinates of a position of a person detected by the image processing unit 23.

The image sensor 24 has the same configuration as that of the controller D1.

For example, the second control unit 22 is realized by using a microcomputer. The second control unit 22 creates the operation instructions to be transmitted to the lighting apparatus selected from the lighting apparatuses C1 to Cn according to the set of coordinates of a position of a person detected by the image processing unit 23. Besides, the operation instruction includes the address of the lighting apparatus selected from the lighting apparatuses C1 to Cn and the lighting signal.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the lighting system according to the present embodiment, as described above, with regard to each one of the controllers (e.g., D1 to D3), the set of coordinates of the position in the imaging area of the image sensor 24 thereof is associated with the address of the lighting apparatus designated as the control object of a particular controller out of the other controllers (D2 to D3) which is selected from the lighting apparatuses (e.g., A1 to Ak, B1 to Bm, and C1 to Cn) designated as the control objects of the controllers (e.g., D1 to D3) based on a predetermined rule, and such an association is stored in the storage unit 25 thereof. The following explanation referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is made to a procedure for making the above association.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2(a)</figref> shows a state where the lighting apparatus A1 is lit in response to the operation instruction from the controller D1. The lighting area R1 of the lighting apparatus A1 overlaps both the imaging area (the left side in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2(a)</figref>) of the image sensor 24 of the controller D1, and the imaging area (the right side in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2(a)</figref>) of the image sensor 24 of the controller D2. The image processing unit 23 of the controller D1 determines a coordinate area R2 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2(b)</figref>) included in the lighting area of the lighting apparatus A1, based on the image data obtained by the image sensor 24 of the controller D1, and stores the coordinate area R2 in association with the address of the lighting apparatus A1 in the storage unit 25. Further, the image processing unit 23 of the controller D2 determines a coordinate area R3 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2(b)</figref>) included in the lighting area of the lighting apparatus A1, based on the image data obtained by the image sensor 24 of the controller D2, and stores the coordinate area R3 in association with the address of the lighting apparatus A1 in the storage unit 25. Transmitting the address of the lighting apparatus A1 being lit from the controller D1 to the controllers D2 and D3 enables the controller D2 to associate the set of coordinates of a position in the imaging area of the image sensor 24 of the controller D2 with the address of the lighting apparatus A1. When the association process for the lighting apparatus A1 is completed, the controller D1 lights the lighting apparatuses A2, A3, ..., Ak one by one in this order, and performs the association process in a similar manner.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">When the association for the lighting apparatuses A1 to Ak selected as the control objects of the controller D1 is completed, the controller D1 transmits, to the controller D2, an operation instruction for performing the association process. Upon receiving the operation instruction, the controller D2 lights the lighting apparatuses B1 to Bm one by one sequentially so as to perform the association process in a similar manner. Further, when the association process for the lighting apparatuses B1 to Bm selected as the control objects of the controller D2 is completed, the controller D2 transmits, to the controller D3, an operation instruction for performing the association process. Upon receiving the operation instruction, the controller D3 lights the lighting apparatuses C1 to Cn one by one sequentially so as to perform the association process in a similar manner. Namely, in the present embodiment, each of the controllers D1 to D3 is configured to control the image sensor thereof in such a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> manner to take the image each time the lighting apparatus being lit is switched in a process of lighting all the lighting apparatuses one by one sequentially. Each of the controllers D1 to D3 associates the set of coordinates of a position in the lighting area of the lighting apparatus being lit with the address of the lighting apparatus being lit, with regard to each of the images taken by the image sensor through the above process.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The following explanation is made to an operation performed when a person is detected in the coordinate area R3 in the imaging area of the image sensor 24 of the controller D2. When a person is detected in the coordinate area R3 by the image processing unit 23 of the controller D2, the second control unit 22 retrieves, from the storage unit 25, the address of the lighting apparatus A1 associated with the coordinate area R3, and creates the control signal including the retrieved address and the lighting signal. The second control unit 22 transmits the control signal via the second communication unit 21 to the controllers D1 and D3. Since the address included in the control signal is not identical to any of the addresses of the respective lighting apparatuses selected as the control objects of the controller D3, the controller D3 discards the control signal. Since the address included in the control signal is identical to one of the addresses of the respective lighting apparatuses selected as the control objects of the controller D1, the controller D1 accepts the control signal, and creates the operation instruction including the address of the lighting apparatus A1 and the lighting signal, according to the control signal. The controller D1 transmits the operation instruction via the second communication unit 22 to the lighting apparatuses A1 to Ak. The lighting apparatuses A2 to Ak discard the operation instruction since the address included in the operation instruction is different from their own addresses. The lighting apparatus A1 accepts the operation instruction since the address included in the operation instruction is the same as its own address, and lights its own light source 14 according to the lighting signal included in the operation instruction.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Thus, according to the present embodiment, in a case where the lighting apparatus associated with the set of coordinates of a position determined by the image processing unit of one of the controllers is the lighting apparatus selected as the control object of the particular controller out of the other controllers, the control signal is transmitted to the particular controller. Hence, the lighting apparatus associated with the determined set of coordinates of the position can be lit. Therefore, it is possible to propose the lighting system enabling one controller to also control the lighting apparatus selected as the control object of another controller. Further, in the process of lighting all the lighting apparatuses one by one sequentially, the image sensor of each of the controllers takes an image each time the lighting apparatus being lit is switched. Consequently, with regard to each of the imaging areas of all the image sensors, the association between the set of coordinates of a position included in the imaging area and the address of the appropriate lighting apparatus selected from all the lighting apparatuses can be made automatically. Further, in the present embodiment, since the control signal outputted from one controller includes the address of the lighting apparatus selected as the control object of another controller, it is possible to light the lighting apparatus selected as the control object of another controller.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Additionally, in the present embodiment, in each one of the controllers, the set of coordinates of a position in the imaging area of the image sensor thereof is stored in the storage unit thereof in association with the address of the lighting apparatus selected as the control object of the particular controller out of the other controllers.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> However, in each one of the controllers, the address of the lighting apparatus selected as the control object thereof may be stored in the storage unit thereof in association with the set of coordinates of a position in the imaging area of the image sensor of the particular controller out of the other controllers. Also in this case, it is possible to turn on and off the lighting apparatus selected as the control object of the particular controller. In this case, in a process of making an association between the set of coordinates of a position included in the lighting area of the lighting apparatus being lit and the address of the lighting apparatus being lit with regard to the image taken by each of the image sensors, the controller which determines the set of coordinates of the position included in the lighting area of the lighting apparatus being lit sends the determined set of coordinates of the position to the controller selecting the lighting apparatus being lit as the control object. Accordingly, the controller receiving the determined set of coordinates of the position can associate between the received set of coordinates of the position and the address of the lighting apparatus being lit. Further, in the present embodiment, wired-communication is performed between each of the controllers and the lighting apparatuses to be controlled by the same controller, and wired-communication is performed among the controllers. However, wireless communication may be performed instead of the wired-communication.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56976051" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A lighting system comprising a plurality of controllers each configured to control one or more lighting apparatuses,<br/>
