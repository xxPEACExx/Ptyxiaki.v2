The method is applicable to compensated medium voltage distribution networks.</p><heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The most frequently occurring disturbances in distribution networks are ground faults of a high-ohm character, so called non-permanent ground faults, and ground faults of a low-ohm character, so called permanent ground faults. With non-permanent ground faults, leakage currents during a fault condition are orders of magnitude less than currents occurring with permanent ground faults. A high-ohm fault may occur e.g. when a tree branch props against an overhead line or if the power cable insulation was mechanically damaged in the factory. Such fault can develop with time into a permanent ground fault. Then, full phase voltage appears on the shorted network element which normally has the ground potential, which usually poses a great threat to people and equipment. Identification of faults and their detection, i.e. indication of the line in which the fault occurred, is especially difficult in compensated networks, i.e. networks in which the neutral point of the network is connected with the ground by means of an arc-suppression coil, usually a compensation reactor. The purpose of the reactor is to compensate for the capacitive component of fault current. In compensated networks, during normal operation, the occurring ground currents flowing through the line capacitance are so large that if an additional fault current resulting from the occurrence of a high-ohm fault appears, it will affect the value of the total ground current only slightly, which will make its measurement difficult. Moreover, the basic difficulty in fault detection is the fact that an additional ground-fault current which occurs in the defective line occurs also in undamaged lines, which makes simple indication of a faulted line impossible. This is the consequence of the fact that fault current in a compensated system closes through the capacitances of all the transmission lines of the network, both the damaged one and the undamaged ones.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Known fault detection methods include passive methods applicable to low-ohm faults and active methods used to detect high-ohm faults. Passive methods consist in current and voltage measurements in different points of the network and in suitable reaction of the protection automatics depending on the obtained values and arbitrarily set threshold values. Active methods consist by injecting a special current signal into the network and a simultaneous measurement of the current signal and measurement of zero sequence voltage in different points of the network.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Patent application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE10307972"><text>DE10307972</text></patcit> describes an active method of detection of ground faults, both low-ohm and high-ohm, applicable to compensated networks. It consists in introducing an alternating current signal into the network, which signal is a combination of two frequencies near the resonance frequency of the network. After the injection of the alternating current signal, the zero sequence voltage and the current flowing through individual feeder lines of the network are measured in order to calculate the equivalent admittances of individual feeder lines. The obtained values of the measured and calculated admittances are the basis for detecting the fault by indicating in which feeder line the fault occurred and whether the fault is high- or low-ohm. However, the active method of ground fault detection is applicable only to faults occurring in steady state.</p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The method of detection of feeder lines with a high-ohm ground fault in compensated power networks is characterized by the following steps.
