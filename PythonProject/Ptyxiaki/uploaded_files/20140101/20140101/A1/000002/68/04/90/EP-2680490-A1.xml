In a packet-based network, such as an Ethernet network, the computing devices communicate data by dividing the data into small blocks called packets, which are individually routed across the network from a source device to a destination device. A variety of intermediate devices operate to route the packets between the computing devices. For example, a computer network may include routers, switches, gateways, firewalls, and a variety of other devices to provide and facilitate network communication.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">These network devices typically include mechanisms, such as management interfaces, for locally or remotely configuring the devices. By interacting with the management interface, various clients, such as human users, automated scripts or network management systems, can perform configuration tasks as well as collect and view operational data of the managed devices. For example, the clients may configure interface cards of the device, adjust parameters for supported network protocols, specify physical components within the device, modify routing information maintained by a router, access software modules and other resources residing on the device, and perform other configuration tasks. In addition, the clients may receive information either by polling the managed device or by receiving asynchronous events from the devices. In this way, the clients may allow a user to view current operating parameters, system logs, information related to network connectivity, network activity or other status information from the devices as well as view and react to event information received from the devices.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a standard defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for managing network devices. SNMP uses a design that incorporates one or more management information bases (MIBs) within a managed device to describe and expose internal data elements of the managed device. Management devices, such as computer consoles and network management systems, store data to and read data from the SNMP MIBs of the devices to configure, monitor and generally control operation of the devices. For example, an SNMP agent executing on the managed device accesses the device's internal SNMP MIBS and exchanges network management information with an SNMP manager running on the network management system or other host. The SNMP agent responds to requests for information and directives from the SNMP manager.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Management devices may be configured to poll certain information, such as system load or system status information, from the managed network devices at configurable intervals. Conventionally, each time a management device requests the information, the management device generates a request for the information with an SNMP manager and sends the information to an SNMP agent of a managed network device. The SNMP agent decodes the request, identifies any potential duplicate requests, processes the request, generates a response, and sends the response to the SNMP manager. The SNMP manager then decodes the response and stores the information included in the response.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Particular aspects are set out in the appended claims.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In general, techniques are described that enable a management device to generate a request for information having parameters that specify certain filter criteria to be applied by a managed device to exclude information that would otherwise be included by the managed device in a response to the request. For example, techniques of this disclosure enable the management device to generate requests that include filter criteria and variable identifiers encoded in variable bindings of the request. The filter criteria may include various operators, values, and object identifiers. In one example implementation, two new types of object identifiers are defined. A first new type of object identifier is a filter operator object identifier, which is used to encode filter operators. A second new type of object identifier is a generic value object identifier, which is used to encode any numeric or string value. A managed device receives a request, including filter criteria encoded using the two new type of object identifiers, from the management device, parses the request to extract the variable bindings included in the request, retrieves information that is associated with the variable identifiers and satisfies the filter criteria, and returns the retrieved information to the management device.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In one embodiment, a method includes receiving, with a management agent executing on a network device and from a device management system, a request message, wherein the request message includes a set of managed object identifiers and a set of filter operator object identifiers, and generating at least one filter criterion based on the set of managed object identifiers and the set of filter operator object identifiers. The method also includes retrieving, with the management agent, a set of managed object values stored in a management information base (MIB) of the network device based on the set of managed object identifiers, wherein each managed object value of the set of managed object values corresponds to a respective managed object identifier of the set of managed object identifiers specified in the request message, generating, with the management agent, a response message based on the set of managed object identifiers specified in the request message and the retrieved set of managed object values, wherein each managed object value included in the response message<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> satisfies the at least one filter criterion, and sending the response message to the device management system.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In another embodiment, a network device includes an interface to receive, from a device management system, a request message that conforms to a network management protocol, wherein the request includes a set of managed object identifiers and a set of filter operator object identifiers, a control unit that provides an execution environment for a management agent, and a data repository configured to store information. The management agent is operable to, in response to the request, generate at least one filter criterion based on the set of managed object identifiers and the set of filter operator object identifiers and to retrieve a set of managed object values stored in the data repository based on the set of managed object identifiers, wherein each managed object value of the set of managed object values corresponds to a respective managed object identifier of the set of managed object identifiers specified in the request message. The management agent is further operable to generate and output to the device management system a response message based on the set of managed object identifiers specified in the request message and the retrieved set of managed object values, wherein each managed object value included in the response message satisfies one or more of the at least one filter criterion.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In another embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium is encoded with instructions that cause one or more programmable processors of a network device to receive, from a device management system, a request message, wherein the request message includes a set of managed object identifiers and a set of filter operator object identifiers, and generate at least one filter criterion based on the set of managed object identifiers and the set of filter operator object identifiers. The instructions also cause the one or more programmable processors to receive a set of managed object values stored in a management information base (MIB) of the network device based on the set of managed object identifiers, wherein each managed object value of the set of managed object values corresponds to a respective managed object identifier of the set of managed object identifiers specified in the request message, generate a response message based on the set of managed object identifiers specified in the request message and the retrieved set of managed object values, wherein each managed object value included in the response message satisfies one or more of the at least one filter criterion, and send the response message to the device management system.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The techniques described herein may provide certain advantages. Rather than requesting all information for a particular managed object, techniques of the techniques may, for example, enable the device management system to reduce the number of requests sent to each managed device as each request may include a request for more specific information, thereby also reducing the number of requests received by the SNMP agent executing on the managed network device. Furthermore, by reducing the amount of information that is retrieved from a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> data store of the managed network device, the retrieval of the information from the data store may be more efficient. In such instances, the request and response sockets of the managed network device may be less likely to overflow and the amount of network traffic resulting from the request and response messages may be reduced.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.

Even though two device management systems 10A and 10B (collectively, "device management systems 10") are illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, any number of device management systems 10 may be used to manage elements of enterprise network 2. Managed devices 5A-5G (collectively, "managed devices 5") of enterprise network 2 include network devices interconnected via communication links to form a communication topology in order to exchange resources and information. Even though seven managed devices 5 are illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, any number of managed devices 5 may be included in enterprise network 2. Managed devices 5 may include, for example, routers, switches, gateways, bridges, hubs, servers, firewalls or other intrusion detection systems (IDS) or intrusion prevention systems (IDP), computing devices, computing terminals, printers, other network devices, or a combination of such devices. Enterprise network 2 supports the exchange of protocol data units (PDUs) for transmitting data among managed devices 5 and device management systems 10. Such PDUs may comprise, for example, Internet Protocol (IP) packets Ethernet datagrams, and<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cells. Communication links interconnecting managed devices 5 may be physical links (e.g., optical, copper, and the like) or wireless.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Enterprise network 2 may represent an enterprise network, a campus network, a service provider network, or other autonomous system for example. Thus, while described with respect to an enterprise network, the techniques of this disclosure are applicable to other network types, public and private, including local area networks (LANs), virtual local area networks (VLANs), virtual private networks (VPNs), and the like. Enterprise network 2 may be coupled to one or more additional private or public networks, e.g., the Internet (not shown).</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Device management systems 10 are communicatively coupled to managed devices 5 via enterprise network 2. Device management systems 10 may be coupled either directly or indirectly to the various managed devices 5. Once managed devices 5 are deployed and activated, administrator 12 may use device management systems 10 to manage the managed devices 5 using a management protocol designed for management of configuration data within managed devices 5, such as the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), or the Network Configuration (NETCONF) protocol, or a derivative thereof, such as the Juniper Device Management Interface, to perform the configuration.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In common practice, device management systems 10 and managed devices 5 managed by device management systems 10 are centrally maintained by an IT group of the enterprise and are collectively referred to as an element management system (EMS) or a network management system (NMS). Administrator 12 interacts with one or more of device management systems 10 to remotely monitor and configure managed devices 5. For example, administrator 12 may receive alerts from device management system 10A regarding any of managed devices 5, view configuration data of managed devices 5, modify the respective configuration data of managed devices 5, add new network devices to network 2, remove existing network devices from network 2, or otherwise manipulate the network 2 and network devices therein.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Administrator 12 uses device management systems 10 to configure managed devices 5 to specify certain operational characteristics that further the objectives of administrator 12. For example, administrator 12 may specify for a managed device 5 a particular operational policy regarding security, device accessibility, traffic engineering, quality of service (QoS), network address translation (NAT), packet filtering, packet forwarding, rate limiting, or other policies. Device management systems 10 use a network management protocol, such as SNMP, designed for management of configuration data within network devices or monitoring and retrieving operation data from managed devices 5. SNMP allows device management systems 10 to traverse and modify management information bases (MIBs) within each of devices 5 that describe the structure of the management data of the device by using a namespace that contains object identifiers (OlDs). Each OID represents, within the particular managed device 5,<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> a managed object that identifies a specific characteristic about the managed device. Managed objects include one or more object instances, also represented by an OID in a MIB, that each identifies a variable of management data (e.g., a operational/configuration parameter) within the network device that can be read or set by the client via SNMP. Further details regarding SNMP can be found in <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Harrington et al., RFC 3411, "An Architecture for Describing Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Frameworks," Network Working Group, the Internet Engineering Task Force draft, December 2002, available at http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3411</text></nplcit>, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Device management systems 10 may issue commands in accordance with the network management protocol to monitor or control managed network devices 5 (e.g., SNMP GetRequest, GetNextRequest, or SetRequest commands). In an example operation, device management system 10A issues a command to direct an SNMP agent executing on one of devices 5 (e.g., device 5A) to retrieve a set of management information. The management information may include configuration and/or operational information. The command includes a request identifier that uniquely identifies that particular request associated with the command. Device 5A receives the request for the set of management information in the form of variable bindings ("varbinds"). The varbinds include a set of name-value pairs of management objects, where the name is the object identifier (OID). The SNMP agent executing on device 5A retrieves values for the set of requested OIDs and returns the OIDs and values in one or more response packet data units (PDUs). That is, the SNMP agent uses the OIDs to select object instances within the MIB, where each of the object instances is bound to a variable (e.g., a configurable parameter or status data unit) within the internal data space of the control software executing on the network device. In this way, the SNMP agent utilizes the structures in the MIB to allow device management system 10A to read or set any of the specific data elements of the internal data space that are described by the MIB and thereby exposed to the SNMP agent by way of the MIB.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In an example operation of a command and message exchange, a device management system 10, e.g., device management system 10A, issues a command to direct an SNMP agent executing on one of managed devices 5, e.g., device 5A, to retrieve a set of management information. The management information may include configuration and/or operational information.

In this way, the SNMP agent uses the structures in the MIB to allow device management systems 10 to read or set any of the specific data elements of the internal data space that are described by the MIB and thereby exposed to the SNMP agent by way of the MIB.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In accordance with techniques of this disclosure, one of device management systems 10 (e.g., device management system 10A) generates a request message that includes one or more requested OIDs (i.e., managed objects) and one or more filter criteria and sends the request message to a managed device (e.g., managed device 5A). In general, the request message includes varbinds having a name-value pair, where the name is the name of the OID and the value is set to null.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In some examples, an administrator (e.g., administrator 12) may configure device management system 10A with the filter criteria included in the request message. The filter criteria include filter operators and filter values. In one example implementation, two new types of object identifiers are defined. A first new type of object identifier is a filter operator object identifier, which is used to encode filter operators. A second new type of object identifier is a generic value object identifier (genVaIOID), which is used to encode any value within the name portion of varbind. In some examples, the generic value object identifier may have an octet string that contains an encoded string or integer value. Using the two new types of object identifiers, techniques of this disclosure enable filter operators and values to be encoded within varbinds along with operational OIDs to create a filter.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Managed device 5A receives the request message and retrieves managed object values from the MIB based on the request message. More specifically, the management agent executing on managed device 5A retrieves the managed object value from the MIB. Each managed object value corresponds to one of the OIDs included in the request message. In examples where the request message does not include filter parameters, managed device 5A retrieves the managed object values stored in the MIB for each OID specified in the request message. In examples where the request message includes filter criteria, managed device 5A applies the filter criteria to exclude or otherwise filter managed object values stored in the MIB for each OID specified in the request message. That is, the filter criteria included in the request message are applied by managed device 5A such that only managed object values that satisfy the filter criteria are retrieved from the MIB.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">After retrieving the appropriate managed object values from the MIB, the management agent executing on managed device 5A generates a response message that includes the managed object identifiers specified in the request message and the managed object values retrieved from the MIB for each OID. In some embodiments, the response message also includes the filter criteria originally included in the request message.

Furthermore, by reducing the amount of information that is retrieved from MIBs of managed devices 5, the retrieval of the information from the data store may be more efficient. In such instances, the request and response sockets of managed devices 5 may be less likely to overflow and the amount of network traffic resulting from the request and response messages exchanged between device management systems 10 and managed devices 5 may be reduced.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating example embodiments of device management systems 22A-22N that configure managed device 24 (hereinafter, "managed device 24" or "device 24") to periodically provide specified management information in accordance with one or more aspects of this disclosure.

MIB 32 includes managed object instances that each represent an aspect of SNMP managed data (SNMP DATA) 34, which may include, for example, configuration or descriptive data for device 24. SNMP manager 28 represents an exemplary instance of an SNMP management application or, more generally, a network management application. SNMP manager 28 is one example of a network management module.

In generating request messages, PDU module 29 generates SNMP request PDUs that include varbinds having managed object identifier (OID) and managed object value pairs. Each OID and value pair included in the SNMP request PDU may encode a respective filter operator or filter value that may be used as filter criteria applied by SNMP agent 40 to filter information retrieved from MIB 44.

Additional details of the request message are described below with respect to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. In general, PDU module 29 generates SNMP request PDUs based on configuration information stored in MIB 32 or other data repository of device management system 22A, based on configuration information entered by a network operator using administrator interface 30, or based on a combination of both configuration information received from an administrator and configuration information stored by device management system 22A.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Device 24 may be any device having one or more processors and a memory, and that is capable of executing one or more software processes, including SNMP agent 40, that operates in accordance with a network management protocol, such as SNMP.

The specific characteristics, or "managed objects," of device 24 typically include resources, parameters, settings, or descriptors for a component,<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> software objects' attributes, system attributes, or global data, for instance. Examples of managed objects include network interfaces of device 24, data describing the relationships between multiple sub-layers of network interfaces, and data describing and providing status information for IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units (MAUs).

For example, the operator may enter commands to view and modify SNMP data 34 and ultimately to deploy the configuration data to MIB 44 of device 24 as operational configuration data of the device. As another example, the operator may enter commands to retrieve the operational data from MIB 44 of device 24. In another example, SNMP manager 28 may be configured to automatically check the configuration or the status of device 24 or monitor the performance of device 24 at specified times, e.g. once every two minutes or once per month. The status of device 24 may include one of up, down, or warning. When checking the performance of device 24, SNMP manager 28 may retrieve information about network latency, traffic load, errors, central processing unit load, memory usage, and the like.

In some examples, configuration data 42 may be included within MIB 44 and may include tables or other data structures that conform to the structure of MIB 44, thereby minimizing the changes required to implement the techniques of this disclosure and increasing the ease with which the techniques of this disclosure may be deployed. SNMP agent 40 may operate as a software daemon executing within control unit 38. More specifically, SNMP agent 40, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, includes long-standing SNMP program code 41 and filter module 48.

Similarly, if SNMP agent 40 sends an excessive number of responses, the set of sockets configured to send the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> responses may overflow.

Similarly, the filter values may be encoded as a new type of object identifier (e.g., a general value OID) having the same format as standard managed object identifiers. That is, the filter operators and filter values may each be encoded within SNMP messages as if the filter operators and values are standard configuration data.

In this example embodiment, PDU module 46 generates queries that request information for the operational OIDs, but does not include the filter criteria, such that MIB 44 returns all of the information about the operational OIDs. PDU module 46 receives the request OID values from MIB 44 and generates SNMP response PDU 47 that includes the operational OIDs specified in the SNMP request PDU as well as the retrieved values for each of the operational OIDs. Filter module 48 receives SNMP response PDU 47 from PDU module 46 and applies the filter criteria specified in the SNMP request message to exclude one or more of the retrieved values. That is, filter module 48 excludes values that do not satisfy the filter criteria. Using the remaining values, filter module 48 generates SNMP response PDU 49 and SNMP agent 40 sends SNMP response PDU 49 to device management system 22A. In some examples, the SNMP response PDU includes varbinds for the filter criteria as well as varbinds for the OID and value pairs. By implementing filter module 48 outside of long-standing SNMP program code 41, the techniques of this disclosure may be more easily implemented in conjunction with the existing SNMP standards and take advantage of the stability and familiarity of long-standing SNMP program code 41.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In another embodiment, SNMP agent 40 may process the SNMP request PDU and filter criteria by applying the filter criteria as part of the query execution.

The queries may correspond to a Get, Get-Next, Get-Bulk, or Set command, as specified in the SNMP request PDU. When PDU module 46 receives the data structure for the table associated with the operational OID, PDU module 46 applies the filter criteria to confirm that, if the command is applied to the column, the result satisfies the filter criteria and, therefore, would produce a valid result. In examples where application of the command produces a valid result, the values for the requested operational OIDs are received from MIB 44 and PDU module 46 generates an SNMP response PDU for sending to device management system 22A.

SNMP version number 62 specifies the version of SNMP that is being used to generate request PDU 60. Community name 64 defines an access environment for a group of network management devices, e.g., device management system 22A. PDU type 66 identifies the type of PDU transmitted. For example, if PDU type 66 is set to one, the PDU is identified as a get-next-request PDU, whereas if PDU type 66 is set to two, the PDU is identified as a get-response PDU. In general, a get-response PDU returns the values of one or more variables and is generated in response to a get-request or get-next-request PDU. Request identifier 68 specifies a value that uniquely identifies the request PDU and the corresponding response PDU. In general, the request identifier of a get-response PDU is set to the same value as the request ID of the corresponding request. Error status 70 is an integer set by SNMP agent 40, for example, to identify an error condition. Error status 70 having a value of zero identifies that there is no error while error status 70 having a value of six identifies a "noAccess" error. A "noAccess" error signals that access was denied to the object for security reasons. Error index 72 specifies which variable was in error when the error occurred.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Each variable binding of variable bindings 74 includes a variable name, e.g., OID, and a value associated with the variable name.

In particular, variable bindings 74 specify two operational OIDs, an equality operator filter criterion, a logical operator filter criterion, and a filter value filter criterion. Request PDU 60 corresponds to a get-request PDU that requests names for interfaces in which the number of input errors and the number of output errors are both greater than 1000. Name 76 is set to a value that corresponds to an OID for a logical AND operation filter criterion. Name 80 is set to a value that corresponds to an OID for a greater than logical operation filter criterion. Name 84 is set to a value that corresponds to the ifInErrors OID. Name 88 is set to the basic encoding rules (BER) encoding of the integer 1000. Name 92 is set to a value to an OID for a greater than logical operation filter criterion. Name 96 is set to a value that corresponds to the ifOutErrors OID. Name 100 is set to the basic encoding rules (BER) encoding of the integer 1000. Name 104 is set to a value corresponds to the ifName OID. Values 78, 82, 86, 90, 94, 98, 102, and 106 are set to a null value as request PDU 60 is a request message and, in accordance with the SNMP protocol, the values are retrieved from a MIB by the SNMP agent that receives request PDU 60 (e.g., retrieved from MIB 44 by SNMP agent 40 of device 24 shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>).

For example, filter module 48 may process the variable name and value pairs included in variable bindings 74 in order (e.g., from left to right as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>). Filter module 48 identifies the value stored in name 76 as corresponding to a logical AND operator. Filter module 48 is configured such that a logical AND operator requires two parameters, one for each side of the logical AND operator. Thus, filter module 48 processes the next variable name and value pair (i.e., name 80 and value 82). However, because the value stored in name 80 corresponds to a greater than operator, filter module 48 is configured to treat the greater than operator as a nested operator and is configured such that the greater than operator requires two parameters.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Filter module 48 processes the third variable name and value pair (i.e., name 84 and value 86).

Filter module 48 processes the next variable name and value pair (i.e., name 88 and value 90) and identifies the value stored in name 88 as being the BER encoding of the integer 1000. The integer 1000 is used as the value for the second parameter of the greater than equality operator.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Filter module 48 processes the next variable name and value pair (i.e., name 92 and value 94) and identifies the value stored in name 92 as a greater than equality operator that requires two parameters. The result of the greater than operation is treated as the second parameter of the logical AND operator specified in name 76. The value stored in name 96 corresponds to the ifOutErrors OID (e.g., an operational OID). Filter module 48 is configured such that operational OIDs are acceptable parameters for filter criterion and sets the value of the first parameter required for the greater than operation to the ifOutErrors OID. Filter module 48 processes the next variable name and value pair (i.e., name 100 and value 102) and identifies the value stored in name 100 as being the BER encoding of the integer 1000. The integer 1000 is configured by filter module 48 as the second parameter for the greater than equality operator specified in name 92. Based on the first seven variable name and value pairs included in variable bindings 74, filter module 48 is configured with a filter criterion that is valid when both the value associated with the ifInError OID is greater than 1000 and the value associated with the ifOutError OID is greater than 1000. Filter module 48 processes the eight variable name and value pair included in variable bindings 74 (i.e., name 96 and value 98) and determines that the value stored in name 96 corresponds to the ifName OID. After processing all of variable bindings 74 shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, filter module 48 generates a filter criterion that, when used to retrieve information from MIB 44, returns the values associated with the ifName OID when the number of ifInErrors and ifOutErrors are both greater than 1000.
