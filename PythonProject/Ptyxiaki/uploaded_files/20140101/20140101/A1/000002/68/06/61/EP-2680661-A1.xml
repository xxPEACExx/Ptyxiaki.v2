The application layer of the terminal sends the first switching instruction to the mobility management module of the terminal, so that the mobility management module of the terminal receives the first switching instruction, so as to set the working mode of the terminal to the target mode.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Optionally, an option may further be added in a setting menu of the terminal, where the option is used to generate a first switching instruction input by a user when the user selects the option, so that the application layer of the terminal receives the first switching instruction.

However, in the embodiment of the present invention, only an IMSI detach indication message is sent to the network side, so that the CS domain service of the terminal is in disconnected state, while the PS domain service is in connected state, that is, the terminal is incapable of performing the CS domain service, but is still capable of performing the PS domain service.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Optionally, the above steps 202 to 203 may also be replaced by the following step 204:</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">204: The terminal turns off a CS processing module on the terminal, so that the terminal is incapable of accessing a CS network.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The mobility management module of the terminal turns off the CS processing module on the terminal, and maintains a PS processing module in an on state.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">For the network side, the terminal does not send an IMSI detach indication message to the network side, so the network side does not know that the terminal is incapable of performing the CS domain service.
