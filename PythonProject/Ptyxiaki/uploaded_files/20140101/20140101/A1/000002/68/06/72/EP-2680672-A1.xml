In other words, in the organic EL element including, in the following order, the anode, the light-emitting layer, the electron injection layer, and the cathode, these layers may be provided adjacent to each other, or certain layers may be interposed between the layers.

In addition, the organic EL element may be formed by a laminating method. Specifically, when an organic EL element is divided into two members at an imaginary plane perpendicular to the thickness direction, the first member in which layers from the anode to a cut plane (the "imaginary plane") are formed may be prepared in advance, and the second member in which layers form the cathode to the cut plane (the "imaginary plane") are formed may be prepared in advance, and then the first member and the second member may be laminated at the cut plane (the "imaginary plane"), thus forming the organic EL element.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating the configuration of an organic EL element according to an embodiment of the present invention.

Subsequently, the anode 3, the hole injection layer 4, the hole transport layer 5, and the light-emitting layer 6 are stacked in order on the supporting substrate 2. Specifically, in the step of forming the anode ("the step (A)"), the anode 3 is formed. Subsequently, the hole injection layer 4 and the hole transport layer 5 are stacked in order on the anode 3. Furthermore, in the step of forming the light-emitting layer ("the step (B)"), the light-emitting layer 6 is formed on the hole transport layer 5. Materials for constituting these members and their forming methods will be described later.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Next, the electron injection layer 7 is formed. In the step of forming the electron injection layer 7 ("the step (C)"), (i) an application liquid containing an ionic polymer is applied to form a thin film, (ii) the formed thin film is heated, (iii) a partially finished organic EL element obtained in (ii) is stored for a given period of time, and thereafter, (iv) the thin film is heated again.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In other words, first, the application liquid containing the ionic polymer is applied onto the light-emitting<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> layer 6 to form a film ("(i)").

Examples of the application method may include a spin coating method, a casting method, a microgravure coating method, a gravure coating method, a bar coating method, a roll coating method, a wire bar coating method, a dip coating method, a spray coating method, a screen printing method, a flexo printing method, an offset printing method, and an inkjet printing method.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">After applying the application liquid containing the ionic polymer and forming the thin film, in the present embodiment, the formed thin film is heated ("ii"). This removes a solvent and a dispersing medium, forming a solidified thin film. Heating conducted first after applying the application liquid containing the ionic polymer and forming the thin film may be described as the first heating below.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In a general method for manufacturing an organic EL element, after conducting the first heating, a layer covering the electron injection layer 7 (for example, the cathode 8) is formed. In contrast, in the present embodiment, after conducting the first heating, a partially finished organic EL element in which the thin film is formed is stored for a given period of time ("iii"). The "storing" in the present invention refers to "leaving" or "keeping" of the partially finished organic EL element for a given period of time in predetermined conditions. For<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> example, when manufacturing an organic EL element by the roll-to-roll processing, in some cases, without forming the layer covering the electron injection layer 7 (the cathode 8 in the present embodiment) subsequently after conducting the first heating, after conducting the first heating, the partially finished organic EL element is once wound around a winding roll to be stored, and thereafter, the layer covering the electron injection layer 7 (the cathode 8 in the present embodiment) may be formed by the roll-to-roll processing. The present invention can be applied to above-described method for manufacturing an organic EL element including a step of storing a partially finished organic EL element in which a thin film is formed for a given period of time after conducting the first heating. The method for manufacturing an organic EL element including a step of storing a partially finished organic EL element for a given period of time after conducting the first heating is not limited to a method for manufacturing an organic EL element using the roll-to-roll processing.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The partially finished organic EL element may be stored in any atmosphere and may be stored in, for example, a vacuum atmosphere or an inert gas atmosphere.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">When storing in the vacuum atmosphere, its pressure is usually 0.01 Pa or less and preferably 0.001 Pa or less. The lower limit of the pressure is not particularly required to be set and is set, in view of process simplicity or the like, to, for example, 0.00001 Pa.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">When storing in the inert gas atmosphere, examples of the inert gas may include nitrogen gas and argon gas.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">When thus storing the partially finished organic EL element in the vacuum atmosphere or the inert gas atmosphere, the deterioration of the thin film occurring<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> during the storage can be reduced.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">When storing the partially finished organic EL element in the vacuum atmosphere or the inert gas atmosphere, apparatuses used for the storage become complicated, making the manufacturing process for the organic EL element complicated.
