This discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the present invention. Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A residential network or home network is set of digital device communicating in a local area network. It usually comprises a variety of electronic devices that may be interconnected through various network technologies, either wired or wireless. It may comprise among others computers, printers, mobile devices, television decoder or television set. It usually comprises a gateway providing Internet access through a broadband connection. A decoder, also called a set-top box, is adapted to receive content from a server generally located outside the residential network. In particular, a decoder may receive content from a server device located in the Internet. The decoder accesses the Internet through a residential gateway. It is generally connected to the gateway through a wired link that provides a good transmission quality. However, transmission quality of some wireless technologies is sufficient today to permit reliable transmissions. In particular, in some home environments, it is possible to wirelessly connect a decoder to a gateway. Of course in some configurations, it is known that wireless transmission may not be reliable enough and a wired link is preferred. In general the gateway comprises a wireless access point module that allows<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> wireless stations to connect to the residential wired network and to the Internet.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The residential network may comprise several decoders. In particular the decoders may be connected to a same content provider and provide the multi-room function where a decoder is the master and the other ones are slaves. A slave decoder is connected through the master decoder to access the content provider services. Decoders are interconnected through home network technologies, either wired or wireless. Most decoders now contain a Wi-Fi module. Slaves contain a Wi-Fi client module to connect to the master having a Wi-Fi access point module. When the wireless transmission quality is too low for video transmission, a wired connection is required between the client and the master. More generally, the client located close to the master may be wirelessly connected to the master, and the clients located too far away from the master have to use a wired link to connect to the master. This is not convenient because it requires setting up a wired network in the home environment to enable reliable transmissions between the master and all client devices located far away from the master.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention attempts to remedy at least some of the concerns connected with the interconnection of devices in the prior art, by avoiding an end user to set up a wired network in the home environment.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention concerns a network device able to solve the problems of easy set-up of a residential network. The network device permits to easily expand the wireless coverage in a residential network. It applies notably to the field of local network comprising wired and wireless connections.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">To this end, the invention relates to a device comprising a first network interface and a wireless network interface. According to the invention, the device comprises a network configuration module adapted to configure the wireless network interface, so that, when the wireless network<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> interface is disabled, if the device is connected to a second device through the first network interface, the second device comprising a wireless access point interface compatible with the wireless network interface, configuring the wireless network interface into a wireless access point mode of operation, and if the device is not connected to the second device through the first network interface, configuring the wireless network interface into a wireless client mode of operation, and connecting the wireless network interface to the wireless access point interface.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Thus, the invention permits to easily extend the wireless coverage in a home environment. It has the advantage of facilitating the connection of devices without having to necessarily use a wired network and its drawback. In addition, the invention permits to use the wireless interface of a device, although it is not used to access the server. The easy configuration enables any end user to set up the wireless network.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to an embodiment of the invention, the device is connected to a second device through the first network interface when, after sending a request to a server through the first network interface, it receives a response from the server.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to an embodiment of the invention, the device comprises an application that starts when the device is connected to the server.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to an embodiment of the invention, the application is a decoder.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to an embodiment of the invention, the first network interface is an Ethernet interface or a coaxial cable interface.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to a variant embodiment, the invention is a method in a device comprising a first network interface and a wireless network interface,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> comprising the steps of, when the wireless network interface is disabled, if the device is connected to a second device through the first network interface, the second device comprising a wireless access point interface compatible with the wireless network interface, configuring the wireless network interface into a wireless access point mode of operation, and if the device is not connected to the second device through the first network interface, configuring the wireless network interface into a wireless client mode of operation and connecting the wireless network interface to the wireless access point interface.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Another object of the invention is a computer program product comprising program code instructions for executing the steps of the method according to the invention, when that program is executed on a computer.

Namely, they could be developed in the form of hardware or software, or be implemented in one or several integrated circuits.</p><heading id="h0005"><u>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</u></heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">It is to be understood that the figures and descriptions of the present invention have been simplified to illustrate elements that are relevant for a clear understanding of the present invention, while eliminating, for purposes of clarity, many other elements found in typical digital multimedia content delivery methods and systems. However, because such elements are well known in the art, a detailed discussion of such elements is not provided herein. The disclosure herein is directed to all such variations and modifications known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The exemplary embodiment comes within the framework of a residential environment, but the invention is not limited to this particular environment and may be applied within other frameworks where devices may be connected though multiple means.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A system according to the embodiment is represented in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>. It comprises three client devices 3, 4, 5 and a server 7 connected through the Internet 2. The client devices are located in a local network 6 connected to the Internet through a gateway device 1. The local network is a residential<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> network. The gateway device is adapted to connect the residential network provide to the Internet through a broadband access. In particular the client devices 3, 4, 5 are set-top boxes that receive audio-video content from a content provider over the Internet from the server 7. Of course they could receive content from more than one server. An example of such a set-top box device is the DX1807 from Technicolor.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The local network may use any combination of wired or wireless technologies well known to the skilled in the art, in part or totally, to interconnect local devices. As illustrated in the exemplary embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>, the client 4 is connected to the gateway with an Ethernet connection. The client 3 is connected to the gateway with a wireless connection, and the client 5 is connected to the client 4 with a wireless connection. In particular, the client 5 cannot connect wirelessly to the gateway because it is located too far from the gateway. However, it can connect wirelessly to the client 4 to access the gateway. The gateway device 1 comprises an Ethernet connection and a wireless connection. The wireless interface of the gateway is an IEEE802.11 n compliant access point.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The client device 4 is further illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>. According to the embodiment the client device is a set-top box. The modules illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref> are the ones relevant to the embodiment of the invention. The client device comprises a wired interface 44 such as an Ethernet interface. Of course it could be any wired interface that can be used to connect a set-top box to a gateway in a local network. For example it could be an interface compliant with power line communication standards. It could also be an interface compliant with coaxial cable standards, as promoted by the Multimedia over Cable Alliance, noted MoCa.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The client device also comprises a wireless interface 46 compliant to the IEEE802.11 n standard. Of course the wireless interface could be of any wireless network technology that enables to connect a set-top box to a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> gateway in a local network. The wireless interface may be set either to an IEEE802.11 n compliant access point or an IEEE802.11 n compliant station.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The client device comprises a detector 45 adapted to check if the server 7 is accessible. In particular it is adapted to check if a service provided by the server is available. The detector 45 is usually present in any decoder.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The client device also comprises a wireless interface manager 42, noted WIM hereinafter, that is adapted to configure the wireless interface 46. In particular it configures the wireless interface either into an access point or a station, according to decision criteria as illustrated in the flow chart of <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 4</figref>, the wireless configuration starts at step S0, where the device 4 boots up. At steps S1, the wireless interface is disabled; which means it is not activated or in other words it does not consume power. The WIM then checks whether the client 4 is connected to the server. The detector 45 starts a timer at step S21, and it sends a request to connect to the server at step S22. If the detector receives a response from the server, at step S23, this means that the client is connected to the server. The WIM is informed by the detector either with an interruption signal from the detector or by accessing a register in memory that indicates the presence of a server, in a manner well known to the skilled in the art. When a server has been detected, the WIM configures the wireless interface as a Wi-Fi access point function and it starts the Wi-Fi access point function, at step S25. As the client is connected to the server, the decoder client service is then started, at step S8.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">If no connection to the server is detected, at step S23, and a Time_0 Out occurs, at step 24, the WIM configures the wireless interface as a Wi-Fi station function, at step S4. After being started, the Wi-Fi station tries to connect to the gateway Wi-Fi access point, at step S4. When it is connected to the access point, the WIM then checks if the service is accessible through the wireless link. The detector sends a request to a<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> server, at step S6. If it receives a response, at step S7, this means that the client is connected to the server. And the decoder client service is then started, at step S8.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">If it does not receive any response, at step S7, and the Time_2 Out occurs at step S7, the Wi-Fi interface is disabled, step S1.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">While the decoder client services are active, the WIM regularly checks whether the decoder is still connected to the server, at step S9. When the connection is disabled, the decoder client services are stopped, at step 510, and the Wi-Fi interface is disabled, step S1.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Preferably, when the connection to the server is disabled, the WIM first checks whether the connection to the gateway is active. If it is inactive, the Wi-Fi interface is disabled, step S1. If it is still active, the client tries to connect to the server.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As illustrated, to configure the wireless interface, the client checks whether it is connected to the server. Of course, it could alternatively check whether it is connected to the gateway device 1, in a manner well know per se. If connected while the wireless interface is disabled, the client configures the wireless interface as a Wi-Fi access point function. If not connected, it configures the wireless interface as a Wi-Fi station function. The configuration of the wireless interface is there independent of the connection to a server. The wireless interface is configured whether the server is accessible or not. The client can then use the wireless interface as a wireless repeater in the home environment, even if the decoder service is not enabled.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Alternatively, the connection to the gateway and to the server could be both verified before configuring the wireless interface. This would enable to check that the server is accessed through the gateway device and not through another device.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As illustrated, when some timers expire or when the connection to the gateway is lost, the Wi-Fi connection is disabled, at step S1. Alternatively, a notification message appears on the device user interface to indicate that the connection could not be set up. And the wireless interface configuration is terminated. This permits to avoid an endless configuration algorithm. In this case the user interface offers the possibility to the end user to restart the wireless configuration algorithm.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As indicated in step S25, the wireless interface may be set to a Wi-Fi Access Point function. The Access Point may be set into any configuration that enables another wireless client 3, 5 to connect to it to access the server. Of course, the Access Point could also be put into the same configuration as the gateway Access Point, as is well known to the skilled in the art. In particular the access point could use the same service set identification, SSID, parameter as the gateway Access Point. The SSID is defined in the IEE802.11 specification. This would enable roaming between the Access Points.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The service is provided by a server that is located outside the local network. Of course, the server could alternatively be located in the local network either in the gateway or in a set-top box.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In a variant, the client device 4 is a master set-top box and the client devices 3, 5 are slave set-top boxes.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">References disclosed in the description, the claims and the drawings may be provided independently or in any appropriate combination.
