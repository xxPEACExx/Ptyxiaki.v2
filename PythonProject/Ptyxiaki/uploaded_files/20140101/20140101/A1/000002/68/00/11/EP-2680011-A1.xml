For example, an immunoassay method is used for measuring a target material by dispensing to a sample a reagent including an antibody that selectively combines with the target material only, causing the target material included in the sample to combine with the antibody in the reagent, and quantitatively detecting a complex produced by the combination, utilizing a phenomenon such as chemiluminescence, fluorescence, absorption, scattering or the like. Specifically, such immunoassay methods include EIA (Enzyme Immunoassay), FIA (Fluorescence Immunoassay) and the like.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As a measurement device for performing such a measurement, a measurement device has been proposed in which a sample and a reagent are separately dispensed to a reaction container then the sample is reacted with the reagent within the reaction container to perform a measurement. Such a measurement device includes a conveyer line for conveying a plurality of reaction containers and performs various steps for reaction and measurement while conveying the plurality of reaction containers in the conveyer line at a predetermined convey speed.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Note that the reaction time required for reacting a sample with a reagent may depend on a combination of type and concentration (dilution) of the sample and the reagent. So, conventionally, a measurement device has also been proposed that can accommodate measurements with different reaction times. For example, an immunoanalytical device described in Patent Document 1 includes an inner reaction line and an outer reaction line placed in the same plane and can convey reaction containers in the inner reaction line and the outer reaction line at speeds different from each other.</p><heading id="h0003">[Prior Art Document]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Patent Document]</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005"><ul><li>[Patent Document 1] <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP4047268A"><text>JP-A-4-47268</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">[Summary of the Invention]</heading><heading id="h0006">[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, for measurement items with different reaction times, in the device described in the Patent Document 1, samples are dispensed to reaction containers provided in the inner reaction line and the outer reaction line, then the reaction containers are conveyed at speeds different between the inner reaction line and the outer reaction line, and then target materials produced in the inner reaction line and the outer reaction line are measured in a measurement unit provided lateral to the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> inner reaction line and the outer reaction line. In this case, since a sample may be dispensed to only one of the inner reaction line and the outer reaction line depending on a measurement method, a reaction container with no sample dispensed may exist on the inner reaction line and the outer reaction line, which is a problem of decreasing the throughput of the inner reaction line and the outer reaction line in spite of providing two lines.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In other words, in order to maximize the throughput of the inner reaction line and the outer reaction line, all of the reaction containers on the reaction lines should be used with no vacancy, which occurs only when the ratio of the number of tests of the inner reaction line and the outer reaction line is 1:1. However, in the device described in the Patent Document 1, when items with different measurement times are measured, all of the reaction containers in the inner reaction line and the outer reaction line may not be used depending on a combination of the items with a vacancy in either the inner reaction line or the outer reaction line, which decreases the throughput.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In order to avoid such decrease in the throughput, it is necessary to provide two samplers for separately supplying samples to the reaction containers on the respective reaction lines, which inevitably requires the device to be larger and the control to be more complicated.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In order to solve the above-described problem, it is an object of the present invention to provide a measurement device and a measurement method in which an immune reaction line for conveying a reaction container and a measurement line for conveying a reaction container at a speed higher than that of the reaction line are combined to allow the throughput to be prevented from decreasing and the device to be prevented from becoming larger even in measuring a combination of measurement items with different reaction times, with no vacancy in the reaction lines.</p><heading id="h0007">[Means for Solving the Problems]</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">In order to solve the above-described problem and achieve the object, the measurement device in accordance with claim 1 is a measurement device that includes a plurality of lines for conveying a reaction container containing a sample and measures a predetermined material included in the sample while conveying the reaction container by the plurality of lines, wherein the plurality of lines include: a reaction line for reacting the sample with a reagent within the reaction container, the reaction line conveying the reaction container at a predetermined convey speed;

However, it should be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the embodiments.</p><heading id="h0011">[I] Basic concept common to embodiments</heading><p id="p0023" num="0023">First, a basic concept common to the embodiments is described. A measurement device in accordance with the embodiments includes a plurality of lines for conveying a reaction container containing a sample and measures a predetermined material included in the sample while conveying the reaction container by the plurality of lines. Furthermore, a measurement method is for measuring a predetermined material included in a sample while conveying a reaction container containing the sample.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The measurement device and the measurement method in accordance with the embodiments can be specifically applied to any appropriate field unless otherwise specified. For example, in the medical field, the measurement device and the measurement method can be applied to an automatic immunoassay device and an automatic immunoassay method for separating and identifying a predetermined material to be measured from a sample including a plurality of target materials and analyzing the predetermined material. In the following embodiments, the invention is described as applied to an automatic immunoassay device and an automatic immunoassay method for performing analysis of a sample, such as blood, using an EIA (Enzyme Immunoassay) that uses an enzyme as a labeled material.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">This type of measurement devices and measurement methods include: a device and method in which a reaction container is washed after a measurement and reused for another measurement; and a device and method in which a disposable reaction container (hereinafter referred to as a cuvette) is disposed of after a measurement. The invention can be applied to the both types of device and method. However, in the following description, the invention is described as applied to the device and method using a cuvette.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Furthermore, this type of measurement methods include one-step method, delay one-step method, two-step method, dilution two-step method, competition method and the like. As a solid phase used for the measurement, various magnetic particles, polystyrene particles, latex particles and the like can be used. The invention can be applied to any of these methods. However, in the following description, the invention is described as applied to a dilution two-step method for measuring an antigen included in a sample using magnetic particles as a solid phase, an enzyme as a labeled material, and a luminescent substrate as a substrate. Generally, the dilution two-step method performs the following steps in this order: 1) a "pretreatment step" in which pretreatment, such as dilution, is performed on a sample; 2) a "first reaction step" in which, by, for example, dispensing a first reagent to the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> sample, a target material (antigen) included in the sample is reacted with a first antibody coupled to magnetic particles, to cause the target material to be coupled to the first antibody; 3) a "second reaction step" in which, by, for example, dispensing a second reagent (enzyme-labeled antibody) to the complex with magnetic particles produced in the first reaction step, the complex is reacted with the enzyme-labeled antibody (a second antibody) to cause the complex to be coupled to the enzyme-labeled antibody (the second antibody); 4) an "enzyme reaction step" in which, by, for example, dispensing a luminescent substrate to the complex with the labeled antibody produced in the second reaction step, the enzyme coupled to the magnetic particles to form a complex is reacted with the luminescent substrate; and 5) a "measurement step" in which the amount of chemiluminescence produced in the enzyme reaction step is measured. As a result, the amount of the target material (antigen) can be determined from the luminescence amount obtained in the measurement step.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Generally, one feature of the measurement device in accordance with the embodiments is in that: 1) a plurality of reaction lines for reacting a sample with a reagent within a reaction container is separated from a measurement line for measuring a target material from the samples in the reaction containers reacted in the reaction lines; and 2) furthermore, the convey speed of the reaction containers in the measurement line is set to be higher than the convey speed of the reaction containers in the plurality of reaction lines. Separating the plurality of reaction lines from the measurement line in this way allows the convey speed of the reaction containers in the reaction steps to be different from the convey speed of the reaction containers in the measurement step. Furthermore, setting the convey speed of the reaction containers in the measurement line to be higher than the convey speed of the reaction containers in the plurality of reaction lines allows the throughput of the measurement line to be higher than the throughput of the reaction lines, which allows the reaction containers after the reaction in the reaction lines to be transferred to the measurement line without delay, thereby allowing the overall throughput to be prevented from decreasing.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Hereinafter, "throughput" means the number of cuvettes per unit time (unit: cuvettes per hour) discharged from the reaction line or the measurement line after treatment. Here, "throughput decreases" means that the throughput of a reaction step falls below the maximum throughput of the reaction step. For example, when a maximum throughput of a reaction line is 240 cuvettes per hour and an actual throughput of the reaction line is lower than 240 cuvettes per hour at the maximum, the throughput is considered to be decreasing. In other words, in this case, when the actual throughput of the reaction line is 240 cuvettes per hour at the maximum, the throughput is considered to be prevented from decreasing.</p><heading id="h0012">[II] Specific description of embodiments</heading><p id="p0029" num="0029">Next, the embodiments are specifically described.
