load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">[Technical Field]</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an electricity storage control device or the like which transmits charging rates of electricity storage devices to a management device that manages electric power interchange between the electricity storage devices.</p><heading id="h0002">[Background Art]</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In recent years, together with an electricity generation device such a photovoltaic generation device, an electricity storage device has been increasingly placed for each consumer. The electricity storage device charges when an amount of consumed electricity is smaller than an amount of generated electricity, and discharges when the amount of consumed electricity is larger than the amount of generated electricity, thereby enabling the consumer to efficiently use electricity generated by the electricity generation device.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It is assumed that a storage battery such as a lithium-ion battery is used as such an electricity storage device. The storage battery such as the lithium-ion battery has characteristics of deteriorating when charging or discharging excessively. Thus, for instance, the charge or discharge of the storage battery is managed so that a charging rate falls within a certain range (e.g., 20% to 80%).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In view of the above, to keep the charging rate of the storage battery in the certain range, a technique of performing electric power interchange between consumers has been proposed (e.g., refer to Patent Literature (PTL) 1). In the technique disclosed in PTL 1, the electric power interchange is performed according to an amount of electricity stored in the storage battery.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0003">[Citation List]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Patent Literature]</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005"><ul><li>[PTL 1]<br/>

However, subsequently, electricity generated by the first consumer is stored into the storage battery of the first consumer, and thus the amount of electricity stored in the storage battery of the first consumer becomes excessive. As a result, electric power interchange from the storage battery of the first consumer to a storage battery of a third consumer is further performed. In other words, the electric power interchange is performed beyond necessity, thereby increasing the number of times the storage battery charges or discharges.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention has been conceived to solve the problem, and an object of the present invention is to provide an electricity storage control device, a management device, and an electricity storage control system that reduce occurrence of unnecessary electric power interchange when electric power interchange is performed between electricity storage devices.</p><heading id="h0007">[Solution to Problem]</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">In order to achieve the object, an electricity storage control device<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> according to one aspect of the present invention is an electricity storage control device that transmits a charging rate of at least one of electricity storage devices to a management device that manages electric power interchange between the electricity storage devices, wherein the management device refers to charge and discharge determining information defining a charging rate at which charge and discharge for electric power interchange are permitted and a charging rate at which the charge and discharge are prohibited, and allows electric power interchange between electricity storage devices having the charging rate at which the charge and discharge are permitted, the electricity storage control device including: a charge information acquisition unit configured to acquire the charging rate of the at least one electricity storage device as a first charging rate; a communication unit configured to transmit the first charging rate to the management device; and a control unit configured to cause the communication unit to transmit, instead of the first charging rate, a second charging rate that the charge and discharge determining information defines as the charging rate at which the charge and discharge are prohibited, when (a) the electricity storage control device is operating in an operation mode that prohibits at least one of the charge for electric power interchange and the discharge for electric power interchange and (b) the charge and discharge determining information defines the first charging rate as the charging rate at which the charge and discharge are permitted.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">With this configuration, when the electricity storage control device is operating in the operation mode that prohibits the at least one of the charge for electric power interchange and the discharge for electric power interchange, it is possible to transmit, to the management device, the second charging rate instead of the first charging rate obtained from the electricity storage device, the second charging rate being defined as the charging rate at which the charge and discharge are prohibited. In other words, when it is necessary to prohibit the charge or discharge for electric power interchange, it is possible to prevent the charge or discharge for electric power interchange from being instructed. In short, it is possible to reflect an electricity consumption plan of each consumer in the charge and discharge instruction for electric power interchange. Consequently, it is possible to reduce occurrence of unnecessary electric power<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> interchange.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Moreover, with the configuration, it is necessary to share the prohibition of the charge or discharge for electric power interchange with the management device. Stated differently, it is possible to prevent the charge or discharge for the electric power interchange using the charging rate to be transmitted to the management device, without notifying the management device of the electricity consumption plan of the consumer or the like. Thus, it is possible to protect privacy information of the consumer such as a plan for long-term absence from home.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Moreover, the control unit may cause the communication unit to transmit the second charging rate instead of the first charging rate when (a) the electricity storage control device is operating in an operation mode that prohibits the charge for electric power interchange, (b) the charge and discharge determining information defines the first charging rate as the charging rate at which the charge and discharge are permitted, and (c) the first charging rate is less than a predetermined threshold value.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">With this configuration, it is possible to transmit the second charging rate instead of the first charging rate when the first charging rate is less than the predetermined threshold value. To put it another way, when the first charging rate is higher than or equal to the predetermined threshold value, it is possible to directly transmit the first charging rate even when the first charging rate is the charging rate at which the charge and discharge are permitted. Consequently, it is possible to discharge for other electricity storage devices when the charging rate is high, thereby allowing the electric power interchange to be performed efficiently.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Moreover, the charge and discharge determining information may define a first charge and discharge permitted range, a charge and discharge prohibited range, and a second charge and discharge permitted range, the first charge and discharge permitted range may be a range of the charging rate at which the charge and discharge for electric power interchange are permitted, and is a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> range less than a first threshold value, the charge and discharge prohibited range may be a range of the charging rate at which the charge and discharge for electric power interchange are prohibited, and is a range greater than or equal to the first threshold value and less than a second threshold value, and the second charge and discharge permitted range may be a range of the charging rate at which the charge and discharge for electric power interchange are permitted, and is a range greater than or equal to the second threshold value.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">With this configuration, it is possible to set a range between the first and second charge and discharge permitted range as a charge and discharge prohibited range. In other words, it is possible to set a range of a charging rate at which the electricity storage device deteriorates as the charge and discharge permitted range, thereby reducing the deterioration of the electricity storage device.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Moreover, the control unit may be further configured to calculate the second charging rate so that a temporal variation of a charging rate to be transmitted to the management device approximates a temporal variation of a charging rate of the at least one electricity storage device that is already acquired.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">With this configuration, it is possible to reduce a possibility of an operation mode being determined based on the temporal variation of the charging rate. In short, it is possible to further protect the privacy information of the consumer.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Moreover, the electricity storage control device may further include a mode notification unit configured to notify a user that the electricity storage control device is operating in the operation mode.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">With this configuration, it is possible to notify the user that the electricity storage control device is operating in the operation mode that prohibits the charge for electric power interchange.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Moreover, the control unit may be further configured to cause the communication unit to transmit a third charging rate instead of the first and second charging rates so that a charging rate to be transmitted to the management device varies smoothly when the electricity storage control device starts operating in the operation mode.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">With this configuration, when the electricity storage control device starts operating in the operation mode that prohibits the charge for electric power interchange, it is possible to smoothly vary the charging rate to be transmitted to the management device. Thus, this prevents the charging rate to be transmitted to the management device from intermittently varying, thereby reinforcing the protection of the privacy information of the consumer.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Moreover, the electricity storage control device may be configured as an integrated circuit.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A management device according to another aspect of the present invention is a management device that manages electric power interchange between electricity storage devices, the management device including: a communication unit configured to receive a charging rate of each of the electricity storage devices; a selection unit configured to select, by referring to charge and discharge determining information defining a charging rate at which charge and discharge for electric power interchange are permitted and a charging rate at which the charge and discharge are prohibited, electricity storage devices having the charging rate at which the charge and discharge are permitted, from among the electricity storage devices; and a management unit configured to cause the communication unit to transmit charge and discharge instructing information for causing, between the selected electricity storage devices, electric power interchange from an electricity storage device having a high charging rate to an electricity storage device having a low charging rate.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">With this configuration, it is possible to manage the electric power interchange using the charging rate at which the charge and discharge for<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> electric power interchange are prohibited.

In addition, the privacy mode may be, for instance, an operation mode that prohibits charge and discharge for electric power interchange.</p><p id="p0123" num="0123">Moreover, although the charge required range 210a and the discharge required range 210e are defined in the charge and discharge determining information 210 in Embodiments 1 to 3, these ranges are not necessarily defined. In addition, only one of the first charge and discharge permitted range 210b and the second charge and discharge permitted range 210d may be defined in the charge and discharge determining information 210.</p><p id="p0124" num="0124">Furthermore, although the second charging rate is transmitted instead of the first charging rate when the first charging rate is less than the predetermined threshold value in Embodiments 1 to 3, the second charging rate may be transmitted when the first charging rate is greater than or equal to the predetermined threshold value.</p><p id="p0125" num="0125">Moreover, although the mode receiving unit 205 receives the operation mode switching instruction from the user in Embodiments 1 to 3, the mode receiving unit 205 does not necessarily receive the operation mode switching instruction from the user. For example, the mode management unit 207 may automatically switch the operation mode based on the acquired first charging rate. Specifically, the mode management unit 207 may automatically switch the operation mode to the normal mode when, for instance, a predetermined charging rate is not reached within a predetermined time since the operation<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> mode is switched to the privacy mode. In addition, for example, the mode management unit 207 may switch the operation mode to the privacy mode with timing when a front door is locked, in conjunction with a home security system. Alternatively, the mode management unit 207 may perform ON/OFF control of the privacy mode via a network from the outside of home.</p><p id="p0126" num="0126">It is to be noted that in the case where the first charging rate is acquired even when the electricity storage control device starts operating in the privacy mode, the second charging rate is transmitted instead of the first charging rate in Embodiments 1 to 3. However, in the case where the second charging rate is transmitted as above, a charging rate to be transmitted to the management device intermittently varies when the electricity storage control device starts operating in the privacy mode. As a result, the temporal variation of the charging rate appears unnatural, and thus there is a possibility of leaking the privacy information of the consumer such as the plan for long-term absence from home.</p><p id="p0127" num="0127">In view of the above, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>, when the electricity storage control device starts operating in the privacy mode, the control unit 203 may cause the communication unit 202 to transmit a third charging rate instead of the first and second charging rates so that the charging rate to be transmitted to the management device 100 varies smoothly. This prevents the charging rate to be transmitted to the management device 100 from intermittently varying when the electricity storage control device starts operating in the privacy mode, thereby reinforcing the protection of the privacy information of the consumer.</p><p id="p0128" num="0128">It is to be noted that the temporal variation of the charging rate shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref> is an example, and it is not always necessary to transmit the charging rate shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>. For instance, when the electricity storage control device starts operating in the privacy mode, the control unit 203 may cause the communication unit 202 to transmit a charging rate randomly selected from among charging rates within a predetermined range. This prevents the charging rate from varying monotonously. Thus, it is possible to<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> further reduce a possibility that the temporal variation of the charging rate to be transmitted to the management device 100 appears unnatural.</p><p id="p0129" num="0129">It is to be noted that although the electricity variation when the charging rate is increasing is described in <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>, the communication unit 202 may be caused to also transmit the third charging rate so that the charging rate to be transmitted to the management device 100 varies smoothly, when the charging rate is decreasing. In addition, although the case where the privacy mode is turned ON is described in <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>, the control unit 203 may cause, for instance, the communication unit 202 to also transmit the charging rate so that the charging rate to be transmitted to the management device 100 varies smoothly, when the privacy mode is turned OFF.</p><p id="p0130" num="0130">Moreover, the management device 100 and the electricity storage control device 200 included in the electricity storage control system 10 do not necessarily include all the constituent elements shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.
