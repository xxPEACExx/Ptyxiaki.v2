These events can be recorded in the social network calendar of the user or of his contacts.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Background of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">When a user uses the Internet, all the data which he inputs can be stored and used by different applications. All the companies offering products and/or services want to reach their consumer in the clearest and most direct way particularly as individualised and as personalised as possible, for which many alternatives have been carried out.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Social network applications, such as Facebook™ Beacon, which send information of external companies to the users of said social network and to the contacts of said users in said social network are known.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">On the other hand, Facebook™ Connect allows the data stored by the users in said social networks to be viewed by other companies.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Applications informing the user on the existence of products related to searches performed or to e-mail content are also known.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2002004753A"><text>US2002004753A</text></patcit> describes a system for finding and supplying information to a consumer regarding specific products. The system comprises servers storing product-related information and the URLs containing said products on the Internet, also considering additional information contained in the web pages of said URLs: promotions, discounts, offers, reviews, guarantees, etc. These products are identified by a universal product number, for example, a UPC, or a Universal Product Code. The manufacturers are provided with tools which<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> allow creating and maintaining UPC/URL or Universal Product Code/Uniform Resource Locator databases on the Internet, exclusively containing information of their products.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US2002055351A"><text>US2002055351A</text></patcit> describes a system integrating the information of a series of contacts to facilitate searching for it in a server. Among its multiple features, the system can also use the information contained in the preferences of said contacts to send them advertisement on specific products of their interest.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, all these applications and technologies send the user information related to his own preferences, but they do not integrate the information of the preferences and behaviour of the contacts together with a link (access) in which he finds products according to their preferences, nor do they integrate information of the events and/or publications in the social networks or the like of the user himself or of his contacts, nor act proactively based on all this information thus allowing the provider of a product and/or service to be able to reach a user needing the product and/or service at a precise and specific time in a proactive manner without the user initiating the process.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Description of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention solves the technical problem described above by means of a method of searching and/or inferring and/or sending information according to claim 1, and a system suitable for searching and/or inferring and/or sending information according to claim 7. Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A first inventive aspect shows a proactive method of searching, and/or inferring and/or sending information to an application by searching and/or inferring means, <b>characterised in that</b> it comprises at least the steps where:
<ol><li>a.- the searching and/or inferring means periodically enquire the temporal proximity of at least one event under a temporal proximity criterion already<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> predetermined or defined by a user and according to a periodicity already predetermined or defined by the user himself or the searching and/or inferring means receive a notice of the temporal proximity of said at least one event according to a temporal proximity criterion already predetermined or defined by the user in at least one of the following data tables:
<ul><li>■ event table of the user,</li><li>■ event table of at least one user's contact,</li><li>■ event table of providers associated with a provider table</li></ul>
when the searching and/or inferring means receive a result from the enquiry or the notice of the temporal proximity of the at least one event:</li><li>b.- the searching and/or inferring means relate said event with at least one product and/or service of a service and/or product data table, and</li><li>c.- the searching and/or inferring means send a notice of said event and a message related to the at least one product and/or service to the application.</li></ol></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The data tables are comprised in an information system, for example, they can be data tables comprised in databases, or can be data tables comprised in independent information systems or can be data tables comprised in a single information system.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Event table of the user is a table associated with a data table of the user. Data table of the user is a table comprising data relating to the user, such as his preferences, his personal data, etc. It also comprises user tastes relating to his permanent preferences: a specific literary genre, flower varieties, type of technology, transport preferences, such as using or not using toll motorways, etc.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Event table of at least one user's contact is a data table associated with a data table of one user's contact. A user's contact is an input in the contact table of the user.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Event table of providers associated with a provider<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> table is a data table associated with a provider data table. A provider is a physical or virtual entity offering products and/or services.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The enquiry of the temporal proximity of an event comprises the set of actions intended for identifying the existence of an event related to any of the cases indicated (related to the user, to one of his contacts or to one of the providers), according to a temporal proximity criterion defined previously by the user of the application, such as for example "next week".</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The periodicity with which the enquiry is carried out is defined by the user when he starts the application or at any time of use. It is also possible that, if the user does not define it, it can be defined by the application with default values; for example, daily, twice a day, etc. Likewise, it is also possible that the method is activated without the need of performing any enquiry, but when it receives a notice of the proximity of an event, such as for example, the launch of a product and/or service.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Inference is an evaluation between expressions or words, which when related allow plotting a logical line of logical condition or implication between the different expressions or words. The essential way of inferring is deductive reasoning. This inference particularly corresponds to a deduction and/or relation according to the preferences of the user and/or preferences of other users and/or programmed or un-programmed events of the user or of the user's contacts and/or of products and/or services and/or to the providers of these products and/or services or to any event related thereto. This relation is carried out by means known in the state of the art, for example by means of tables relating words, semantic concepts, meanings or ontologies with all those having to do with it; for example: products such as nappies, cots, strollers, foods, other accessories, etc., are associated with the word "baby".</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">An event of the user is an input in an event table of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the user indicating a date and/or a time and/or a temporary sign with a theme type attribute. A theme type attribute is for example, a product and/or service, a birthday, an appointment, a meeting, the launch of a product and/or service, change in the conditions of the products and/or services, offers, promotions, obligation, scheduled or unscheduled appointment, anything which can be jotted down in a calendar usually with a time and a place or action to be performed, any programmed or non-programmed event, etc. The event of a user's contact is also defined.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The concept of event comprises a publication, understood as the public information of the user or of a user's contact or the public information of a provider, i.e., a third party user or application with access to a communications network in which the verification is being performed has access to this information.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Event of a provider is an input in a provider data table indicating an event related to said provider: the launch of one of its products and/or services, a change in the conditions of the products and/or services, offers, promotions, etc.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A product is an article, or a service or any other entity which can be the object of a commercial or non-commercial transaction.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Once the event has been identified, it is related to a product and/or service having semantic relation and/or associative relation with the event and/or inference relation with the event. This relation is carried out by means known in the state of the art, for example by means of tables relating words and/or, semantic concepts, meanings and/or ontologies with all those having to do with it, for example, products such as nappies, cots, strollers, foods, other accessories, etc., are associated with the word "baby".</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">At the time of relating an event with a product and/or service, information contained in a data table associated with the user or in the data tables of his contacts which can<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> contain high level information, such as social information, is also used. This data table has the data which the user has input according to how he has interacted with the system. Thus for example the name of the user is provided, preferably with some of this data: name and surnames, objective data such as address, telephone, date of birth, and in particular embodiments, also occupation, education, religion, ethnicity, nationality, political affiliation, with other high level information such as the password of different services such as supermarket, online shop, purchase history, enquiry data history, subscriptions to any product and/or service, or even health data, weight, height, blood group, or personal or social information, such as family relationship, sentimental relationship, such as "boy/girlfriend", "husband/wife" and identifying data of said persons, tastes or preferences, orientation and sex life, abilities, self-esteem, attitude towards life, intelligence quotient, qualities, etc. In one embodiment, this data table is filled in when creating an input to the user and it is progressively filled in as its information is being used. The users in different embodiments are persons or machines.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The application receiving the notices is preferably used by a user, although not in a limiting manner. The application can be used by machine such as a smartphone, robot, computer or the like. There are several possibilities in terms of the way of receiving notices of the existence of events. In particular embodiments of the invention, these notices are sent as text messages, or messages encoded with Bidi codes, also known as quick response codes, or QR codes, or they can be an audio message, a message in augmented reality, etc. The application to which the invention refers to is the interface for receiving the messages and notices. In one embodiment, the user application is an application for mobile devices or the like, it can be created for the World Wide Web and/or the Internet, kiosks, for a smartphone, robot, a television set or any home automation display or any computing type device or<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> device interpretable by computing, and under any platform. The application can also be incorporated in the computer on-board a vehicle. In one embodiment, this application is an integrated message reception and recognition application and in another embodiment, it is formed by a system receiving the information and another independent system processing it, for example for changing text to speech. Therefore, in different embodiments, this application receives the notice of an event or message related to a product and/or service which can be a first action triggering a second action; or it can be a written notice, for example a sentence or part of a written sentence or voice message, since the device in that embodiment has a text to speech engine. Furthermore, in another embodiment, the notice is received by means of NFC, Near Field Communication, a wireless technology between close objects, valid for example for identifying, exchanging or collecting data, similar to RFID, Radio Frequency Identification, cards. In different embodiments, the device has a barcode or bidirectional code or Bidi code receiver, and reading that code is sufficient for knowing the notice received. In one embodiment, the system comprises a facial recognition system. In one embodiment, the system comprises a language interpretation module for detecting a series of languages, and sending the messages and notices in said language. In one embodiment, the message related to the at least one product and/or service comprises an option for purchasing or acquiring and/or receiving information about the product and/or service through the user application, for example through a web service, an API or the like. In one embodiment, the message related to the at least one product and/or service comprises an option for purchasing or acquiring and/or receiving information about the product and/or service through NFC, a QR code or the like.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The advantage which the method according to the invention has with respect to the methods in the state of the art is that it enables the user to receive information of his<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> own events and/or of his contacts and/or of provider events. For example, if a contact of a user has an event, for example a birthday, and the preferences of the contact are accesible, the user receives a notice for acquiring a suitable product and/or service for the contact at the time of the contact's birthday. Furthermore, this information is received in the user application without there having to be a prior action by the user, i.e., it behaves proactively.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Another advantage provided by the method according to the invention is that it can be implemented in a computer belonging to a shop which carries out its commercial activity depending on the preferences of the user, his contacts and the events of the user and the events of his contacts.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In a second inventive aspect, the invention has a proactive system for searching and/or inferring and/or sending information to an application, the system comprising:
<ul><li>a data table of the user comprising data about a user, preferably user preferences,</li><li>a contact table of the user,</li><li>a service and/or product data table comprising data about products and/or services,</li><li>searching and/or inferring means,</li><li>a user application,</li><li>a communications network interconnecting the searching and/or inferring means with the different data tables and with the user application,</li></ul>
and it comprises at least one of the following:
<ul><li>an event table of the user such as for example the birthday of the user,</li><li>at least one event table of at least one user's contact, such as for example the birthday of a user's contact,</li><li>a provider table comprising data about the providers,</li></ul>
wherein the searching and/or inferring means are in communication with the different data tables and with the user application,<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> -->wherein the system is suitable for carrying out the steps of a method according to the first inventive aspect.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The data tables are comprised in an information system, for example, they can be data tables comprised in databases, or they can be data tables comprised in independent information systems or they can be data tables comprised in a single information system.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Data table of the user is a table comprising data relating to the user, such as his preferences, his personal data, etc. It also comprises user tastes relating to his permanent preferences: a specific literary genre, flower varieties, type of technology, transport preferences, such as using or not using toll motorways, etc.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Event table of the user is a table associated with a data table of the user.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Event table of at least one user's contact is a data table associated with a data table of a user's contact. A user's contact is an input in the data table of the user.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Event table of providers associated with a provider table is a data table associated with a provider data table.
