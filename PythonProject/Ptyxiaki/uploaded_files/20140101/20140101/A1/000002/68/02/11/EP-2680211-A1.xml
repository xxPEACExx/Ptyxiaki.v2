This sale mode is known as, for example, group buying. An information providing device which provides information of a product transacted in this mode provides, for example, a price applied to a current order quantity of this product as information of the product. For example, Patent Literature 1 discloses a technique of displaying the current order quantity of a product and a price applied to the current order quantity on a user terminal. When the user browses the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> information of the product and then wishes to purchase this product, the user performs an operation of ordering this product. At this time, the user can specify the quantity of the product to order.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003"><ul><li>Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2001357276A"><text>2001-357276</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of the Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Problem to be solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">When a user orders a product, the total order quantity is increased by the quantity of the ordered product. In this case, a purchase price of a product purchased by the user is a price applied to the total order quantity which is increased by the quantity of the product ordered by the user. Hence, a maximum value of a purchase price changes in some cases according to the quantity of a product ordered by the user. Hence, displaying a price applied to a total order quantity increased when a user is assumed to order a product is more preferable for the user than displaying a price applied to a total order quantity at a current point of time. When, for example, whether or not the user orders a product is decided,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> a price applied when the user is assumed to order a product is more suitable as information for making a decision than a price at the current point of time.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, a conventional technique only displays a price applied to a current order quantity. Although the technique disclosed in Patent Literature 1 displays a list of ranges of product prices and order quantities to which these prices are applied, the user cannot immediately learn a price to be applied from this list when the user places an order.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In light of the above, it is an object of the present invention to provide an information providing device, an information providing method, an information providing program, and a recording medium which can provide a price applied when a user who receives information of a product is assumed to place an order of this product.</p><heading id="h0007">Means for solving the Problem</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">In order to solve the above problem, the invention according to claim 1 is an information providing device comprising:

The group buying is, for example, a transaction mode to which a sale period is set, and is a transaction mode that, when an order quantity of a product in this sale period is higher, a purchase price of this product becomes cheaper stepwise according to the order quantity. At the electronic mall, a plurality of stores is listed as a seller side of products. A user can purchase a desired product from a desired store by utilizing the electronic mall. According to requests from the user terminals 3, the group buying server 1, for example, transmits a web page of the electronic mall or performs processing related to, for example, search or purchase of a product.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> The store terminal 2 is a terminal device which is utilized by, for example, an employee of a store which is listed in the electronic mall. The store terminal 2 is used to, for example, register information about a product to sell, in the electronic mall. The store terminal 2 accesses the group buying server 1 based on, for example, an employee's operation. By this means, the store terminal 2 receives and displays a web page from the server device. In the store terminal 2, software such as a browser and an electronic mail client is implemented. For the store terminal 2, for example, a personal computer is used.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The user terminal 3 is a terminal device of a user who utilizes the electronic mall and purchases a product. The user terminal 3 accesses the group buying server 1 based on, for example, a user's operation. By this means, the user terminal 3 receives and displays a web page from the server device. In the user terminal 3, software such as a browser and an electronic mail client is implemented. For the user terminal 3, for example, a personal computer, a mobile information terminal such as a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) or a smart phone or a mobile telephone is used.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In the group buying system S employing this configuration, the group buying server 1 searches a product which can be purchased by a group based on a search condition specified by the user. Further, the group buying server 1 provides<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> information of the searched product to the user terminal 3. More specifically, the group buying server 1 transmits HTML (HyperText Markup Language) document of a search result page to the user terminal 3. The search result page is a web page which displays a list of information of a searched product in association with this product as a search result of a product. Information of a product to be displayed is, for example, a price of a product. Transmitting HTML document of a search result page is an example of outputting a price of a searched product in association with this product.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">A price of a product changes according to a total quantity of this product ordered so far. The total quantity of a given product ordered so far is referred to as a "total order quantity". For example, a unit price of a product is 3000 yen when the total order quantity is 1, is 2000 yen when the total order quantity is 2 or more and 10 or less, and 1000 yen when the total order quantity is 11 or more. A price applied to a range of each total order quantity is referred to as an "applied price". The applied price is a sale price in case that a final total order quantity at a point of time when acceptance of an order of a product is closed is in a range of a total order quantity matching this applied price. Further, a total order quantity which is necessary at minimum for a given applied price to be applied is referred to as a "necessary order quantity". In the above example, the necessary order quantity for prices of 3000 yen,<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> 2000 yen and 1000 yen are 1, 2 and 11. A combination of a necessary order quantity and an applied price is set by a store which sells a product. A total order quantity at a current point of time is referred to as a "current order quantity". Further, an applied price of a current order quantity is referred to as a "current price". Furthermore, an applied price in case that the total order quantity is 1 is referred to as a "start price". Still further, an applied price of a maximum necessary order quantity among the set necessary order quantities is referred to as a "final price". A start price is the highest price among set applied prices. A final price is the lowest price among set applied prices.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">A search result page includes two modes of display modes for a price of a product which can be purchased by a group. The first mode is a mode of displaying a current price. The second mode is a mode of displaying a price applied when a user who browses a search result page is assumed to order a product information of which is displayed in the search result page according to an order quantity which the user schedules. More specifically, when the user who browses a search result page is assumed to purchase a product, the total order quantity of this product is increased by the quantity ordered by this user. Hence, a price applied to the increased total order quantity is displayed. This price is referred to as an "expected price". When the user places an order, the user wants to know how much<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> the price will be and how cheap the price is at minimum in some cases. When the current price is different from the expected price, the expected price servers as information for making a decision to decide whether or not to order a product.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The quantity ordered by the user when the user who browses a search result page is assumed to purchase a product is referred to as an "expected order quantity". An expected price (an example of a quantity which the user is expected to order according to the present invention) is a sale price of a product when an order quantity corresponding to a sum of a current order quantity and an expected order quantity is a final total order quantity and sale is determined according to this order quantity. To display the "expected price", it is necessary to acquire an expected order quantity which is the quantity of a product which the user is expected to order. In the present embodiment, the group buying server 1 estimates an expected order quantity based on a purchase history of a product purchased by the user so far. More specifically, the expected order quantity is estimated based on the order quantity specified by the user when the user ordered a product in the past. This is because a product tends to be ordered in future according to the same order quantity as the past order quantity. The expected order quantity is, for example, estimated per product genre. In addition, the maximum order quantity is set to each product. The maximum order quantity is a maximum value of the quantity of a product<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> which can be ordered at a time. The maximum order quantity is used as a threshold of an expected order quantity for displaying an expected price. More specifically, when the expected order quantity exceeds the maximum order quantity, an applied price in case that the total order quantity is increased by the maximum order quantity is displayed as an expected price.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Hereinafter, a method of specifying a display mode of a price and a display example of a price will be described. <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a view illustrating a display example of a top page of an electronic mall.

The applied price of the product D in case that the total order quantity is increased by 3 from the current order quantity is displayed as an expected price. The reason is that the maximum order quantity of the product D is 3. The expected order quantities of the products A, B and E are less than the next price remaining necessary order quantities, and therefore the expected prices do not change from the current prices. Meanwhile, the expected order quantities of the products C and D are the next price remaining necessary order quantities or more, and therefore the expected prices change from the current price.

The other pieces of information includes, for example, a store ID, a store name, a genre ID, a product code, a product name and a URL of a product image.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The reason why a search record is registered per applied price is to display an applied price matching an expected order quantity is displayed as an expected price in a search result page. However, when search records of all applied prices of products are registered in the search DB 12e, a data amount of the search DB 12e becomes enormous. Further, when multiple search records are registered, a search speed decreases in some cases. Then, the system control unit 14 registers only search records which are necessary to perform search and display prices, in the search DB 12e.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">First, when product information including an order quantity specific price list of a given product is registered in the product information DB 12b, the system control unit 14 registers only price information the necessary quantities of which are the maximum order quantity or less among price<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> information registered in the order quantity specific price list. This is because an expected price only needs to be displayed in a range equal to or less than an order quantity corresponding to a sum of the current order quantity (0 in the beginning) and the maximum order quantity. The reason why an applied price corresponding to the current order quantity and the maximum order quantity is displayed as an expected price of a product when an expected order quantity exceeds a maximum order quantity of this product is to display an expected price based only on information registered in the search DB 12e at this point of time. By registering only search records which are necessary for the moment to display an expected price, it is possible to reduce a processing load of synchronizing content of the search DB 12e with content of the order quantity specific price list than a processing load of registering search records of all pieces of price information registered in the order quantity specific price list.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Subsequently, when an order is accepted from the user and the current order quantity increases, the system control unit 14 newly registers a search record according to the current order quantity. More specifically, the system control unit 14 registers a search record of price information the necessary order quantity of which newly becomes the sum of the current order quantity and the maximum order quantity or less due to the increase of the current order quantity. Meanwhile, the<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> system control unit 14 deletes from the search DB 12e a search record the applied price of which becomes higher than a current price due to the increase of the current order quantity. The expected price is an applied price matching one of order quantities in a range equal to or more than the increased current order quantity. Hence, a search record an applied price of which becomes higher than a current price does not match an order quantity in the range equal to or more than the current order quantity. This is because an applied price higher than a current price is not displayed as an expected price.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">A specific example will be described below. <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6A</figref> is a view illustrating an example of content registered in the price list per order quantity.

In this case, when determining that there is the price information including the second lowest applied price (step S98: YES), the system control unit 14 selects price information including the second lowest applied price compared to the applied price included in the selected price information (step S99). Next, the system control unit 14 proceeds to step S94. By repeating processing in step S94 to S99, the system control unit 14 acquires price information including an applied price matching the order quantity in a range equal to or less than the order quantity corresponding to the sum of the updated current order quantity and the maximum order quantity, from the order quantity specific price list of the order product registered in the product information DB 12b, and registers the search record matching the acquired price information in the search DB 12e.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">Further, when determining in step S95 that the necessary order quantity is not the sum of the current order quantity and the maximum order quantity or less (step S95: NO), or when determining in step S98 that there is not the price information including the second lowest applied price (step S98: NO), the system control unit 14 finishes processing upon order.</p><p id="p0105" num="0105">As described above, according to the present embodiment, the system control unit 14 of the group buying server 1 acquires an expected order quantity of a product searched based on a<!-- EPO <DP n="57"> --> search request, acquires from search records registered in the search DB 12e an applied price applied when sale is determined according to an order quantity corresponding to the sum of the expected order quantity and the current order quantity of the searched product, and sends HTML document of a search result page which displays the acquired applied price as an expected price.

Second Embodiment]</heading><p id="p0110" num="0110">In the first embodiment, a group buying server 1 estimates an expected order quantity based on a purchase history. By contrast with this, in the second embodiment described below, a user specifies an order quantity which the user wishes when the user is assumed to order a product, and the group buying<!-- EPO <DP n="59"> --> server 1 acquires the specified order quantity from the user terminal 3 as the expected order quantity. Hereinafter, differences from the first embodiment will be mainly described.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111"><figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref> is a view illustrating a display example of a top page according to the present embodiment. In <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>, the same elements as those in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> will be assigned the same reference numerals. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>, the top page includes, for example, a search condition setting area 110, a genre specifying area 120 and an order quantity entry field 140. The order quantity entry field 140 is an input area for inputting a desired order quantity. When the user does not input the order quantity in the order quantity entry field 140 and specifies only a search condition, a search result page as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref> is displayed as a search result page. Meanwhile, when the user inputs the order quantity in the order quantity entry field 140 and specifies a search condition, a search result page as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3B</figref> is displayed as a search result page. In this case, irrespectively of a genre of a searched product, an applied price corresponding to the sum of the current order quantity of this product and the order quantity inputted by the user is displayed as the expected price. Meanwhile, as to a product the order quantity of which is inputted by the user and exceeds the maximum order quantity, an applied price corresponding to the sum of the current order quantity and the maximum order quantity is displayed as an<!-- EPO <DP n="60"> --> expected price.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">When the user inputs the order quantity, the inputted order quantity is set as the expected order quantity to the search request sent from the user terminal 3. In step S23 of search processing illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>, a system control unit 14 determines whether or not the expected order quantity is set to the search request instead of determining displaying an expected price in a search result page is commanded by the user. In this case, when determining that the expected order quantity is not set, the system control unit 14 proceeds to step S24, and performs processing of displaying a current price of the searched product. Meanwhile, when determining that the expected order quantity is set, the system control unit 14 proceeds to step S26, and performs processing of displaying an expected price of the searched product. Without executing expected order quantity estimation processing in step S29, the system control unit 14 makes determination using the expected order quantity set to the search request in step S30.</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">As described above, according to the present embodiment, the user can learn a price matching the total order quantity which is increased by the quantity which the user wishes when the user orders the product according to the quantity which the user wishes.</p><p id="p0114" num="0114"><!-- EPO <DP n="61"> --> In addition, in step S9 of processing at the time of product information registration illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> and in step S95 in processing upon order illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11</figref>, the system control unit 14 uses a maximum order quantity of a product as a threshold for determining whether or not it is necessary to register a search record in the search DB 12e. However, information other than the maximum order quantity may be used as this threshold. Further, information other than the maximum order quantity may be used as a threshold to be compared with the expected order quantity in step S30 of search processing illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>. For example, the system control unit 14 may use a threshold set by a store per product. Further, the threshold may be set based on a purchase history. More specifically, the system control unit 14 searches a purchase history of a product the genre of which is the same or a product the product code of which is the same as that of the product for which the threshold is determined, from the purchase history DB 12d. Further, the system control unit 14 determines the threshold based on the order quantity included in the searched purchase history. In this case, the system control unit 14 determines the threshold such that the order quantity upon order of a given rate in the past orders is the threshold or less. More specifically, an order quantity matching an N percentile among order quantities of each searched purchase history is a threshold. That is, the threshold is determined such that the rate of order the order quantity of which is the threshold or<!-- EPO <DP n="62"> --> less is N% and the rate of order the order quantity of which is higher than the threshold is 100-N%. N is a value set in advance. For example, N only needs to be set in a range exceeding 50 such that large part of the order quantity is the threshold or less.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">Further, in each of the above embodiments, a current order quantity and a current price can be set to a search record. However, when a current order quantity and a current price do not need to be displayed in a search result page (when the current order quantity and the current price do not need to be displayed in the search result page illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref>), the current order quantity and the current price may not be set.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">Further, in each of the above embodiments, a remaining necessary order quantity is set to a search record. However, as long as information enables determination as to whether or not an applied price included in the same search record is an expected price, another information may be set to a search record instead of a remaining necessary order quantity. For example, a range of the remaining order quantity matching the applied price may be set to a search record. In an example in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6C</figref>, 0 to 60 is set as a range of the remaining order quantity to a search record an applied price of which is 9000 yen. Further, in an example in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6D</figref>, 0 to 40 is set as a range of the remaining order quantity to a search record an applied<!-- EPO <DP n="63"> --> price of which is 9000 yen, and 41 or more is set to a search record an applied price of which is 8000 yen. Furthermore, for example, a necessary order quantity may be set to a search record. In this case, it is possible to determine whether or not an applied price included in this search record is an expected price, based on a current order quantity, an expected order quantity and a necessary order quantity included in the search record. The current order quantity in this case may be set to the search record and acquired from the search record, or may be acquired from a product information DB 12b. Further, a range of an order quantity matching an applied price may be set to a search record. For example, in an example of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6B</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0001">1</figref> to 1 is set as a range of an order quantity to a search record an applied price of which is 10000 yen, 2 to 10 is set as a range of an order quantity to a search record an applied price of which is 9500 yen, and 11 to 100 is set as a range of an order quantity to a search record an applied price of which is 9000 yen. The range of the order quantity does not change even when the current order quantity increases.</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">Further, instead of a necessary order quantity, the range of the order quantity matching an applied price may be set to price information of a price list per order quantity.</p><p id="p0118" num="0118">Furthermore, although the present invention is applied to display a price in case that a searched product is displayed<!-- EPO <DP n="64"> --> as a search result of a product based on a search condition specified by the user in the above embodiment, a mode to which the present invention is applicable is not limited to display of a search result.
