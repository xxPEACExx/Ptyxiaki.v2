The conventional way until recently is to provide separate distribution systems for each service.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A more recent known form of apparatus is the provision of a cable based optical fibre distribution network which allows data to be transmitted from a broadcast location, along the supply network cables, typically over many miles, and then to those premises which are linked to the cable network and whose inhabitants wish to subscribe to the services provided via the network. This form of cable based network can be used to distribute television and radio programme services, telephony data services and ethernet or broadband internet services from the broadcast location to the premises with the telephone and Ethernet/broadband service data provided as a subcarrier along the cables along with the data for the television and radio service. While this form of service is known to be effective and provide relatively high speed delivery of the services to the end users, the system is dependent upon, and limited by, the extent and geographical reach of the cable network used to carry the services data. This therefore means that the availability of the system is limited to those geographical areas and premises therein which are connected to the cable network. This apparatus and method therefore cannot provide a distribution system which allows the provision of the radio, television, telephony and the ethernet services to all<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> users over a common supply network as many users will never be able to connect to the network as a result of geographical, technical and/or expenditure constraints.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A further problem is that the cable based distribution network requires a large initial infrastructure investment in order to lay down and install the cable network from the broadcast location to each of the users. This, in practice, means that the cable based distribution network tends to only be provided in geographical "clusters" which means that other geographical areas are unlikely to ever receive the cable service.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An alternative manner of supplying television and radio services and data therefore is to use a wireless transmission system, most commonly a satellite broadcast system, which allows the delivery of television and radio programme data from a broadcast location to be received at any premises which is equipped with a suitable receiving antenna, with the data transmitted from one or more remote broadcast locations and relayed via one or more satellites to be received by the antenna at the user's premises. While the parties which provide this service commonly also offer telephony and ethernet and/or broadband services, these are typically carried over existing telephone service lines to the premises separately to the data which is received via the satellite broadcast system. This therefore means that while the provision of all of the services may be offered to the user, in practical terms the data for those services is provided by different distribution means to the user's premises. As a result the satellite service providers cannot offer a package in which the data for the services offered is carried over a common supply network.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In practice, the provision of the data for the different services using different media and supply systems acts to limit the effectiveness of supplying a "bundle" of different services to the end user and places the satellite service providers at a disadvantage with respect to those service providers using the cable based distribution network over which all of the data can be provided for all of the services which are offered.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">An aim of the present invention is therefore to provide a system and method whereby a plurality of services including any, or any combination, of television, radio, telephone and/or broadband/ethernet services and/or other services such as video services such as video camera security service can be provided to a user in which at least some of the data is transmitted to a headend of the system via satellite transmission and the data for, and hence the various services, can be provided to the user in a more efficient and reliable manner, preferably via a common supply network for at least part of the transfer of the data. A further aim is to be able to provide a number of the services to users who wish to receive the same without any geographical restriction as to whether or not the user can receive the services.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In a first aspect of the invention there is provided a system for the delivery of a plurality of services to at least one user location, said services including at least two of any of a television and radio service, a telephone service and/or a broadband or Ethernet service and/or a video service via a common distribution network from a headend location to the at least one user location and wherein the network transmits the data in an optical format along at least a portion thereof and at least the television and radio service data is provided to the headend location via a satellite transmission system.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In one embodiment all of the data for all of the services are transmitted to the headend via a wireless transmission system.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In one embodiment the common distribution network uses optical fibre cabling from the headend to the user location.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Typically the common distribution network is used to provide the two or more services from the headend to a plurality of user locations.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In one embodiment each of the services is made available to the one or more users from the headend via the common distribution network.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In one embodiment the common distribution network allows the carrying of the different services at different, distinct and/or separate optical wavelengths on the distribution network. Typically this is achieved by utilising frequency selective filters at the headend or at the point at which conversion into an optical format is located on the common distribution network to control the frequency ranges which are used. This effectively means that the data signals for the different frequencies are combined and stacked at the headend at different optical frequencies for the different services and transmitted in this manner along the common distribution network to the user location. In one embodiment the stack of optical wavelengths are 1550nm, 1310 nm and 1490nm respectively. This allows the required separation of the data signals whilst allowing the same to be accommodated on the available wavelength of the optical cable.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In one embodiment, at the headend the data signals for the television and radio service is received via a wireless transmission system via at least one antenna, data for the telephone and/or broadband services is provided via a cable or wireless data supply to the headend and the data for the various services is then transformed into an optical format and assigned to respective optical wavelengths for transmission via the optical fibre cables of the common distribution network to one, but more typically, a plurality of, user locations.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Typically, at each of the user locations there are provided means to allow the reformatting of the received data into a suitable format for each of the services and to allow the separate processing of the data signals for the respective services to be provided.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In one embodiment the data signals received at the user location in a first optical wavelength for the television and radio service are passed to a broadcast data receiver or set top box to allow the data signals to be<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> processed and the audio and video generated from the data is then provided in the required format to allow the same to be displayed.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Typically the data signals received at the user location on other optical wavelengths from the common distribution network are passed to suitable apparatus to allow the provision of an Ethernet/broadband service and/or telephony apparatus to allow a telephone service to be provided at the user location.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In one embodiment the telephony apparatus which is used utilises Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology to provide the telephone service to the user.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Typically the data signals which are transmitted via the wireless transmission system, and indeed by cable, are transmitted from one or more broadcast locations which are remote from the headend. This therefore means that the headend is located intermediate the broadcast locations and the user locations such that the passage of the said data from the broadcast locations to the user locations is via the headend and thereby allows the bundling of the services and distribution of the same via a common distribution network from the head end to the user locations.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a system for the delivery of a plurality of services to at least one user location, said services including at least two of any of a television and radio service, a telephone service and/or a broadband or Ethernet service via a common distribution network from a headend location to the at least one user location and wherein said network transmits the data signals in an optical format along at least a portion thereof and the data signals for at least one of the services is provided to the headend location via a wireless transmission system.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In one embodiment the wireless transmission system utilises any or any combination of satellite, Long Term Evolution (LTE), Wi-Fi, Microwave<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> and/or line of sight data transmissions to provide the data to the head end location.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method for providing a plurality of data services selected from a television and radio service, a telephone service and a broadband/Ethernet service, to one or more user locations from a head end, wherein said method comprises the steps of providing data signals for each of the services to the head end, reformatting the data signals into an optical format, allocating the data signals for each of the services to a different optical wavelength and transmitting the data signals to the one or more user locations from the headend via a common distribution network in an optical format and the data signals for at least one of the services is transmitted to the head end location via a wireless transmission system.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In one embodiment the data signals for the television and radio service are transmitted wirelessly to the head end from a broadcast location.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In one embodiment the data signals received at the user location in a first wavelength are reformatted, if required, from the optical format and passed to a broadcast data receiver to allow the same to be processed and the audio and video generated therefrom is displayed from apparatus connected to the broadcast data receiver to provide the television and radio service. Typically the data signals received at the user location at an optical wavelength different from that at which the data signals for the television and radio service is provided, are passed to apparatus to allow the provision of an Ethernet/broadband service or to telephony apparatus to allow a telephone service to be provided at the user location.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Typically data signals received at the user location at a first optical wavelength are passed to apparatus to allow a first service to be provided, data signals received at a second optical wavelength are passed to apparatus to allow a second service to be provided and data signals received at a third<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> optical wavelength are passed to apparatus to allow a third service to be provided.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A specific embodiment of the invention is now described with reference to the accompanying Figures; wherein

The data signals are transmitted to one or more satellites 104 and, from those satellites, onto one or more receiving locations which are equipped with an antenna 10 and a low noise block 11 located therewith. The antenna and low noise block are located at or connected with a headend 4. Also provided to the headend 4 are data signals to allow a telephone service and an Ethernet/broadband service to be provided with the data signals being provided to the headend from remote locations 106,108 via the same cable or via cables 112, 114.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">From the headend 4 there is provided a common distribution network 6 to one or a number of user locations 2 to allow the data signals for the different services to be provided to the user location in a manner which is described in more details with regard to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>. It should be noted that although one user location is shown, in other embodiments a plurality of user locations can be provided. Furthermore the headend can be provided<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> within for example, a block of apartments to allow user locations in the form of each apartment to be supplied or alternatively may be provided to supply a housing estate with each user location being a house in the housing estate.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In accordance with the example now described in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> there is provided a user location 2 at which the user desires to receive a telephone service 3, television and radio service 5 and an ethernet/ broadband service 7 and wants to receive the services from a single common supplier and via a common distribution network 6.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In accordance with the invention, the data for the various services is collated at the "head end" 4 which is the term given to the apparatus which is provided to receive the required data from the remote broadcast and transmission data sources such as 102,106,108. The head end 4 can be provided at each of the user locations where, for example, the user location is a single residential premises or can be provided to receive data for subsequent distribution to a plurality of user locations such as, for example, for use in a block of apartments to allow data to be distributed to each of the apartments from a common head end, or for use in an estate of premises, each of which can be served by a common head end.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Indeed the system in accordance with the invention can be used to supply any group of user locations and users therein with the services even when the data signals for at least some of the services is broadcast via wireless transmissions, such as by satellite. Thus, it should be appreciated that the transmission, and hence provision, of the services can be to any potential user and without geographical restriction caused by the unavailability of a distribution infrastructure as is conventionally the case.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In the embodiment illustrated, for ease of illustration, only one user location 2 is shown as being supplied by the common distribution network 6 and head end 4 but it should be appreciated that the common distribution network 6 can be expanded for each of a number of user locations. At the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> head end 4 there is provided, or the head end is provided in connection with, the antenna 10 and LNB 11 such as that, in this embodiment, for receiving the data signals 103 broadcast via the satellite broadcast and transmission system. The antenna 10 is provided to receive transmitted data for the television and radio service.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">An antenna 9 for receiving terrestrial digital data signals for a further television and/or radio service may also be provided. Apparatus in the form of a cable modem and /or internet VoIP service provider 14 for receiving and transmitting data signals is provided to allow the receipt and transmission of data, i.e. the passage of data in both directions, through the headend 4 in order to provide the telephone service and Ethernet service via switching apparatus 15.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">At the headend the received data signals are converted via optical conversion means including a laser to allow the data signals to be transmitted onwardly from the head end to the user location 2. This is achieved by the provision of filters at the conversion means 33 to allocate the data signals for each particular service to a particular optical wavelength such that, for example, the data signals for the television service are allocated an optical wavelength at or around 1550nm and, in this embodiment, the data signals are passed to a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) converter 12. Wavelength-division multiplexing allows the multiplexing of the number of optical format carrier signals onto a single optical fiber cable and enables bidirectional communications.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">For the data signals from the terrestrial antenna 9 this can be passed to a combiner 13 to allow the data signals therefrom to be combined with the data signals from the satellite antenna 10 so that the combined television and radio service data signals 17 are passed to the WDM 12.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The data signals for the telephone and/or broadband/ Ethernet services, which data is provided for the receipt and transmission, is passed from the switch 15 to the optical converter 33 and converted into an optical format at<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> the appropriate frequencies and passed to the WDM 12 to be multiplexed onto the carrier 22 and stacked along with the television service data signals in terms of optical wavelength with, in this example, stacking of the respective optical wavelengths at 1550nm, 1310 nm and 1490nm respectively.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">All of the received data signals, at least some of which are typically initially received in the RF mode, is passed to be carried in the optical mode 22 and passed to an optical splitter 24. The splitter provides a plurality of paths 26, 28,30,32 each of which allow the passage of the optical data to one of a plurality of user locations 2, one of which is shown and which is supplied via optical path 32.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Thus all the data signals for the required services in combination is carried via the common distribution network 32 in an optical format, and at differing optical wavelengths, to the user location 2.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">At the user location 2, a WDM converter 16 is provided and which demultiplexes the data signals and if necessary conversion means (not shown) are provided to allow the conversion of the data signals from the optical format and to the required frequency bands so that the data signals are in suitable formats to allow the data signals to be processed by the respective service apparatus at the user location 2. The data for the television and radio service is passed from the WDM 16 via path 36 to a broadcast data receiver 38 and the data is processed in the normal format to allow the video and audio generated therefrom to be displayed and emitted, in this case, via the display screen and speakers of the television 18.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The data for the telephone and Ethernet/broadband services is passed from the WDM 16 via path 37 to an Ethernet switch apparatus 42 which allows the passage of data between the Ethernet/broadband user devices such as laptop 20 and mobile phone 44, and also allows the provision of a telephone service via VoIP adaptor apparatus 48 and plain old telephone system (POTS) 46 and telephone handset 50, which allows a conventional cable<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> based telephone service to be provided via the ethernet service. The WDM's 16 and 12 can also be used to allow the passage of data signals in the opposite direction from the user location 2 to the headend to allow the broadband/Ethernet and/or telephone and/or television and radio services to interact with the remote broadcast locations via the common distribution network.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the invention to that shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>. However, the components of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref> which are common are referred to by the same reference numerals for ease of illustration. In this embodiment, the data signals for the respective services are received at the head end in the same manner as described in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>. However in this case the optical cable which is used for the common distribution network 6 is a multi core, in this case a 4-core, cable which effectively means that there are four separate optical data signal paths along the cable. In this case there is no need to provide the WDM devices 12 and 16 of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> as no multiplexing of the signals is required onto a single cable as, in this embodiment two of the cores 19,21 of the cable are connected directly so as to carry the data signals 17 for the television and radio service, one of the cores 23 is connected to carry data signals for the telephone and broadband/Ethernet services from the headend to the user location and the core 25 is connected to carry the data signals for the telephone and broadband/Ethernet services from the user location to the Headend. The reverse process is performed at the user location 2 where the two cores 19, 21 are connected, via conversion means from optical to RF format if required, to provide the data service 36 and the cores 23 and 25 provide the telephone and broadband/Ethernet service data signals 37, again via conversion means if required. The data signals for the different services can still be carried at stacked frequencies in this case.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">It should also be appreciated that it may not be necessary to convert some or any of the data signals from the common distribution network received at the user location in an optical format back into other formats and, instead,<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> the data which is received can be processed and used in the optical format by the apparatus at the user locations in an optical format.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The present invention therefore provides the necessary data, at least some of which has been received at the headend via a wireless transmission system, to allow a number of services to be provided to a user at a location and allows the necessary data signals to all be provided at the user location via a single, common, supply network and without any geographical restriction on the availability of the services. This also allows the combination of services to be offered to users at the time of installation of the apparatus to receive the wireless data transmission as an extra service. This is turn represents the possibility of additional revenue streams being generated, both to the service providers, and the installers of the apparatus.</p></description><claims
