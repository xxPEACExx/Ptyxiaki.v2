The term "head geometry" relates to the size of the head, the position of the mouth and ears etc. Often the term "head phones" is used for a pair of earphones, which are interconnected by a headband or neckband and used for audio listening, especially music listening. The tem headset is normally used for a device used for two-way communication and comprising a microphone and at least one earphone with an earphone speaker. In the following the term "headset device" is a term used for all devices comprising attachment means for attaching the device to the head of a user and at least one audio transducer, which may be an earphone or a microphone. Normally the headband used with headset devices is adjustable in length, so that they can be adapted to the user's specific head geometry. Headset devices for two-way communication devices are often embodied with an adjustable microphone arm, so that the microphone can be positioned in front of or close to the mouth of the user.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">If the user is going to use the headset device after it has been taken off, put away and or used by another, it must be readjusted to fit the user. As it requires attention and time from the user to adjust the headset device correct, this is often not carried out in a satisfying way. Especially the adjustment of the microphone arm is problematic, as the user may not<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> recognize that the microphone arm is misplaced, which results in poor audio for the person telecommunicating with the headset user.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Headsets with microphone arms are often embodied so that the microphone arm can be adjusted to a position, where microphone is positioned optimally in relation to the mouth.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP4170198A"><text>JP 4170198 A2</text></patcit> discloses a headset device with an adjustable headband with indications showing the current adjustment of the headband.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Jabra Biz™ 2400 is a headset with an adjustable headband and a rotatable microphone arm.

The headset device 1 comprises a first earphone 6, a second earphone 36, a headband 12 interconnecting the two earphones 6, 36 and a microphone arm 4 extending from the first earphone 6 with a microphone 31 at its free end. The first earphone 6 is located on the user's left ear 18 and the second earphone 36 is located on the user's right ear 19. Each earphone 6, 36 comprises an earphone speaker providing audio to each of the user's ears 18, 19. The headband 12 is slidably received in a headband housing 11, which is fixedly connected to the first earphone 6. In this way, the headband can be adjusted to the size of the users head 3 and the position of the ears 18, 19. The microphone arm 4 is rotatably attached to the first earphone 6, whereby it can be rotated into a position where the microphone 31 is optimally positioned in relation to the mouth 17. In <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, the optimal position of the microphone arm 4 is shown with solid lines, wherein two other positions are shown with dashed lines.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref> is a side view of what is disclosed in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>. As shown, the microphone arm 4 is rotated from an upwards pointing direction to a user-specific position, where the microphone arm 4 is pointing in the direction of the mouth 17. In this position, the microphone 31 is placed as close as possible to the mouth, whereby an optimal signal-to-noise ratio can be obtained. The head geometry varies between users, which means that the size of the head, the position of the ears and the mouth vary. The rotational position of the microphone arm 4 is optimal for the shown user 34. However, another rotational position of the microphone arm 4 may be optimal for another user with a different head geometry.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> is a more detailed side view and <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 4</figref> is a more detailed bottom view of the first embodiment of the headset device 1. The first earphone 6 comprises an earphone housing<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> 16, a pivot 8 and a memory disc 9. The pivot 8 extends vertically along a first axis 29 from the side of the earphone housing 16, facing away from the user's ear. The microphone arm 4 and the memory disc 9 are both pivotally journalled on the pivot 8. However, the memory disc 9 is journalled with more friction than the microphone arm 4 so that it requires much more force to rotate than the microphone arm 4. A use position cam 15 extends from the outer side of the memory disc 9 and defines the user-specific position of the microphone arm 4. In the optimal use position, the microphone arm 4 abuts the use position cam 15 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 3</figref>. Thus, the user may rotate the memory disc clockwise and counter clockwise, until the desired position is obtained. If the microphone arm 4 is rotated clockwise to a rest position shown with dashed lines in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 3</figref>, the user can quickly rotate it back to the user-specific position by rotating it until it hits the use position cam 15 and a large resistance against further rotation in counter clockwise direction can be felt. The user may wish to rotate the microphone arm 4 to the rest position, when he is not in a call or wants to take the headset off his head. A rest stop cam 14 protrudes from the outer side of the headset housing 16 outside the periphery 13 of the memory disc 9, which has smaller diameter than the earphone housing 16. The rest stop cam 14 helps the user finding the rest position, as this will be obtained, when the microphone arm 4 abuts the rest stop cam 14.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref> is a side view and <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 6</figref> is a bottom view of a second embodiment of a headset device 1 according to the invention. While the first embodiment was a pure mechanical solution, this is an electronic solution. Like the first embodiment, the microphone arm 4 is pivotally journalled on a pivot 8 extending along a first axis 29. A circular row of optical sensors 20 are located around the first axis. The position of the microphone arm 4 is sensed by the optical sensors 20 located immediately below the microphone arm 4. In the shown embodiment, the microphone arm 4 can rotate 360 degrees. A memory switch 30 embodied as a push-button can be actuated by the user, when the microphone arm 4 is in the optimal position, whereby the electronics, which are connected to the sensors 20 detect the position. If the user moves the microphone arm 4 away from the optimal use position, the electronics may give an audible indication in the earphone 6. In addition, an audible tone may be played, when the user-specific position is obtained. Alternatively, a sound may<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> change in dependence of the distance from the user-specific position. Or, a voice may guide the user by for example saying: "turn clockwise", "turn counter clockwise", "stop", "correct position" or the like. The headset may also be motorized, whereby a short actuation of the memory switch may start a motor driven rotation of the microphone arm 4 to the user-specific position. In a preferred embodiment, a short press on the memory switch 30 may start movement of the microphone arm 4 to the stored position, while a long press will store the current position as the user-specific position. The sensors 20 may be encapsulated in the earphone housing 16 to protect them against dust or "false light". <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref> indicates a use scenario, where the first earphone 6 is placed on the left ear. However, if the user wants to have the microphone arm 4 on the right side of his head, he may place the first earphone 6 on the right ear. In this situation, another user-specific position should be stored. However, the electronics could be intelligent and guess whether the first earphone 6 is located on the left or right ear. Thus, if the microphone arm 4 points in the left direction when looked at as in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 5</figref>, the first earphone 6 is probably located on the left ear. If the microphone arm 4 points to the right as indicated with the dashed lines, the first earphone 6 is probably located on the right ear. A first user-specific position may be stored for left ear use, and a second user-specific position may be stored for right ear use. Other mechanisms to identify left or right ear position of the first earphone could be contemplated.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref> is a side view and <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 8</figref> is a bottom view of a third embodiment of a headset device 1 according to the invention. Just like first earphone of the first embodiment, the first earphone 6 of the third embodiment comprises a pivot 8, about which a microphone arm 4 and a memory disc 9 rotate. The memory disc 9 requires much more force to rotate than the microphone arm 4. A torsion spring 21 is located around the pivot 8 between the memory disc 9 and the microphone arm 4. A first spring end 32 is attached to the memory disc 9 and a second spring end 33 is attached to the microphone arm 4. The spring force exerted by the spring 21 is stronger than the friction force between the microphone arm 4 and the pivot. Thus, the spring 21 will force the microphone arm to the equilibrium point of the spring 21. In the user-specific position of the microphone arm 4 shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">figures 7 and 8</figref> the spring 21 exerts no force on the microphone arm 4. However, if the user moves to microphone arm 4<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> away from this position, the spring 21 will force it back immediately after the user let go off the microphone arm 4. If the user-specific position is to be adjusted, the user simply turns the memory disc 9 about the first axis 29 to the position where the microphone arm 4 is optimally positioned. A rest position cam 22 protrudes from earphone housing 16 outside the periphery 13 of the memory disc 9 and close to the headband 2. When the microphone arm 4 is moved to a rest position, shown with dashed lines, where it is more or less parallel with the headband housing 11, it will deflect slightly and slide on the rest position cam 22. The friction between surface of the microphone arm 4 and the top surface of the rest position cam 22 is greater than the spring force, whereby the microphone arm 4 will be retained at the rest position until the user pushes it free from the rest position cam 22.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 9</figref> is a cross-sectional view through a headband of a fourth embodiment of a headset device according to the invention. The view only discloses the portion of the headband, where the adjustment of the headband length takes place. An end of the headband 12 is slidably received in a channel 7 in the headband housing 11. By pushing the headband 12 further into to the channel 7, the "usable part" of the headband 12 is shortened, and by pulling the headband 12 more out of the channel 7, the headband is lengthened. The headband housing and headband are held together by friction. A not shown stop member prevents the headband 12 from being removed completely from the headband housing. Electrical wiring in the headband and the headband housing are left out for clarity reasons. A row of inductive sensors 24 are provided in the wall of the channel 7. They detect the position of the end face 23 of the headband, which is made of metal. When the headband 12 is adjusted in length to a specific user, he may push a not shown button, whereby the electronics connected to the inductive sensors 24 stores the position. If the user shortens the headband for transporting or lend the headset to another user and later on wants to readjust it, the electronics may advise him by providing an audible alert, when the correct length is obtained.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 10</figref> is a cross-sectional view through a headband of a fifth embodiment of a headset device according to the invention. While the fourth embodiment was an electronic solution,<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> the fifth embodiment is a pure mechanical solution. Also here, the headband 12 is slidably received in a channel 7 in the headband housing 11. The headband 12 is provided with a row of positioning indentations 25 in the surface. The headband 12 is guided through a passage 37 in a memory block 10. In the wall of the passage 37 there is provided a blind hole 28 with a compression spring 27 acting on a locking ball 26. The locking ball 26 engages with one of the positioning indentations 25 and locks the memory block 10 in this position. Thus, the memory block 10 functions as a stop block for the end face 38 of the headband housing 11. For example, the user may lengthen the headband for another user with a larger head or if folding of the headset requires so, and when he wants to return to the user-specific position, he simply shortens the headband, until the end face 38 of the headband housing 11 abuts the memory block 10. If another user-specific position is desired, a relatively high force may be exerted on the memory block 10 in order to slide it to a position where the locking ball 26 engages another positioning indentation 25.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 11</figref> is a cross-sectional view through a headband of a sixth embodiment of a headset device according to the invention. This solution is pure mechanical. The headband 12 is slidably received in a channel 7 in the headband housing 11. The headband housing 11 is made of transparent material and is provided with a longitudinal indicator groove 40 with an indicator block 41 slidably received in the indicator groove 40. When the headband 12 has been adjusted to the user's head, the user may align the indicator block 41 with the end face 23 of the headband 12. If the user later on, after the headset device has been lend to another user with a different head geometry, wants to readjust it to the stored position, he simply aligns the end face 39 with the indicator block 41.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 12</figref> is a diagram showing the overall electronic system of the second and fourth embodiments.

This electronic circuit 39 is able to store the current position of the microphone arm 4 and/or the length adjustment of the headband 2 in a memory circuit 43, when a user activates the memory switch 30. When the user later on<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> adjusts the microphone arm 4 and or headband length, the electronic circuit may generate an alert, such as an audible alert sent to a speaker 42 or on optical alert emitted by a light emitting diode 44.
