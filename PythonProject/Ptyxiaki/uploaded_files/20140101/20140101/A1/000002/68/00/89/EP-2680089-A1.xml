The image forming apparatus is configured such that an electrostatic latent image is formed on the photosensitive drum by the exposure device, and the electrostatic latent image is developed into a toner image by the developing device.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The exposure device is provided with a laser diode, and a seal glass having a dust-proof function in a housing. Laser light emitted from the laser diode is guided to a drum surface of the photosensitive drum which is rotated in a sub scanning<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> direction through the transparent seal glass, while being scanned in a main scanning direction.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Further, conventionally, there has been known a technology of generating cooling air in an image forming apparatus for preventing transfer of heat generated in a fixing device to a toner casing such as a developing device. In the case where cooling air is allowed to flow in the image forming apparatus, as disclosed in the above technology, dust or dirt flowing in from the outside of the image forming apparatus may adhere to the seal glass of the exposure device. If dust or dirt adheres to the seal glass in the image forming apparatus, part of laser light may be blocked and the image quality may be degraded. In view of the above, there is disposed a partition wall which restricts a cooling air path between the photosensitive drum and the exposure device.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In view of the above, an object of the present disclosure is to provide a configuration that enables to avoid a likelihood that a partition member for guiding cooling air may obstruct an operation of mounting and dismounting an image forming unit to and from an apparatus body of an image forming apparatus.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Summary</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">An image forming apparatus according to an aspect of the present disclosure is provided with a casing, an opening/closing cover, an exposure device, an image forming<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> unit, an airflow generator, a cooling air path, and a partition member. The casing is provided with an inner space. The opening/closing cover is mounted on the casing to be openable and closable for opening the inner space to an outside of the image forming apparatus when the opening/closing cover is in an opened state. The exposure device is provided with a laser light source which emits laser light, a housing which houses the laser light source therein and includes an opening for passing the laser light therethrough, and a light transmissive member which is disposed in the housing at such a position as to cover the opening of the housing for transmitting the laser light. The exposure device is disposed in the inner space. The image forming unit is provided with an image carrier onto which the laser light transmitted through the light transmissive member is irradiated. The image forming unit is mounted to a first position facing the exposure device in the inner space, and is allowed to be mounted and dismounted to and from the inner space when the opening/closing cover is in the opened state. The airflow generator generates an airflow in the inner space. The cooling air path guides the airflow between the exposure device and the image forming unit in the inner space. The partition member is disposed between the exposure device and the image forming unit, and is configured to change a state thereof between a first state and a second state. The first state is such that the partition member projects toward the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> image forming unit mounted to the first position from a side of the exposure device, and constitutes part of the cooling air path when the opening/closing cover is in a closed state. The second state is such that the image forming unit is allowed to be dismounted from the inner space while passing between the exposure device and the image forming unit when the opening/closing cover is in an opened state.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">These and other objects, features and advantages of the present disclosure will become more apparent upon reading the following detailed

However, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>, in the case where the blocking member 91 is disposed to extend downwardly from the attachment plate 220, the blocking member 91 may obstruct an operation of dismounting the process unit 101 (in the direction of the arrow D73 in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>). In particular, as described in this embodiment, in which the process unit 101 is mounted and dismounted in a direction orthogonal to the axis direction of the photosensitive drum 121, the aforementioned drawback is likely to occur. Further, during the dismounting operation, in the case where the process unit 101 is shifted to the second position closer to the exposure device 123 than the first position for avoiding friction between the photosensitive drum 121 and the transfer roller 126, it is highly likely that the blocking member 91 as a partition wall of the cooling air path 50 may obstruct the operation of dismounting the process unit 101. Even in such a condition, as described above in this embodiment, it is possible to dispose the blocking member 91 at the spaced position X2. In particular, even in the case where the process<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> unit 101 is dismounted from the main body inner space 260, after the process unit 101 has been shifted to the second position closer to the exposure device 123 than the first position, the blocking member 91 disposed at the spaced position X2 is allowed to be disposed on the exposure device 123 side with respect to the process unit 101 in the second position. Accordingly, an operation of dismounting the process unit 101 is appropriately performed. Namely, the blocking member 91 allows the process unit 101 to be dismounted from the main body inner space 260 when the opening/closing cover 200C is in an opened state (second state of the blocking member 91).</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">Further, in this embodiment, the interlocking portion 95 causes the blocking member 91 to shift from the projecting position X1 to the spaced position X2 in association with an operation of shifting the opening/closing cover 200C from a closed state to an opened state. Accordingly, the blocking member 91 is smoothly disposed at the spaced position X2 before the process unit 101 is mounted and dismounted. Further, the air path blocking portion 911 of the blocking member 91 is disposed to extend along the housing body 80G of the exposure device 123 when the opening/closing cover 200C is in an opened state. Further, as the opening/closing cover 200C is shifted from an opened state to a closed state, the blocking member 91 is pivotally moved about the axis of the shaft portion 910 by contact of the arm portion 230 with the contact piece 913. As<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> a result of the above operation, the air path blocking portion 911 of the blocking member 91 projects toward the process unit 101.

Accordingly, it is possible to smoothly shift the blocking member 91 between the spaced position X2 and the projecting position X1 in association with an operation of opening and closing the opening/closing cover 200C.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Further, in this embodiment, the optical path blocking portion 912 is disposed to be spaced away from the optical path L of laser light to be output through the seal glass 90 when the blocking member 91 is in the projecting position X1. Accordingly, there is no likelihood that the optical path blocking portion 912 may obstruct irradiation of laser light when the opening/closing cover 200C is in a closed state. On the other hand, the optical path blocking portion 912 is disposed at such a position that blocks the optical path L of laser light when the blocking member 91 is in the spaced position X2. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent laser light from<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> leaking to the outside of the casing 200 when the opening/closing cover 200C is in an opened state.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">In the foregoing embodiment, the blocking member 91 constitutes part of the cooling air path 50, and also has a function of blocking laser light to be output through the seal glass 90.

Each of the cleaning members 914A and 914B is formed of a sponge member. When a process unit 301 is dismounted from a main body inner space 260 (in the direction of the arrow D29 in <figref idrefs="f0029">FIG. 29</figref>), an upper surface portion 301A of the process unit 301 contacts with<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> the cleaning members 914A and 914B, so that the toner or foreign matter adhered to the process unit 301 is removed and the process unit 301 is cleaned. In the case where the blocking member 91A is disposed at a projecting position X1 as with the case of the blocking member 91 in the first embodiment, the cleaning members 914A and 914B are disposed to substantially align with the blocking member 91A so that the cleaning members 914A and 914B do not block the optical path of laser light to be output through a seal glass 90A. The cleaning members 914A and 914B may be formed of a brush member, in place of a sponge member.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Next, a printer 100M (image forming apparatus) according to a third embodiment of the present disclosure is described.

When the elastic guide member 550 is in a state (first state), in which the process unit 101 is mounted to a position (first position) facing a<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --> transfer roller 126 for image formation (for irradiating laser light transmitted through a seal glass 90 onto a photosensitive drum 121), the elastic guide member 550 is disposed between the exposure device 123 and a charger 122 in the process unit 101, and constitutes part of a cooling air path 50 (first state). The elastic guide member 550 is fixedly mounted to a lower wall portion of an attachment plate 220 in such a manner as to project toward the process unit 101. The elastic guide member 550 is made of polyurethane foam, and is compressively (resiliently) deformable.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Disposing the elastic guide member 550 as described above makes it possible to guide and deflect an airflow flowing into the cooling air path 50 to flow away from the attachment plate 220 (in the direction of the arrow D62 in <figref idrefs="f0030">FIG. 30</figref>) by the elastic guide member 550, at a position above the charger 122, after having passed a position above a cleaning device 127 (in the direction of the arrow D61 in <figref idrefs="f0030">FIG. 30</figref>). Then, the airflow is guided forwardly of a developing device 124 (in the direction of the arrow D63 in <figref idrefs="f0030">FIG. 30</figref>), after having passed between the elastic guide member 550 and the developing device 124. As a result of the above operation, it is possible to prevent the airflow from approaching the seal glass 90.

In particular, the aforementioned drawback is likely to occur in mounting and dismounting the process unit 101 in a direction orthogonal to the axis direction of the photosensitive drum 121. Further, during the mounting/dismounting operation, in the case where the process unit 101 is shifted to the second position closer to the exposure device 123 than the first position for preventing friction between the photosensitive drum 121 and the transfer roller 126, it is highly likely that the elastic guide member 550 as a partition wall of the cooling air path 50 may obstruct the operation of mounting and dismounting the process unit 101.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">As described above, however, the elastic guide member 550 in this embodiment is an elastic member made of an elastic material as represented by polyurethane foam. <figref idrefs="f0031">FIG. 31</figref> is a cross sectional view showing a state of the elastic guide member 550 when the process unit 101 moves upwardly (see the direction of the arrow D64 in <figref idrefs="f0030">FIG. 30</figref>).

Thus, the elastic guide<!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --> member 550 allows the process unit 101 to be shifted to the second position (second state of the elastic guide member 550). Accordingly, it is possible for the operator to take out the process unit 101 from the main body inner space 260 in the direction of the arrow D161 in <figref idrefs="f0031">FIG. 31</figref>. Further, when the process unit 101 leaves the elastic guide member 550 in a compressed state, the elastic guide member 550 is recovered to the original shape.
