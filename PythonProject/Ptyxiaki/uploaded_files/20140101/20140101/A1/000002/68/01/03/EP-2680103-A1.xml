The fastening device includes a tray 10, two brackets 20, an engaging member 30, and a plurality of screws 50 with columnar heads 52.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The tray 10 includes a long bottom plate 11 and two opposite side plates 15 extending perpendicularly up from opposite sides of the bottom plate 11. A recess 16 is defined in an inner side of a front end of one of the side plates 15. A through slot 18 (shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>) is defined in the side plate 15, extending through a rear sidewall 162 of the recess 16 and a rear end of the side plate 15. A first connector 120 with a plurality of cables 122 is mounted on a front end of the bottom plate 11. A second connector 121 with a plurality of cables 122 is mounted on a rear end of the bottom plate 11. The cables 122 of the first connector 120 enter the through slot 18 from the recess 16, and extend out of the through slot 18 from the rear end of the side plate 15. The cables 122 of the first connector 120 and second connector 121 are then electrically connected to an electronic device, such as a backplane. A first group of slide slots 151 is defined in front portions of inner sides of the side plates 15, extending forward. A second group of slide slots 151 is defined in rear portions of the inner sides of the side plates 15, extending backward. The side plates 15 define a plurality of accesses 152 respectively communicating with rear ends of the slide slots 151 of the first group in a substantially perpendicular manner and extending through tops of the inner sides of the side plates 15. The side plates 15 define a plurality of accesses 152 respectively communicating with front ends of the slide slots 151 of the second group in a substantially perpendicular manner and extending through tops of the inner sides of the side plates 15. In one embodiment, each group of slide slots 151 has four slide slots 151.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Each bracket 20 includes a top plate 21, two side plates 22 extending perpendicularly down from opposite sides of the top plate 21, and a first end plate 23 and a second end plate 24 extending perpendicularly down from opposite ends of the top plate 21. The top plate 21 defines a plurality of vents 212 for heat dissipation of the HDD 40. Two recesses 25 are depressed inward from each side plate 22. A through hole 252 is defined<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> in a bottom wall 251 of each recess 25. Two through holes 231 are defined in the first end plate 23. Two notches 232 are defined in a junction of the top plate 21 and the first end plate 23, and respectively communicate with top ends of the through holes 231. An opening 243 is defined in a junction of the top plate 21 and the second end plate 24. Connectors 42 of the HDDs 40 can be electrically connected to the first connector 120 and the second connector 121 through the openings 243.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> shows the engaging member 30 including a main body 31 and a resilient portion 35. The main body 31 is hollow, without a bottom wall. Two abutting portions 32 extend out from opposite sides of the main body 31. Two platforms 33 extend from opposite sides of a first end of the main body 31. A substantially rectangular block 34 extends perpendicularly from each platform 33. Opposite end walls 341 of the block 34 are arc-shaped, and the radius of the arc is substantially the same as the radius of the through hole 231. The resilient portion 35 includes an extension plate 351 extending down firstly and then extending slantingly up from a bottom of a second end of the main body 31 opposite to the first end of the main body 31, an operation portion 352 extending from a top of the extension plate 351 away from the main body 31, and two latches 353 formed on opposite sides of the extension plate 351. An arc-shaped abutting wall 355 substantially having the same radius as the through hole 231 is formed on a side of each latch 353 away from the main body 31.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIGS. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref> show in assembly, the HDDs 40 are respectively received in the brackets 20. The opposite sides of each HDD 40 abut against the bottom walls 251 of the corresponding bracket 20. A connector 42 of each HDD 40 aligns with the opening 243 of the corresponding bracket 20. The screws 50 respectively extend through the through holes 252 and engage in the locking holes 43. The brackets 20 are manipulated down toward the bottom plate 11, with the first end plates 23 facing each other. The heads 52 of the screws 50 enter the first and second groups of the slide slots 151 through the corresponding accesses 152. The brackets 20 are respectively manipulated forward and backward, to allow the heads 52 of the screws 50 to slide in the first and second groups of the slide slots 151, until the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> heads 52 of the screws 50 are blocked by blind ends of the first and second groups of the slide slots 151. The connectors 42 of the HDDs 40 are respectively connected to the connectors 12 in the tray 10 through the openings 243.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The engaging member 30 is placed between the first end plates 23 of the brackets 20, with the first end of the main body 31 located at a bottom of the engaging member 30. The engaging member 30 is manipulated down, allowing the blocks 34 to respectively enter the through holes 231 through the notches 232 adjacent to one of the side plates 15. The engaging member 30 is rotated toward the other side plate 15. The blocks 34 are rotated in the corresponding through holes 231, with the end walls 341 of the blocks 34 abutting against sidewalls bounding the corresponding through holes 231. The operation portion 352 is operated to deform the resilient portion 35 toward the main body 31, to allow the latches 353 to respectively slide down in the notches 232 adjacent to the other side plate 15. When the abutting walls 355 completely abut against sidewalls bounding the corresponding through holes 231, the resilient portion 35 is restored. The abutting portions 32 respectively abut against the first end plates 23.
