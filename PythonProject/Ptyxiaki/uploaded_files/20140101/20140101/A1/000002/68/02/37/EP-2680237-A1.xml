For example, in a banknote processing unit disclosed in Patent Document 1, a pouch is attached between a first frame and a second frame, and the pouch is retained in an opened state by the first frame and the second frame. In the banknote processing unit, when an upper opening of the pouch is sealed after a banknote is stored in the pouch, the first frame is pulled onto a front side of the banknote processing unit to abut the first frame and second frame on each other, thereby sealing the upper opening of the pouch. After the upper opening is sealed, the first frame is further drawn onto the front side, the pouch in which the upper opening is sealed is taken out from the inside of the banknote processing unit, and finally the pouch is collected. An adhesive surface is formed in an inner surface of the pouch, and the upper opening of the pouch is sealed by adhesion of the adhesive surface. After the upper opening is sealed, the first frame is further drawn onto the front side, the pouch in which the upper opening is sealed is taken out from the inside of the banknote processing unit, and finally the pouch is collected.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In a banknote processing unit disclosed in Patent Document 2, a banknote storing bag (the pouch) is set in a banknote storage container, and the banknote taken in the container is stored in the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> banknote storing bag by free fall using transport means.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Document</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1369826A1"><text>EP Patent Application Publication No. EP1369826A1</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP0852279A2"><text>EP Patent Application Publication No. EP0852279A2</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the conventional pouch sealing mechanism disclosed in Patent Document 1, as described above, the first frame and the second frame are abutted on each other by drawing the first frame onto the front side of the paper sheet processing unit, the upper opening of the pouch is sealed, and the first frame is further drawn onto the front side after the upper opening is sealed, whereby the pouch in which the upper opening is sealed is taken out from the inside of the paper sheet processing unit. In the sealing mechanism, the first frame is drawn onto the front side of the paper sheet processing unit in two stages (that is, twice before and after the pouch is sealed), and a wide space is required on the front side of the paper sheet processing unit in order to draw the first frame onto the front side. However, sometimes the wide space can hardly be ensured on the front side of the paper sheet processing unit depending on an installation place of the paper sheet storing unit in which the pouch sealing mechanism is provided.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the conventional pouch sealing mechanism disclosed in Patent Document 1, the frames are attached in the sealing mechanism while the pouch is opened, and the pouch is retained by the frames after the peel-off sheet of the pouch is peeled off to expose the adhesive surface. When the upper opening of the pouch is sealed, the adhesive surfaces adhere to each other in the inner surface of the pouch. However, in the pouch sealing mechanism, because the adhesive surface is exposed when the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> banknote is stored, there is a risk that the banknote adheres to the adhesive surface formed in the inner surface of the pouch when the banknote is stored in the pouch from above by the free fall. Additionally, because the adhesive surface is exposed, an adhesive force of the adhesive surface is degraded by aging, and there is a risk of insufficiently sealing the upper opening of the pouch.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the conventional paper sheet storing unit disclosed in Patent Document 2, because only the paper sheet transported into the container is stored by the free fall when the paper sheet is stored in the storing bag, such a stacking failure that the paper sheet becomes an upright state in the storing bag is generated, and unfortunately that a paper sheet storage state of the storing bag becomes a full state is detected eve if a small number of paper sheets are stored compared with an actual capacity of the storing bag.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention has been devised to solve the problems described above, and an object thereof is to a paper sheet storing unit that can shorten a drawing distance, in which first and second retention members that retain a paper sheet storing bag are drawn onto the front side of the paper sheet storing unit, to achieve space saving on the front side of the paper sheet storing unit by moving the first retention member in a direction orthogonal to a drawing direction in which the paper sheet storing bag is drawn to the outside from the inside of the paper sheet storing unit when the first and second retention members are abutted on each other to seal the upper opening of the paper sheet storing bag.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Another object of the present invention is to provide a paper sheet storing unit and a paper sheet storing method, which can prevent the paper sheet from adhering to the adhesive surface of the paper sheet storing bag during the storage of the paper sheet in the paper sheet storing bag by reducing the exposure of the adhesive surface of the paper sheet storing bag during, and surely<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> seal the upper opening of the paper sheet storing bag by reducing the degradation of the adhesive force of the adhesive surface the storage of the paper sheet in the paper sheet storing bag.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a paper sheet storing unit in which a push-in unit that pushes the paper sheet into the paper sheet storing bag placed in the storing unit is provided, and the push-in unit compresses the paper sheet in the paper sheet storing bag every time the paper sheet is stored in the paper sheet storing bag, whereby the stacking failure of the paper sheet can be reduced in the paper sheet storing bag to increase a storage amount of the paper sheet stored in the paper sheet storing bag.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A paper sheet storing unit comprises:

In this case, using an information unit (not illustrated), the control unit 190 informs the operator of the information indicating that the banknote storage state of the banknote storing bag 150 reaches the storage limit in a display or sound manner.
