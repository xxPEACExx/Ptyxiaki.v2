Fields of the invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a product purchase platform, especially to a product purchase platform using a mobile terminal in product exchange that allows users to verify a product voucher by a mobile terminal and then redeem the product voucher in exchange for products on physical stores.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Descriptions of Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Gift-giving behavior is for expressions of gratitude, caring, apology, celebration, sympathy or caring in our society. Sending a gift is an important relationship building gesture. Due to globalization, the social network allows users to meet people all over the world. However, when people want to send gifts to their friends who stay far away, they need to consider the appropriate types of gifts, care packages, and the delivery way. Once the gifts are damaged or broken during the shipment, the gift giver and the gift recipient will not be satisfied with the gift-giving experience.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Thus there is a need to have a product purchase platform using a mobile terminal in product exchange in which recipients can get the product the gift giver purchased in stores nearby. This ensures the gift in a better condition. Moreover, the cost of shipment is included in the purchasing cost of the store so that the shipping fee is saved. Compared with the way available now that people send the gifts at convenient stores, the warehousing cost of the gift is also included in the original warehousing cost of goods the store needs to pay and there is no need to pay additional warehousing cost. The present invention provides a more economical product purchase and voucher redemption model.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Thus the present invention provides a product purchase platform using a mobile terminal in product exchange. The product purchase platform consists of a first terminal and a second terminal. The first terminal is connected to a server for transmitting a piece of purchase information and a second user's information to the server. The second terminal is a mobile terminal also connected to the server for receiving a product voucher transmitted by the server and for confirming validity of the product voucher. A first user is connected to the server via the first terminal for purchasing at least one product on a product platform built in the server<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> and sending the product to a second user as a gift. The second user uses the second terminal to get the product voucher that is transmitted by the server and carries the second terminal to redeem the product voucher for the product in a store. Before redemption of the product voucher, the second user uses the second terminal to connect to the server for confirming that the product voucher is still valid. After the validity of the product voucher being confirmed by the server, the store gives the product to the second user according to the purchase information. Thus the online purchase and the redemption of the product voucher for the product are completed.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Therefore it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a product purchase platform using a mobile terminal in product exchange that allows a first user to be connected to a server for purchasing at least one product online and sending the product to a second user as a gift.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is another object of the present invention to provide a product purchase platform using a mobile terminal in product exchange in which the server transmits a product voucher to the second user so<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> that the second user can redeems the product voucher for the product in a store.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a product purchase platform using a mobile terminal in product exchange in which the second user carries the second terminal to be connected to the server for verifying whether the product voucher is still valid.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a product purchase platform using a mobile terminal in product exchange that provides the second user a first cash gift voucher or a second cash gift voucher. Thus the second user is attracted to redeem the first cash gift voucher or the second cash gift voucher for a cash gift to be used in product purchase services provided by the server for saving money.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a product purchase platform using a mobile terminal in product exchange in which a third party organization receives a purchase price and transmits a piece of already-paid information to the server so that the server transmits the product voucher to the second user after confirming the payment of the purchase price.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a product purchase platform using a mobile terminal in product exchange in which the server produces a piece of already-redeemed information after the product voucher being verified so as to avoid double use of the product voucher.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In order to achieve the above objects, a product purchase platform using a mobile terminal in product exchange according to the present invention includes a first terminal and a second terminal. The first terminal is used by a first user to be connected to a server for transmitting a piece of purchase information and a piece of a second user's information to the server. The second terminal is a mobile terminal operated by a second user and connected to the server for receiving a product voucher transmitted by the server and for checking whether the product voucher is valid. After confirming validity of the product voucher, a store gives at least one product to the second user according to the purchase information.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">By the above components, the first user is connected to the server provided by a service supplier for purchasing at least one product online on a product platform built in the server, and<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> transmitting the purchase information and the second user's information to the server. The purchase information includes at least one product name and at least one product while the second user's information includes an electronic mail (email) account/address or a mobile phone number. After confirming a payment made by the first user, the server transmits the product voucher to the second terminal through an email or a mobile phone short message. Thus the second user obtains the product voucher. The product voucher includes at least one one-dimensional (1D) barcode, at least one 2D barcode or at least one serial number. The second user carries the second terminal to the store that cooperates with the service supplier. Before the redemption of the product voucher, the second terminal is used to connect to the server for checking whether the product voucher is still valid and there are three checking mechanisms available now. The first is that the second terminal directly transmits the product voucher to the server and the server immediately returns a verification result of the product voucher and the purchase information after analyzing and verifying the product voucher. The second mechanism is that the second terminal transmits the product voucher to the server after the product voucher being analyzed to get the purchase information. Then the server verifies the product<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> voucher and returns the verification result of the product voucher. The third mechanism is that a voucher code and the purchase information are obtained after analysis of the product voucher. Next the second terminal transmits the voucher code to the server and the server returns the verification result of the product voucher after verifying the voucher code. All the three mechanisms enable the store to learn whether the product voucher is still valid and the name as well as quantity of at least one product for which the product voucher is redeemed. The verification result of the product voucher and the purchase information transmitted by the server are contained in at least one 1D barcode, at least one 2D barcode or at least one serial number. Thus the store can use an input device to get the verification result of the product voucher and the purchase information. Moreover, the server automatically generates and saves a piece of already-redeemed information after transmitting the product voucher so as to prevent the product voucher from being redeemed again.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Furthermore, a first cash gift voucher is transmitted to the second terminal via the server or a second cash gift voucher is given to the second user by the store. Like the product voucher, the first cash gift voucher or the second cash gift voucher includes<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> at least one 1D barcode, at least one 2D barcode or at least one serial number. The second user is connected to the server via the second terminal or a third terminal for transmitting the first cash gift voucher or the second cash gift voucher to the sever to be verified. Then the server returns a verification result of the first cash gift voucher together with a piece of first cash gift information, or a verification results of the second cash gift voucher together with a piece of second cash gift information. The first cash gift information and the second cash gift information respectively includes the amount and expiration date of the first cash gift and those of the second cash gift. Thereby the service supplier gives the second user virtual cash gift that can be used on the product platform. Thus the second user is attracted to purchase products on the product platform and send them to others as gifts.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In addition, a product purchase platform using a mobile terminal in product exchange of the present invention further includes a fourth terminal. The fourth terminal is operated by a third party organization to be connected to the server for receiving a piece of purchase price information and transmitting a piece of already-paid information to the server after the third party organization confirming the payment of the purchase price. The<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> third party organization cooperates with the service supplier. After receiving the purchase information transmitted from the first user, the server transmits a piece of purchase price information to the fourth terminal of the third party organization. The third party organization returns a piece of already-paid information to the server after receiving a purchase price that is consistent with the purchase price information. Thus the server transmits a product voucher to the second terminal and informs the second user to redeem the product voucher for the product in a store cooperating with the service supplier. The purchase price information includes a payment way. The payment way means how the first user pay the purchase price to the third party organization, including bank counter remittance, ATM remittance, using credit card at the counter, using credit card online, installment payment at the counter, and installment payment online.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">While using the product purchase platform using a mobile terminal in product exchange, the first user is directly connected to the product platform of the server, or is connected to the server via a social networking site. The service supplier cooperates with a social networking site company for connecting and sharing accounts/identities and application services. Thus consumers can more<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> easily get access to promotion information and more possibly purchase and exchange product on the product platform. The first user can also purchase the product on the product platform and redeem the product voucher for the product for himself. Under such condition, the first terminal and the second terminal can be the same terminal.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">The structure and the technical means adopted by the present invention to achieve the above and other objects can be best understood by referring to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and the accompanying drawings, wherein

The second user uses a second terminal to receive a product voucher transmitted by the server and then carries the second terminal to a store to redeem the product voucher for the product. Before redemption, the second user is connected to the server via the second terminal for checking whether the product voucher is still valid. After the store confirming that the product voucher is valid, the product is given to the second user. After transmitting a verification result of the product voucher to the second terminal, the server automatically generates and saves a piece of already-redeemed information so as to avoid double use of the product voucher. Moreover, the server can also provide the second user a first cash gift voucher or a second cash gift voucher that is redeemable to exchange for virtual cash gift. Thus the second user is attracted to purchase and exchange products on the product platform of the server. A third party<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> organization receives a piece of purchase price information transmitted by the server via a fourth terminal and returns a piece of already-paid information to the server after receiving a purchase price. Then the server transmits the product voucher to the second terminal.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Refer to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a product purchase platform using a mobile terminal in product exchange of the present invention includes a server 10, a first terminal 21, a second terminal 22, a third terminal 23, and a fourth terminal 24. A service supplier B provides the server 10 and sets up a product platform 100 in the server 10. A first user A is connected to the server 10 by the first terminal 21 for purchasing a product P on the product platform 100 and transmitting a piece of purchase information S1 as well as a second user's information S2 to the server 10. The purchase information S1 includes a product name and a product quantity of the product P. The server 10 sends a piece of purchase price information S3 to a fourth terminal 24 operated by a third party organization C. The purchase price information S3 includes a payment way S31 mentioned that the first user A makes a payment of a purchase price M to the third party organization C by bank counter remittance. After receiving of the purchase price M,<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> the third party organization C sends a piece of already-paid information S4 to the server 10. Then the server 10 transmits a product voucher S5 to a second terminal 22 owned by a second user D after confirming the payment of the purchase price M.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">When the second user D goes to a store E for getting the product P, the second terminal 22 is connected to the server 10 and there are three kinds of mechanisms to verify the product voucher S5 and get the purchase information S1. As the L1 pathway shown in the figure, the first mechanism is that the second terminal 22 directly transmits the product voucher S5 to the server 10 and then receives a verification result of the product voucher S7 and the purchase information S1 the server 10 returns. The second mechanism (L2 pathway shown in the figure), the product voucher S5 is analyzed by the store E to get the purchase information S1 while the second terminal 22 transmits the product voucher S5 to the server 10 and then receives a verification result of the product voucher S7 the server returns 10. The third mechanism (L3 pathway shown in the figure), the product voucher S5 is analyzed by the store E to get a voucher code S51 and the purchase information S1 while the second terminal 22 transmits the voucher code S51 to the server 10 and then receives a verification result of the product voucher S7 the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> server returns 10.

The service supplier cooperates with a third party organization that receives a purchase price of the product purchased and informs the service supplier the payment of the purchase price. Thus the service supplier transmits a product voucher to the second user so that the second user can redeem the product voucher for the product in a store cooperating with the service supplier. A second terminal owned by the second user is a mobile terminal so that the second user can carry the second terminal conveniently to the store for redemption of the product voucher. The validity of the product voucher is also verified by the second terminal connected to the server. Thus there is no need to arrange a terminal in the store. Moreover, the service supplier can also cooperate with a social networking site company so that the social networking site of the company and the product platform of the service supplier are connected with each other and sharing accounts/identities and application services with each other for promotion of the product purchase and exchange service. Furthermore, the server can also provide a first cash<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> gift voucher or a second cash gift voucher to the second user. The second user redeems the first cash gift voucher or the second cash gift voucher for a cash gift able to be used on the product platform. Thereby the service supplier uses the cash gift for attracting the second user to use the product platform. By the product purchase platform in which a product is exchanged via a mobile terminal according to the present invention, the product one user purchased can be obtained by the other user at a store nearby. Thus the other user can get the product with a better condition. In addition, the delivery and storage cost of the product is included in the purchasing and warehousing cost of the store.
