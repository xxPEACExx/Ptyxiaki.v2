These were based on infrared in the 90's and Bluetooth in the 2000's or even pico-networks based on Zigbee. For these technologies, but the infra-red based ones, the connectivity still reaches several meters and is still quite pervasive. As a result, credentials have still to be exchanged between connected nodes to secure the data transmission.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In order to bypass the connection setup, which can be inefficient and painful for a one-off, short data exchange, some new technologies have emerged; they are referred to as near-field communication technologies. The principle is to minimize the security layers by relying on a physical proximity to establish a "safe" connection and data transfer. The underlying point is to reduce the range of connectivity by any mean to avoid any security breach. Some approaches rely on the design of the transmission itself like the nature of the media (image for barcode or 2D-codes, induction for NFC,...) or even on the energy level used during the communication (infrared, radio frequencies, ultrasound).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Some of the used technologies are restricted to a certain area by nature; this is the case for infrared light for example that is directional and cannot go through walls. However this is not sufficient to restrict the communication range within a very limited range, i.e. less than 10 centimeters, so as to preserve security. One left option would be to limit the power used during the data transmission.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However limiting the power could raise some usability issue for some basic technologies which are very limited in loopback mechanisms. This is the case if the implementation relies on a send &amp; forget mechanism ('pure' sender and a 'pure'<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> receiver) and that no acknowledgement feedback is implemented to actually confirm the reception of the data. If the transmitting device is too far from the receiver then the message could be lost or the implementation of a time-off may abort the transmission too early. This happens when the technology does not provide an easy way to create two separate communication channels or when for implementation cost reasons only one channel is implemented. An example of such an implementation is ultrasound based technology that relies on standard components available in devices and is limited on signal analysis capabilities.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to increase the transmission success rate while keeping the transmission time as short as possible to overall shorten the process, and consequently improve security, user's control becomes the single factor. Users may adjust the distance between devices and when the transmitter and receiver device are within proximity, the user can start the transmission by interacting with the application running on the device, such as clicking a button.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Examples of such transmissions may be found among solutions offering sound based transmissions, relying for instance upon Near Sound Data Transfer (NSDT). This is the case for instance with applications (e.g. mobile payments) relying upon Naratte's Zoosh™ solution that enables users to securely exchange data between devices using the speakers and microphones found on most devices. Other similar applications can be found for instance with Tagtile or Tagpay offering a secured payment solution.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Nevertheless, leaving to the user the entire control of the transmission has some issues as the user may trigger the transmission too early or too late. Indeed, the user may not know what the best to start the transmission is. He may be able to control the distance between devices, but could possibly start the transmission process through e.g. clicking on the button too early or too late. The former case may result in the transmission time-off or prolonged transmission time; while the latter case will keep both sides waiting for extra time without any data being transmitted.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">An illustration of how significant the start of transmission may be is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref>. Two electronic devices are used for the transmission of data, a sender and a receiver. The transmission of data in the here after application will be a carrier wave transmission (wave transmission in short), this may be for instance a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> radio-wave transmission, an electromagnetic wave transmission or a sound wave transmission.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A user device, i.e. the transmitter or sender, runs an application to convert data to carrier waves (electromagnetic or air) that are transmitted to a proximate receiver, for instance an Infra Red (IR) or sound wave reader. In the graph of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref>, the X axis represents time in the transmission process while the Y axis shows the distance between the two devices, d0 being the initial distance. We assume here that the ideal transmission distance between devices is d 1. The user in the present case will move his user device towards the reader and starts the transmission when sufficiently close according to his own judgment, d2 in the present case. Taking into account the human nature of the movement, where the speed of movement reduces over time until position d1 is reached, a asymptotic curve line can be drawn roughly as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref>, with user device stops the user device motion at d1 from the reader device. t1 is the ideal transmission time when the ideal transmission distance d1 is first reached by the user.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In existing solutions, a user may, on the one hand, start the transmission at any point between 0 and t1 (starting time) while the distance between devices can be any value between d0 (starting position) and d1 (ideal distance). Therefore, we could assume that when the distance of two devices is d2 (chosen as an intermediate distance between d0 and d1), at time t2, the user will start the transmission. However, the reader device would not receive the transmission until the emitting device keeps moving to the idea position indicated by d 1. Therefore, during Δt12 (difference of time between t1 and t2), even if the user triggers the transmission with his user device, the reader receives nothing.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">On the other hand, the user device may reach d1 ideal position before user starts transmission at a time t3, after the ideal time t1. During Δt13 (difference of time between t3 and t1), since nothing is transmitted from user device, nothing will be received by receiving device.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The here above prior techniques still rely heavily upon the user control and activation of the transmission, leaving room to an unreliable transmission.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">There is still a need today to ensure further control over the transmission of data using carrier waves to as to compensate for the user poor estimate of the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> best transmission time. There is a further need to ensure the best transmission window for the transmitting device.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT SYSTEM:</b></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is an object of the present system to overcome disadvantages and/or make improvements in the prior art.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The present system relates to a mobile device for transmitting data through wave transmission according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The mobile device of the present system relies upon the Applicant's observation that the user will intuitively estimate the ideal distance for transmission between his mobile device and a reader, recipient of the transmission. As a direct consequence he will reduce his speed as he approaches the reader device, and will stop the motion when at a relatively short distance in front of the reader. He may activate at some point during the approach (e.g. at the start, midway or right when stopping) the data transmission that will only be transferred when the mobile device monitored motion is sufficiently low, i.e. below a predefined threshold. Thus thanks to the present mobile device, the data transmission is decorrelated from the transmission activation, for instance at the user request.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The present system also relates to a method according to claim 6 and a computer program according to claim 8.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:</b></heading><p id="p0019" num="0019"><ul><li>The invention is explained in further detail, and by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein:

GUIs are typically used to render visual and textual images which describe various visual metaphors of an operating system, an application, etc., and implemented on a processor/computer including rendering on a display device. Furthermore, GUIs can represent programs, files and operational functions with graphical images, objects, or vector representations. The graphical images can include windows, fields, dialog boxes, menus, icons, buttons, cursors, scroll bars, maps, etc. Such images can be arranged in predefined layouts, or can be created dynamically (by the device itself or by a web-based server) to serve the specific actions being taken by a user. In general, the user can select and/or activate various graphical images in order to initiate functions and tasks, i.e. controls, associated therewith. By way of example, a user<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> can select a button that opens, closes, minimizes, or maximizes a window, or an icon that launches a particular program. By way of another example, the GUI may present a typical user interface including a windowing environment and as such, may include menu items, pull-down menu items, pop-up windows, etc., that are typical of those provided in a windowing environment, such as may be represented within a Windows™ Operating System GUI as provided by Microsoft Corporation and/or an OS X™ Operating System GUI, such as provided on an iPhone™, MacBook™, iMac™, etc., as provided by Apple, Inc., and/or another operating system.

The wave transmission will also be referred to as a transmission trough/using carrier waves. A carrier wave or carrier is a waveform (usually sinusoidal) that is modulated (modified) with an input signal for the purpose of conveying information. The purpose of the carrier is usually either to transmit the information through space as an electromagnetic wave (as in radio communication), or to allow several carriers at different frequencies to share a common physical transmission medium by frequency division multiplexing.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In the present system, the user interaction with and manipulation of the application program rendered on a GUI is achieved using:
