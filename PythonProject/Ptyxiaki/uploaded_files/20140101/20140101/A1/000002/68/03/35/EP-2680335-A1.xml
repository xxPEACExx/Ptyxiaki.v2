a metallized layer 8 disposed on a side surface of the stacked body 7, the metallized layer 8 being electrically connected to the internal electrodes 5; an external electrode member 12 disposed, through an electrically-conductive adhesive layer 10, on the metallized layer 8; and a lead member 14 bonded to the external electrode member 12.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The stacked body 7 constituting the multi-layer piezoelectric element 1 includes an active section in which the piezoelectric layers 3 and the internal electrodes 5 are alternately laminated, and an inactive<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> section formed of the piezoelectric layers 3 and provided at each end of the active section in a stacking direction of the stacked body, and, the stacked body 7 has a rectangular parallelepiped form which is, for example, 0.5 to 10 mm in length, 0.5 to 10 mm in width, and 1 to 100 mm in height.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The piezoelectric layer 3 constituting the stacked body 7 is made of ceramics having piezoelectric property, and, as such a ceramics, for example, a perovskite-type oxide made of lead zirconate titanate (PbZrO<sub>3</sub>-PbTiO<sub>3</sub>), lithium niobate (LiNbO<sub>3</sub>), and lithium tantalate (LiTaO<sub>3</sub>) can be used. The piezoelectric layer 3 has a thickness in a range of 3 to 250 µm, for example.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The internal electrodes 5 constituting the stacked body 7, which are formed by means of co-firing together with the ceramics constituting the piezoelectric layers 3, are stacked in alternate relation to the piezoelectric layers 3 in a manner such that one piezoelectric layer 3 is sandwiched between upper-located and lower-located internal electrodes 5, and in which positive electrodes and negative electrodes are arranged according to the stacking order, so that a driving voltage can be applied to the piezoelectric layer 3 sandwiched between the positive and negative electrodes. As the material of construction of the internal electrodes, for example, a<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> conductor composed predominantly of a silver-palladium alloy whose reactivity with piezoelectric ceramics is low, or a conductor containing copper, platinum, or the like can be used. In the case shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the positive electrodes and the negative (or grounding) electrodes are led out to opposed side surfaces, taken as a pair, of the stacked body 7 in a staggered arrangement so as to be electrically connected to a pair of metallized layers 8 disposed on the side surface of the stacked body 7. The internal electrode 5 has a thickness in a range of 0.1 to 5 µm, for example.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The paired metallized layers 8 disposed on the side surface of the stacked body 7 for electrical connection with the internal electrode 5 are formed for example by application of a paste made of silver and glass with subsequent baking treatment, and more specifically they are bonded to the side surface of the stacked body 7 so as to be electrically connected to the internal electrodes 3 led out to the opposed side surfaces of the stacked body 7 in a staggered arrangement. The metallized layer 8 has a thickness in a range of 5 to 500 µm, for example.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">On the metallized layer 8 is disposed the external electrode member 12 through the electrically-conductive adhesive layer 10. In contrast to the conventional multi-layer piezoelectric element in which the lead member is<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> bonded directly to the metallized layer by the electrically-conductive adhesive, in the multi-layer piezoelectric element 1 of the invention, the external electrode member 12 which is large enough to cover the metallized layer 8 is bonded with use of the electrically-conductive adhesive layer 10.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">That is, the electrically-conductive adhesive layer 10 is configured to have an area larger than that of the conventional electrically-conductive adhesive. Accordingly, a stress acting on the metallized layer 8 can be dispersed more effectively than can be done in the conventional case, wherefore development of a crack from the lead-member 14 junction to the stacked body 7 can be restrained.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Exemplary of the electrically-conductive adhesive layer 10 employed herein is a layer made of epoxy resin or polyimide resin containing highly electrically conductive metal powder such as Ag powder or Cu powder. The layer made of such a material is capable of stress relaxation by virtue of its elastic property, and is thus conducive to long-term driving. The electrically-conductive adhesive layer 10 has a thickness in a range of 5 to 500 µm, for example.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Moreover, the external electrode member 12 is a plate-like or metallic mesh-like member made of a metal<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> such as copper, iron, stainless steel, or phosphor bronze, that is larger in width than the lead member 14, and more specifically it has a width in a range of 0.5 to 10 mm and a thickness in a range of 0.01 to 1.0 mm, for example. The external electrode member 12 may be plated with tin or silver to improve the electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Moreover, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, it is preferable that the external electrode member 12 extends outwardly beyond the end surface of the electrically-conductive adhesive layer 10 in the stacking direction, and that the junction between the external electrode member 12 and the lead member 14 is located outside the end surface of the electrically-conductive adhesive layer 10. According to this configuration, since the lead member 14 is bonded to that part of the external electrode member 12 which is not secured by the electrically-conductive adhesive layer 10; that is, a free region of the external electrode member 12, it follows that, even if the lead member 14 moves, a resultant stress will not be applied directly to the stacked body 7, wherefore the multi-layer piezoelectric element 1 can be driven without causing cracking for a longer period of time.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, it is preferable that the external electrode member 12 extends outwardly<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> beyond the end surface of the stacked body 7 in the stacking direction, and that the junction between the external electrode member 12 and the lead member 14 is located outside the end surface of the stacked body 7. According to this configuration, it is possible to suppress application of a stress arising from the movement of the lead member 14 to the stacked body 7 more effectively than can be done in the case shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, and thereby drive the multi-layer piezoelectric element 1 for an even longer period of time. In the case of using the multi-layer piezoelectric element 1 for automotive applications in particular, although there is the risk of resonance of the multi-layer piezoelectric element 1 with ambient vibration, by placing the junction between the external electrode member 12 and the lead member 14 in a location outside the end surface of the stacked body 7, since the lead member 14 serves as an anti-vibration weight, it is possible to prevent occurrence of resonance and thereby drive the multi-layer piezoelectric element 1 with stability for an even longer period of time.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The multi-layer piezoelectric element 1 includes the lead member 14 bonded to the external electrode member 12. The lead member 14 is intended to establish connection between the external electrode member 12 and an external circuit, and exemplary of the lead member 14 is a pin made<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> of copper, iron, stainless steel, phosphor bronze, or the like.

Then, after application of DC voltage of 160 V to the multi-layer piezoelectric elements, a displacement of 30 µm was obtained in the stacking direction of the stacked body.<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --></p><p id="p0083" num="0083">Moreover, in order to test the durability of each of the multi-layer piezoelectric elements, they have been driven continuously on a 1 × 10<sup>8</sup>-cycle basis under application of AC voltage ranging from 0 V to +160 V at a frequency of 150 Hz.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">The test result showed that the multi-layer piezoelectric element of the example of the invention (Sample No. 1 and Sample No. 2) was free from cracking at the junction between the stacked body and the lead member even after continuous driving on a 1 × 10<sup>8</sup>-cycle basis.
