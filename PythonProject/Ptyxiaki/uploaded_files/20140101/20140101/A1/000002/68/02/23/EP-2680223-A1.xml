Patent literature 1 discloses an image matching device that includes a following feature point arrangement matching function. Note that patent literature 1 calculates a coordinate sequence of ordered feature points as a feature point arrangement.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">This function is, in principle, composed of a registration image invariant calculation module, a search image invariant calculation module, and an invariant match evaluation module. The registration image invariant calculation module calculates an invariant from a feature point arrangement calculated from a registration image. The search image invariant calculation module calculates an invariant from a feature point arrangement of a search image. The feature point arrangement matching<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> function with such a configuration is, in principle, realizes matching of the feature point arrangements in the following operation. First, a feature vector is calculated in advance from a position coordinate of the feature point included in the feature point arrangement of the registration image in a registration process. Next, a feature vector is calculated from a position coordinate of the feature point included in the feature point arrangement of the search image in a search process. Subsequently, degree of similarity is calculated between the feature vector obtained in the registration process and the feature vector obtained in the search process. Then, the feature point arrangements are matched by evaluating whether the degree of similarity is within a predetermined range.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">An image matching device disclosed in patent literature 1 includes a projective affine parameter estimation module, a partial region projective module, a projective image matching module, and an image matching result calculation module. The projective affine parameter estimation module includes three modules that make up the feature point arrangement matching function. This image matching device calculates a geometric transformation parameter from a pair of feature point arrangements in which a pair of feature vectors that are evaluated as a match is calculated in two images to be matched. The image matching device, using the calculated geometric transformation parameter, projects one of the images on the other for each partial region, matches the image for each partial region, integrates matching results for the partial regions, and obtains a final image matching result.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In regard to a generation method of the feature point arrangement, there are other known methods than the one disclosed in patent literature 1. For example, a document image feature quantity generation device disclosed in patent literature 2 can be used.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Further, an image matching device disclosed in patent literature 3 includes a following feature point group matching function. Note that<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the present invention distinguishes between a feature point group and a feature point arrangement. The term feature point group simply indicates a set of feature points. When the feature points belonging to the feature point group are ordered, the ordered feature point group shall be referred to as the feature point arrangement.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">This function is, in principle, composed of two image feature data group generation units and a matching unit. The two image feature data group generation units calculate, from a basic image and a sample image, a pair of two-dimensional vector (V) and a two-dimensional pixel position (R) for a scan point. The two-dimensional vector (V) is a spatial gradient of the average luminance around the scan point that satisfies a predetermined condition in the image. The matching unit, using a relationship between the two-dimensional vector (V) and the two-dimensional pixel position (R) that are calculated respectively by the two image feature data group generation units, performs a voting process to set a high voting value to a particular pixel value when the feature point groups are correctly associated. This feature point group matching function realizes the process of matching the feature point groups by the two image feature data groups calculating the two-dimensional vector (V) and the two-dimensional pixel position (R), and then the operation by the matching unit.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the technique disclosed by patent literature 3, voting is performed based on the relationship between the two-dimensional vector and the two-dimensional pixel position. Therefore, it is considered to be the technique effective in the case in which the two images to be voted for move in parallel to each other, rotate, or are in a relationship in combination thereof. However, this technique is not suitable, in principle, to the case in which the two images to be voted for are in a relationship of the two-dimensional affine transformation or projective transformation (any transformation that projects a plane on a plane) to each other.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> An image matching method disclosed in patent literature 4 calculates the degree of similarity in image matching. This image matching method estimates a geometric transformation parameter based on a matching result for each local region using information of a pair of corresponding local regions. Next, the image matching method corrects the position based on the estimated geometric transformation parameter, performs a relative position voting process, and calculates the degree of similarity in image matching. In the image matching method, local regions are associated instead of feature points as a result of matching. This image matching method can be applied to images, in principle, even when the image is affine transformed or projective transformed as long as the association between the local regions can be obtained appropriately. However, while the image is affine transformed or the projective transformed, the larger the size of the local region, the more the matching accuracy of the local regions deteriorates. Therefore, accuracy in matching the resultant images is considered to deteriorate as well.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Citation List</b></heading><heading id="h0004"><b>Patent Literature</b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010"><ul><li>Patent literature 1: International Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2010053109A"><text>WO 2010/053109</text></patcit></li><li>Patent literature 2: International Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2008066152A"><text>WO 2008/066152</text></patcit></li><li>Patent literature 3: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2005228150A"><text>2005-228150</text></patcit></li><li>Patent literature 4: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2001092963A"><text>2001-092963</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b>Summary of Invention</b></heading><heading id="h0006"><b>Technical Problem</b></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">There is a problem in the techniques explained in background that it is difficult to match feature point groups or feature point arrangements with high accuracy when one of two images that are originally the same is deformed by the geometric transformation with greater flexibility such as<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the affine transformation and projective transformation in a two-dimensional plane.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The reason for this is that the abovementioned matching of the feature point groups or the feature point arrangements adopts the method (method disclosed in patent literature 3) that is susceptible, in terms of accuracy deterioration, to the geometric transformation with greater flexibility such as the two-dimensional affine transformation and the two-dimensional projective transformation or the method (method disclosed in patent literature 1) that uses only positions of the feature points in the feature point arrangements.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The problem in patent literature 1 is explained in more detail using <figref idrefs="f0012">Figs. 12</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0013">13</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 12</figref> shows two different kinds of images. <figref idrefs="f0013">Fig. 13</figref> is a conceptual diagram for explaining a state of extracting feature points from each of the two different kinds of images shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 12</figref>.

Moreover, the ordered feature point group shall be referred to as a feature point arrangement. That is, the feature point arrangement is information indicating the position coordinates, the pixel values, and the order of the feature points. The feature point numbering means R12 outputs the first feature point arrangement to the feature calculation means R131. Further, the feature point may be any point as long as it is an point on the image indicating feature of the image.

Similarly, the feature calculation means R131 and the feature calculation means Q131 have the same configuration and execute the same operation. However, in the case, for example, when the nature of images from which the feature points have been extracted is different, either the configuration or operation may be changed in at least one of the feature point numbering means R12 and the feature point numbering means Q12 or at least one of the feature calculation means R131 and the feature calculation means Q131.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In the following explanation, unless otherwise noted, the feature point numbering means R12 and the feature point numbering means Q12 have the same configurations, and the feature calculation means R131 and the feature calculation means Q131 have the same configurations.

In this example, n is any positive integer.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">(A) First, select m points near the target point from the feature<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> point group. In this example, m is any positive integer. For example, m is any number less than n.

(C) Search for m-1 feature points clockwise about the target point from the position of the first feature point and select the second to mth feature points in the searched order. The method of ordering is not necessarily limited to this method. In these processes, one point provided in advance from the n feature points may be the target point, or the above processes may be repeated until all the n points are used as the target point. For example, in (C), the feature point arrangement is composed of the neighboring m feature points, but the feature point arrangement may be composed of m+1 feature points including the target point.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The feature point numbering means Q12 calculates the second feature point arrangement from the second feature point group in a similar manner as the feature point numbering means R12. A relationship between n and m is explained with reference to a specific example. As an example, all feature points included in one image shall be a feature point group (the number of feature points is n) where m+1 &lt;n, and every m or m+1 feature points of the input feature point group may compose the feature point arrangement. As another example, the feature points for the number corresponding to the feature point arrangement among all feature points included in one image may be the feature point group (the number of feature points is n) where m+1=n, and m or m+1 feature points may compose the feature point arrangement.

The position feature calculation means R1311 calculates the feature quantity based on the positions of the feature points of the first feature point arrangement. For example, as disclosed in patent literature 2, the position feature calculation means R1311 may calculate, as the position feature quantity, a feature vector with the geometric transformation invariant as an element that is calculated based on the coordinate of the feature point. Specifically, the position feature calculation means R1311 calculates the feature vector by calculating the invariant from the coordinate of the selected feature point for each of a plurality of possible combinations when selecting the predetermined number of feature points from the m feature points in conformity to the abovementioned order. That is, the position feature quantity is information (feature vector) including arranged geometric invariants that are calculated according to the abovementioned order. The position feature quantity here is not limited to such a feature vector. For example, a combination of the position coordinates belonging to the feature point arrangement may be the position feature quantity.

Moreover, a value calculated based on the coordinate values of the points in the color space, for example, values obtained by normalizing the component of the feature quantity by an appropriate width may be used. The pixel value feature quantity is, for example, information including the pixel values of the feature points arranged in the abovementioned order. That is, the pixel value is, for example, the luminance value, the coordinate value in the color space and the like. When the coordinate value of the feature point is not an integer value and the pixel value cannot be obtained directly, it is possible to use the pixel value of the feature point that is estimated, using a known method, from the coordinates and pixel values of the points with defined pixel values around the feature point and a positional relationship between those points and the feature point. For example, as the known method, linear interpolation can be employed, but it is not limited to this.

First, background for explaining this exemplary embodiment is stated. For example, in the case of carrying out the second exemplary embodiment of the present invention, consider a case in which there are p1 first feature point arrangements and p2 second feature point arrangements to be matched, and an evaluation is made whether or not there are matches in all combinations of the first feature point arrangements and the second feature point arrangements. In this example, p1 and p2 are any positive integers. In this case, matching evaluation for at least one of the position feature quantities and the pixel value feature quantities shall be always performed for p1×p2 times. For example, in the case of matching as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, matching of at least the pixel value features is performed for p1×p2 times. The same holds true for the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The third exemplary embodiment realizes faster processes as a whole by reducing the number of matching evaluation for the position feature quantities and the pixel value feature quantities.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">Next, a configuration, an operation, and an exemplary advantage peculiar to this exemplary embodiment are explained in detail with reference to the drawings for the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Since this exemplary embodiment is common to the second exemplary embodiment of the present invention in many points, only the differences are explained.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074"><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> is a diagram for explaining the configuration of the third<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>, a difference from the second exemplary embodiment of the present invention is that feature storage means R333 is included.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">Although the feature storage means R333 is typically mounted inside the storage medium 8, it is not limited to this. As for the feature storage means R333, the position feature quantity calculated by the position feature calculation means R1311 is stored based on the value of the pixel value feature quantity calculated by the pixel value feature calculation means R2312. <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref> is a diagram for explaining an example of a state in which the position feature quantities are stored. Note that in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>, the position feature quantity is represented by "p.f.q". This example shows a state from an initial state in which no position feature quantity is stored to the storage of the position feature quantities in a list with the pixel feature quantities as indices and the position feature quantities as elements. In <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>, "p" represents a pointer to a next element, and "E" is a pointer indicating an end. A method of storing the position feature quantities in this way is described later in the explanation of the operation.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Next, an operation according to the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention is explained. The operation of this exemplary embodiment is composed of a registration process SR3 and a search process SQ3. The registration process SR3 calculates in advance the first position feature quantities and the first pixel value feature quantities for all the first feature point arrangements and stores the first position feature quantities to the feature storage means R333. The search process SQ3 calculates the second position feature quantity and the second pixel value feature quantity for the second feature point arrangement. Then, the search process SQ3 matches the calculated second pixel value feature quantity and the first pixel value feature quantity stored to the feature storage means R333 so as to match the first feature arrangement and the second feature arrangement. Hereinafter, the registration process SR3 and the search process SQ3 are explained in<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> detail.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077"><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref> is a flowchart for explaining an operation of the registration process SR3. First, the feature calculation means R231 calculates the first feature set (the first position feature quantity and the first pixel value feature quantity) for one of p1 first feature point arrangements (step SR301).</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Next, the feature calculation means R231 stores the calculated first position feature quantity to the feature storage means R333 (step SR302). The first position feature quantity at this time is connected to the end of the list with the calculated first pixel value feature quantity as an index. That is, following steps SR3021 to SR3023 should be executed in order in the step SR302. Note that the processes from the steps SR3021 to SR3023 are not shown.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">First, the feature calculation means R231 finds the end of the list with the calculated first pixel value feature quantity as an index (step SR3021). The feature calculation means R231 adds the first position feature quantity to the end of the list (step SR3022). The feature calculation means R231 adds a pointer indicating an end to the element (step SR3023). The feature calculation means R231 further updates the pointer of the element that is previous to the added element to_a pointer to the newly added element. When the step SR302 is completed, the feature calculation means R231 evaluates whether or not the calculation of the feature quantities has completed for all the first feature point arrangements (step SR303). When the calculation of the feature quantities has completed for all the feature point arrangements, the feature calculation means R231 ends the registration process SR3. Otherwise, the feature calculation means R231 performs the processes from the steps SR301 to SR303 for the first feature point arrangement in which the first position feature quantity has not been stored yet.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">Next, an operation of the search process SQ3 is explained. <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig.<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> 10</figref> is a flowchart for explaining the operation of the search process SQ3. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10</figref>, first the feature calculation means Q231 calculates the second feature set (the second position feature quantity and the second pixel value feature quantity) for one of p2 second feature point arrangements (step SQ301). Next, the feature calculation means Q231 stores the calculated second position feature quantity to the feature matching means 132.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Subsequently, the pixel value feature matching means 1322 searches in the list stored to the feature storage means R333 for the index of the first pixel feature quantity that matches the second pixel value feature quantity included in the second feature set output from the feature calculation means Q231. When the pixel value feature matching means 1322 detects the index that matches the second pixel value feature quantity, the pixel value feature matching means 1322 outputs the detected index to the position feature matching means 1321. Further, in this case, when the pointer to a first element in the list with the detected index is not an end, the pixel value feature matching means 1322 outputs an evaluation result indicating a match in the pixel value feature quantities to the feature point arrangement matching means 1323. On the contrary, when the pointer to the first element in the list with the detected index is an end, the pixel value feature matching means 1322 outputs the evaluation result indicating a mismatch in the pixel value feature quantities to the feature point arrangement matching means 1323. This is because that when the first position feature quantity is not stored to the list, it means that the first feature point arrangement does not exist for which the first pixel value feature quantity to be an index of the list is calculated.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">The position feature matching means 1321 obtains the pointer to the first element in the list with the index output from the pixel value feature matching means 1322 and uses obtained pointer to the first element as the pointer to the next element (step SQ302).</p><p id="p0083" num="0083"><!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> Next, the position feature matching means 1321 evaluates whether the obtained pointer to the next element is an end (step SQ303). When the pointer to the next element is an end, the position feature matching means 1321 ends searching in the list and performs the process of the step SQ305. Otherwise, the position feature matching means 1321 performs the process of the step SQ304.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">In the process of the step SQ304, the position feature matching means 1321 matches the first position feature quantity stored to the next element and the second position feature quantity included in the second feature set that is output from the feature calculation means Q231 and outputs an evaluation result to the feature point arrangement matching means 1323. Next, the position feature matching means 1321 obtains the pointer added to the matched first feature quantity as the pointer to the next element. Then, the position feature matching means 1321 performs the process of the step SQ303 again.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">The step SQ305 evaluates whether or not matching is completed for all the second feature point arrangements. When matching is completed for all the second feature point arrangements, the search process SQ3 ends. When the matching is not completed for all the second feature point arrangements, the process of SQ301 is performed for the second feature point arrangement that has not been matched yet. That is, the feature matching means 132 obtains from the feature calculation means Q231 the second feature set calculated from the second feature point arrangement which has not been matched and continues the search process SQ3.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Next, an exemplary advantage of this exemplary embodiment is explained. This exemplary embodiment has a configuration in which, in the registration process, the position features are categorized based on the indices and stored, and in the search process, only the position feature quantity of the feature set with the index matching with the pixel value feature quantity is matched, so as to match the feature point arrangements.<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> This enables faster matching than the first and second exemplary embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">More specifically, in the second exemplary embodiment, matching evaluation for the position feature quantities and the pixel value feature quantities is performed for; the number of the first feature point arrangements p1 × the number of the second feature point arrangements p2. However, in the third exemplary embodiment, the number of matching evaluation for the pixel value feature quantities is only the number of comparison until the index with the matching pixel value feature quantity is detected, and the number of matching evaluation for the position feature quantities is only the number of elements included in the detected index. This enables reduction in the number of matching evaluation for the pixel value feature quantities and the position feature quantities. The greater the number of the first feature point arrangements and the number of the second feature point arrangements, the greater the reduction in the number of matching evaluation.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">Although in the third exemplary embodiment, the position feature quantities are categorized based on the values of the pixel value feature quantities, the pixel value feature quantities may be categorized based on the values of the position feature quantities. Moreover, upon mounting, in the storage medium 8, when the position feature quantity is already stored to the storage medium 8, the list may be composed using the pointer to a position feature storage region in the storage medium 8.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">Further, also in the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention in a similar manner as the first exemplary embodiment, when the second pixel value feature quantity and the first pixel value feature quantity to be the index substantially match, an evaluation may be made that there is a match in the pixel value feature quantities. That is, the pixel value feature matching means 1322 may detect the index of the first pixel value feature quantity that substantially matches the second pixel value feature quantity from the list stored to the feature storage means<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> R333. Moreover, also for the position feature quantity, when the first position feature quantity substantially matches the second position feature quantity, an evaluation may be made that there is a match in the position feature quantities.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">Additionally, although the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention illustrated the case of using the pixel value feature quantity obtained by binarizing the pixel value as the index of the list, it is not limited to this. For example, a pixel value feature quantity obtained by converting the pixel value into a plurality of values other than binary may be used as the index or a pixel value feature quantity with the pixel value not converted into a plurality of values may be used as the index.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">The feature point arrangement matching device 13 of each exemplary embodiment described above can be used as one function in the image matching device.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">This is because that as described in background, there has been a technique that includes the feature point arrangement function as one function in the image matching device. For example, it is obvious that the feature point arrangement function can be used as one function in the image matching device, as disclosed in patent literature 1.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">For example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 11</figref>, the image matching device can be configured including the feature arrangement matching device 13 according to this exemplary embodiment. This image matching device includes feature point extraction means 12, the feature point arrangement matching device 13 according to this exemplary embodiment, and an image matching means 14.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">The image matching device supplies the feature point extraction means 12 with a first image and a second image to match the first image and the second image. The feature point extraction means 12 extracts<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> feature points from the first image and calculates a first feature point group. The feature point extraction means 12 further extracts feature points from the second image and calculates a second feature point group. The feature point extraction means 12 outputs the calculated first feature point group and the calculated second feature point group to the feature point arrangement matching device 13.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">The image matching means 14 matches the first image and second image based on the feature point arrangement matching result output from the feature point arrangement matching device 13. Specifically, when the feature point arrangement matching result indicates a match in the first feature point arrangement and the second feature point arrangement, the image matching means 14 estimates a content of geometric transformation between the first image and the second image based on the first feature point arrangement and the second feature point arrangement. The first feature point arrangement and the second feature point arrangement used for estimating the content of the geometric transformation are, for example, output from the feature point arrangement matching device 13 to the image matching means 14. The content of geometric transformation is, for example, a geometric transformation parameter in a mathematical expression used to transform the first image and the second image mutually. The image matching means 14 matches the first image and second image based on the estimated content of geometric transformation.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">Specifically, to match the images, the image matching means 14 projects any first region included in the first image on the second image based on the content of geometric transformation. That is, the image matching means 14 identifies a second region corresponding to the first region included in the first image. The image matching means 14 calculates the feature quantity of the first region and the feature quantity of the second region and compares the feature quantity of the first region and the feature quantity of the second region so as to evaluate whether or not there is a match in the first image and the second image. At the time<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> of calculating the feature quantity of the second region, it is preferable to deform the image specified by the second region to be the same shape as the first region based on the content of geometric transformation before calculating the feature quantity of the second region. The feature quantity of the region may be any value as long as it is a value describing a feature of the region. The feature quantity of the region may be, for example as disclosed in patent literature 1, a proportion of non-background pixels or a value obtained by dividing a sum of the pixel values in the partial region by a region area.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">This realizes the image matching device that is robust against the geometric transformation such as the affine transformation and the projective transformation.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">The reason is as follows. For example, the unit of matching is a local region in the method disclosed in patent literature 4. However, the features extracted from the local region are susceptible to the affine transformation and the projective transformation. In other words, the features extracted from the local region in the first image tend to differ from the features extracted from the local region in the second image. Therefore, matching local regions is susceptible to the affine transformation and the projective transformation.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">Meanwhile, the feature point arrangement matching device according to the abovementioned exemplary embodiments of the present invention uses the pixel values at the plurality of feature point positions belonging to the feature point arrangement for matching the feature point arrangements. The pixel value of a certain target point in the first image ideally matches the pixel value of a point in the second image corresponding to the target point in the first image.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">For example, the image matching device disclosed in patent literature 1 calculates the geometric transformation parameter based on the feature point arrangement matching result and projects and matches<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> the images using the calculated geometric transformation parameter for each partial region. Therefore, applying the feature point arrangement matching device 13 of this exemplary embodiment enables the image matching to be robust against the affine transformation and the projective transformation.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">Matching the centroid point of a connected region as the feature point is preferable in matching string images. This is because that in the string image, it is easy to calculate the connected region. Since the centroid point is essentially shifted by the projective transformation, there is fear that matching accuracy is adversely affected. However, characters have various shapes. For example, as with H and O shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 12</figref>, there are characters with the pixel values at centroid coordinates that can likely be the color of the shape (character) and the pixel values at centroid coordinates that can likely be the background color. Therefore, when the string image with a single-color background is subject to be matched and the centroid is used as a feature point in the matching, it is unlikely that the image is complicated enough to cause a large change in the pixel value by a slight shift of the centroid due to the projective transformation.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">The explanation above has been presented with an example of incorporating various means in the form of software in the abovementioned exemplary embodiments illustrating the feature point arrangement matching device and the image matching device. However, it is also possible to configure a part or all of the means by hardware.</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">The present invention can be applied to uses such as an information search device that searches for the same or similar image as the search image from images that are stored previously to a database.
