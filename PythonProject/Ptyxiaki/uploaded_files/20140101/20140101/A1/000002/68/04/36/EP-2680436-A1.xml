This can significantly affect the travel performance or travel safety.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">An electric vehicle may include a drive system which may be in the form of an in-wheel motor drive system. The components of an in-wheel motor drive system may include a wheel bearing, a reducer and a motor. Reliability of a motor, a wheel bearing and a reducer is an urgent concern for such an in-wheel motor drive system which, due to its smaller size, involves rapid rotation of the motor, and etc.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the past, in the attempt to ensure such reliability, an in-wheel motor drive system has been proposed in which the temperature of components such as a wheel bearing, a reducer and a motor may be measured and monitored for overload, with features to limit a drive current in/to the motor or a rotational frequency of the motor according to the temperature measurements (see the Patent Document 1 listed below).

However, control based on temperature measurements may not provide a solution to a situation where there is a failure of torque control that may be caused by a damage to a sensor that senses a motor current.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide an electric vehicle which enables appropriate measures or actions to be quickly taken when there is a failure of torque control of a motor unit. The general aspects of the present invention will now be described using the reference signs in the figures showing embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention may provide an electric vehicle which includes a motor unit 6 configured to drive a wheel 2. The electric vehicle also includes an ECU 21 which is an electronic control unit configured to perform general control of the vehicle. The electric vehicle also includes an inverter unit 22. The inverter unit 22 includes a power circuitry 28 including an inverter 31 configured to convert a DC power into an AC power used to drive the motor unit 6. The inverter unit 22 also includes a motor control circuitry 29 configured to control at least the power circuitry 28 in accordance with control from the ECU 21. The ECU 21 is configured to send to the inverter unit 22 a torque command value that causes the motor unit 6 to be driven. The motor control circuitry 29 of the inverter unit 22 is operable to perform torque control. The electric vehicle also includes a rotational frequency controller 37 operable to perform rotational frequency control. The motor control circuitry 29 includes the rotational frequency controller 37. The electric vehicle also includes a torque control abnormalities detector 38 configured to detect an abnormality of torque control performed by the motor control circuitry 29. The electric vehicle also includes a control mode switcher 39 configured to, in response to determination<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> by the torque control abnormalities detector 38 that there is an abnormality of torque control, cause the motor control circuitry 29 to switch from torque control to rotational frequency control performed by the rotational frequency controller 37.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the aforementioned configuration, during a normal operation of the driving of the electric vehicle, the motor control circuitry 29 may perform torque control based on a torque command value that may be produced from the ECU 21. The torque control abnormalities detector 38 may be ready at any time to detect an abnormality of torque control. The control mode switcher 39 may, in response to determination by the torque control abnormalities detector 38 that there is an abnormality of torque control, cause the motor control circuitry 29 to switch from torque control to rotational frequency control performed by the rotational frequency controller 37. In particular, the torque control abnormalities detector 38 may be configured to determine that there is an abnormality of torque control, if there is a failure of torque control due to, for example, a damage to a current sensor 35 configured to sense a motor current. The control mode switcher 39 may, in response to such a determination, cause the motor control circuitry 29 to switch from torque control to rotational frequency control. In this way, appropriate measures or actions can be quickly taken when there is a failure of torque control.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The torque control abnormalities detector 38 may be configured to determine that there is an abnormality of torque control, if a measurement of a motor current for a given torque command value produced from the ECU 21 falls outside a predefined range for the given torque command value. Such a predefined range may be determined in the following procedures:
<ul><li>For example, a measurement of a motor current for a given torque command value that may be produced from the ECU 21 during a normal operation may be obtained in advance through experiments and/or simulations. Such a measurement may be defined as a reference value for the given torque<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> command value. The predefined range for a given torque command value may be determined as a range of possible measurements of a motor current for the given torque command value, outside which there is too much deviation from the reference value to perform proper torque control.</li></ul></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A target value generator 43 may further be provided which is configured to generate a target value, with the target value indicating a rotational frequency of the motor unit that is the latest as of when the motor control circuitry 29 is caused to switch from torque control to rotational frequency control, wherein the rotational frequency controller 37 may be configured to perform feedback control of rotational frequency based on a deviation between the target value and a detection value as derived from a sensor 36 configured to determine rotational frequency of the motor unit. Thus, the rotational frequency controller 37 may perform rotational frequency control in such a way to bring the aforementioned detection value as derived from the sensor 36 closer to the target value. In other words, the rotational frequency controller 37 may controllably adjust rotational frequency of the motor unit to that of the motor unit as measured during a normal operation when torque control is performed.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A drive decrementor 45 may further be provided which is configured to gradually reduce torque or rotational frequency of all of the motor units 6 of the vehicle, after switching from torque control to rotational frequency control performed by the rotational frequency controller 37 is carried out. The drive decrementor 45 may, in response to an abnormality, gradually reduce torque or rotational frequency of the motor units 6, thus allowing a driver to, for example, continue driving the vehicle to some place where the vehicle can be fixed. Then, the electric vehicle may be repaired so as to be ready to perform torque control.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The inverter unit 22 may include an abnormalities notifier 41 configured to send to the ECU 21 a notification of abnormalities of the motor unit 6, if the motor control circuitry 29 is caused to switch from torque control to rotational frequency control. The ECU 21 performs general, integrated control<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> of the vehicle. Thus, by sending to the ECU 21 a notification of abnormalities of torque control if the torque control abnormalities detector 38 detects an abnormality of torque control, the ECU 21 can correspondingly perform an appropriate control of the vehicle in general. Also, the ECU 21 is an upper-level control unit which may send a drive command to the inverter unit 22. Thus, an urgent control performed by the inverter unit 22 may be followed by a more appropriate control of drive which is performed by the ECU 21.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A wheel bearing unit 4 and a reducer unit 7 may further be provided, wherein the motor unit 6, together with the wheel bearing unit 4 and the reducer unit 7, may form an in-wheel motor drive system 8 that is partly or entirely disposed within the wheel 2. Reliability of the wheel bearing unit 4, the reducer unit 7 and the motor unit 6 is an urgent concern for an in-wheel motor drive system 8 which, due to its smaller size, involves rapid rotation of the motor unit 6, and etc. Switching, if there is a failure of torque control of at least one motor unit 6, from torque control to rotational frequency control of the at least one motor unit 6, can prevent abrupt stopping of the driving of the at least one motor unit 6, thus allowing a driver to, for example, continue driving the vehicle to some place where the vehicle can be fixed. Then, the electric vehicle may be repaired so as to be ready to perform torque control.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A reducer unit 7 may be provided which is configured to produce rotation with a speed that is reduced with respect to that of rotation of the motor unit 6, wherein the reducer unit 7 may comprise a cycloidal reducer. Such a configuration in which the reducer unit 7 comprises a cycloidal reducer having, for example, a reduction ration of 1/6 or greater, allows for the provision of a smaller motor unit 6, thus achieving reduction in dimensions of the system or assembly. With such a significant reduction ratio, a smaller motor unit 6 may involve rapid rotation. Even when a failure of torque control of a motor unit 6 occurs during rapid rotation of the motor unit 6, the motor control circuitry 29<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> may be caused to switch from torque control to rotational frequency control, thus preventing problems such as abrupt stopping of the driving of the motor unit 6.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The present invention encompasses any combination of at least two features disclosed in the claims, the specification and/or the drawings. In particular, the present invention encompasses any combination of at least two claims.</p><heading id="h0006">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">In any event, the present invention will become more clearly understood from the following description of embodiments thereof, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The torque controller 40 may be configured to convert a torque command produced from the ECU 21 into a current command. The torque control abnormalities detector 38 may detect an abnormality of torque control performed by the motor control circuitry 29. During a normal operation, the motor control circuitry 29 may cause the torque controller 40 to perform torque control based on a torque command value produced from the ECU 21. The control mode switcher 39 may, if the torque control abnormalities detector 38 determines that there is an abnormality of torque control, cause the motor control circuitry 29 to switch from torque control to rotational frequency control performed by the rotational frequency controller 37.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>, the torque control abnormalities detector 38 may determine that there is an abnormality of torque control, if a measurement of a motor current for a given torque command value produced from the ECU 21 falls outside a predefined range Ea for the given torque command value. Such a "predefined range" Ea may be determined in the following procedures:
<ul><li>For example, a measurement of a motor current for a given torque command value produced from the ECU 21 during a normal operation may be obtained in advance through experiments and/or simulations.

A predefined range Ea that may be determined in this way may be stored in a memory (not shown) in a rewritable manner as a table. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>, the reference value Ka may increase in proportion with the torque command value produced from the ECU 21. A reference value Ka1 may<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> be defined, in one-to-one corresponding relationship, with respect to a given torque command value Tr1. For instance, the torque control abnormalities detector 38 may determine that there is an abnormality of torque control, if a measurement of a motor current for a given torque command value Tr1 produced from the ECU 21 -- greater than a reference value Ka1 for the given torque command value Tr1 -- exceeds the upper deviation limit EH of a predefined range Ea for the given torque command value Tr1.</li></ul></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Similarly, the torque control abnormalities detector 38 may determine that there is an abnormality of torque control, if a measurement of a motor current for a given torque command value Tr1 produced from the ECU 21-lower than a reference value Ka1 for the given torque command value Tr1 -- is below the lower deviation limit EL of a predefined range Ea for the given torque command value Tr1.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Thus, the torque control abnormalities detector 38 may determine that there is an abnormality of torque control, if there is too much deviation of a measurement of a motor current from a reference value Ka for a given torque command value to perform proper torque control.

The rotational frequency controller 37 may perform feedback control of rotational frequency based on a deviation between such a target value as discussed above and a detection value, as derived from the angle sensor 36, indicating rotational frequency of the motor unit. A differentiator 44 may receive an angle sensed by the angle sensor 36 to generate an angular speed.

In the example under discussion, if the motor control circuitry 29 is caused to switch from torque control to rotational frequency control, the rotational frequency control may be performed such that a target value indicates a rotational frequency of the motor unit as measured during a normal operation when torque control is performed. The motor control circuitry 29 may further include a drive decrementor 45.

In particular, the torque control abnormalities detector 38 may be configured to determine that there is an abnormality of torque control, if there is a failure of torque control due to, for example, a damage to the current sensor 35 configured to sense a motor current. The control mode switcher 39 may, in response to such a determination, cause the motor control circuitry 29 to switch from torque control to rotational frequency control.

In this way, the torque control abnormalities detector 38 that may determine if there is an abnormality of torque control is positioned closer to the motor unit 6 than in a configuration where the ECU 21 includes the torque control abnormalities detector 38, thus the former configuration being more advantageous in terms of wire routing. Also, with the former configuration, an appropriate control can be initiated more quickly than with a configuration of the ECU 21 including the torque control abnormalities detector 38, thus promptly avoiding various driving problems. Furthermore, with the former configuration, the load on the ECU 21, whose complexity is increasing hand-in-hand with its sophistication, can be reduced.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The ECU 21 performs general, integrated control of the vehicle.

For instance, the ECU 21 may, if an abnormality occurs in only one of the traction motor units 6, 6 of the illustrated left and right wheels, command the drive decrementor 45 to gradually reduce torque or rotational frequency of both of the traction motor units 6, 6 of the illustrated left and right wheels simultaneously. Also, the ECU 21 is an upper-level control unit which may send a drive command to the inverter unit 22.

To maximize the efficiency of the illustrated motor unit 6, a motor drive controller 33 of a motor control circuitry 29 may be configured to control the timings at which respective phase alternating currents are supplied to the coils 78 of the motor stator 73, based on the rotational angle of the motor rotor 75 relative to the motor stator 73 as sensed by the angle sensor 36.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><p id="p0053" num="0053">A connector 99 may be formed at the motor housing 72 for connection of the wires for a motor current in the in-wheel motor drive system 8, wires for various sensors, wires for various commands, and etc.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The illustrated reducer unit 7 includes a cycloidal reducer as described. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 8</figref>, the cycloidal reducer includes two curvilinear plates 84a, 84b, each having an outer contour defined by a smoothly corrugated trochoidal curve, that are mounted via respective bearings 85 to the eccentric segments 82a, 82b of the rotational input shaft 82. A plurality of outer pins 86 are fitted to the housing 83b to directly or indirectly guide, along the outer peripheries thereof, the eccentric motions of the curvilinear plates 84a and 84b. A plurality of inner pins 88, which are fitted to the inboard member 60 of the inner member 52, are inserted to a plurality of corresponding, round through holes 89 formed in each of the curvilinear plates 84a and 84b, to directly or indirectly engage with the through holes 89. The rotational input shaft 82 is splinedly connected to the rotational output shaft 74 of the motor unit 6 for co-rotation. The rotational input shaft 82 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref> is supported on both sides thereof, via two bearings 90, by an inboard housing 83a and by an inner diameter surface of the inboard member 60 of the inner member 52.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Rotation of the rotational output shaft 74 of the motor unit 6 causes the curvilinear plates 84a, 84b, associated with the rotational input shaft 82 that co-rotates with the rotational output shaft 74, to make eccentric motions. The eccentric motions of the curvilinear plates 84a, 84b are, through the inner pins 88 directly or indirectly engaging with the through holes 89, transmitted in the form of a rotary motion to the inner member 52. The speed of rotation of the inner member 52 is reduced with respect to that of rotation of the rotational output shaft 74. For example, a single-stage reducer unit having such a configuration can achieve a reduction ratio of 1/10 or greater.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The two curvilinear plates 84a, 84b are mounted, 180° out of phase with each other, to the eccentric segments 82a and 82b of the rotational input<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> shaft 82, so that the eccentricity of the motions of the curvilinear plates 84a, 84b can be cancelled. Counterweights 91 associated with the respective eccentric segments 82a, 82b, are each disposed at a side of the corresponding one of the eccentric segments 82a, 82b, in such a way that the counterweights 91 face each other across the eccentric segments 82a, 82b while each of the counterweights 91 being displaced in a direction opposite to the direction of displacement of the corresponding one of the eccentric segments 82a, 82b. In this way, vibrations that may be caused by the curvilinear plates 84a, 84b can be cancelled out.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">As shown on an enlarged scale in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 9</figref>, bearings 92 and bearings 93 may be fitted to the outer pins 86 and the inner pins 88, respectively. The outer rings 92a of the bearings 92 are in rolling contact with the outer peripheries of the curvilinear plates 84a, 84b, while the outer rings 93a of the bearings 93 are in rolling contact with the inner peripheries of the through holes 89. This can minimize the contact friction between the outer pins 86 and the outer peripheries of the curvilinear plates 84a, 84b and the contact friction between the inner pins 88 and the inner peripheries of the through holes 89, thus allowing for smoother transmission of the eccentric motions of the curvilinear plates 84a, 84b in the form of a rotary motion to the inner member 52.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The wheel bearing unit 4 of the in-wheel motor drive system 8 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref> is secured to a vehicle body through the connection between a suspension system (not shown) such as a knuckle and the housing 83b of the reducer unit 7 or an outer periphery of the housing 72 of the motor unit 6.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Although the present invention has been described in connection with preferred embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings which are used only for the purpose of illustration, those skilled in the art will readily conceive numerous changes and modifications within the framework of obviousness upon the reading of the specification herein presented of the present invention.
