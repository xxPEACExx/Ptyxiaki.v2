First embodiment:</heading><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a partially sectional view of a spark plug 100 of a first embodiment. In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the direction of an axis O of the spark plug 100 is the vertical direction of the drawing, the lower side is the leading end side of the spark plug 100, and the upper side is the rear end side.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The spark plug 100 includes: an insulator 10 functioning as an insulating body; a metal shell 50 holding the insulator 10; a center electrode 20 which is held in the insulator 10 in the direction of the axis O; a ground electrode 30 in which a base end portion 32 is welded to the leading end surface 57 of the metal shell 50, and the range from the base end portion 32 to a leading end portion 31 is curved toward a leading end portion 22 of the center electrode 20; and a terminal metal fixture 40 which is disposed at a rear end portion of the insulator 10.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The insulator 10 is formed by firing of alumina or the like as known in the art, and has a tubular shape in which an axial hole 12 extending in the direction of the axis O is formed in the axial center. A flange portion 19 having the largest outer diameter is formed at a substantially middle position in the direction of the axis O, and a rear end trunk portion 18 is formed at the rear end side (the upper side in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) with respect to the flange portion 19. At the leading end side (the lower side in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) with respect to the flange portion 19, a leading end trunk portion 17 having an outer diameter which is smaller than that of the rear end trunk portion 18 is formed, and at the leading end side with respect to the leading end trunk portion 17, an insulator nose portion 13 having an outer diameter which is smaller than that of the leading end trunk portion 17 is formed. The more away toward the leading end side, the more reduced the outer diameter of the insulator nose portion 13<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> is, and when the spark plug 100 is attached to an engine head 200 of an internal combustion engine, the insulator nose portion is exposed to a combustion chamber of the engine. A step 15 is formed between the insulator nose portion 13 and the leading end trunk portion 17.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The center electrode 20 is a rod-like electrode having a structure in which a core member 25 is embedded in an electrode base member 21 formed by nickel or a nickel-based alloy such as Inconel (trademark) 600 or 601. The core member 25 is made of copper or copper-based alloy which is superior in thermal conductivity than the electrode base member 21. Usually, the center electrode 20 is produced by filling the core member 25 into the electrode base member 21 which is formed in a bottomed cylindrical shape, and performing an extrusion molding process starting from the bottom side to extend the shape. The core member 25 has a substantially constant outer diameter at the trunk portion, but is formed in a shape that a diameter of the core member 25 is reduced towards the leading end side.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The leading end portion 22 of the center electrode 20 projects from the leading end portion of the insulator 10, and is formed so as to be further reduced in diameter toward the leading end. In order to improve the spark consumption resistance, a center electrode tip 70 which is made of a high melting noble metal, and which has a substantially cylindrical shape is joined to the leading end surface of the leading end portion 22 of the center electrode 20. For example, the center electrode tip 70 may be formed by iridium (Ir) or an Ir alloy which essentially consists of Ir, and to which one or two or more of platinum (Pt), rhodium (Rh), ruthenium (Ru), palladium (Pd), and rhenium (Re) are added.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The center electrode 20 and the center electrode tip 70 are joined such that laser welding is performed on the outer circumference of the joining surface between the center electrode tip 70 and the leading end portion 22 of the center electrode 20. As a result of the laser welding, the materials are melted and mixed by laser irradiation, and therefore the center electrode tip 70 and the center electrode 20 are firmly joined to each other. The center electrode 20 extends through the axial hole 12 toward the rear end side, and is electrically connected to the terminal metal fixture 40 in the rear side (the upper side in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) through a seal member 4 and a ceramic resistor 3 (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>). A high-voltage cable (not shown) is connected to the terminal metal fixture 40 through a plug cap (not shown), and a high voltage is applied to the cable.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The metal shell 50 is a cylindrical metal member for fixing the spark plug 100 to<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the engine head 200 of the internal combustion engine. The metal shell 50 holds the insulator 10 therein so as to surround a region of the insulator extending from a part of the rear end trunk portion 18 to the insulator nose portion 13. The metal shell 50 is formed from a low-carbon steel, and includes a tool engagement portion 51 to which an unillustrated spark plug wrench is to be fitted, and in which an attachment screw portion 52 on which threads for thread engagement with an attachment threaded hole 201 of the engine head 200 disposed in an upper portion of the internal combustion engine are formed.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the metal shell 50, a flange-like seal portion 54 is formed between the tool engagement portion 51 and the attachment portion 52. An annular gasket 5 which is formed by bending a sheet body is fittingly inserted onto a thread neck 59 between the attachment screw portion 52 and the seal portion 54. When the spark plug 100 is mounted on the engine head 200, the gasket 5 is crushed and deformed between a seating surface 55 of the seal portion 54 and an opening peripheral edge portion 205 of the attachment threaded hole 201. The deformation of the gasket 5 causes the gap between the spark plug 100 and the engine head 200 to be sealed, thereby preventing air leakage from the engine through the attachment threaded hole 201 from occurring.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The ground electrode 30 is configured by a metal having high corrosion resistance. For example, a nickel alloy such as Inconel (trademark) 600 or 601 is used. The spark plug 100 is characterized in the shape of the ground electrode 30. The shape of the ground electrode 30 will be described later in detail with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">Figs. 2 to 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">To the metal shell 50, a thin crimping portion 53 is disposed at the rear end side with respect to the tool engagement portion 51. A buckling portion 58 which is thin similarly with the crimping portion 53 is disposed between the seal portion 54 and the tool engagement portion 51. In a range from the tool engagement portion 51 to the crimping portion 53, annular cylindrical members 6, 7 are interposed between the inner circumferential surface of the metal shell 50 and the rear end trunk portion 18 of the insulator 10, and the space between the cylindrical members 6, 7 is filled with a powder of talc 9. By forming the crimping portion 53 through inwardly bending portion of the metal shell 50, the insulator 10 is pressed toward the leading end side in the metal shell 50 through the cylindrical members 6, 7 and the talc 9. Therefore, the step 15 of the insulator 10 is supported through an annular sheet packing 8 by a step 56 which is formed in the inner circumference of the metal shell 50, and at the position of the attachment screw<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> portion 52, thereby integrating the metal shell 50 with the insulator 10. At this time, airtightness between the metal shell 50 and the insulator 10 is maintained by means of the sheet packing 8, thereby preventing a combustion gas from outflowing. The buckling portion 58 is configured so as to be outward flexurally deformed in association with application of a compressive force in a crimping process, thereby increasing the stroke of compression of the talc 9 so that airtightness of the interior of the metal shell 50 is enhanced. On the side of the leading end side with respect to the step 56, a clearance C having a predetermined dimension is disposed between the metal shell 50 and the insulator 10.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref> are expanded figures of the vicinity of the leading end portion 22 of the center electrode 20 of the spark plug 100. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2(a)</figref> shows the leading end portion 22 of the center electrode 20 in such a manner that the leading end side of the spark plug 100 is in the upper side. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2(b)</figref> shows a state where the leading end portion 22 of the center electrode 20 is viewed in the direction of the axis O of the spark plug 100. <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is an expanded figure of the vicinity of the leading end portion 22 of the center electrode 20 of the spark plug 100 as viewed in the right direction OR in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2(a)</figref>.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, in the ground electrode 30, the cross section along its longitudinal direction has a substantially rectangular shape, and an end surface 33 having the same shape as the cross section is provided in the leading end portion 31.
