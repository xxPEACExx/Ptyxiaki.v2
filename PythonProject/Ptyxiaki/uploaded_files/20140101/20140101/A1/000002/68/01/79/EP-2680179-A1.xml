For example, they may carry both a personal electronic device for personal use and may carry a work-issued electronic device for work-related use. Carrying multiple electronic devices which have overlapping capabilities is inefficient. Thus, users may wish to be able to use a single electronic device for both personal and work purposes.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Employers may also benefit when employees are permitted to use a single electronic device for both personal and work purposes. For example, when employees connect their personal electronic device to work-related systems, the personal electronic device may then be used for work purposes, allowing the employer to benefit from increased productivity associated with the use of the electronic device without having to finance the purchase of the electronic device. Thus, shared electronic devices may be advantageous for both employees and employers. However, employers are often concerned about maintaining the integrity and security of work-related files when allowing electronic devices to be used for both work and personal purposes.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Sandbox techniques have been used to allow electronic devices to be used in different operational contexts. Sandboxing maintains a strict separation between business and personal data and applications. Conventionally, such techniques require manual selection and switching between the different operating contexts.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings which show example embodiments of the present application, and in which:</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example electronic device in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a flowchart of an example method of displaying records associated with a second sandbox together with records associated with a first sandbox;</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is an example display screen in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> is an example display screen in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> is an example display screen in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart of an example method of initiating an application to access an attachment in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> is an example display screen in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 8</figref> is an example display screen in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Like reference numerals are used in the drawings to denote like elements and features.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">In one example embodiment, the present application describes a method that includes: providing within a hybrid record access application, a selectable option to access an attachment associated with a record, the record being associated with one of a plurality of sandboxes, the hybrid record access application configured to access records associated with the plurality of sandboxes, the plurality of sandboxes configured to prevent data from moving between different sandboxes; and initiating within the sandbox associated with the record, an application to access the attachment when selection of the selectable option is received.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In another example embodiment, the present application describes an electronic device.

For example, a smartphone may have an ability to run third party applications which are stored on the smartphone.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A tablet computer (which may also be referred to as a tablet) is an electronic device 201 which is generally larger than a mobile phone (such as a smartphone) or personal digital assistant. Many mobile phones or personal digital assistants are designed to be pocket sized. That is, mobile phones or personal digital assistants are generally small enough to be carried by a person easily, often in a shirt or pant pocket while tablet computers are larger and may not fit within pant pockets. For example, many tablet computers have a height which is seven inches (7") or<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> more. In some example embodiments, the tablet computer may be a slate computer. A slate computer is a tablet computer which does not include a dedicated keyboard. A slate computer may allow for text input through the use of a virtual keyboard or an external keyboard which connects to the slate computer via a wired or wireless connection.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In at least some embodiments, the electronic device 201 is a handheld electronic device. A handheld electronic device is an electronic device 201 which is sufficiently small to be held in one or more hands of a user. The term handheld electronic device includes smartphones and may also include tablet computers. In at least some embodiments, the handheld electronic device may be sufficiently small to be held in a single hand of a user. For example, the handheld electronic device may be a palm-sized device which is sized to be held in the palm of a user's hand. From the description which follows, it will be appreciated that the techniques and methods described herein may be used in electronic devices 201 having limited display capabilities.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In other example embodiments, the electronic device 201 may be of a type not specifically listed above.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The electronic device 201 includes a housing (not shown) which houses components of the electronic device 201. The internal components of the electronic device 201 are constructed on a printed circuit board (PCB). The electronic device 201 includes a controller including at least one processor 240 (such as a microprocessor) which controls the overall operation of the electronic device 201. The processor 240 interacts with device subsystems, such as a wireless communication subsystem 211 for exchanging radio frequency signals with a wireless network 101 to perform communication functions. The processor 240 interacts with additional device subsystems including one or more input interfaces 206 (such as a keyboard, one or more control buttons, a camera 253, one or more microphones 258, and/or a touch-sensitive overlay associated with a touchscreen display, etc.), flash memory 244, random access memory (RAM) 246, read only memory (ROM) 248, auxiliary input/output (I/O) subsystems 257, a data port 257 (which may be a serial data port, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port), one or more output interfaces 205<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> (such as a display 204, one or more speakers 256, or other output interfaces), a short-range communication subsystem 262, and other device subsystems generally designated as 264. Some of the subsystems shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide "resident" or on-device functions.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">One or more of the input interfaces 206 may be configured for receiving user input to allow a user to interact with the electronic device 201. Such input interfaces 206 may, for example, allow a user to interact with a graphical user interface provided on the electronic device 201. Instructions, commands, or other forms of input may be received by the electronic device 201 via the input interfaces. For example, the input interfaces 206 may allow a user to interact with one or more interface elements displayed on a graphical user interface of the display 204.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Such input interfaces 206 may take a variety of forms. For example, any one or combination of the following input interfaces 206 may be included on the electronic device 201 and used for receiving user input: a touchscreen display, a control button, a trackball, trackpad, or optical input device, a keyboard, a camera 253 (which may be used, for example, to detect gesture-based input), an orientation or acceleration sensor such as an accelerometer (which may be used, for example, to detect gesture-based input performed by moving the electronic device 201), and/or a microphone 258 (which may be used, for example, to detect voice-based commands). It will be appreciated that the foregoing list of input interfaces 206 is not exhaustive and that other input interfaces 206 may be used instead of or in addition to any of the interfaces 206 described above.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As noted previously, the electronic device 201 may include a touch-sensitive display 204 which may be referred to as a touchscreen or a touchscreen display 204. The touchscreen display 204 may be constructed using a touch-sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller. The touch-sensitive input surface overlays the touchscreen display 204 and may be referred to as a touch-sensitive overlay. The touch-sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch-sensitive input interface 206 and the processor 240 interacts with the touch-sensitive<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> overlay via the electronic controller. That is, the touchscreen display 204 acts as both an input interface 206 and an output interface 205.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In some embodiments, the electronic device 201 may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network 101 within its geographic coverage area. The electronic device 201 may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network 101 after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In some example embodiments, the auxiliary input/output (I/O) subsystems 257 may include an external communication link or interface, for example, an Ethernet connection. The electronic device 201 may include other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks, for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the example embodiment illustrated, the electronic device 201 also includes a memory module 230 (which may be flash memory) and a memory module interface 232. The memory module 230 may be removable from the electronic device 201. Network access may be associated with a subscriber or user of the electronic device 201 via the memory module 230, which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory module for use in the relevant wireless network. The memory module 230 may be inserted in or connected to the memory module interface 232 of the electronic device 201.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The electronic device 201 may store data 227a, 227b in an erasable persistent memory, which in one example embodiment is the flash memory 244. In various example embodiments, the data 227a, 227b may include service data having information required by the electronic device 201 to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network 101. The data 227a, 227b may also include user application data including one or more records 291a, 291b. The records 291a, 291b may, for example, include email messages, address book and contact information, calendar and schedule information, notepad documents, image files, and<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> other commonly stored user information stored on the electronic device 201 by its user, and other data.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The data 227a, 227b stored in the persistent memory (e.g. flash memory 244) of the electronic device 201 may be organized, at least partially, into a number of databases or data stores each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example, email messages, contact records, and task items may be stored in individual databases within the memory of the electronic device 201.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">At least some of the records 291a, 291b may include an attachment 292a, 292b. By way of example, in some embodiments, a record 291a, 291b may be an email message (or another type of electronic message) that includes a file as an attachment 292a, 292b. Electronic messages sometimes include attachments 292a, 292b to allow files to be transferred from one location, person, device, or account to another location, person, device or account.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">By way of further example, a record 291a, 292b may be a calendar entry that includes a file as an attachment 292a, 292b. Calendar entries may, for example, include attachments 292a, 292b representing data related to an event associated with the calendar entry. For example, content (such as a presentation, document or notes) may be included in the calendar entry to allow such content to be discussed when the event represented by the calendar entry occurs. For example, the attachment 292a, 292b may be an agenda for a meeting. By way of further example, an attachment 292a, 292b included in a calendar entry may represent transportation information related to a calendar entry; for example, directions to the event.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Accordingly, records 291a, 291b associated with the electronic device 201 may include one or more attachments 292a, 292b.

The workspace can be one of a plurality of partitioned workspaces in which each workspace is separate from each of the other workspaces such that a tightly-controlled set of resources for controlling entities such as, but not limited to, data files, network connections and hardware and running applications that access the entities provides a security mechanism for separating the launching and running of programs and entities in the different workspaces. Each workspace is generally referred to as a sandbox 250, 252 and may also be referred to as a perimeter. Rule sets can be implemented to provide full control over what processes are started, spawned (by other applications), allowed to access entities such as, but not limited to, data files, network connections, and hardware, or allowed to inject code into other applications. Sandboxing provides a security system where data is prevented from movement between the different areas. More specifically, sandboxes 250, 252 (and other components, and software on the electronic device 201) may be configured such that data is prevented from being moved between different sandboxes 250, 252.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The sandboxes 250, 252 generally allow the electronic device 201 to be used in different operational contexts while maintaining file security. For example, the electronic device 201 may be used for both personal use and also for business use.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> Business files may, however, be kept separately from personal files (e.g. business files may be kept in a corporate sandbox and personal files may be kept in a personal sandbox and the sandboxes may be walled off from one another so that file transfers between the sandboxes are prevented or controlled).</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Accordingly, in at least some embodiments, there can be multiple modes or workspaces provided by the electronic device 201. A non-hybrid application running in one sandbox 250, 252 can access entities such as, but not limited to, data files, network connections, and hardware in the sandbox 250, 252 in which it is running, but can be restricted from accessing and operating on entities such as, but not limited to, data files, network connections, and hardware in another sandbox.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Accordingly, data 227a, 227b may be securely separated into sandboxes 250, 252. A non-hybrid application may separately operate on the data 227a, 227b in a sandbox 250, 252 in which that application is running but may not access data 227a, 227b in another sandbox.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">. For example, the system may be partitioned into two workspaces (as secure workspaces, i.e., sandboxes) such as a corporate sandbox and a personal sandbox. The data and files in the corporate sandbox can be strictly separated from non-hybrid applications or programs running the personal sandbox. This secure separation provides a security mechanism that allows a system to operate in numerous modes. The establishment of a secure separation to provide a security mechanism that allows a system to operate in numerous modes is not limited to two sandboxes and can be implemented for three or more sandboxes.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Accordingly, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the memory may be partitioned into a plurality of sandboxes 250, 252. In the embodiment illustrated, the memory is partitioned into a first sandbox 250 and a second sandbox 252. Each sandbox 250, 252 may be associated with separate data 227a, 227b. More particularly, each sandbox 250, 252 may be associated with a different record 291a, 291b or set of records. For example, in the example illustrated, the first sandbox 250 stores a first record 291a having a first attachment 292a and the second sandbox 252 stores a second record 291b having a second attachment 292b. For example, in at least some<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> embodiments, one of the sandboxes 250, 252 may be associated with business records (e.g. it may be a corporate sandbox) and one of the sandboxes 250, 252 may be associated with personal records (e.g. it may be a personal sandbox).</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The data port 258 may be used for synchronization with a user's host computer system (not shown). The data port 258 enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the electronic device 201 by providing for information or software downloads to the electronic device 201 other than through the wireless network 101. The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the electronic device 201 through a direct, reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In some example embodiments, the electronic device 201 is provided with a service routing application programming interface (API) which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data (i.e., USB) or Bluetooth® (Bluetooth® is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, Inc.) connection to the host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their electronic device 201 to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth® connection, traffic that was destined for the wireless network 101 is automatically routed to the electronic device 201 using the USB cable or Bluetooth® connection.

In the data communication mode, a received data signal such as a text message, an email message, or a web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem 211 and input to the processor 240 for further processing. For example, a downloaded web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the touchscreen display 204. A user of the electronic device 201 may also compose data items, such as email messages, for example, using the input interfaces 206, such as the touchscreen display 204. These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem 211 over the wireless network 101.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In the voice communication mode, the electronic device 201 provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> similar to the data communication mode, except that the received signals would be output to the speaker 256 and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone 258. The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software/firmware (i.e., a voice communication module) and hardware (i.e., the microphone 258, the speaker 256 and input devices). Alternative voice or audio I/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the electronic device 201. Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker 256, the touchscreen display 204 may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The processor 240 operates under stored program control and executes software modules 220 stored in memory such as persistent memory, for example, in the flash memory 244.

The hybrid application may access files from a sandbox 250, 252 in which the hybrid application was initiated and may also access files from another sandbox 250, 252. The ability to access files from a plurality of sandboxes 250, 252 at the same time may be provided to the hybrid application by higher-level system components, such as a sandbox management application or module (not shown) which manages the sandboxes 250, 252 and administers a set of access rules for the sandboxes.

The hybrid record access application 226 is an application that is configured and permitted to access records 291a, 291b associated with a plurality of sandboxes 250, 252. For example, the hybrid record access application<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> 226 is an application that is configured to access records 291a from a first sandbox 250 and to concurrently access records 291b from a second sandbox 252. More particularly, a single instance of the hybrid record access application 226 may access records 291a, 291b from both the first and second sandbox 250, 252 concurrently.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In some embodiments, the hybrid record application 226 may be an electronic messaging application, such as an email application. In such embodiments, the electronic messaging application may be configured to access records 291a, 291b that are electronic messages, such as email messages. The electronic messaging application may provide for the creation of electronic messages, the display of electronic messages (such as received electronic message), composing and sending replies to electronic messages, forwarding electronic messages and/or other functions associated with electronic messages not specifically listed herein. The hybrid record application 226 may be permitted to concurrently access electronic messages associated with a plurality of sandboxes 250, 252. One or more of these electronic messages may have an attachment 292a, 292b associated therewith. For example, an email message may include an attachment.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The electronic messaging application may be configured for use with other types of electronic messages instead of or in addition to email messages.

In at least some embodiments, the electronic messaging application may be a unified messaging application that is configured to access different types of messages from a common interface.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The electronic messaging application may be configured to operate in at least one operating mode in which electronic messages associated with a plurality of sandboxes are displayed concurrently. For example, in one operating mode, the hybrid electronic messaging application may display a list that includes references to electronic messages associated with a plurality of sandboxes 250, 252. Such a list may be referred to as an integrated record list 502 (<figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>). The hybrid electronic<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> messaging application may allow an electronic message to be selected from the list. Such selection may cause the electronic message to be displayed more fully. In at least some embodiments, when the electronic message is displayed more fully, a selectable option to access an attachment 292a, 292b associated with the electronic message may be displayed. Activation of the selectable option may cause the attachment access application 225 to be initiated.

The calendar application is an application that is configured to display dates and days of the week. The calendar application may be configured to access records 291a, 291b such as calendar entries. Calendar entries are records that are associated with the calendar and that have timing information specifying when the events associated with such calendar entries are to occur. For example, calendar entries may specify a date and/or time associated with an event.

The at-a-glance display may provide an overview of calendar entries associated with a particular time period, such as a day, week or month. A reminder interface may be a display screen that reminds a user of upcoming calendar entries. That is, the reminder interface may act as an alarm for the calendar entries. Selection of a calendar entry from the at-a-glance display or from the reminder interface may cause the calendar entry to be displayed more fully. In at least some embodiments, when the calendar entry is displayed more fully, a selectable option to access an attachment 292a, 292b associated with the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> calendar entry may be displayed.

For example, the attachment access application 225 may only store data within the sandbox in which the instance of the attachment access application 225 is operating. That is, the attachment access application 225 may only store data within the sandbox in which the attachment access application 225 is running. Similarly, a single instance of the attachment access application 225 may be configured and/or permitted to only access data from one of the sandboxes 250, 252.

As noted above, the hybrid record access application is configured to access records 291a, 291b associated with a plurality of sandboxes 250, 252 within a single instance of the hybrid record access application 226. The sandboxes 250, 252 are described in greater detail above. As discussed more fully above, the sandboxes 250, 252 may be configured such that data is prevented from moving between different sandboxes. For example, data accessed from within one sandbox 250, 252 may not be saved to another sandbox 250, 252. For example, when a user accesses a document from a first sandbox 250, any attempts to save that document (e.g. by selecting a "save as" option) will allow the document to be saved to locations within the first sandbox 250 but not to locations within the second sandbox 252.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">As further noted above, the sandboxes may be configured such that a non-hybrid application (such as an application to access an attachment to a record) is permitted to store data to the sandbox in which the application was initiated but is prevented from storing data in another sandbox.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">In at least some embodiments, providing a hybrid record access application 226 (<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) may include, for example, steps of initiating, launching and/or running the hybrid record access application 226 from the electronic device 201. In at least some embodiments, the hybrid record access application 226 may be launched in response to the receipt of a request to launch the hybrid record access application 226. For example, a request to launch the hybrid record access application 226 may be received when a user selects an icon or other interface element associated with the hybrid record access application 226 from a graphical user interface, such as an icon grid, provided on a display of the electronic device.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">In at least some embodiments, when the hybrid record access application 226 is run, various display screens 300, 400, 500 associated with the hybrid record access application 226 may be displayed on the display 204 associated with the electronic device 201.<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --></p><p id="p0088" num="0088">The hybrid record access application 226 is configured to be operated in at least one operating mode in which it is capable of accessing both records 291a associated with a first sandbox 250 and records 291b associated with a second sandbox 252. For example, the hybrid record access application 226 may provide for the display of an integrated record list 502 (<figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>) of the type described above.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">As noted above, in some embodiments, the hybrid record access application 226 is an electronic messaging application which may be associated with and access records that are electronic messages. The hybrid record access application 226 may, in other embodiments, be a calendar application. In such embodiments, the records may be calendar entries.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">At 604, a selectable option 702 (<figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref>) to access an attachment 292a, 292b associated with a record 291a, 291b may be provided within the hybrid record access application 226. The record may be associated with the first sandbox 250 or the second sandbox 252. The selectable option may, for example, be a selectable option to view, open, or otherwise access the attachment.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref>, an example display screen 700 having a selectable option 702 to access an attachment 292a is illustrated. In the embodiment illustrated, the attachment 292a is associated with a record 291a that is associated with the first sandbox 250. The record 291a is, in the example illustrated, an email message 306. The example display screen 700 of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> may, for example, be displayed in response to selection of a record 291a displayed in the integrated record list of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">The display screen 700 may be provided by the hybrid record access application 226. In the example illustrated, the display screen includes an attachment preview window 704 which may be used for previewing the attachment.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">The selectable option 702 to access an attachment 292a may be selected via an input interface 206 associated with the electronic device 201. In the example illustrated, the selectable option 702 may be selected using a touchscreen display 204; a hand 310 may activate the selectable option 702 with a tap or touch at an area of the<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> display 204 associated with the selectable option 702. Other input methods may be used in other embodiments.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">Accordingly, referring again to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref>, at 606 a selection of the selectable option 702 to access the attachment 292a may be received. At 608, in response to receiving selection of the selectable option 702, the hybrid record access application 226 may initiate an application to access the attachment within the sandbox associated with the record 291a. That is, an attachment access application 225 (which is a non-hybrid application) may be initiated, launched and/or run in the sandbox that is associated with the record to which the attachment is attached. The attachment access application 225 is a non-hybrid application and may be configured to access data associated with the sandbox where the application is initiated and which is prevented from accessing data associated with another sandbox.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">In at least some embodiments, at 608, the hybrid record access application 226 may initiate the application to access the attachment in the sandbox associated with the record associated with the attachment irrespective of the sandbox that was active at the time the selection of the selectable option 702 was received (at 606). That is, the selection of a sandbox which will be used for accessing the attachment does not depend on the sandbox that was active at the time the selection was received. For example, if the attachment is associated with a corporate record (i.e. a record associated with a corporate sandbox), the application to access the attachment will operate in the corporate sandbox even if the electronic device 201 was operating in a "personal mode" (in which the personal sandbox is the active sandbox) at the time the selection was received. For example, if the hybrid record access application 226 was initially launched when the electronic device 201 was operating in a personal sandbox, the electronic device 201 may continue to operate in a personal sandbox mode. However, when a selectable option to access an attachment associated with a record stored in the corporate sandbox is received, an attachment access application 225 may be run in the corporate sandbox.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">Accordingly, in at least some embodiments, at 608, the hybrid record access application 226 may identify the sandbox associated with the record to which<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> the attachment is attached and may run the application to access the attachment in the identified sandbox.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 8</figref>, an example of a display screen 800 of an attachment access application 225 is illustrated. In the example illustrated, the display screen 800 is provided by an image viewing application and the attachment 292a represents an image. In the example illustrated, the attachment access application 225 is operating in the first sandbox 250 since the attachment 292a is associated with a record 291a associated with the first sandbox 250.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">The example display screen 800 includes a selectable edit option 802. The selectable edit option may be used for receiving instructions to initiate editing of the attachment.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">The example illustrated also includes a selectable share option 804. The selectable share option 804 allows the attachment 292a to be shared; for example, with other users, applications, devices or systems. By way of example, the selectable share option may be an option to email the attachment 292a.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">In at least some embodiments, the selectable share option 804 is configured to operate based on the sandbox in which the attachment access application is operating. For example, different sharing options may be provided when the attachment access application 225 is operating in the first sandbox 250 than are provided when the attachment access application 225 is operating in the second sandbox 252. For example, when the attachment access application 225 is operating in a personal sandbox, a user may be permitted to email the attachment using a personal email account and not a corporate email account and when the attachment access application is operating in a corporate sandbox, a user may be permitted to email the attachment using a corporate email account and not a personal email account.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">The example illustrated also includes a selectable store option 806. The selectable store option 806 allows the attachment 292a to be stored in a specified location in memory of the electronic device 201. In at least some embodiments, the<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> store option 806 may allow the attachment to be stored in the sandbox 250 in which the attachment access application is operating but not the other sandbox 252. For example, if the attachment access application 225 is operating in the first sandbox 250, it may be permitted to store the attachment 292a in the first sandbox 250 but not the second sandbox 252.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">While the present application is primarily described in terms of methods, a person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the present application is also directed to various apparatus such as an electronic device 201 including a mobile communications device.
