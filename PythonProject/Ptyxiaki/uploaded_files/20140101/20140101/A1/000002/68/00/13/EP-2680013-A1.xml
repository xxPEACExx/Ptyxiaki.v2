A magnetic field detector positioned in an air gap of the magnetic circuit measures the intensity of the magnetic field, which is correlated to the current to be measured. In a closed-loop current transducer, the output of the magnetic field detector is connected in a feedback circuit to a compensation circuit that drives a compensation coil (also known as a secondary coil) to cancel the magnetic field from the primary conductor. The current in the compensation coil forms an image of the current to be measured and can be used to generate the measurement signal output.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A very common form of magnetic core and magnetic field detector arrangement is to provide an air gap transversally extending through a branch of the magnetic core in which the magnetic field detector is positioned. Such a gapped magnetic core provides a high sensitivity in that the magnetic field in the magnetic core is concentrated in the air gap and picked up by the magnetic field detector. One of the drawbacks of this design however is that external magnetic fields, for instance external magnetic fields created by alternating currents in conductors positioned in proximity of the conductor to be measured, influence the current in the secondary coil and thus the measurement signal representing the primary conductor.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Effects of external magnetic fields may be reduced by providing magnetic shielding means, however, such measures are costly, need space and in certain applications are difficult to implement.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An object of this invention is to provide a closed loop electrical current transducer that is accurate and economical to produce, yet has a high immunity to external magnetic fields, in particular changing or alternating external magnetic fields.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is an object of this invention to provide an electrical current transducer that is cost-effective to manufacture.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is advantageous to provide an electrical current transducer that is able to measure a large current amplitude range.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Objects of this invention have been achieved by providing an electrical current transducer according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Disclosed herein is an electric current transducer, including a magnetic core made of a highly magnetically permeable material encircling a central passage configured to receive a primary conductor, and a magnetic field detector.

The magnetic field detector 4 comprises electrical terminals 6 for connection to a signal processing circuit.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The current transducer comprises a compensation coil 8, also commonly called a "secondary coil", which is connected to the signal processing circuit in a feedback<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> loop controlled by the signal from the magnetic field detector, the functioning principle of such closed-loop configurations being <i>per se</i> well-known in the art. The magnetic field detector 4 may comprise a Hall effect sensor in the form of an ASIC, as is <i>per se</i> well-known in the art, or may comprise other magnetic field detectors such as fluxgate detectors or giant magneto-resistive (GMR) based magnetic field sensors.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In a variant, the current transducer may comprise an open-loop configuration in which the signal of the magnetic field detector is used to generate the measurement signal, in which case it is not necessary to provide a compensation coil.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The magnetic core 2, 2' comprises a closed configuration, in other words without an air gap cutting completely across the magnetic core loop, that allows at least a portion of the magnetic flux flowing in the core to circulate in the magnetic core without passing through an air gap. This fully closed magnetic core loop configuration provides a very high immunity to external magnetic fields, in particular varying or alternating fields. This high immunity is the consequence of the cancelling effect of the external fields that distribute symmetrically around the magnetic core.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In the embodiments illustrated schematically in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">figures 1 to 4</figref>, the magnetic core 2 comprises a slot 10 extending fully through the magnetic core from a radially outer side 12 to a radially inner side 14, where the radially inner side defines the inner contour of the magnetic core surrounding a central passage 16 through which the primary conductor, in which the current to be measured flows, is inserted. The slot 10 comprises opposed first and second major faces 10a, 10b and opposed minor faces 10c, 10d positioned between opposed axial sides 18, 20 of the magnetic core. The major faces 10a, 10b and minor faces 10c, 10d of the slot form a closed perimeter around the slot. The slot 10 is oriented orthogonally or essentially orthogonally to an axis A extending through the central passage 16, the slot being configured such that it does not cut transversely through the magnetic core, thus ensuring that the magnetic core has a fully closed configuration. The slot 10 may have an essentially constant width and be positioned essentially centrally between opposed axial sides 18, 20, of the magnetic core. The width <i>W</i> of the slot, defined<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> by the distance between the major faces 10a, 10b, is configured to be sufficiently wide to enable insertion of a sensing portion of the magnetic field detector therein, the dimension of the width <i>W</i> thus depending on the type of magnetic field detector that is intended to be inserted in the slot. In a preferred embodiment, the slot advantageously has a constant width such that it may be manufactured easily by a machining operation, for example by means of a rotating cutting blade that cuts through the magnetic core from the radially outer side towards the radially inner side.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In the embodiments illustrated schematically in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">figures 1 to 4</figref>, the slot 10 extends fully through from the radially outer side 12 to the radially inner side 14, which advantageously enables the magnetic field detector to be mounted against the radially inner side of the magnetic core with the sensing portion thereof inserted in the slot 10, leaving the radially outer side 12 on the magnetic core free. The latter configuration advantageously facilitates handling, machining, and assembly operations on the magnetic core, for instance for the winding operation of the compensation coil 8 around the magnetic core. Guiding, holding or positioning tools can engage the radially outer side 12 of the magnetic core without hindrance from the magnetic field sensor positioned against the radially inner side 14.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The magnetic core may advantageously be formed of a wound thin strip or band of highly permeable magnetic material forming a wound toroidal core. Wound toroidal magnetic cores, which are <i>per se</i> well known in the art, are cost effective to manufacture and offer a good performance with respect to eddy currents. In an embodiment of the present invention, the slot may advantageously be formed by machining the wound toroidal core the after the winding operation.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The slot in the embodiments illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">figures 1 to 3</figref> may advantageously be machined by a cutting blade, for instance a circular cutting blade that has a trajectory in an essentially tangential direction T, or in an essentially orthogonal direction P, or in a curved direction C, whereby the cutting depth is such that the cutting tool completely cuts through the core to form a slot 10 accessible from the radially inner side 14 of the magnetic core.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Within the scope of this invention, the magnetic core can also be formed from other materials or in other manners, for instance out of a ferrite material that is sintered and directly formed with the slot therein. In variants, the slot may have an width <i>W</i> that is non-constant (not shown) and have various shapes. In a variant, the opening from the radially outer side to the radially inner side could also be formed by means of a milling tool instead of a blade cutter. The opening may in a variant comprise a circular or oval shape.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In a variant of the invention, schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 4</figref>, the magnetic core may be made of two annular core portions 2a, 2b that are assembled together along an interface surface 22 transversely oriented with respect to the axial direction A, to form a core. The slot 10 may be machined or otherwise formed on the interface surfaces prior to assembly of the core portions.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 5</figref>, in another embodiment the slot 10' of the magnetic core 2 for receiving the magnetic field detector therein extends fully through the magnetic core from one axial side 18 through to the opposed axial side 20 of the magnetic core. The slot 10' in this embodiment is thus oriented parallel or essentially parallel to the axis A extending through the central passage 16, the slot being configured such that it does not cut transversely through the magnetic core, thus ensuring that the magnetic core has a fully closed configuration. The slot 10' comprises opposed first and second major faces 10a', 10b' and opposed minor faces 10c', 10d' positioned between opposed axial sides 18, 20 of the magnetic core. The major faces 10a', 10b' and minor faces 10c', 10d' of the slot form a closed perimeter around the slot. The slot 10' may be positioned essentially centrally between the radially inner and outer surfaces 12, 14 of the magnetic core. The width <i>W</i> of the slot, i.e. the distance between the major surfaces 10a', 10b', is configured to be sufficiently wide to enable insertion of a sensing portion of the magnetic field detector therein, the magnitude of the width <i>W</i> thus depending on the type of magnetic field detector that is intended to be inserted in the slot 10'.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The configuration of the slot 10' advantageously enables the magnetic field detector to be mounted with connection terminals directed towards the radially inner side of the magnetic core with the sensing portion thereof inserted in the slot 10', leaving<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the radially outer side 12 on the magnetic core free. The latter configuration advantageously facilitates handling, machining, and assembly operations on the magnetic core, for instance for the winding operation of the compensation coil 8 around the magnetic core.
