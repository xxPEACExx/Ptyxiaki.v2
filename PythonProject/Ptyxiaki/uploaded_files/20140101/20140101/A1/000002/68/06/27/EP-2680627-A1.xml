For instance, in a mobile station configured to communicate according to the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), currently the world's most popular standard for mobile communications systems, the secure element for securely storing subscription data is called a subscriber identity module (SIM) and is usually provided in the form of a smart card that can be removably inserted into the mobile terminal. According to the GSM standard, the technical features of which are defined by a large number of interrelated and mutually dependent specifications published by the ETSI standardization organization, the SIM contains subscription data for authenticating and identifying the user of the mobile station, including in particular an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and an authentication key Ki.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">One particular field of application of secure elements, such as a SIMs, UICCs or eUICCs, which is expected to grow rapidly within the next couple of years is M2M (machine-to-machine), i.e. the communication between machines over a mobile communications network without human intervention, also<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> called the Internet of things. In M2M data is automatically transmitted between many different types of machines equipped with a secure element, such as TV systems, set top boxes, vending machines, motor vehicles, traffic lights, surveillance cameras, sensor devices, and the like. As in a lot of cases these machines are equipped with a removable secure element and at least from time to time will be unattended, the problem exists that the secure element of such a device can be easily removed and fraudulently used in another mobile terminal for accessing without permission the services provided by a mobile communications network.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is known to address the above problem by locking secure element to a mobile terminal using the mobile terminal's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI). According to this known solution the secure element will allow normal operation in case the mobile terminal can identify itself by the correct IMEI. This approach, however, suffers from the drawback that, in principle, it is possible to modify the IMEI of a mobile terminal thereby allowing a rogue mobile terminal by providing a fake IMEI to claim to be the mobile terminal that originally had been locked to a specific secure element.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Another method for locking a secure element to a mobile terminal is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2010115732A"><text>WO 2010/115732</text></patcit>. According to the method disclosed therein a data management server compares the terminal profile provided by a mobile terminal with a terminal profile that is stored within the data management server in association with the IMEI provided by the mobile terminal. In case the data management server determines that these terminal profiles differ, it can be concluded that the mobile terminal that provided the terminal profile is not the mobile terminal it claims to be and appropriate countermeasures can be taken, such as blocking further access to the mobile communications network.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The main object of the present invention is to provide for improved methods and devices for locking a secure element to a mobile terminal.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The above object is achieved according to the present invention by the subject matter of the independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Generally, the present invention is based on the idea to use the order in which a mobile terminal, for instance, during the start-up sequence of the mobile terminal, accesses files stored on a secure element as a kind of fingerprint of the mobile terminal. Preferably, the fingerprint is derived from the file access profile of the mobile terminal by applying a hash function to the file access profile.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">If the terminal fingerprint derived from the file access profile of the mobile terminal differs from a nominal terminal fingerprint, then it is concluded that the mobile terminal is not the mobile terminal the secure element has been locked to initially, so that further operation of the secure element should be blocked. Otherwise, i.e. if the terminal fingerprint derived from the file access profile of the mobile terminal is identical to the nominal terminal fingerprint, it is concluded that the mobile terminal is the mobile terminal the secure element has been locked to initially, so that operation of the secure element can continue.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The uniqueness of the terminal fingerprint generally increases with the number of files the file access profile is made up of. Thus, preferably, the file access profile is made up of all the necessary files stored on the secure element that need to be accessed by the mobile terminal in order to perform its intended<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> functions, such as attaching to a mobile communications network. However, the present invention also covers embodiments, where the file access profile is made up only of a subset of all the necessary files stored on the secure element that need to be accessed by the mobile terminal in order to perform its intended functions.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">More specifically, according to a first aspect the invention is directed to a method for locking a secure element to a mobile terminal, comprising the following steps: determining an actual file access profile of the mobile terminal by determining which files stored on the secure element are accessed by the mobile terminal and/ or in which order these files are accessed by the mobile terminal; deriving an actual terminal fingerprint from the actual file access profile of the mobile terminal; comparing the actual terminal fingerprint with a nominal terminal fingerprint; and allowing further operation of the secure element in case the actual terminal fingerprint is identical with the nominal terminal fingerprint; or blocking further operation of the secure element in case the actual terminal fingerprint is not identical with the nominal terminal fingerprint.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Preferably, the step of determining an actual file access profile of the mobile terminal is performed during a specific well-defined procedure of the mobile terminal, such as a start-up procedure, and/ or in response to a specific event of the mobile terminal, such as a power-on or reset event.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to preferred embodiments, the step of comparing the actual terminal fingerprint with a nominal terminal fingerprint is performed on the secure element, wherein the nominal terminal fingerprint is stored on the secure element. Preferably, the nominal terminal fingerprint stored on the secure element can be provided to the secure element during a personalization<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> process thereof, over-the-air by a device management server or in response to a user interaction that causes the storing of the actual terminal fingerprint as the nominal terminal fingerprint.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Preferably, the step of determining an actual file access profile of the mobile terminal comprises the step of monitoring the APDU communication between the mobile terminal and the secure element.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to preferred embodiments, the file access profile is created by providing a list of the names, file identifiers and/ or any other file identification elements of the files that are accessed by the mobile terminal, wherein the elements of the list are ordered according to the order in which the files are accessed by the mobile terminal.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to alternative preferred embodiments, the file access profile is created by concatenating the names, file identifiers and/ or any other file identification elements of the files that are accessed by the mobile terminal, wherein the files are ordered according to the order in which the files are accessed by the mobile terminal.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Preferably, the step of deriving an actual terminal fingerprint from the actual file access profile of the mobile terminal comprises the step of applying a hash function to the actual file access profile of the mobile terminal.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to preferred embodiments, the file access profile of the mobile terminal or the terminal fingerprint can be combined with further data elements characterizing the mobile terminal, such as the IMEI and/ or the terminal profile of the mobile terminal.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to preferred embodiments, the step of blocking further operation of the secure element in case the actual terminal fingerprint is not identical with the nominal terminal fingerprint comprises the additional steps of: transmitting an identification data element to a device management server in communication with the secure element to identify the secure element; and transmitting an updated nominal terminal fingerprint to the secure element, in case a firmware of the mobile terminal has been updated. Preferably, the identification data element transmitted to the device management server is the ICCID of the secure element.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to a second aspect the invention is directed to a secure element that is configured to be locked to a mobile terminal. The secure element comprises a memory unit storing a plurality of files that can be accessed by the mobile terminal. Moreover, the secure element comprises means for determining an actual file access profile of the mobile terminal by determining which files stored on the secure element are accessed by the mobile terminal and/ or in which order these files are accessed by the mobile terminal; means for deriving an actual terminal fingerprint from the actual file access profile of the mobile terminal; means for comparing the actual terminal fingerprint with a nominal terminal fingerprint; and means for allowing further operation of the secure element, in case the actual terminal fingerprint is identical with the nominal terminal fingerprint, and for blocking further operation of the secure element, in case the actual terminal fingerprint is not identical with the nominal terminal fingerprint.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Preferably, an application running on an CPU of the secure element provides for the determining means, the deriving means, the comparing means and/ or the means for allowing further operation of the secure element, in case the actual terminal fingerprint is identical with the nominal terminal<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> fingerprint, and for blocking further operation of the secure element, in case the actual terminal fingerprint is not identical with the nominal terminal fingerprint</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to preferred embodiments, the secure element is configured as a SIM, UICC, eUICC, USIM, R-UIM or ISIM.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to a third aspect the invention provides a mobile communication system comprising the above described secure element and a mobile terminal that is locked to the secure element by means of the above described methods.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">These and other features, characteristics, advantages, and objects of the invention will be clear from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments, given as a non-restrictive example, under reference to the attached drawings.

According to preferred embodiments of the invention the secure element 20 is configured as a subscriber identity module (SIM), as the SIM currently is the most popular type of secure element used in mobile communications systems for identification as well as for the provision of different special functions and value-added services. The person skilled in the art will appreciate, however, that other types of secure elements that, depending on the underlying generation and type of mobile communications system standard, are designated as UICC, eUICC, USIM, R-UIM, ISIM and the like, are also encompassed by the present invention. Moreover, the person skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention can be advantageously put into practice by means of a secure element 20 that is removably inserted in the mobile terminal 14 or,<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> alternatively, a secure element 20 that is fixedly embedded into the mobile terminal 14, as in the case of an embedded UICC (eUICC).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The mobile station 12 is configured to communicate via the air interface with a mobile communications network or Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) 30, preferably operated by a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) according to the GSM standard. In the following, preferred embodiments of the invention will be described in the context of a mobile communications network according to the standards of the Global System for Mobile communication (GSM), as specified in a number of specifications provided by ETSI. However, the person skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may be advantageously applied in connection with other mobile communications systems as well. Such systems include third-generation mobile communications systems (3GPP), such as the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), and next generation or fourth-generation mobile networks (4G), such as Long Term Evolution (LTE), as well as other mobile communications systems, such as CDMA, GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), CAMEL (Customised Applications for Mobile network Enhanced Logic) and the like.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As is well known to the person skilled in the art, the PLMN 30 configured according to the GSM standard generally comprises a base station subsystem consisting of one or more base transceiver stations that define respective cells of the PLMN 30 and are connected to a base station controller. Generally, such a base station controller is one of several base station controllers that communicate with a mobile switching center (MSC). Often, a local database called Visitor Location Register (VLR) for keeping track of the mobile stations currently located within the cells covered by a MSC (i.e. the MSC service area) is incorporated in the MSC. The MSC provides essentially the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> same functionality as a central office switch in a public-switched telephone network and is additionally responsible for call processing, mobility management, and radio resource management. The MSC is further in communication with a home location register (HLR), which is the primary database of the PLMN 30 that stores information about its mobile users required for authentication. To this end, the HLR generally is in communication with an authentication center (AUC).</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">As can be taken from the enlarged schematic view of the secure element 20 in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, the secure element 20 preferably comprises a central processing unit (CPU) 22 for monitoring and processing data being transferred into and out of the secure element 20. Preferably, an application 24 is running on the CPU 22 that is configured to identify the mobile terminal 14 and thereby lock the secure element 20 to the mobile terminal 14 according to the methods disclosed by the present invention and whose features will be described in the context of <figref idrefs="f0002">figures 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref> in more detail further below. The application 24 could be implemented, for instance, as a Java Applet and/ or as part of a USIM application.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The CPU 22 is in communication with a memory unit 25 for storing data on the secure element 20. At least part of the memory unit 25 is configured as a non-volatile memory, such as a ROM, EEPROM and/ or Flash memory, which can store, for instance, the operating system of the secure element 20 as well as the program code of the application 24 for identifying the mobile terminal 14. However, at least a part of an operating system could be stored on an internal non-volatile memory of the CPU 22 as well.

For instance, in order to be able to attach to the PLMN 30 the mobile terminal 14 has to obtain certain information stored within specific files on the memory unit 25 of the secure element 20, for instance, the IMSI stored thereon. In the preferred embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, the exemplary files 26a, 26b, 27a, 27b and 28a constitute such files that have to be accessed by the mobile terminal 14, for instance, during its start-up sequence, which will be described in more detail in the context of <figref idrefs="f0002">figures 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Preferably, the memory unit 25 of the secure element 20 is configured to implement a file system architecture as defined in at least one of the following specifications, which are incorporated herein by reference: ISO/IEC 7816-4, ETSI TS 100 977 / 3GPP TS 11.11, ETSI 151011 / 3GPP TS 51.011 and/or 3GPP TS 31.102 (formerly known as ETSI TS 102 221). According to these specifications the file system of a secure element is generally defined as a hierarchical structure comprising the following basic elements: a master file (MF), dedicated files (DFs) and elementary files (EFs). The MF is the root of the file hierarchy and generally there is only one MF on a secure element configured according to the above specifications. The MF may contain, as elements, a DF, or even many DFs, and it may contain zero to many EFs. A DF is essentially a container for EFs, i.e. a DF may contain zero to many EFs. An EF may contain only records, i.e. actual files. For the case of a secure element 20 implemented as a UICC or eUICC with a USIM application running thereon the above mentioned specification 3GPP TS 31.102 additionally defines an application dedicated file (ADF), which is a sort of combination of a MF and a DF and as such is arranged separate from and at the same level of<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> the file hierarchy as the MF.

The EFs 26a, 26b, 27a, 27b and 28a stored in the memory unit 25 of the secure element 20 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> could be any of these generally mandatory files defined in these specifications, such as: EFiccm (i.e. the elementary file containing the ICCID of the secure element), EF<sub>FLPMN</sub> (i.e. the elementary file defining forbidden public land mobile networks), EF<sub>IMMSI</sub> (i.e. the elementary file containing the IMSI assigned to the secure element), EF<sub>Kc</sub><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> (i.e. the elementary file containing the GSM ciphering key for encrypting the data communication via the air interface), EF<sub>LOCI</sub> (i.e. the elementary file containing information about the present location of the mobile terminal), EF<sub>PLMNsel</sub> (i.e. the elementary file containing a list of preferred PLMNs) and the like. A complete compilation of these files can be found in the above mentioned specifications, which as already mentioned above are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Although the names of the set of mandatory files that must be present on the secure element 20 for the mobile station 12 to function properly, e.g. to be able to attach to the PLMN 30, could differ for a secure element 20 that is not configured as a SIM or UICC/eUICC according to the above specifications, the person skilled in the art will appreciate that such secure elements 20 containing files with different file names according to different mobile communications standards are encompassed by the present invention as well.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In order for the mobile terminal 14 to be able to access, for instance, one of the files 26a, 26b, 27a, 27b, 28a stored in the memory unit 25 of the secure element 20 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, the mobile terminal 14 and the secure element 20 have to communicate by means of a suitable communication protocol. As is well known to the person skilled in the art, in case the secure element 20 is configured as a SIM or eUICC/UICC with a USIM application running thereon the exchange of data between the mobile terminal 14 and the secure element 20 is based on application protocol data units (APDUs). The structure of an APDU is defined in the above mentioned specification ISO/ IEC 7816-4. Generally, the communication between the mobile terminal 14 and the secure element 20 is implemented according to a master slave model in that the mobile terminal 14 acts by issuing a command APDU (C-APDU) and the secure element 20 reacts by issuing a corresponding response APDU (R-APDU).<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> A C-APDU issued by the mobile terminal 14 generally contains a command, such as "SELECT" for selecting a file and "READ BINARY" or "READ RECORD" for reading a file stored on the secure element 20.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Preferably, the mobile terminal 14 is implemented with a firmware that controls the operation of the mobile terminal 14 and defines its reactions to specific terminal events. For instance, when the mobile terminal 14 is powered on, the firmware operating the mobile terminal 14 generally will cause the mobile terminal 14 to perform a well-defined start-up sequence or procedure (also called initialization), whereafter the mobile terminal 14 will be configured, for instance, to attach to the PLMN 30. As part of this start-up sequence the mobile terminal 14 accesses files stored in the memory unit 25 of the secure element 20 in order to configure itself for an attachment to the PLMN 30. As already briefly described above, such an access of files stored on the secure element 20 by the mobile terminal 14 can be performed by selecting and reading the corresponding files using respective C-APDUs containing, for instance, the commands "SELECT", "READ BINARY" and/or "READ RECORD". For instance, the exemplary EF 27b shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, which could be the EF<sub>IMSI</sub>, can be accessed by selecting the EF 27b with a C-APDU containing the command "SELECT" and the file identifier (FID) of the EF 27b and a C-APDU containing the command "READ BINARY". Similar C-APDUs will be used for selecting and reading other files, such as the EFs 26a, 26b, 27a and 28a shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, that might have to be accessed by the mobile terminal 14 during the start-up procedure. Thus, generally the firmware operating on the mobile terminal 14 defines a file access profile, i.e. the firmware defines which files stored in the memory unit 25 of the secure element 20 will be accessed and in what order these files will be accessed by the mobile terminal 14. The person skilled in the art will appreciate, however, that the present invention also covers embodiments, where the file access<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> profile is not or not only defined by the firmware of the mobile terminal 14, but at least partly by the operating system and/ or the hardware of the mobile terminal 14 and/ or a SIM application running thereon.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In case the secure element 20 is implemented in the form of a UICC/eUICC with a USIM application running thereon the start-up sequence of the mobile terminal 14 with respect to the secure element 20 begins with the step of selecting the USIM application and ends with the step of receiving the first status command by the secure element 20. In between these steps, the start-up sequence consists of a multitude of steps of selecting and reading each of the files required by the mobile terminal 14 to configure itself for an attachment to the PLMN 30. For further details about the start-up sequence for a secure element implemented as an eUICC/ UICC with a USIM application running thereon reference is made to the above mentioned specification 3GPP 31.102.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Under further reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>, a first preferred embodiment of a method for locking a secure element, for instance the secure element 20, to a mobile terminal, for instance the mobile terminal 14, by will now be described. In step S1 of <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref> the mobile terminal 14 begins its start-up sequence, for instance, in response to a power-on or reset event of the mobile terminal 14. As already described above, this start-up sequence generally involves several steps of accessing mandatory files stored on the memory unit 25 of the secure element 20, which define a file access profile that is essentially determined by the configuration of the mobile terminal 14, such as by the firmware of the mobile terminal 14 (step S2 of <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>). According to the present invention, preferably, the secure element 20 is configured to monitor and log these file accesses by the mobile terminal 14 thereby creating a file access profile of the mobile terminal 14 (step S3 of <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>). Preferably,<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> it is the application 24 running on the CPU 22 of the secure element 20 that is configured to monitor and log the file accesses by the mobile terminal 14. To this end, the application 24 could be configured to monitor and log the APDU communication between the mobile terminal 14 and the secure element 20 and, in particular, such APDUs that contain a command for selecting a file and/or a command for reading a file. Thus, for the preferred embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> the file access profile monitored and logged preferably by the application 24 running on the CPU 22 of the secure element 20 could look as follows: "SELECT EF 27a" | "READ BINARY "SELECT EF 28a" | "READ BINARY "SELECT EF 26b" | "READ BINARY ..., where | denotes the concatenation operation. Alternatively, the file access profile could be created by simply concatenating the names, file identifiers or any other identification elements of the files in the order in which they are accessed, such as follows: "EF 27a" | "EF 28a" | "EF 26b" | ... According to a further alternative, the file access profile could be created by concatenating the actual content of the files in the order in which they are accessed, such as follows: content(EF 27a) | content(EF 28a) | content(EF 26b) | ... Instead of concatenating the above elements the file access profile could simply be a list of the names, file identifiers or any other suitable identification elements of the files accessed by the mobile terminal 14, wherein the elements of the list are ordered according to the order in which the files have been accessed by the mobile terminal 14.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The person skilled in the art will appreciate that the above described file access profiles of the mobile terminal 14 defines a sort of fingerprint of the mobile terminal 14. Obviously, the uniqueness of this fingerprint generally increases with the number of files the file access profile is made up of. Thus, preferably, the file access profile is made up of all the necessary files stored on the secure element 20 that need to be accessed by the mobile terminal 14<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> in order to perform its intended functions, such as attaching to the PLMN 30. However, the present invention also covers embodiments, where the file access profile is made up only of a subset of all the necessary files stored on the secure element 20 that need to be accessed by the mobile terminal 14 in order to perform its intended functions.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">After the secure element 20 has determined the file access profile of the mobile terminal 14 in step S3 of <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>, the secure element 20 preferably derives a fingerprint of the mobile terminal from this file access profile (step S4 of <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>). Although the present invention also covers embodiments, where the file access profile determined by the secure element 20 is simply taken as the fingerprint of the mobile terminal 14, the step of deriving the fingerprint from the file access profile preferably includes the step of applying a hash function to the file access profile, i.e. fingerprint = H(file access profile), where H is a hash function. Thus, for the preferred embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> the fingerprint of the mobile terminal 14 could be derived from its file access profile determined by the secure element 20 by means of the following formula: fingerprint = H ("SELECT EF 27a" | "READ BINARY | "SELECT EF 28a" | "READ BINARY | "SELECT EF 26b" | "READ BINARY" | ...), where again | denotes the concatenation operation.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In step S4 of <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref> the fingerprint derived by the secure element 20 from the file access profile of the mobile terminal 14 is, moreover, compared with a nominal fingerprint. Preferably, the nominal fingerprint is stored in the memory unit 25 of the secure element 20. As the person skilled in the art will appreciate, using a hash value of the file access profile as the fingerprint of the mobile terminal 14 and comparing the same with the nominal fingerprint has the advantage that it is not possible to derive a nominal file access profile from the nominal fingerprint, because a hash function is not invertible.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> Moreover, the person skilled in the art will appreciate that the nominal fingerprint which the actual fingerprint of the mobile terminal 14 is compared with could have been provided to the secure element 20 by several means. For instance, the nominal fingerprint could have been stored on the secure element 20 during a personalization process thereof. Alternatively, the nominal fingerprint could be provided over the air (OTA) to the secure element 20 by a device management server 32 connected to the PLMN 30, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>. As a further alternative it is conceivable that the user of the mobile terminal 14, after having authenticated itself vis-à-vis the secure element 20, could choose to store the fingerprint derived from the actual file access profile as the new nominal fingerprint. Such a feature could be advantageous, in case a mobile user continues to use his secure element with a new mobile terminal.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">If the result of the step of comparing the actual fingerprint of the mobile terminal 14 with the nominal fingerprint is that the two fingerprints are identical, then there is at least a high probability that the mobile terminal 14 is the one it is supposed to be, namely the mobile terminal the secure element 20 has been paired with originally. In this case the secure element 20 preferably continues to operate as normal, such as proceeding with an authentication or subscription procedure, i.e. an attachment to the PLMN 30 (step S5 of <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>, first alternative). Otherwise, i.e. if the actual fingerprint of the mobile terminal 14 does not match the nominal fingerprint stored on the secure element 20, it can be concluded that the mobile terminal 14 is not the mobile terminal that has been used to create the nominal fingerprint, i.e. the mobile terminal the secure element 20 has been paired with originally. Unless the firmware of the mobile terminal the secure element 20 has been paired with originally has been modified, this strongly indicates that the mobile terminal 14 is not the one it is supposed to be, so that in this case the secure element<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> 20 preferably blocks any further operation, for instance, an attachment to the PLMN 30 (step S5 of <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>, second alternative).</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">As already partially mentioned above, it is preferably the application 24 running on the CPU 22 of the secure element 20 that controls and coordinates the steps described in the context of <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref> that require an action of the secure element 20, namely steps S3 to S5 of <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">A further preferred embodiment of the present invention that includes an interaction between the secure element 20 and a device management server 32 connected to the PLMN 30 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> to check whether any updates of the firmware of the mobile terminal 14 might be the cause for a mismatch between the actual fingerprint derived from the file access profile of the mobile terminal 14 and the nominal fingerprint stored on the secure element 20 will now be described under reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>.

Preferably, the identification data element transmitted from the secure element 20 to the device management server 32 is the integrated circuit card ID (ICCID).
