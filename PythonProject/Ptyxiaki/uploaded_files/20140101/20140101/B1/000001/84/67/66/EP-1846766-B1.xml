The reason for this is that tests need to be easy to perform, in a reliable and cost effective way, with minimum human intervention. At the same time there is an ever-increasing need for higher sensitivity and specificity of detection.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Magnetic biochips have been proposed as a new means to sensitively detect low concentrations of target molecules in body fluids for diagnostics. Such magnetic biochips have promising properties for bio-molecular diagnostics, in terms of sensitivity, specificity, integration, ease of use and costs. For example, sensitive magneto-resistive magnetic field sensors, such as GMR magnetic field sensors, can be combined with suitable biochemistry to selectively attach magnetic beads, resulting in a miniaturized biosensor that is suitable for detection in an array format. The sensitivity and specificity of rapid tests is usually provided by dedicated capture of probe molecules, e.g. a high-affinity antibody-antigen combination. In such an immunoassay, the target molecules become sandwiched between antibodies on a solid support and a label that is detected by the sensor. Conventionally this label is a fluorophore, and a plate reader is used for detection. In the most sensitive assays, the test is performed on magnetic bead carriers that can be actuated so the reaction rate is no longer limited by diffusion and the test is speeded up. Magnetic detection naturally combines actuation and detection by using the magnetic beads as both label and carrier. Besides this natural integration, magnetic labelling has several other advantages: body liquids do show autofluorescence, but are by nature hardly magnetic, which helps to improve the detection limit. Magnetic detection of magnetic particles requires no expensive optics, yet is fast and sensitive, and furthermore, it is well suited for miniaturized diagnostic sensing, due to the direct availability of electronic signals and the small size of the required instrumentation.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The aim of a biosensor is to detect and quantify the presence of a biological molecule in a sample, usually a solution. Desired attributes are high sensitivity, high specificity, and high speed. Furthermore, the biosensor is preferably of low cost and it should be reliable and easy to use.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For many decades magnetic particles have been used in biology for separation, extraction and purification of biological materials. In recent years, biosensors based on the use of magnetic particles for actuation as well as detection have started to develop. In these studies, magnetic particles are detected by optical methods, electric means, coils or magneto-resistive sensors. Actuation of the particles is used for stringency, to concentrate the particles near the detection surface or to enhance particle-to-particle binding.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For high sensitivity and high speed in a sandwich assay, the following protocol may be attempted:
<ul><li>Disperse: Mix beads into the fluid sample.</li><li>Catch: Let targets bind to beads.</li><li>Attract: Bring beads toward the binding surface of the sensor device.</li><li>Bind: Let beads form biological bonds to the binding region or binding sites of the sensor. The binding surface of the sensor has a portion which is chemically and/or biochemically prepared to enable binding of particles, in particular via selective biochemical bonds. In the case of a sandwich format, the biochemical bond involves at least the following elements: an area on the sensor binding surface, a first binding entity, a target, a second binding entity, and the bead.</li><li>Stringency (i.e. selective removal): Remove unbound and weakly bound beads from the binding surface of the sensor device, either magnetically or non-magnetically. Determine relative binding forces.</li></ul></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The catching step can be made very fast by providing a high surface-to-volume ratio, i.e. by dispersing many small particles in the solution. However, this is only useful when the other steps can also be made very rapid. Thermal diffusion, however, gives only slow transport of sub-micrometer beads towards the binding surface. The transport can be enhanced by applying magnetic field gradients, e.g. with a permanent magnet [as in <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Perrin, J.Immun.Meth 224, 77 (1999</text></nplcit>) for example].</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">From literature (<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="b"><text>JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS, AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF PHYSICS, NEW YORK, US, vol. 91, no. 10, pages 7786-7788</text></nplcit> and <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="b"><text>vol. 93, no. 10, pages 7281-7286</text></nplcit>) sensor devices and methods are known that provide a single magnetic micro sphere placement and detection using current line designs with integrated<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> spin valve sensors. The micro spheres are moved to and from the sensor surface by switching the current line on and off, wherein said surface is treated with a cross linker (biotin) that can specifically bind to target particles of interest.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2004235197A"><text>US 2004/235197</text></patcit> claims an apparatus for detecting analytes or binding reactions using measurements of double refraction in bulk media. The samples are magnetized for a period of 20 ms repeatedly with a magnetic pulse, wherein pauses between the pulses are 20 ms.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US2003095897A"><text>US 2003/095897</text></patcit> relates to methods and apparatus that are useful for collecting magnetic materials in one or more magnetic fields and resuspending the particles into a dispersion medium, and optionally repeating collection/re-suspension one or more times in the same or a different medium, by controlling the direction and rate of fluid flow through a fluid flow path to allow for relaxations.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Furthermore, a biosensor comprising an array of sensors, e.g. 100 sensors, based on the magnetic detection of magnetic beads, e.g. superparamagnetic beads, may be used to simultaneously measure the concentration of a large number of different biological molecules (e.g. proteins, DNA) in a solution (e.g. blood). This may be achieved by attaching magnetic beads to target molecule, magnetising these beads with an applied magnetic field and using a Giant Magneto Resistance (GMR) sensor to detect the stray field of the magnetised beads, which stray field is dependent on the concentration. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> shows an example of integrated excitation. A current flowing in current wire 1a generates a magnetic field, which magnetises a magnetic bead 2 which is attached to a target molecule 3. Hence, the beads 2 present at a binding surface 6 of the sensor device each develop a magnetic moment m indicated by the field lines 7. The stray field from the magnetic bead 2 introduces an in-plane magnetisation component H<sub>ext</sub> in the GMR sensor 4, which results in a resistance change ΔR<sub>GMR</sub>(H<sub>ext</sub>). In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the in-plane component H<sub>ext</sub> is indicated by arrow 5.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In order to achieve a short assay time, the magnetic beads 2 have to be magnetically actuated, i.e. by means of magnetic actuation attracted to the binding surface 6. Thereafter, the binding process needs to take place as efficiently as possible. This means that (i) the particles need to be concentrated onto the binding zones with highest detection sensitivity by the sensors, and (ii) that all particles need to have optimum possibilities to form the desired (bio)chemical bonds to the binding surface. A disadvantage of attraction by a large external permanent magnet is that the magnetic particles form large and static aggregates on the surface, which does not give optimum binding conditions to the binding<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> surface. In addition, magnets can give large in-plane magnetic fields 5, which influence the sensitivity of the magnetic sensor due to shifting of the operation point on the non linear R(H) resistance change characteristic of the sensor. Furthermore, the large magnetic fields may de-orientate the sensor and introduce magnetic build-up in the sensor due to its hysteric characteristic.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">It is an object of the present invention to provide improved apparatus and methods for biosensing. An advantage of embodiments of the present invention can be optimisation of the 'bind' process, e.g. by increasing the contact efficiency (to maximise the rate of specific biological binding when the bead is close to the binding surface) and/or the contact time (the total time that individual beads are in contact with the binding surface. An advantage of embodiments of the present invention can be enhancing the speed of the detection of target molecules in a fluid when using magnetic particles as labels in a sensor device such as e.g. a magnetic sensor device for the detection of the magnetic particles. An advantage of the present invention is a sensor suitable for high rate biosensing. The methods and apparatus according to embodiments of the present invention allow for the detection of target molecules such as e.g. proteins, antibodies, nucleic acids (e.g. DNA, RNA), peptides, oligo- or polysaccharides or sugars, in fluids, for example, biological fluids, such as saliva, sputum, blood, blood plasma, interstitial fluid or urine, with high sensitivity and specificity.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The above objective is accomplished by a method and device according to the present invention.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Particular and preferred aspects of the invention are set out in the accompanying independent and dependent claims.

The magnetic particles preferably stay within 100 µm from the binding surface and more preferably stay within 10 µm from the binding surface in a direction substantially perpendicular to the binding surface. Randomisation of the magnetic particles may be performed e.g. by changing a magnetic gradient in time, in amplitude, in frequency (depending on the amplitude and the magnetic anisotropy of the magnetic particles) or in direction.

An advantage of the present invention can be improving the speed of a biosensing process performed by using a sensor device, e.g. but not limited to a magnetic sensor device. In biosensing processes using a magnetic sensor device, magnetic particles or beads are directly or indirectly attached to target molecules such as e.g. proteins, antibodies, nucleic acids (e.g. DNR, RNA), peptides, oligo- or polysaccharides or sugars, small molecules, hormones, drugs, metabolites, cells or cell fractions, tissue fractions. These molecules are to be detected in a fluid, which can be the original sample or can already have been processed before insertion into the biosensor (e.g. diluted, digested, degraded, biochemically modified, filtered, dissolved into a buffer). The original fluids can be for example, biological fluids, such as saliva, sputum, blood, blood plasma, interstitial fluid or urine, or other fluids such as drinking fluids, environmental fluids, or a fluid that results from sample pre-treatment. The fluid can for example comprise elements of solid sample material, e.g. from biopsies, stool, food, feed, environmental samples.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The surface of the sensor device may be modified by attaching molecules to it, which are suitable to bind the target molecules which are present in the fluid. The surface of the sensor can also be provided with organisms (e.g. viruses or cells) or fractions of organisms (e.g. tissue fractions, cell fractions, membranes). The surface of biological binding can be in direct contact with the sensor chip, but there can also be a gap between the binding surface and the sensor chip. For example, the binding surface can be a material that is separated from the chip, e.g. a porous material. Such a material can be a lateral-flow or a flow-through material, e.g. consisting of microchannels in silicon, glass, plastic, etc. The binding surface can be parallel to the surface of the sensor chip. Alternatively, the binding<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> surface can be under an angle with respect to, e.g. perpendicular to, the surface of the sensor chip.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Before the magnetic particles or the target molecules/magnetic particles-combination can be bound to the surface of the sensor device, they have to be attracted towards that surface. Embodiments of the present invention now provide a method for improving the speed of biosensing by improving the speed of at least one of the 'attracting' and/or the 'binding' phases in the assay protocol as described in the background section. According to embodiments of the present invention, the attracting phase may be speeded up by magnetic actuation of target molecules/magnetic particles combinations. The 'bind' process may be optimised by increasing the contact efficiency (to maximise the rate of specific biological binding when the bead is close to the binding surface) as well as the contact time (the total time that individual beads are in contact with the binding surface.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In a first aspect, not explicitly illustrated in the drawings, the present invention proposes the use of means for re-arranging and randomizing the position of individual magnetic particles with respect to the binding sites on the binding surface, in order to give binding sites on all individual particles a substantial probability to have a contact time with binding sites on the binding surface, and thus in order to optimise the bind process. It has to be noted that magnetic particles can be used in various types of assays, e.g. a binding or unbinding assay, sandwich assay, displacement assay, inhibition assay, or competition assay. In the following, focus will be laid on a binding assay, more in particular a sandwich assay, but the described methods are not limited to this assay type.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In a biosensor assay, the 'attract' and 'bind' phases need to be made as efficient and as fast as possible. In the 'attract' phase the beads are concentrated from the bulk of the fluid to a zone near the sensor binding surface. The time needed to attract the particles toward the binding surface should be as low as possible, lower than 30 minutes, preferably lower than 10 minutes, and more preferred lower than 1 minute.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In the 'bind' phase, the resulting bead ensemble is brought even closer to the binding surface in a way to optimise the occurrence of desired (bio)chemical binding to the capture or binding area on the sensor, i.e. the area where there is a high detection sensitivity by the sensors, e.g. magnetic sensors, and a high biological specificity of binding. It is not trivial to optimise the 'bind' process. Therefore, there is a need to increase the contact efficiency (to maximise the rate of specific biological binding when the bead is close to the binding surface) as well as the contact time (the total time that individual beads are in contact with the binding surface).<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0046" num="0046">First, the contact efficiency will be discussed. The contact efficiency deals with the contact between the surface of the beads that are closest to the sensor and the surface of the binding region on the sensor. Ideally, the distance between the biological molecules on the surface of the beads and the biological molecules on surface of the binding region of the sensor should be in the order of the size of the biological molecules, for example, a distance of 0-100 nm.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">For a single bead near a surface and exposed to a magnetic field gradient, the distance of approach ξ can be estimated by comparing the thermal fluctuations with the magnetic force: <maths id="math0001" num="(6)"><math display="block"><mi>F</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">ξ</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>m</mi><mo>∇</mo><mi>B</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">ξ</mi><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="italic">kT</mi><mo>⇒</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">ξ</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mi mathvariant="italic">kT</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>∇</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow></mfrac></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="129" he="15" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0048" num="0048">A magnetic field gradient VB thus has to be generated in order to attract the particles or beads toward the binding surface. The larger the magnetic field gradient VB, and thus the larger the force F on the beads, the smaller the distance of approach ξ. Magnetic field gradients VB may be generated in different ways. For example, by an external means (e.g. an external magnet or coil). An external coil may, for example, generate a magnetic field gradient of 25 T/m. Magnetic field gradients may also be generated by at least one on-chip current wire. In that case the gradient may be estimated from: <maths id="math0002" num="(7)"><math display="block"><mfrac><mi mathvariant="italic">dB</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">dR</mi></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">μ</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mi>I</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">π</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="137" he="12" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> wherein I is the current through the current wire and r is the distance between the magnetic bead and the current wire. As an example, a current of 10 mA at a distance of 0.5 µm from the bead may generate, at the level of the bead, a field gradient of 8.10<sup>3</sup> T/m.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">As another example, the magnitude of the magnetic field gradient in the vicinity of magnetic material embedded in the sensor surface is calculated. The example is taken that magnetic beads are embedded in the material. The magnitude of the magnetic field gradient at a distance r away from the centre of a spherical bead with moment m is approximately given by: <maths id="math0003" num="(8)"><math display="block"><mo>∇</mo><mi>B</mi><mo>≈</mo><mfrac><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">μ</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">π</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>⁢</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>6</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>4</mn></msup></mfrac></math><img id="ib0003" file="imgb0003.tif" wi="129" he="15" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0050" num="0050">For simplicity, the angle dependency of the gradient, which may give differences of a factor two, has been ignored in equation (8). For example, a 300 nm bead with magnetic moment m = 10<sup>-16</sup> Am<sup>2</sup> may generate a gradient of about 2.10<sup>3</sup> T/m at a distance of 400 nm.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0051" num="0051">For example, assuming a field gradient of 10<sup>3</sup> T/m. From equation (6) it can be calculated that for a magnetic moment m, resulting from a single bead structure (or from a multi-bead structure as in the second aspect of the present invention), of 10<sup>-15</sup> Am<sup>2</sup> or more, a distance of approach or attraction ξ can be achieved of 4 nm (if m = 10<sup>-15</sup> Am<sup>2</sup>) or less (if m is larger than 10<sup>-15</sup> Am<sup>2</sup>) at room temperature. This means that very small distances can in principle be achieved already by using practical magnetic field gradients, e.g. in the range between 10 T/m and 10000 T/m, so that efficient biological binding can take place.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Secondly, the contact time will be discussed. When a large number of beads or particles is attracted to the binding surface of a sensor device and the complete binding surface becomes covered with magnetic particles, the magnetic structure thus formed will be very dense but also static and rigid. Due to translational constraints, a large fraction of particles cannot reach the binding surface and will not have a chance to form a desired specific biochemical bond. This causes a loss of signal in the biosensor and thus a false reading or an unnecessarily long assay time.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The inventors have realised that individual beads have a freedom of rotation. For example, superparamagnetic beads have a very weak magnetic anisotropy, so a very weak coupling exists between the magnetic moment and the physical orientation of the particle. Thermal energy causes rotation of the magnetic beads (rotational diffusion) and as a result the beads will expose a significant part of their surface area to the binding surface. The surface-to-surface exposure will allow the formation of specific biochemical bonds.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">According to the present invention, the magnetic particles may be randomised regularly or irregularly, e.g. by removing and re-applying the magnetic fields attracting the individual magnetic particles to the binding surface of the sensor device, or by rotational excitation of the beads, or by the application of fluid motion such as stirring or acoustic vibrations. With randomised is meant that magnetic particles which are attracted to the binding surface but which do not bind to the binding surface are shortly moved away from the binding surface but never get very far from the binding surface, i.e. they stay within a short distance from the binding surface in the z-direction, i.e. a direction perpendicular to the binding surface. Preferably, they stay within 100 µm from the binding surface and more preferably they stay within 10 µm from the binding surface in a direction substantially perpendicular to the binding surface. According to the invention, the particles are moved away from the binding surface such that 90% of the magnetic particles which are attracted to the binding surface stay within 10% or less of the sample volume. Particles do not disperse back into the complete sample volume. The repeated attractions and randomisations ensure<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> that biological material coupled to magnetic beads have a high probability to be at least once in contact with the binding sites on the binding surface of the sensor device during the total assay, i.e. that all targets have a substantial probability to have a contact time with binding sites on the binding surface of the sensor device.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The magnetic particles or beads are thus attracted toward and onto the binding surface by means of a magnetic field gradient.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The assay should be designed to achieve maximum specific binding (by attraction of the beads toward the binding surface) and minimum hindering of binding (all beads should have a significant probability to interact with binding sites on the binding surface of the sensor device), and minimum unwanted unbinding (due to forces breaking the desired bonds between beads and binding surface).</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">As explained, rotation of magnetic particles may be used to optimise the exposure rate and binding rate in a biochemical assay. The rotation can be caused by thermal energy but can also be generated or enhanced by time-varying applied fields. Firstly, when magnetic particles are present in solution, rotation of these magnetic particles can enhance the interaction and binding rate between the biological material in solution and the surface of the magnetic particles. This, for example, applies to the fishing or catching phase in an assay, wherein magnetic particles are used to bind to specific biological material in a sample solution and/or to extract this material. Secondly, when magnetic particles are rotated with respect to another body, for example the surface of a biochip or the surface of a cell, the interaction and binding rate between the label and the other body can be enhanced. The increase of the binding rate may particularly be of importance when the surface area of the label is large with respect to the size of the relevant molecular binding region on the magnetic particle. This is, for example, the case in low-concentration assays, when a catching or fishing step yields magnetic particles with only very little biological material of interest on the magnetic particle surface. For reference, some calculations on the role of orientation and rotation in biomolecular kinetics can be found in "<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>K.S. Schmitz and J. M. Schurr: 'The role of orientation constraints and rotation diffusion in biomolecular solution kinetics', J. Phys. Chem., vol. 76, p. 534 (1972</text></nplcit>)".</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The ideal rotation speed is given by an optimal binding rate at acceptable unbinding rate for the biochemical bond that needs to be formed in the given assay time. In other words, the rotation is optimised for sensitivity as well as specificity. To avoid removal of the desired specific bindings, the applied forces need to be below 1 nN.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In a second aspect the present invention furthermore proposes the use of multi-particle magnetic structures, such as e.g., but not limited thereto, chains or columns of magnetic particles or beads, e.g. for achieving enhanced speed in biosensing. More particularly, according to the invention, multi-particle structures are used to increase the speed of the process steps 'attract' and/or 'bind' in a biosensing protocol. It has to be noted that magnetic particles can be used in various types of assays, e.g. a binding or unbinding assay, sandwich assay, displacement assay, inhibition assay, or competition assay. In the following, focus will be laid on a binding assay, more in particular a sandwich assay, but the described methods are not limited to this assay type.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">An advantage of using multi-particle structures is that individual particles inside the structures have a higher magnetic moment due to the reduced demagnetising fields. In addition, the total magnetic moments of such structures, and therefore also the magnetic forces, are larger than in case of individual particles. The force that can be applied to a magnetic multi-particle structure is given by equation (1): <maths id="math0004" num="(1)"><math display="block"><mi>F</mi><mo>=</mo><mo>∇</mo><mfenced separators=""><mi>m</mi><mn>.</mn><mi>B</mi></mfenced><mo>≈</mo><mi>m</mi><mo>∇</mo><mi>B</mi></math><img id="ib0004" file="imgb0004.tif" wi="129" he="9" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> wherein m is the magnetic moment of the multi-particle structure, B the applied magnetic field and VB the gradient of the applied magnetic field. A chain of, for example, 100 particles can experience an approximately 100-fold higher force than a single particle or bead due to the higher total magnetic moment m of the multi-particle structure. Multi-particle structures according to the second aspect of the present invention may comprise a combination of large and small particles but may also be structures comprising particles with similar size. Typically, multi-particle structures may comprise 5 to several 1000 magnetic particles or beads, but even higher numbers are also possible.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In the following description the second aspect of the invention will be described by means of chains or columns of magnetic particles. It has, however, to be understood that this is only for the ease of explanation and that this is not limiting to the invention. Other multi-particle structures can also be used according to the second aspect of the invention, e.g. clusters of magnetic particles, or single or multiple loops, or rings of magnetic particles.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Thus, one example of a multi-particle structure which can be used according to the second aspect of this invention is a chain 10 of magnetic particles or beads. It is known that magnetic particles or beads form chains 10 when the inter-bead magnetic forces exceed the thermal motion. Magnetising magnetic particles or beads in a magnetic field has the effect of inducing a dipole-dipole interaction between neighbouring beads, which, if the<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> interaction energy exceeds the thermal energy of the particles, results in the formation of chains 10 of magnetic particles in the direction of the magnetic field lines. Over time, the chains 10 interact with each other to form columns. In, for example, a uniform magnetic field without field gradients, the chains and columns can arrange in regular patterns due to repulsion caused by the dipole moments. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, which shows magnetic bead interactions and formation of chains 10 in the presence of a uniform magnetic field in a square capillary tube 11 of 50 µm [<nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>Baudry et al., J. Phys. Cond. Matt. 16, R469 (2004</text></nplcit>)].</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The multi-particle structures that are formed are determined by the applied field pattern, the duration of field application, the modulation frequency, the types of bead that are used (e.g. depending on the size, susceptibility, magnetic anisotropy, shape, superparamagnetic, or ferromagnetic properties of the beads) and the concentration of beads. Concerning the field pattern, curved chains can be formed by applying fields with a curvature, for example. To form clusters of particles, a loop-shaped wire can for example be used. The particles will be attracted to the region of highest field in the centre of the wire loop. For obtaining loops or rings 8 of particles, a current wire 9 can be used with a segment that is freely accessible from all sides. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 25</figref>. The field lines will follow the edge of the current wire 9 and the particles will arrange to form a ring or loop 8. Particles having a long relaxation time or having hysteresis will remain in the loop-shape when the magnetic field is removed. Furthermore, magnetic particles initially ordered as chains can form loops or rings when the field is removed.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In the following description, the second aspect of the present invention will be further described by means of chains 10 of beads.

This can be broadened to particles with dissimilar radii. For example, in case of a mixture of large beads with large moments and small beads with small moments, the beads with larger moment will more strongly attract each other for a given center-to-center distance. As a consequence, the large particles can form chains while the particles having a smaller moment will collect around or as close as possible to the poles of the larger particles. Manipulating the larger particle chain directly manipulates the smaller particles.

Such a large ratio of interaction energy of two parallel dipoles in contact and the thermal energy implies that the force of magnetic interaction is much bigger than the thermal influence on the magnetic particles or beads, resulting in the formation of chains 10 of magnetic particles.

Superparamagnetic particles or beads are ferromagnetic beads so small that they quickly lose their magnetic moment in absence of an external magnetic field. Superparamagnetic particles or beads are readily magnetised to large magnetic moments, facilitating detection, yet the mutual magnetic attraction can be switched off, preventing irreversible aggregation. In general, superparamagnetic particles or beads with a diameter of, for example, about 300 nm may require a field of only 4 to 10 mT to form chains 10 of beads. The speed of chain formation and the chain length may be determined by the particle or bead concentration and the particle or bead magnetic moment [<nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>Zhang, Phys.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> Rev. E51, 2099 (1995</text></nplcit>)]. The chains 10 according to embodiments of the present invention may, for example, have a length in the order of about 100 particles.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The surface of the magnetic particles or beads may be prepared to allow reversible aggregation, i.e. the formation of multi-particle structures in the presence of a magnetic field and the dissociation of the multi-particle structures when the magnetic fields are subsequently removed. It is shown by experiments that reversible chain formation is possible with e.g. 300 nm particles obtainable from Ademtech. The surface of the beads may be prepared to avoid sticking and allow reversible chain formation. This may be done by, for example, applying a polymer layer for entropic repulsion, by steric hindrance and/or by applying electrical charges on the surface. At very high fields, some degree of irreversible binding may take place due to a too close approach and the resulting non-specific adhesion. In that case the applied fields should be reduced.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">As already stated above, in a biosensor assay, the 'attract' and 'bind' phases need to be made as efficient and as fast as possible. In the 'attract' phase the beads are concentrated from the bulk of the fluid to a zone near the sensor binding surface. The time needed to attract the particles toward the binding surface should be as low as possible, lower than 30 minutes, preferably lower than 10 minutes, and more preferred lower than 1 minute.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">In the 'bind' phase, the resulting bead ensemble is brought even closer to the binding surface in a way to optimise the occurrence of desired (bio)chemical binding to the capture or binding area on the sensor, i.e. the area where there is a high detection sensitivity by the sensors, e.g. magnetic sensors, and a high biological specificity of binding. It is not trivial to optimise the 'bind' process. Therefore, there is a need to increase the contact efficiency (to maximise the rate of specific biological binding when the bead is close to the binding surface) as well as the contact time (the total time that individual beads are in contact with the binding surface).</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Contact efficiency and contact time have been discussed above with respect to the first aspect of the present invention.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">With regard to contact time, when a large number of beads or particles is attracted to the binding surface of a sensor device and the complete binding surface becomes covered with magnetic particles, the multi-particle structure will be very dense but also static and rigid. Due to translational constraints, a large fraction of particles cannot reach the binding surface and will not have a chance to form a desired specific biochemical bond. This causes a loss of signal in the biosensor and thus a false reading or an unnecessarily long assay time.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></p><p id="p0072" num="0072">The above analysis leads to the conclusion that multi-bead structures do generate a high contact area with the binding surface, but cannot be beneficially used in a magnetic biosensor due to the low translational dynamics inside the multi-bead structure. However, the inventors have realised that there is a way to solve this. Therefore, it must be realised that inside the multi-bead structures, individual beads maintain a freedom of rotation. For example, superparamagnetic beads have a very weak magnetic anisotropy, so a very weak coupling exists between the magnetic moment and the physical orientation of the particle. Thermal energy causes rotation of the magnetic beads (rotational diffusion) and as a result the beads will expose a significant part of their surface area to the binding surface. The surface-to-surface exposure will allow the formation of specific biochemical bonds.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">In other words, multi-bead structures can be used in a biosensor provided that, according to the present invention, the structures are regularly or irregularly randomised, e.g. by removing and re-applying the magnetic fields attracting the multi-particle structures to the binding surface of the sensor device, or by rotational excitation of the beads and bead structures, or by the application of fluid motion such as stirring or acoustic vibrations, With randomised is meant that magnetic particles which are attracted to the binding surface but which do not bind to the binding surface are shortly moved away from the binding surface but never get very far from the binding surface, i.e. they stay within a short distance from the binding surface in the z-direction. Preferably, they stay within 100 µm from the binding surface and more preferably they stay within 10 µm from the binding surface in a direction substantially perpendicular to the binding surface. According to the invention, the particles are moved away from the binding surface such that 90% of the magnetic particles which are part of a multi-particle structure stay within 10% or less of the sample volume. Particles do not disperse back into the complete sample volume. The repeated attractions and randomisations ensure that biological material coupled to magnetic beads have a high probability to be at least once in contact with the binding sites on the binding surface of the sensor device during the total assay, i.e. that all targets have a substantial probability to have a contact time with binding sites on the binding surface of the sensor device.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">The magnetic particles or beads are thus attracted toward and onto the binding surface by means of a magnetic field gradient. The beads involved in the binding process will be part of multi-bead structures, characterised in that the beads have a probability larger than 80% to have the surface of at least one other bead in their vicinity, i.e. within a bead-surface to bead-surface distance of two times the bead diameter.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><p id="p0075" num="0075">In conclusion, the assay should be designed to achieve maximum specific binding (by attraction of the beads toward the binding surface) and minimum hindering of binding (all beads should have a significant probability to interact with binding sites on the binding surface of the sensor device), and minimum unwanted unbinding (due to forces breaking the desired bonds between beads and binding surface).</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">As explained, rotation of magnetic particles and multi-bead structures may be used to optimise the exposure rate and binding rate in a biochemical assay. The rotation can be caused by thermal energy but can also be generated or enhanced by time-varying applied fields. Firstly, when magnetic particles are present in solution, rotation of these magnetic particles can enhance the interaction and binding rate between the biological material in solution and the surface of the magnetic particles. This, for example, applies to the fishing or catching phase in an assay, wherein magnetic particles are used to bind to specific biological material in a sample solution and/or to extract this material. Secondly, when magnetic particles are rotated with respect to another body, for example the surface of a biochip or the surface of a cell, the interaction and binding rate between the label and the other body can be enhanced. The increase of the binding rate may particularly be of importance when the surface area of the label is large with respect to the size of the relevant molecular binding region on the magnetic particle. This is, for example, the case in low-concentration assays, when a catching or fishing step yields magnetic particles with only very little biological material of interest on the magnetic particle surface. For reference, some calculations on the role of orientation and rotation in biomolecular kinetics can be found in "<nplcit id="ncit0007" npl-type="s"><text>K.S. Schmitz and J. M. Schurr: 'The role of orientation constraints and rotation diffusion in biomolecular solution kinetics', J. Phys. Chem., vol. 76, p. 534 (1972</text></nplcit>)".</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">The ideal rotation speed is given by an optimal binding rate at acceptable unbinding rate for the biochemical bond that needs to be formed in the given assay time. In other words, the rotation is optimised for sensitivity as well as specificity. To avoid removal of the desired specific bindings, the applied forces need to be below 1 nN.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">According to a first embodiment of the second aspect of the present invention, the use of magnetic fields which are oriented essentially perpendicularly to the sensor surface 14 of the sensor device 15, i.e. according to the orientation axes mentioned in the drawings, oriented in the z-direction, is described. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 3</figref>. A uniform magnetic field, indicated by arrow 12, induces the formation of particle or bead chains 10, comprising a plurality of magnetic particles or beads 13, as described earlier. Then, a magnetic field gradient may be generated for attracting the magnetic particle or bead chains 10 toward the<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> surface 14 of the sensor device 15. The magnetic field gradient may be provided by at least one magnetic field gradient generating means 16. In the example illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 3</figref> the magnetic field gradient is generated by means of an external coil 16 which is positioned under the sensor device 15 and which is used to generate forces toward and from the sensor surface 14. In embodiments of the present invention, the sensor device 15, which may be used according to the present invention, may comprise at least one magnetic sensor element and at least one magnetic field generating means for generating a magnetic field for forming bead chains 10. The magnetic sensor element may preferably be a magneto-resistive sensor element such as, for example, a GMR, TMR or AMR sensor element. Bio-molecular diagnostics generally involves a re-usable reader system and a disposable unit in which the sample is entered. Field-generating coils can be part of the reader or of the disposable unit. In the disposable unit, the coil, can be embedded in the outer material (generally plastic) or be integrated onto a chip that also performs the detection of the magnetic field of the beads. According to alternative embodiments, the sensor device 15 may comprise at least one nonmagnetic sensor element, e.g. an optical sensor element.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">The z-oriented chains of beads can easily be concentrated into a small area close to or even onto the sensor by applying a small magnetic gradient field in addition to a more uniform field with larger magnitude. This is sketched in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 26</figref> which shows a view along the z-axis, i.e. along the long axis of the bead chains 10 which are represented as open circles.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">The z-oriented field generates the bead chains 10. The local current wire generates a field gradient in the middle of the loop 30. When the field generated by the loop 30 has the same orientation as the external field, the field is larger inside the loop 30 than outside the loop. Therefore, the chains 10 are attracted into the middle of the loop 30. When the current is reversed, the field generated by the loop 30 will oppose the external field in the middle of the loop 30, and as a consequence the chains 10 will be pushed out of the loop 30. Similarly, <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 27</figref>, which is a top view along the long axis of the bead chains 10 of a configuration comprising two current wires with a sensor in the middle, illustrates how currents in current wires can be used to concentrate bead chains 10 onto a sensor binding region.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">It has to be noted that the presence of a magnetic sensor or other magnetic materials in a chip can influence the fields near the sensor, due to magnetostatic or flux guiding properties. An advantage of the out-of-plane chain orientation is that flux guiding is low due to the in-plane shape anisotropy of magnetic thin films. The magnetic field gradient<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> may be modulated in-phase with the modulation of the chain-forming magnetic field 12, which results in attraction of bead chains 10 to the sensor surface 14. When the modulation is applied in anti-phase, the field gradient is reversed and as a result the bead chains 10 may be repelled from the sensor surface 14. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref> which shows the effect of repelling (reference number 17) and attracting (reference number 18) magnetic particle or bead chains 10 from and to the surface 14 of a sensor device 15 respectively. Repelling the bead chains 10 may generate stringency, which may differentiate between (strongly) bound and weakly bound beads or particles 13 on the sensor surface 14.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">The flow resistance of bead chains 10 is lower for chains 10 travelling along their length axis than for chains 10 travelling perpendicular to their long axis. In this way the shape of the container of the fluid sample and the resulting required travelling direction toward the sensor can influence the choice of applied fields.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">In the above, both the magnetic field for forming the multi-particle magnetic structures, in the example given chains 10, is applied in a direction substantially perpendicular to the sensor surface 14, i.e. in the z-direction. Due to these fields perpendicularly applied to the sensor surface 14, the particle or bead chains 10 are oriented in a direction substantially perpendicular to the sensor surface 14, as is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">In case the binding surface 40 is parallel to the sensor surface 14, located on or near the sensor surface 14, the above-described embodiment has the disadvantage that not all magnetic particles 13 can come very close to the binding surface 40 due to the multi-particle structures 10 having their long axis in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the binding surface 40. However, in case the binding surface 40 is a porous medium with walls essentially perpendicular to the sensor surface 14, the beads 13 in the multi-particle structure 10 which are lying in a plane substantially parallel to the binding surface 40 can make good contact to the binding surface 40. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 28</figref>, where the binding surface 40 is provided on walls of a porous multi-channel structure, which walls are oriented perpendicularly with respect to the sensor surface 40. The channels in the multi-channel structure may e.g. be tubes or slits. The multi-particle structures 10 may attracted to the binding surface 40 e.g. by means of a magnetic gradient in a direction perpendicular to the binding surface 40, in the embodiment shown parallel to the sensor surface 14. After the 'attract' phase, a 'binding' phase takes place, i.e. binding sites on particles 13 in the multi-particle structures 10 come into contact and bind with binding sites on the binding surface 40. According to the present invention, the position of individual magnetic particles 13 in the multi-particle structures 10 is randomised with respect to the binding sites on the binding<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> surface 40 to give the binding sites on the individual particles 13 in the multi-particle structures 10 a substantial probability to have a contact time with binding sites on the binding surface 40. This randomisation may be done by changing the magnetic field gradient in a direction perpendicular to the binding surface 40. After the binding phase, the multi-particle structures 10 are no longer attracted to the binding surface 40, unbound particles 13 are washed away and detection of particles bound onto binding surface 40 can take place. This detection can e.g. be a magnetic detection or an optical detection. Typically in biological tests the concentration of beads is limited so that a plurality of bound beads in one channel are often not to be expected, and thus the presence of a bead in a microchannel can be optically detected. If the concentration is expected to be higher, a measurement period can be split up into a plurality of time intervals. A high target concentration will be detected very rapidly (for example after one time interval, e.g. in a few seconds) while low target concentrations can be detected after a much longer processing time (after a plurality of time intervals, e.g. minutes to hours). Alternatively, if a plurality of beads present in one microchannel are to be optically detected, the labels can be made fluorescent. If light is impinged into the microchannels, all beads will receive light, and fluorescent light will be sent out, so that the presence of all the beads in the microchannel can be detected.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">When the binding surface 40 is essentially parallel to the sensor surface 14, in particular the binding surface 40 is part of the sensor surface 14, to achieve a small distance between most of the particles or beads 13 in a chain 10 and the binding surface 40, it is advantageous to align the bead chains 10 along the binding surface 40, i.e. to apply magnetic fields with strong in-plane components, i.e. in the x- or y-direction. This is described in a second embodiment of the present invention. Magnetic fields with strong in-plane components may be applied by off-chip as well as by on-chip field-generating means. On-chip field generation has the strong advantage that the unavoidable magnetic crosstalk to the magnetic sensing element, e.g. a GMR, is well defined.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Hence, according to the second aspect of the present invention, a magnetic field generating means is adapted to form multi-particle magnetic structures 10 which have a long axis lying parallel to the binding surface 40.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">A magnetic field is applied with a strong in-plane component parallel with the binding surface 40 of the sensor device 15, e.g. by placing the device near a permanent magnet and/or a coil.

This process can be repeated several times in order to combine (i) efficient concentration of beads or particles 13 near the binding surface 40, (ii) efficient contact between beads 13 and binding surface 40, and (iii) regular re-arrangement and randomisation of the beads 13 in order to give all beads 13 a substantial probability to interact with the binding sites on the binding surface 40. Changing between attracting the particles to the binding surface 40 and randomising may be controlled by means of a reader, or it may be implemented on a chip which may be part of the sensor device 15 or which may be a separate signal-processing chip in the sensor device 15.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">Local current wires are useful to make field gradients (unit T/m) with relatively small currents, e.g. smaller than 100 mA.

An additional external magnetic field with low gradient, however, does not realise the force required for attracting the magnetic particles or beads 13 close to the binding surface 40. Preferably, AC fields may be used for these additional external magnetic fields. DC fields, which may originate from e.g. permanent magnets, will shift the R(H) resistance change characteristic from the magnetic sensor element 23 and introduce gain variations. On the contrary, AC fields will only introduce additional frequency components, which may or may not interfere with the detection mechanism and may or may not introduce gain errors. Therefore, preferably AC fields may be used which have a frequency such that the detection mechanism is not affected. Furthermore, the attack and decay of the envelope of such additional external magnetic fields should be relatively slow compared to the actual frequency in order to not generate magnetic build-up in the sensor 10. Abrupt switching of magnetic fields will introduce remnant<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> magnetic fields in the sensor.

The magnetic field gradient attracts the multi-particle magnetic structures or magnetic bead chains 10 to the sensor surface 14 of the sensor device 15.</p><p id="p0127" num="0127">In other embodiments according to the present invention, uniform external fields, non-uniform external fields or on-chip current wires may be used to actuate the magnetic particles 13. <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 24</figref> illustrates examples of sequences of signals to drive the different field-generating means. Curve 30 illustrates on-chip currents in current wires 22a, 22b for the attraction of magnetic particles or beads 13 toward the sensor surface 14. Curve 31 illustrates the excitation sequence of a small external coil. Part 31a of curve 31 represents the attraction of the beads from the bulk to the sensor surface 14 and part 31b represents the repelling force into the bulk. Curve 32 illustrates the excitation sequence for a large coil to magnetise the particles or beads 13 and form columns or chains 10.</p><p id="p0128" num="0128">The present invention has been described mainly by using magneto-resistive sensors 23 for the detection of magnetic particles or beads 13. It has, however, to be noted that the beads 13 may also be detected by other magnetic sensor means, such as, for example, with Hall sensors, coils, etc.<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --></p><p id="p0129" num="0129">As earlier described, in embodiments according to this present invention, enhanced rotation of the beads 13 can also used to improve the speed of the 'binding' step.</p><p id="p0130" num="0130">The second aspect of the present invention shows different advantages. Due to the larger volume and resulting larger shear forces, multi-particle structures 10 are more sensitive to fluid washing steps than single particles 13. This may result in more effective washing and less non-specific binding.</p><p id="p0131" num="0131">Furthermore, gravitational forces may be higher for multi-particle structures 10 than for individual particles 13. The present invention, in the different aspects, has been focused on the use of magnetic forces. However, gravitational forces will need to be corrected for and can be used in advantage (e.g. for the 'attracting' step).</p><p id="p0132" num="0132">Another advantage of using multi-particle structures in accordance with the second aspect of the invention, is that aggregates 10 of magnetic beads 13 have a larger (collective) magnetic moment and hence can be manipulated using smaller field gradients than those required to manipulate individual beads 13. These magnetic field gradients may, for example, be produced by a magnet or coil placed beneath the sensor device 15 and/or by on-chip current wires 22a, 22b.</p><p id="p0133" num="0133">Magnetic beads 13, as used in any of the first or second aspects of the invention, can be attracted to a sensor surface 14 from a large volume sample, using magnetic forces alone or in combination with the sedimentation and diffusion processes. Furthermore, chains 10 of magnetic beads 13 in accordance with the second aspect of the invention can be attracted toward the binding surface 40, which locally creates a high bead concentration, a good contact between beads and sensor binding surface 40, and thus an increased binding rate.</p><p id="p0134" num="0134">The processes of the beads 13 near the sensor surface 14 (e.g. attract, bind, stringency, and their repetitions) can all be measured as a function of time. The data are indicative of the kinetics of the processes. The kinetics depend on the target concentration in the solution, and as such the data can indicate what the target concentration was as soon as the signal appears above the noise. Also, the measurement of kinetics allows the measurement in a large dynamic range, because a high target concentration will be detected very rapidly (e.g. in a few seconds) while low target concentrations can be detected after a much longer processing time (e.g. minutes to hours). Also, the kinetics and noise signals can be analysed as a quality control, to check if the assay has evolved correctly and ensure for the end-user that the test result is reliable.<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --></p><p id="p0135" num="0135">It is to be understood that although preferred embodiments, specific constructions and configurations, as well as materials, have been discussed herein for devices according to the present invention, various changes or modifications in form and detail may be made without departing from the scope of this invention. For example, the invention has been described by means of magnetic detection of the magnetic particles 13. The magnetic detection can be done by magnetic sensors integrated in the disposable part (the chip and/or the cartridge) but it has to be understood that the magnetic sensors can also be part of the re-usable reader system (e.g. as a read-head that is brought close to the cartridge). Furthermore, according to the invention, the magnetic particles 13 may also be detected in any other suitable way, e.g. by optical detection means. The optical detector can be part of the disposable (the chip and/or the cartridge) or of the re-usable reader system.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56979572" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Sensorvorrichtung (15) zum Detektieren von Magnetpartikeln (13), die in einem Probenvolumen vorliegen, wobei die Sensorvorrichtung (15) eine Bindungsfläche (40) mit darauf befindlichen Bindungsstellen aufweist und Folgendes umfasst:
