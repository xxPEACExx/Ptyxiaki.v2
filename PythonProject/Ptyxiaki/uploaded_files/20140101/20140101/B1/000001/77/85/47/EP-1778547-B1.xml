to an apparatus for sealing food containers, and more specifically pertains to an apparatus for sealing food containers with a sealing film.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Various forms of apparatus are known hi the prior art for sealing food containers. The following commonly assigned patents disclose various forms of tray sealing machines including machines that are automated or manual: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5784858A"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 5,784,858</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5946887A"><text>5,946,887</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6499271A"><text>6,499,271</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6571534A"><text>6,571,534</text></patcit>; and <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US6681546A"><text>6,681,546</text></patcit>. The machines disclosed in these U.S. patents are very effective at sealing food trays. However, there exists the need for a food container apparatus that is cheaper and easier to manufacture so as to be priced at a level so as to be economically attractive to a larger group of consumers.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="FR2008502A"><text>FR-A-2008502</text></patcit> discloses a sealing device in which a roll of film may be laid across containers and then heated.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US3378991A"><text>US 3,378,991</text></patcit> discloses a heat sealing apparatus in which a roll of sealing film is mounted at the back of the apparatus such that the sealing film unrolls from the back towards the front of the apparatus. The sealing film extends below the heater platen, but above the location where the top of the container holder slides beneath the heater platen. The front edge of the sealing film must be held in place by the cutting blade as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">Figs. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">4</figref>. This allows the container holder to slide underneath the sealing film. <figref idrefs="f0006 f0007 f0008 f0009">Figs. 3-8</figref> of depict the operation of the heat sealing apparatus. In particular, a tray may be loaded into the container holder as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">Fig. 3</figref>, and then the container holder with the tray is slid under the heater platen as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 4</figref>. Next, in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 5</figref>, the handle 37 is lowered so as to lower the heater platen and sealing<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> film over the tray and the container holder so as to seal the sealing film on the tray. Then, in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 6</figref>, the handle is lifted so as to lift the heater platen from the tray and container holder. Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 7</figref>, the container holder is slid forward, which in turn, unrolls the sealing film so that it will be positioned under the heater platen for use in sealing over a subsequent tray. In <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 8</figref>, the handle must again be lowered so as to cut the sealing film and to subsequently hold the front edge of the sealing film for subsequent operation. Thus, operation of the prior art apparatus requires the handle to be lowered and raised twice per sealing operation. Further, the cutting blade assembly must be configured in a much more complex manner so as to hold the front edge of the sealing film. A support structure 52 with a separate roller 53 is also required to support the roll of sealing film 48 and to allow the film to be easily unrolled in the proper direction.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The invention is set out in claim 1.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A preferred construction provides an apparatus for sealing food containers using a sealing film.

In general, if the food container 200 is a food tray having a plurality of sealable compartments (205a, 205b, 205c), a gasket-lined opening (55a, 55b, 55c) is provided for each one of the sealable compartments and has a corresponding shape and size. It should be noted that the multi-compartment food tray 200 shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 6</figref> is just one example, and that the food containers may have various shapes and sizes and may be configured for holding liquids such as soup or beverages.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The illustrated gaskets 95a and 95b may be formed of any suitable material and are preferably formed of a resilient rubber, such as a silicone rubber.

The handle 60 may further have a cam 68 positioned between the base ends 63a and 63b of the side arms 62a and 62b. The cam 68 may be made of any suitable material, but is preferably made of an ultra-high molecular weight polymer. The cam 68 may have an eccentric shape or be a cylinder having a central axis. If the cam 68 is cylindrical, it may be mounted between the base ends 63a and 63b of the side arms 62a and 62b such that the central axis of the cylindrical cam 68 is parallel to, but not, coaxial with, the common axis defined by pins 65a and 65b whereby the cylindrical cam 68 is rotated about the common axis as the handle 60 is rotated. The pressure applicator 76 may then be positioned between a portion of the cam 68 and the upper surface 72 of the heater platen 70 whereby, as the handle 60 is rotated from the loading position to the sealing position, the cam 68 rotates and thereby presses downward against the pressure applicator 76, which, in turn, applies pressure to the heater platen 70 causing heater platen 70 to be pressed downward into the sealing position.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0012 f0013 f0014">FIGS. 11A-13B</figref>, the apparatus 10 may further comprise a bracket 80 mounted to the heater platen 70.

The first grooves 30a' and 30b' are U-shaped (see <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 18</figref>) and include an upper section 180 that extends substantially horizontally and open to a front of the base 20' to receive pins 170 extending from the side edges 58c' and 58d' of the container holder 50' such that the container holder 50' is horizontally slidable within the base 20' along the upper section. The first grooves 30a' and 30b' also include a lower section 182 that extends substantially horizontally below the upper section 180 and that does not open to a front of the base 20'. When the container holder 50' is inserted into the upper section 180 of the first grooves 30a' and 30b', the container holder 50' is moved to a rear of the first grooves 30a' and 30b', wherein the pins 170 will fall to the lower section 182 of the first grooves 30a' and 30b'. Since the lower section 182 of the first grooves 30a' and 30b' do not open to the front of the base 20', the container holder 50' will remain connected to the base 20' until the container holder 50' is fully inserted into the base 20' and a rear of the container holder 50' is lifted to move the pins 170 to the upper section 180 of the first grooves 30a' and 30b' to allow removal of the container holder 50'.

The enlarged bottom support 312 maintains the cutting blade holder 306 in the groove 304 (which preferably includes closed ends such that the cutting blade holder 306 is not allowed to slide out of the groove 304). After the film has been sealed to the container 200, the cutting blade holder 306 is slid within the groove 304 by pushing or pulling the push portion 314 and one of the cutting blades 316 will cut the film.

The hold down device 350 is located in front of the cutting blade bracket 300 on the container holder 50' and includes a pair of upstanding posts 308 and a hold down plate 352. The cutting blade bracket 300 and the posts 308 are separated by a step 310 (see <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 18</figref>), with the posts 308 of the hold down device 350 being located below the groove 304 of the cutting blade bracket 300. The hold down plate 352 includes a pair of openings for accepting the posts 308 therein. During use, before the film is sealed to the container 200, the film is initially rolled over the container 200. The hold down plate 352 is then placed on top of the film, with the hold down plate 352 accepting the posts 308. After sealing, the cutting blade holder 306 is slid as discussed above to cut the film. Once the film is cut, an end of the film will<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> raise because the end of the film is located above the step 310 and a portion of the film adjacent the end is located below the step 310 and the hold down plate 352 will force the portion downward, thereby bending the end of the film upward at the step 310.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">The illustrated pressure applicator 76' may include a metal plate 78' placed between the cam 68' and a plurality of springs 400, which in turn abut against a top of the heater platen 70'.
