A gallium nitride-based light emitting device is formed on an insulating sapphire (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) substrate.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The gallium nitride-based light emitting device is classified into Top-Emitting Light Emitting Diodes (TLEDs) and Flip-Chip Light Emitting Diodes (FCLEDs).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The top-emitting light emitting diode allows light to emit through an Ohmic electrode layer that is in contact with a P-type clad layer, and provides a low electric conductivity of the P-type clad layer to allow smooth current injection through the Ohmic electrode layer with transparency and low resistance.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The top-emitting light emitting diode is generally employing a structure of a nickel (Ni) layer and a gold (Au) layer sequential layered on the P-type clad layer.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The nickel layer is known in the art to form a semi-transparent Ohmic contact layer that is annealed in oxygen (O2) atmosphere to have a relative contact resistance of about 10<sup>-3</sup>-10<sup>-4</sup>Ωcm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">When the semi-transparent Ohmic contact layer is annealed at about 500-600°C in the oxygen atmosphere, the semi-transparent Ohmic contact layer provide a low relative contact resistance between the gold (Au) layer and a lower layer portion where the nickel oxide (NiO) is island-shaped as a P-type semiconductor oxide between the gallium nitride that forms the P-type clad layer and the nickel layer that is used as the Ohmic contact layer. Accordingly, a Schottky Barrier Height (SBH) is reduced, thereby facilitate to supply holes as a majority carrier in the vicinity of a surface of the P-type clad layer. As a result, an<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> effective carrier concentration is increased in the vicinity of the surface of the P-type clad layer.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further, after the nickel layer and the gold layer are formed on the P-type clad layer, a reactivation process using the annealing is performed to remove a Mg-H compound to thereby increase a concentration of Magnesium dopants at a surface of the gallium nitride. As a result, the effective carrier concentration of above 10<sup>19</sup> is obtained at the surface of the P-type clad layer. Therefore, tunneling conduction is generated between the P-type clad layer and the Ohmic electrode layer that contains nickel oxide to provide an Ohmic conduction characteristic.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">However, since the top-emitking light emitting diode using a semi-transparent electrode film formed of nickel/gold has a low optic efficiency, it is difficult to embody a large-capacity and high-luminance light emitting device.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In order to embody the large-capacity and high-luminance light emitting device, a flip-chip light emitting device using silver (Ag) or aluminum (A1) that is noticed as a high reflective material is being recently required for development.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">However, silver or aluminum can temporarily provide a high light-emitting efficiency due to its high reflection efficiency, but there is a drawback in that a device life is short since it is difficult to form an Ohmic contact with a lower resistance due to a small work function, and a stable device reliability is not provided since the adhesiveness with the gallium nitride is poor.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In order to solve the above drawback, an Ohmic contact layer providing the high reflectivity despite the low relative contact resistance is being vigorously studied for development.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20020190260A1"><text>U.S. Patent Publication No.: 2002-0190260A1</text></patcit> discloses a structure with nickel/silver sequential layered on the P-type clad layer, but has a drawback in that contact resistance is high, and adhesiveness is low at the time of annealing.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO0147038A"><text>WO 01/47038</text></patcit> describes multilayer contacts to LED devices, including GaN type lasers.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a nitride-based light emitting device according to claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">An addition ratio of the second metal group to tin may be 0.1 to 51 atomic percentages.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The reflective layer may be formed of silver or rhodium.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The metal layer may include: a first metal layer formed on the P-type clad layer; and a second metal layer formed between the first metal layer and the reflective layer, the first metal layer is formed of any one of selected from the second metal group consisting of nickel, cobalt, copper, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, tantalum, rhenium, tungsten, and a lanthanum-based metal, and the second metal layer may be formed of tin.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The second metal layer is formed by addition of any one selected from the second metal group to any one selected from the first metal group.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The metal layer and the reflective layer have a thickness of 0.1 nm to 10 µm.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The N-type clad layer is formed on a substrate that is formed of light transmission material.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a nitride-based light emitting device according to claim 10.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The annealing may be performed at 20°C to 700°C, and the annealing may be performed in gas atmosphere containing at least one of nitrogen, argon, helium, oxygen, hydrogen, and air within a reactor in which the layer structure is installed.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The present invention provides a nitride-based light emitting device having an electrode structure for providing a low resistance characteristic and a high reflectivity, and a method of manufacturing the same.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The above and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent by describing in detail exemplary embodiments thereof with reference to the attached drawings in which:
