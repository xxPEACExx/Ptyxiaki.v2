molding of a single- or multilayered film or sheet, an apparatus for the molding, and to a process for producing a pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet with these.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Processes for film or sheet production by inflation extrusion molding have hitherto been used extensively because films or sheets can be efficiently produced by the processes. However, in the case where a pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet or tape or the like which has a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer on one side is produced by inflation extrusion molding, the following trouble arises. When a pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet which has been extruded from an extruder and inflated into a cylindrical shape is transferred, while being flattened, with stabilizers constituted by guide rollers arranged in rows, then the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer on one side of the pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet sticks to the guide<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> rollers and, hence, the length over which the sheet being transferred is in contact with the guide rollers fluctuates. Because of this, the pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet moves intermittently between the stabilizers and this may result in surface waviness or wrinkles of the pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet. Such prior art processes and apparatusses are disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO03016023A"><text>WO-A-03016023</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">There is hence a technique in which the surfaces of the guide rollers constituting stabilizers are coated with Teflon to diminish the sticking of pressure-sensitive adhesive layers (see, for example, patent document 1).</p><heading id="h0003">Patent Document 1: JP 50-020578 B</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, in the case where a long guide roller is used as each of the guide rollers constituting the stabilizers, the direction of rotation of the guide rollers do not coincide with the direction of resin material spreading when the resin material which has been inflated into a cylindrical shape by blown-film extrusion is folded so as to have an elliptic section. Because of this, even when the surfaces of the guide rollers have been coated with Teflon or the like, the resin material shakes undesirably and is not smoothly spread into a flat tube shape having an elliptic section, resulting in the occasional occurrence of folding wrinkles.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Especially in the case of sheets or films having a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer formed on one side, such<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> as pressure-sensitive adhesive sheets, it has become difficult to cope with the recent pressure-sensitive adhesive layers of various kinds with the mere coating of the surfaces of the guide rollers constituting stabilizers with Teflon or the like as shown in patent document 1. Namely, the mere coating of the surfaces of the guide rollers constituting stabilizers with Teflon or the like as shown in patent document 1 is ineffective in preventing sticking to the guide rollers when the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer formed has high pressure-sensitive adhesive properties, and it is difficult with this technique to fold the cylindrical inflated pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet into a flat tube shape having an elongated elliptic section with avoiding the occurrence of wrinkles or the like on the sheet surface.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide a method of inflation extrusion molding by which a resin material, e.g., a pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet, extruded by blown-film extrusion can be easily deformed into a flat tube shape having an elongated elliptic section and can be inhibited from developing wrinkles or the like upon folding.

The film or sheet which has passed through the space between the stabilizers is hence inhibited from occasionally generating wrinkles upon folding, and a high-quality film or sheet having a predetermined width can be stably produced.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In a preferred embodiment of the method of inflation extrusion molding, the stabilizers comprise roller members arranged in rows and the roller members each are arranged so that the direction of rotation thereof is substantially the same as the direction in which the resin material is spread when deformed into a flat tube shape having an elongated elliptic section, to thereby serve as the guide device.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Since the stabilizers are constituted by roller members arranged in rows, the frictional resistance in the direction in which the extruded resin advances is reduced.

When a pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet or resin material which has been inflated into a cylindrical shape by blown-film extrusion is deformed into a flat tube shape having an elongated elliptic section, stabilizers are used for sandwiching and pressing the cylindrical inflated resin material and deforming it into a flat tube shape having an elongated elliptic section. The stabilizers are constituted by roller members arranged in rows and these roller members each are constituted by a plurality of short rollers rotating in a direction substantially the same as the direction in which the resin material expands and spreads. Due to this constitution, the frictional resistance of contact with the rollers, which restrains the resin material from spreading into a flat tube shape having an elongated elliptic section, is reduced and the resin material can be easily deformed into a flat tube shape having an elongated elliptic section. Because of this, the method of inflation extrusion molding can inhibit generation of wrinkles even in the extrusion molding of a pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet having a pressure-sensitive<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> adhesive layer on one side, not to mention in the inflation extrusion molding of various resin materials.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0027" num="0027"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a diagrammatic view of one embodiment of the apparatus for inflation extrusion molding.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a diagrammatic view of one embodiment of the stabilizers in the apparatus for inflation extrusion molding according to the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a diagrammatic view of another embodiment of the stabilizers in the apparatus for inflation extrusion molding.</li></ul></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The reference numerals and signs used in the drawings denote the followings, respectively.

In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, numeral 1 denotes a die into which one or more resin materials extruded from one or more extruders not shown are introduced. The die 1 has, formed therein, one or more passages for the resin material(s) to be introduced from one or more extruders, although the passages are not shown. The die has concentrically arranged ejection openings through which the resin materials introduced into the die are ejected. In the case where a pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet is formed, a resin material for forming a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer and a resin material for forming a substrate are introduced into the respective passages so that the former and latter resin materials will constitute an outer layer and an inner layer, respectively. The disposition of the substrate-forming resin material so as to constitute an inner layer is intended to locate the substrate part inside when the flat tube shape having an elongated elliptic section is folded, as will be described later.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, numeral 2 denotes a resin material which has been extruded and ejected from the die 1 through an ejection opening and inflated into a cylindrical shape having a predetermined diameter.

The angle of aperture θ between the stabilizers 5a and 5b preferably is appropriately selected according to the viscosity of the resin material 2, and it is necessary for the selection to take account of the gradient at which the cylindrical inflated resin material 2 is deformed between the stabilizers 5a and 5b, the area of contact with the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> stabilizers 5a and 5b, etc. It is preferred that the angle of aperture θ be regulated to a value in the range of 10° to 45°, preferably 10° to 30°, more preferably 10° to 25°.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the stabilizers 5a and 5b have been disposed so as to face each other at a predetermined angle so that the passage of the resin material which has been ejected from the die 1 and inflated into a cylindrical shape is narrowed along the direction of forward movement of the resin material and that the cylindrical inflated resin material can be thus deformed into a flat tube shape having an elongated elliptic section. These stabilizers 5a and 5b are constituted by roller members 7 arranged in rows. These roller members 7 are arranged with an appropriate pitch H so as to give a gap h between adjacent roller members of not larger than the diameter of each roller member 7. Because of this constitution, the resin material 2 which is moving forward while being in contact with these roller members 7 does not come into the space between adjacent roller members 7 during the movement. As a result, the resin material 2 is inhibited from developing surface wrinkles and can be made even in thickness, etc.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the roller members 7 are disposed so as to be inclined at a predetermined angle and protrude upward at the center of each of the stabilizers 5a and 5b. The roller members 7 thus arranged hence function<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> as a guide device for deforming the cylindrical inflated resin material 2 into a flat tube shape having an elongated elliptic section. The angle of inclination α of these roller members 7 is determined by the width of the resin material 2 deformed into a flat tube shape having an elongated elliptic section and by the paths of the edges of the traveling resin material 2 which are given by the angle of aperture θ between the stabilizers 5a and 5b. Thus, the direction of rotation of each roller member 7 can be made substantially the same as the direction in which the resin material 2 inflated into a cylindrical shape is spread when deformed into a flat tube shape having an elongated elliptic section. Since the stabilizers 5a and 5b are thus constituted by the roller members 7 arranged in rows, the resin material 2 extruded from the die 1 comes into contact with the stabilizers 5a and 5b not by areal contact but by intermittent linear contact, whereby the frictional resistance in the direction of forward movement of the resin material 2 is reduced. Furthermore, since the roller members 7 have been arranged so that the direction of rotation thereof is substantially the same as the direction in which the resin material is spread when deformed into a flat tube shape having an elongated elliptic section, not only the frictional resistance which restrains the resin material 2 from spreading is reduced but also the resin<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> material 2 which is moving forward can be inhibited from shaking. As a result, the resin material 2 can be stably sent to the nip between the pinch rollers 6a and 6b and can be more easily deformed into a flat tube shape having an elongated elliptic section. Consequently, the occurrence of wrinkles during folding can be inhibited with higher certainty.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Furthermore, the roller members 7 arranged in rows each are constituted by a plurality of short rollers 8, 8, ·· arranged in a row, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. Due to this constitution, those regions of these roller members 7 in which the resin material 2 comes into contact with the roller members do not make continuous lines but broken lines, resulting in reduced resistance of friction between the resin material 2 and the roller members 7. Consequently, the occasional occurrence of wrinkles during folding can be inhibited without fail. These plural short rollers 8, 8, ·· preferably have a reduced area of contact with the resin material 2 as described above, and each preferably have a width of 10-15 mm. It is also preferred that the rollers 8, 8, ·· adjacent in the respective row be arranged as close as possible to each other. The roller width and the space between rollers adjacent in the respective row are not limited, and it is preferred to<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> appropriately select these taking into account the viscosity of the resin material 2, etc.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">It is further preferred that the plural short rollers 8, 8, ·· in each roller member 7 be disposed so as to form a zigzag arrangement with the plural short rollers 8, 8, ·· of other rows. When this roller arrangement is employed, the regions where the roller members 7 come into contact with the resin material 2 are not continuous and, hence, a reduction in frictional resistance is attained. For example, even in the case of a resin material having a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer, such as a pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet, the occasional occurrence of wrinkles during folding can be inhibited without fail.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Those short rollers 8, 8, ·· are preferably those having a surface made of a material having a low coefficient of friction, from the standpoint of reducing friction coefficient. For example, use can be made of polytetrafluoroethylene (hereinafter referred to as PTFE), polyfluoroalkoxyl (hereinafter referred to as PFA), tetrafluoroethylene/hexafluoropropylene copolymers (hereinafter referred to as FEP), and polychlorotrifluoroethylene (hereinafter referred to as CTFE).</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Furthermore, the roller members 7 should not be construed as being limited to those constituted by the<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> plural short rollers 8, 8, ·· described above. For example, one long roller 9 can be used as the roller member 7 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>. When such long rollers 9 are disposed so as to be inclined at a predetermined angle so that the direction of spreading of the resin material 2 is substantially the same as the direction of rotation of the rollers 9 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, then the resin material 2 inflated into a cylindrical shape can be easily spread when deformed into a flat tube shape having an elongated elliptic section and the occasional occurrence of wrinkles in folding can be inhibited, as in the case described above.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The method of inflation extrusion molding with an inflation extrusion molding apparatus having the above described constitution will be explained below.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">First, resin material(s) 2 in a molten state is introduced into a die 1 from one or more extruders not shown. The resin material 2 introduced into this die 1 is then extruded upward into a cylindrical shape through annular ejection openings concentrically formed in the die 1. Air is introduced into the cylindrical resin material 2 through an air introduction pipe not shown which has been formed in the die 1 to thereby inflate the resin material 2 into a cylindrical shape (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>). The resin material 2 inflated into a cylindrical shape is introduced into the space between stabilizers 5a and 5b facing each other at a<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> predetermined angle, sandwiched therebetween and pressed into a flat tube shape having an elongated elliptic section, and then introduced into the nip between a pair of pinch rollers 6a and 6b while being folded.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In this operation, the resin material 2 is folded while spreading out to both sides of the direction of forward movement, as described above, between the stabilizers 5a and 5b constituted by roller members 7 arranged in rows. Since the direction of this spreading is substantially the same as the direction of rotation of each roller member 7, the resistance of friction between the resin material 2 and each roller member 7 during the spreading is reduced and the resin material 2 is folded without arising troubles such as wrinkles.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The resin material 2 is easily spread between the stabilizers 5a and 5b and the occasional occurrence of wrinkles is inhibited, as described above. Various resin materials can hence be molded. Examples of moldable resins include block, random, or other propylene polymers containing ethylene units as comonomer units, ethylene polymers such as low-density, high-density, and linear low-density ethylene polymers, polystyrene, polyesters, and olefin polymers which are copolymers of ethylene and other monomer(s), such as ethylene/methyl methacrylate copolymers. Examples thereof further include styrene/isoprene/styrene<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> block copolymers (SIS), styrene/butadiene/styrene block copolymers (SBS), styrene/isoprene block copolymers (SI), styrene/butadiene block copolymers (SB), styrene/ethylene-propylene/styrene block copolymers (SEPS), styrene/ethylene-butylene/styrene block copolymers (SEBS), styrene/ethylene-butylene-propylene block copolymers (SEP), styrene/ethylene-butylene block copolymers (SEB), styrene/ethylene-butylene/olefin crystal block copolymers (SEBC), olefin crystal/ethylene-butylene/olefin crystal block copolymers (CEBC), styrene/isobutylene/styrene block copolymers (SIBS), styrene/butadiene random copolymers (SBR), hydrogenated styrene/butadiene random copolymers (HSBR), ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA), ethylene/propylene rubbers (EPR), and ethylene/propylene/α-olefin rubbers. These materials may be used singly or as a mixture of two or more thereof.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Besides being usable for molding various resin materials as described above, the method of inflation extrusion molding is applicable even to a sheet having a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer on one side, such as, e.g., a pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet. A pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet having no wrinkles can be formed by the method. In the case where a pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet is produced by this method, the following materials may be used. First, examples of resin materials<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> serving as a pressure-sensitive adhesive include styrene/isoprene/styrene block copolymers (SIS), styrene/butadiene/styrene block copolymers (SBS), styrene/isoprene block copolymers (SI), styrene/butadiene block copolymers (SB), styrene/ethylene-propylene/styrene block copolymers (SEPS), styrene/ethylene-butylene/styrene block copolymers (SEBS), styrene/ethylene-butylene-propylene block copolymers (SEP), styrene/ethylene-butylene block copolymers (SEB), styrene/ethylene-butylene/olefin crystal block copolymers (SEBC), olefin crystal/ethylene-butylene/olefin crystal block copolymers (CEBC), styrene/isobutylene/styrene block copolymers (SIBS), styrene/butadiene random copolymers (SBR), hydrogenated styrene/butadiene random copolymers (HSBR), ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA), ethylene/propylene rubbers (EPR), and ethylene/propylene/α-olefin rubbers. These materials may be used singly or as a mixture of two or more thereof.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">For further improving pressure-sensitive adhesive properties, a tackifier (tackifier resin) may be added to the resin material. As the tackifier can be used one or more appropriate members selected from known tackifiers for use in pressure-sensitive adhesives, such as, e.g., petroleum resins of the aliphatic type, aromatic type, aliphatic/aromatic copolymer type, or alicyclic type, coumarone-indene resins, terpene resins, terpene-phenol<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> resins, alkylphenol resins, rosin resins, polymerized rosin resins, xylene resins, and resins obtained by hydrogenating these resins. Also, there may be used one or more appropriate softeners selected from, for example, low-molecular polyisobutylene, polybutene, polyisoprene, polybutadiene, hydrogenated polyisoprene, hydrogenated polybutadiene, derivatives of these which have a reactive group, e.g., an OH group, COOH group, or epoxy group, at one or each end thereof, process oils, naphthenic oil, castor oil, linseed oil, soybean oil, phthalic ester plasticizers, phosphoric ester plasticizers, and liquid aliphatic petroleum resins.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">A mixture of the resin material serving as a pressure-sensitive adhesive and the tackifier resin, etc. and a resin material serving as a substrate are introduced into the die 1 from respective separate extruders. The resin material serving as a substrate is, for example, a block, random, or other propylene polymer containing ethylene units as comonomer units, ethylene polymer, e.g., a low-density, high-density, or linear low-density ethylene polymer, polystyrene, polyester, olefin polymer which is a copolymer of ethylene and other monomer(s), e.g., an ethylene/methyl methacrylate copolymer, styrene/isoprene/styrene block copolymer (SIS), styrene/butadiene/styrene block copolymer (SBS),<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> styrene/isoprene block copolymer (SI), styrene/butadiene block copolymer (SB), styrene/ethylene-propylene/styrene block copolymer (SEPS), styrene/ethylene-butylene/styrene block copolymer (SEBS), styrene/ethylene-butylene-propylene block copolymer (SEP), styrene/ethylene-butylene block copolymer (SEB), styrene/ethylene-butylene/olefin crystal block copolymer (SEBC), olefin crystal/ethylene-butylene/olefin crystal block copolymer (CEBC), styrene/isobutylene/styrene block copolymer (SIBS), styrene/butadiene random copolymer (SBR), hydrogenated styrene/butadiene random copolymer (HSBR), ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), ethylene/propylene rubber (EPR), or ethylene/propylene/α-olefin rubber. Thereafter, the two resin materials introduced into the die 1, i.e., the resin material serving as a pressure-sensitive adhesive and the resin material serving as a substrate, are extruded together through the annular openings formed in the die 1 so that the resin material serving as a pressure-sensitive adhesive forms an outer layer. The reason why a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer is formed as an outer layer is that this constitution prevents the inside surfaces of the resultant pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet from sticking to each other upon folding between the stabilizers 5a and 5b.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --></p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Various resin materials including the folded pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet are taken up with a pair of pinch rollers and then wound up with a winding machine not shown.
