mxw-id="PDES63957466" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b><u>TECHNICAL FIELD</u></b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to methods for detecting and characterizing viral infection(s) in a host. Furthermore, the present invention relates to compositions and methods for treating viral infection(s).</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Viral infections have a debilitating effect on the economic output of society. Diagnosis is commonly difficult, and the availability of treatments limited. As a result, an infected individual must routinely battle the virus as it runs its course. In some instances, this battle is never won, as viral infections can become persistent. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection becomes chronic in up to 85% of infected individuals<sup>1</sup>. This is a serious worldwide public health concern, constituting a major cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The mechanisms for the high rate of viral persistence are unknown, and as a result, progress in the development of vaccine and antiviral therapies has been impeded. Viruses with RNA genomes such as HCV, can undergo mutation at high frequencies, and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> under appropriate selective pressure, rapidly generate viral variants. Distinctive among RNA viruses infecting humans, HCV is the only virus (with the exception of retroviruses) that persists in the majority of infected individuals. The hypervariable region 1 (HVR1), located in a stretch of 27-31 residues at the amino terminus of the second envelope glycoprotein (E2) has been identified as a main target of the anti-HCV neutralizing response, and is involved in the establishment of viral persistence<sup>11,12</sup>. However, the role of HVR1 in viral persistence has come into question in light of a recent study demonstrating that infection with modified HCV genomic RNA, without HVR1, although attenuated in growth, can cause persistent infection in chimpanzees, thus suggesting that HVR1 is not essential for HCV progression to chronicity<sup>10</sup>.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Current commercial enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, for example, have two major limitations: (i) their sensitivity is inadequate to detect seroconversion before 5-6 weeks post-infection leading to a prolonged window period (residual risk in blood supply is 1/100,000) (ii) their sensitivity is poor, causing an unacceptable false positive rate (40 to 50% in blood donors). Although nucleic acid testing will play an increasingly important role in narrowing the window period, it is technically complex and is not cost-effective.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The sensitivity of third generation EIAs for detection of anti-HCV antibodies has been improved by using a combination of viral proteins, as antigens, however, a prolonged window period to detection of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> seroconversion of HCV infection and a low specificity when testing the low risk populations such volunteer blood donors remains. Thus, improvements to current screening and detection methods for biological products is important for the safety of such products as well as for the cost-effectiveness of health care in general.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Although studies have investigated the diversity of persistent infection, a systematic characterization of viral persistence has not been previously developed. Accordingly, a need exists for a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of viral infection and persistence as a basis to provide effective diagnosis and treatment regimes. Such an understanding would also provide a basis for the development of accurate and reliable detection systems for detecting viral infection.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Furthermore, current viral detection methods and/or systems are not capable of characterizing a viral infection, with respect to its capacity to persist in a host, for example. It would be beneficial to have indicators of viral behavior that are useful in characterizing a viral infection. The ability to characterize a viral infection would further serve to improve the determination of an effective treatment regime.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In this respect, there is a further need for the development of specific treatment regimes, tailored to target pre-characterized viral infections.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to one aspect of the present invention, several sequence elements have been identified within viral genomes having a degree of similarity or homology with endogenous elements of a host capable of being infected with the virus of interest. For example, BLAST analyses of the HCV genome to Genbank resulted in the identification of several such sequence elements. As discussed further hereinbelow, the presence of such sequence elements, also referred to as viral-based sequence elements or host protein domain sequence elements (HPDSEs) having a degree of similarity or homology to an endogenous host element are identified as indicators of viral behavior in a host, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As a result, novel methods of detecting, characterizing and treating viral infection(s) are herein provided. In addition, the presence or absence of such HPDSEs or fragments thereof in compounds and/or preparations of the present invention, such as encoded viral-specific antigens, have application in the development of new anti-viral treatments and viral detection methods, such as EIAs, having improved sensitivity and specificity. These novel detection methods will be particularly useful in anti-viral antibody screening of biological products, such as blood, for example.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to one aspect of the present invention a method of characterizing viral variants on the basis of a homology profile with a target host protein is provided. Characterization of a viral variant of HCV, for example, is based on the detection of a host protein domain sequence element(s) (HPDSEs) within a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> target region of a HCV genome. According to an aspect of the present invention, it has been determined that the degree of homology between a HPDSE within a target region of a virus and a protein of a host infected with the virus influences the levels of recognition by the immune system of the host and thus plays a major role in viral persistence. Furthermore, the present invention includes target-specific preparations useful in detecting and/or treating viral infection and methods of the same, based on the characterization of viral variants as herein provided.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the term "host protein domain sequence element" (HPDSE) is intended to refer to a sequence element within a viral genome having a degree of homology to a host sequence. However, a HPDSE is not intended to be limited thereto. For example, a HPDSE of the present invention may more generally be any element within a viral domain having a degree of similarity or homology to an endogenous element of a host carrying the virus in question. Furthermore, an endogenous element of a host, also herein referred to as an "endogenous host element" may include an element naturally occurring within the domain of the host, such as a natural infectious or commensal organism of that host, for example, microbes on body surfaces and within organs (E. coli, S. aureus, Ricketsia sp, Chlamydia sp), as well as organisms resident within tissues (Circoviruses, Salmonella sp., viruses)as well as resident within genomes (Type A retroviruses). Preferably, a host element is a protein sequence or fragment thereof. For the purposes of the present invention, the term "host protein domain sequence<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> element" may be used interchangeably with the term "viral-based sequence element".</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A homology profile of the present invention preferably includes a sequence homology comparison of viral and host genomic structures. However, according to one embodiment of the present invention, a homology profile may be a comparison of structural homology of domains of viral and host molecular structure.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The term "antigenic determinant" as used herein refers to an element employed in accordance with the present invention to elicit an immune response in vivo.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The term "target sequence element" as used herein refers to a viral-based sequence element that is a target of a method of an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method of characterizing a viral infection in a host, said method comprising: identifying at least one viral-based sequence element in a biological sample obtained from the host; determining a homology profile of said at least one viral-based sequence element with at least one endogenous host element; and characterizing said viral infection based on said homology profile; wherein said homology profile is indicative of a viral behavior of said viral infection in said host.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of diagnosing HCV infection in a patient. Based on a homology comparison of a target region of HCV having a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> HPDSE and a predetermined host protein, a characterization of viral behavior can be determined according to one aspect of the present invention.

In particular, molecular mimicry has been identified as a viral strategy for immune evasion. Based on this strategy, mutations within a viral domain are shown to establish an increased similarity and/or homology with an endogenous host element during the course of infection. According to the present invention, this homology is correlated to a viral characterization, and more preferably to a viral outcome. For example, a persistent viral infection may be characterized in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention on the basis of a predefined homology profile of the virus causing the infection.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a comparative analysis of the HCV genome with human sequences in Genbank was conducted. This analysis identified the presence of many host protein domains sequence elements (HPDSEs) within several regions of HCV gene encoded proteins. The presence of such HPDSEs were found to exist in viral variants that persisted in an infected host.<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --></p><p id="p0068" num="0068">According to the strategy of molecular mimicry as characterized in accordance with the present invention, a comparative analysis is conducted, as exemplified hereinabove, to identify the presence of, or predisposition for HPDSEs in a viral genome. The identification of a HPDSE involves the detection of a significant degree of homology in a region of the genome of an infectious pathogen with that of an endogenous host element, such as a protein, for example. In accordance with the present invention, "significant homology" is intended to mean a degree of homology having predictive biological properties. More specifically, a degree of homology of a given HPDSE is significant when the extent (quantitative measure) or nature (qualitative measure) of the homology is predictive of a biological property of a virus or infectious agent. Preferably, significance is defined empirically as a homology that is greater than chance, i.e. significantly greater than 5 % which is the random probability of occurrence of one of 20 amino acids at the same sequence position in any 2 proteins. More preferably, significant homology includes the range of similarities of greater than or equal to 20 % but can include other homologies that are less than 20 % but greater than 5 %.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">According to the present invention, qualitative homology may include viral and host structures having a same or similar molecular shape and are composed of non-homologous amino acid sequences. This is in accordance with the well known phenomenon of complementary shape that defines antibody binding of different antibodies to epitopes, which occur independent of amino acid sequence homology. Accordingly, it is intended that a homology<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> profile of the present invention can refer to a structural homology within the molecular constitution of a viral variant as compared with a host protein. Furthermore, a structural homology may include a homology of antigenic structures having a same or similar molecular shape but a different genomic constitution. Alternatively, as mentioned herein above, a homology profile of the present invention may be based on a sequence homology wherein a degree of homologous sequences are identified within a viral HPDSE relative to a corresponding host protein domain(s).</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Since a viral pathogen has the ability to mutate during the course of infection, a predisposition for the development of a HPDSE may be found where an analysis is conducted at an early stage of infection in an host, and a comparative analysis identifies a pattern of similarity that may be indicative of a predisposition to evolve or mutate to become more homologous to an endogenous host element over time.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">It is contemplated that suitable test systems, as generally known in the art, can be employed to establish whether or not a target HPDSE has the ability or predisposition for immune evasion in a host. One such indicator of immune evasion may be a lack of immune recognition in a suitable test system when a HPDSE is prepared in a suitable fashion for use in immunization. Conversely, the ability of antibodies to HPDSE or the corresponding host domain (usually though not exclusively those produced in another species of host) to cross-react, which is seen as reaction of said antibodies with both structures, may be another such indicator.<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --></p><p id="p0072" num="0072">Further provided is the use of viral-based sequence elements that optionally induce cross-reactive antibodies in a host.

Furthermore, said antigenic determinants may be utilized to detect the presence of anti-viral antibodies in test samples. For example, a test sample is incubated with a solid phase to which at least one recombinant protein has been attached.

In particular, over 100 of HPDSEs in HCV polyprotein have been identified, particularly in the E2, NS3, NS4, and NS5 gene regions.

We believe that the demonstrated instances of structural mimicry and/or sequence homology in RNA viruses are examples of a general process that is important for RNA virus survival. Specifically, we illustrate that viruses will tend to mimic their cognate host and thus a virus can be matched to its host by comparison of the relative extents of viral molecular<!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --> mimicry to a given host. Given the recent advent of the human and mouse genome sequences it has become possible to analyze the structural mimicry of viral variants to these host genomes.</p><heading id="h0006"><b>EXAMPLE I - Molecular Mimicry by HCV</b></heading><p id="p0087" num="0087">To date, the mechanism for HCV persistence in infected individuals has been unclear. Viral replication during acute infection leads to a high frequency of amino acid substitutions in HVR1 that generates a complex mixture of genetic variants, termed a quasispecies. This genetic diversity translates into different amino acid sequences and thus, altered epitopes, resulting in different levels of recognition of quasispecies members by the host immune system<sup>6,7</sup>. For example, some epitopes within HVR1 are not recognized by the immune response and the corresponding variants that persist after seroconversion are termed antibody escape mutants or persistent quasispecies. It has not been previously known why these escape mutants are not subsequently recognized by the immune system. As a result, prior to the present invention, effective prevention, diagnosis and treatment for persistent HCV infection has not been available.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">Amino acid mutation at the amino terminus of the HCV second envelope glycoprotein (E2),and more specifically within hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of HCV has been identified, in accordance with the present invention to provide an elevated homology to human immunoglobulin light chain (kappa) (IgVLκ) in persistent HCV infections. The amino terminal region in E2 was identified as comprising a 124 amino acids region (as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG 1a</figref>) that shows a significant homology<!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --> to the variable region of human immunoglobulin light chain (kappa) (Ig-VLκ) in all HCV genotypes. Furthermore, four HCV major homology domains (MHDs) are described that correspond to surface loops of IgVLκ in antibodies.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">During infection, sequence variation and mutation, particularly in HVR1, elicit significant changes in homology. Those variants with a lower homology to Ig-VLκ within HVR1 are eventually eliminated, while the variants with increased or sufficient homology to Ig-VLκ escape the neutralizing immune response and become persistent. As provided in accordance with the present invention the degree of homology of HVR1 of a HCV variant to IgVL will determine the level of recognition by the immune system and thus play a major role in viral persistence. Characterization of this strategy of molecular mimicry provides a fundamental understanding of the progressive development of HCV infection in a host and serves as a basis for disease intervention.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">Molecular mimicry is one of the immune-evasion strategies viruses use to promote survival and persistence. There are several examples of viruses that express proteins that can modify or avoid host defenses because they are homologous to human protein sequences which are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, intercellular signaling or immune functions<sup>17</sup>. For example human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes a molecular homologue of major histocompatibility complex 1 (MHC 1) proteins (the UL18 gene product)<sup>18</sup>, which is directly involved in evasion of cellular immune response by inhibiting recognition and attack by natural killer cells<sup>19</sup>. As well, molecular mimics of host protein<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> domains by herpes virus type 1 (HSV-1) influence the development of autoimmune disease after viral infection<sup>20</sup>. The virally induced antiviral cytokine, interferon (IFN), acts in part through the dsRNA dependent protein kinase (PKR) that inhibits protein synthesis through phosphorylation of the initiation factor eIF2∀. The HCV E2 protein contains a PKR-eIF2α phosphorylation homology domain that competes with authentic eIF2V to inhibit the antiviral response mediated by IFN<sup>20,5</sup>. We reasoned that other instances of molecular mimicry could also be contributing to HCV persistent infection. In accordance with the present invention, we searched for homologous sequences to the HCV polyprotein among all known proteins available in GenBank. We found that HCV encodes a sequence in envelope region 2 (E2) that is highly homologous to human immunoglobulins (Ig), and that specifically possesses typical features of the variable region of Ig kappa light chain (IgVLκ) in some variants. Using a melded genomic, proteomic, and evolutionary approach, analysis of HCV E2 and HVR1 sequences that arise during infection in humans and chimpanzees we found that the degree of homology with Ig-VLκ within E2, and in particular within HVR1, is directly related to viral escape and persistence. Thus, the mechanism of HCV immune evasion and persistence involves a process of molecular mimicry.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">The discovery of HCV encoded Ig-like protein domains, more generally referred to herein as host protein domain and sequence elements (HPDSEs), in accordance with the description of the present invention, and their role in circumventing the host immune response<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> provides a mechanistic explanation for viral persistence. Molecular mimicry of host antibodies by HCV is a unique and efficient way to circumvent the immune response because it is focused on the variable region of antibody molecules which are both the effectors as well as targets for humoral immunity and are thus tolerated antigens. Host-like antigenic structures are not immunogenic due to tolerance mechanisms that operate to block the synthesis of self-reactive antibodies. In accordance with the findings of the present invention, our data show that HPDSEs, such as those target sequence elements within E2 and N5SA proteins in certain HCV variants co-evolve with host protein domain sequences, such as Ig domains, to establish persistent infection. That is, over time, these HPDSEs evolve to become more genetically similar or more highly homologous to host protein domain sequences. As a result, through genetic mutation a HPDSEs confers the ability of a viral variant to escape immune evasion of a host.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">According to one embodiment of the present invention, at least 20% sequence homology between a HPDSE and a host protein sequence provides a threshold level of homology sufficient to mimic host protein structure and antigenicity. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the sequence homology of a HPDSE and a host protein is at least 30%. According to yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention, molecular mimicry of IgVLκ by HCV HVR1 (1-27 aa) is achieved with a homology profile of 30% - 45% homology because this is similar to the variation seen among IgVLκs, making HVR1 of a persistent HCV as antibody-like as other antibodies.<!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --></p><p id="p0093" num="0093">All the data support the conclusion that evolution of host protein domain sequence elements within HCV E2 to become more homologous to IgVL correlates directly with a viral variants ability to escape from immune detection, a process that is modulated primarily by epitopes in HVR1.

MHD 1 is located in HVR1 and corresponds with the sequence at the beginning of framework 1 (FR1) (1 to 20 aa) in IgVL of antibodies which functions to both support and contribute to the antigen binding site. MHD 2, 3 and 4 align with the 3 immunoglobulin hypervariable domains at positions 27-34, 49-60 and 90-109 aa, that comprise the complimentarity-determining regions 1 (CDR1), 2 (CDR2) and 3 (CDR3), respectively in the antigen binding site of IgVLκ. To further assess the homology of HVR1 to FR1 of IgVL, that are both highly variable, we also aligned consensus sequences representing the most prevalent amino acids for 1,382 HCV isolates<sup>18</sup> and 500 immunoglobulin light chain genes from human and mouse (<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig 1c</figref>).</p><heading id="h0009"><b>E2 and IgVL biochemical features</b></heading><p id="p0105" num="0105">Firstly, in MHD1 there is high sequence homology between the consensus sequence of HVR1 and IgVL FR1, with 10 out of 20 amino acids (50%) of the most prevalent HVR1 amino acids at positions 9(Ala) 10 (Ala), 12(Thr), 14(Ser), 16(Leu), 17(Ther), 21(Ser), 22(P), 23(Gly) and 25 (Ser) being identical with the most prevalent amino acids at the corresponding positions in IgVL of antibodies. The master consensus sequence, derived from both HVR1 and IgVL, possesses identical amino acids at 14 of 20 positions (70 %) including several positions where all or most of the alternative sequences in the consensus of HVR1 are also identical with those of immunoglobulin. The consensus homologies are within the range of homologies seen among IgVL FR1 regions (25-90 %; <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig 1e</figref>). Secondly, there are common amino acids that control molecular shape in IgVL<!-- EPO <DP n="55"> --> molecules where CDR backbone shape is strongly influenced by alterations of specific resident amino acids (usually Pro and Gly), especially those at positions 15 and 16 in FR1 of IgVL that corresponds to 22 (Pro) and 23 (Gly) in HCV HVR1. These amino acids allow bending through the adoption of unusual torsion angles<sup>19</sup>. Other features that are crucial for the correct positioning of the CDR loops are completely conserved in the corresponding positions in E2 (e.g 69Gly and 103Cys) with those in IgVLκ (56Gly and 90Cys; as well as other residues 26Ser, 46Leu, 102Tyr). Specific amino acids positions were highly conserved in E2 molecules (ie TRP38 and 108) that may maintain three-dimensional structure of E2 (possibly involving cysteines 47, 70, 77 and 107 that border or involve MHDs 2, 3 and 4). The third common feature for HVR1 and IgVL FR1 is that amino acid replacements are frequently restricted to amino acids with similar biochemical properties, being rich in small flexible residues (Ser, Thr, Ala, Gly), appearing at IgVL positions 5, 7, 10 and 14, and at HVR1 corresponding positions 12, 14, 17 and 21 that were always substituted with Ser, Thr and Ala. These amino acids are not only structurally flexible but also can hydrogen bond to other amino acids to promote binding activity (<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 1c</figref>.). Finally, the residues in the MHDs 2, 3 and 4 in HCV were highly conserved among different genotypes of the virus, which was opposite to that of residues in the CDRs that show the greatest variability among antibodies. Presumably, the highly conserved residues of MHDs 2, 3 and 4 in HCV were initially adopted from CDRs of IgVLκ and fixed through evolution under selective pressures. It appears that HCV E2 possesses typical features of Ig-VLκ<!-- EPO <DP n="56"> --> that includes not only aa sequence, chemistry and variability but also critical features that determine molecular conformation and secondary structure. As most members of the immunoglobulin super-family maintain a binding function it is appealing to speculate that E2 uses the IgVL homology domain as a binding site. These common structures in E2 are also expected to share the property of immune tolerance because HCV MHDs correspond to the exposed, surface loops, of antibodies that are recognized as self and not foreign antigens (<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.1d</figref>).</p><heading id="h0010"><b>E2 evolution and viral persistence</b></heading><p id="p0106" num="0106">The common features of aa composition and variability in E2 and IgVLκ suggested that E2, including HVR1 sequence variation was not random and that the trend in variation was in response to selective pressures from the immune response<sup>18</sup>. The presence of two major forms of quasispecies that differ in their ability to persist in the infected individual has been suggested in humans<sup>20</sup> as well as in HCV infected chimpanzees that possess HCV quasispecies to which there is little or no immunity<sup>27</sup>.

The sequence encompassing the amino terminal 108 aa region of E2 including HVR1 is quite homogeneous in the quasispecies of the source virus (S1) from a patient with chronic HCV infection, where 85% (17/20) of the clones were identical with the remaining clones differing only due to one mutation. In contrast, 6 to 14 amino acid replacements were observed in HVR1 in 9 of 28<!-- EPO <DP n="57"> --> clones (32%) on day 36 (sample A1, pre-seroconversion) and in 4 of 24 (16%) clones at day 46 post infection (PI) (A2, early-seroconversion) in the nosocomial patient. Four weeks after seroconversion, (72 days PI), all the clones (30/30, 100%) were found to be the same or genetically similar in sequence to those clones from the source virus in S1. The most divergent viral sequences found in A1 and A2, carrying multiple mutations in HVR1 disappeared after antibody induction as seen in the A3 sample. The quasispecies shifts suggest that during acute infection, two types of quasispecies variants co-existed, one was restricted (i.e. non-persistent forms) and another was naturally selected and became persistent after seroconversion.(i.e persistent forms of variants).</p><p id="p0107" num="0107">The genetic variation with respect to changes in homology to IgVL for persistent and non-persistent forms of the virus in the course of infection from acute to chronicity are shown (<figref idrefs="f0006 f0007">Fig. 3</figref> a,b). Three substitutions at aa positions 9 (Ala→Thr or Pro), 13 (Val→Ala) and 15 (Thr→Ala or Gly) that occurred within HVR1 of the non-persistent variant clones (i.e. 32% for A1' and 16 % for A2 samples) had reduced the degree of homology to IgVL FR1 consensus sequence from 40% to 25%. In contrast, no such low-homology-variants remained in the A3 sample, instead those variants that were genetically identical or similar to the source virus (S1) with higher IgVL homology (35%-40%) in HVR1 ·became predominant (100% of clones). In addition to the HVR1 substitutions, Asn 62 had mutated to several different amino acids (Arg, Tyr and Ser; <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005">Fig 2</figref> and data not shown) in the non-persistent A1 and A2 clones. The repeated occurrence of independent mutations at the same site is strong evidence of<!-- EPO <DP n="58"> --> convergent evolution, indicating functional importance. This substitution decreased the homology of the "YRNN" motif in MHD 3 relative to CDR2 of antibodies. It appears that amino acid variation within, as well as adjacent to HVR1 resulted in a trend of E2 protein domain shifting to a higher homology to human IgVLκ during quasispecies evolution and that the variants with higher homology to IgVLκ became predominant in the persistent virus population. The disappearance of the non-persistent variants coincided with a 100-fold decrease in viral load as HCV antibodies were produced (data not shown). The results suggest that genetically distinct populations of variants had undergone a selective process from the immune response during seroconversion, and that this controlled the outcome of infection. Convergence of HCV homology with IgVL occurred in HVR1 within MHD1 and to a lesser extent in MHD2 which appeared to be crucial for viral persistence. However, the sequences of MHDs 3, 4 and in particular 2, were relatively conserved suggesting that mutations in these MHDs may deleteriously alter the level of recognition by the immune system.</p><p id="p0108" num="0108">To corroborate the initial observation that chronic infection involves selection of variants with increased homology to IgVL we analyzed the quasispecies evolution in another, previously described, case of acute nosocomial infection by genotype 2c during progression from acute to chronic infection<sup>23</sup>. <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 3c</figref> indicates that the major quasispecies with the parental HVR1 sequences disappeared to be replaced by 9 different groups of variants with 11 to 14 (55%-70%) aa substitutions in HVR1 that became dominant in the virus population within 12 months. Although heterogeneous, the substitutions<!-- EPO <DP n="59"> --> resulted in significant increases in homology of HVR1 to IgVL FR1 going from 35% to 45-55% in 100% of the variants after 1 year. The results now obtained from two follow-up studies, confirmed the trend of quasispecies evolution toward higher homology to IgVL during the establishment of viral persistence. Another way to assess the impact of the immune response on the evolution of viral quasispecies is to examine HCV evolution in individuals with immune system defects that result in low or minimal immune selective pressure. Several studies<sup>24,25</sup> have shown that that there is either no or fewer mutations in the dominant amino acid sequence in HVR1 in immuno-compromised patients. We found that these few mutations in the dominant variants in some patients had slightly decreased the homology to IgVLκ, while the degree of homology remained unchanged in most cases (<figref idrefs="f0006 f0007">Fig.3</figref>). This further indicated that the variation of homology of HVR1 sequence to IgVLκ is constrained under immune selective pressure and that without immune selection the initial dominant variants would maintain the same degree of homology to IgVLκ in HVR1.</p><heading id="h0011"><b>HCV-IgVLκ homology in chimpanzees</b></heading><p id="p0109" num="0109">We examined a large number of HVR1 sequences available from several longer term, follow-up studies (up to 13 years) of experimental infections in chimpanzees.

Four of 5 mutations, 15 Ser, 21Ser and 22Pro and 28Ile, were identical to the conserved or relatively conserved residues in IgVLκ.

A similar profile and trend of the HVR1 sequence evolution was found in another chronically infected animal (Hans) where homology between HVR1 and IgVLκ increased from 35% to 45% after 9 years. A sequence analysis from a 12 year follow up study in a HCV chronic infected chimpanzee<sup>27</sup> showed the same trend of HVR1 evolution toward higher homology to IgVL (45%), even though the degree of the homology of HVR1 to IGVL had been high (35%) one year after the infection (<figref idrefs="f0008">Fig 4c</figref>).

The two motifs reside in a region encoding two B-cell epitopes as identified by the work of Kato<sup>23</sup>,<sup>3</sup>.

It was found that on establishment of persistent infection amino acid substitutions in each HVR1 epitope led to escape from recognition by preexisting anti-HVR1 antibodies<sup>23</sup>. However, it was not known why the substitutions allowed the mutants to escape subsequent immune recognition. We analyzed the significance of sequence homology to IgVLκ within the epitopes in relation to mutant escape. <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig.5</figref> indicates that three of the four substitutions at positions 14 (Arg→Ser) , 16 (Phe→Leu) and 18 (Ser→Asn) resulted in significant increases in homology to IgVL for both epitopes 1 and 2. The changes in homology directly correlated with the levels of recognition by antibodies and therefore the generation of antibody escape mutants. The substitution Phe→Leu which appeared at 6 months post diagnosis (p.d.) changed the homology to IgVLκ from 27% to 36% for epitope1 and from 36% to 45% for epitope 2. At that time, variants with this mutation were found to be non-reactive to the anti-HVR1 antibodies existing at 6 and 8 months p.d. in serum. One more substitution Arg14→Ser in HVR1 occurred at 11 months p.d, which further increased the IgVLκ homology to 45% for epitope1 and to 54% for epitope 2. These variants with 14Ser and 16Leu mutations in HVR1 completely escaped antibody recognition, showing a negative reactivity to preexisting antibodies at all time points of 6, 8, 11 and 14 months p.d. in antibody binding assays. It appears that when homology to IgVLκ reached levels of 45% in epitope1 and 54% in epitope 2 that this was not only sufficient to<!-- EPO <DP n="62"> --> escape from recognition by preexisting antibodies but also prevented the further recognition of this epitope since it was not subsequently recognized by antiserum collected at 19 months p.d in this individual<sup>3</sup>. To corroborate this result, we examined the homology changes of the sequences in the two epitopes of HVR1 from the non-persistent and persistent variants found in 2 follow-up studies<sup>33,34,23</sup>.

HVR1 homologies of less than 30% and E2 homologies of less than 37.8 were<!-- EPO <DP n="63"> --> removed by the antibody response. In Table 3 it is further demonstrated that the virus populations that survived IFN treatment and are thus identified as IFN resistant have less homology to IgVLκ in the HVR1 region and the larger region of E2 including HVR1 HPDSEs, than the antibody resistant population. These viral populations are thus predicted to be more susceptible to antibody neutralization. These viruses in post IFN treatment sample A4 comprise 2 populations in Table 3. The majority of the IFN resistant population (90 %) is seen to have a homology to the HVR1 and E2 region that is near the lower limit of homology of variants that are antibody resistant. The remainder of IFN resistant population (10%) is similar to the antibody sensitive population and subsequently disappears from the A5 population.

The stimulation of cross-reactive antibodies may be directed to IgG and be responsible for the high incidence (56%) of cryoglobulinemia associated with HCV persistence. The occurrence on a liver specific antigenic region immediately adjacent and overlapping with HVR1 may be responsible for stimulation an anti-hepatocyte immune response that may be responsible for continuous hepatocyte damage by CTL or antibody dependant cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Partial immune recognition of the HCV E2 leads to antibody that cross-reacts with host leading to autoimmune disease. This can involve antibodies that cross react with IgG as well as antibody that cross reacts with a liver antigen that is adjacent to the HVR1 region and is nearly identical in 19/20 aa.

HVR1 is identified as the major immunogenic domain of E2, although the presence of additional B-cell sites outside HVR1 has been documented. The presence of two epitopes within HVR1 suggested that epitope shift occurred during the course of hepatitis C viruse infection( <nplcit id="ncit0010" npl-type="s"><text>Nobuyuki Kato, et al. 1994, J Virol, 68:4776-4784</text></nplcit>)<!-- EPO <DP n="72"> --> and it has been thought that the epitope shift within the E1/E2 region, in particular the hypervariable N-terminal region of E2, plays a major role in the escape mechanism. The definition of two major forms of quasispecies, non-persistence and persistence forms of quasispecies with different genetic and biological characteristics at protein levels has facilitated the study on the mechanism of how the persistence quasispecies could attenuate or evade the immune response. Genetic changes at amino acid level in viral proteins is correlated with alteration of neutralization properties of viral mutants as seen in many lentiviruses such as retroviruses including SIV in monkeys and HIV in humans (<nplcit id="ncit0011" npl-type="s"><text>Burns DP, Collignon C, Desrosiers RC. 1993, J Virol; 67:4104-4113</text></nplcit>, <nplcit id="ncit0012" npl-type="s"><text>Robert-Guroff M, Brown M, Gallo RC,. Nature 1985; 16:72-74</text></nplcit>,). Even a single amino acid change can abrogate CTL recognition, leading to the persistence of the viral mutant in vivo (<nplcit id="ncit0013" npl-type="s"><text>Koup RA. Virus escape from CTL recognition. J Exp Med 1994; 180: 779</text></nplcit>). The significance of the substitutions or mutations in the establishment of viral persistence in HCV infection has not been addressed to date. In accordance with the present invention, we proposed that the stabilized or fixed amino acid sequence within the E1/E2 region in persistence variants may comprise protein domains and /or epitopes that may lead to low or no recognition of the virus envelope proteins by the immune system. All known protein sequences from different species in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems in GenBank were analyzed and aligned with amino acid sequences within the E1/E2 region derived from the clones of the persistence and non-persistence variants using SSEARCH and NCBI Blast. The protein sequences available from GenBank with<!-- EPO <DP n="73"> --> homology scale of E value lesser or equal to 10 and/or Z-score higher than 104.6 (equal to E value 9.3) were selected and displayed for comparison of their similarity with the sequences of all cloned quasispecies including persistence and non-persistence variants. A number of the clones from the sample (S1) from the virus source patient with chronic hepatitis C were also analyzed. Table 4 illustrates a great concordance of results between the two methods of direct DNA sequencing, and cloning and sequencing of quasispecies. The data from the cloning and sequencing method indicates that the amino acid sequence within the E1/E2 region in more than a half (9/16, 56.3%) of the quasispecies, existing only in pre-and early-seroconversion samples (A1 and A2), mutated to the sequences homologous to the sequences of protein domains from microbes. They include the domains from bacterial integral membrane protein (IMP) and molybdate protein from <i>E.Coli,</i> hydolyse from fungi and viruses and coat protein from bacterial phage. All the variants (A1-7, -8, -12, -15, -16, and A2-7, -1, -8 and -11) with the homologous sequences to the sequences of microbe protein domains were found to be non-persistent. In contrast, the amino acid sequence within this region of the majority (75-100%) clones of the quasispecies representing the persistence form of variants in the post-serocoversion sample (A3) and virus source patient sample (S1) have shifted to the sequences that are homologous to the sequences from human protein domains. They include the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) (<nplcit id="ncit0014" npl-type="s"><text>Beamer, L. J., S.F. Carroll, D. Eisenberg, 1997, Science 276: 1861</text></nplcit>) and immunoglobulin variable region (Ig-V) domains (<nplcit id="ncit0015" npl-type="s"><text>Marquart, M., and R. Huber, 1989, Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 370: 263</text></nplcit>). These results suggest<!-- EPO <DP n="74"> --> that only the variants in which the protein domain shifts to the host protein domains in E1/E2 region can escape the immune surveillance, and become the predominant population after seroconversion and in the course of chronicity of the virus infection. In addition, the results also indicate that the minority (25%) of quasispecies in patients with chronic HCV infection carried the protein domain in E1/E2 region mutated to the sequence that was homologous to IMP and bacterial protein of glucarate seen in the sample S1. It suggests that some non-persistence variants may frequently occur and will be eliminated after specific antibody is produced, but cannot be the predominant population of variants in most patients with chronic HCV infection. The direct DNA sequencing analysis allows detection of the master sequence and is useful for measurement of amino acid sequence changes in the consensus sequence of a population of genome (<nplcit id="ncit0016" npl-type="s"><text>Leen-Jan van Doorn, et al. J Virol. 69:773-778,1995</text></nplcit>). The results from the direct DNA sequencing data show that the protein domain shifted to IMP domain in the E1/E2 region in the isolates A1, A2. While the sequence within E1/E2 of A3 and S1 isolates was more homologous to that of human protein domains of BPI and/or Ig-V. Data from both methods have concordantly indicated that the protein domain shifts due to the mutations occurred within E1/E2 in the course of HCV primary infection trend towards to the human protein domains.</p><heading id="h0018"><b>EXAMPLE II - Parallels with HIV</b></heading><p id="p0129" num="0129">HCV virus infection in humans primarily occurs in hepatocytes and liver macrophages, however HCV RNA is also often found in lymph nodes and the pancreas. The<!-- EPO <DP n="75"> --> evolutionary biology of HCV may have parallels with that of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that also causes persistent infections where the virus is present as a heterogeneous and varying population in the infected individual. Of more direct relevance to our interpretation of genetic variation in HCV as it relates to disease is the observation that most of the genetic variation involves the hypervariable regions in the gp120 receptor protein. HIV biology is dependant on the cell tropism of HIV that is controlled by binding of virus to the CD-4 receptor in conjunction with co-receptors on macrophages and T cells. Thus macrophage tropic HIV binds the CCR5 chemokine receptor whereas T-cell tropic HIV virus binds the CXCR5 chemokine receptor. The receptor specificity of HIV shifts during persistent infection from being M-tropic early in infection to being T-tropic at the onset of disease by virtue of mutations in the viral receptor. Persistent infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is thus associated with evolution of the receptor tropism on progression to disease. Interestingly, transmission repeats this selection indicating that the T-tropic virus that is selected during persistent infection is not optimized for establishing an infection in a new host. Given that commercial sex workers who are repeatedly exposed to HIV but who lack the macrophage co-receptor do not become infected in spite of having T-cells that can be infected in vitro indicates that successful infection requires the initial infection of macrophages to establish an acute infection that then mutates to T-cell tropism to cause disease. Although HIV infections contain mixtures of M-tropic and T-topic virus new infections are initiated by the M-tropic components. Presumably the macrophage<!-- EPO <DP n="76"> --> response must be perturbed in order to successfully infect T cells in vivo. This is directly analogous to the situation we observed on transmission of HCV where the acute form evolves into the persistent form but re-infection involves the acute form of HCV. This parallel may have implications for the cultivation of HCV suggesting that different forms may require different culture conditions.</p><p id="p0130" num="0130">Given our observation that a parallel pattern of selection of variant types during HCV transmission suggest that the persistent form of HCV is not optimal for establishing an acute infection and thus variant forms must arise to establish the infection but that the HCV PI form must replace this form to establish a lifelong persistent. This suggests that specific biological features of E2 are necessary early in infection that are different from those functions that provide for persistent infection.</p><p id="p0131" num="0131">It is possible that HCV virus PI virus is likewise not optimal of establishment and thus evolution of the receptor to affect its biology is required initially but on seroconversion that mutations that make the neutrallization epitopes more host like, becoming similar to IgG variable region, are selected that result in both neutralization escape as well as avoiding further recognition due to tolerance mechanisms that prevent its recognition. It is thus possible to maintain replicative abilities and at the same time hide from the immune system through antigenic mimicry with tolerant antigens.</p><p id="p0132" num="0132">The findings of the present invention will be further applied to the study and characterization of HIV<!-- EPO <DP n="77"> --> infection.

According to one embodiment, the HTLV-1 gag protein may be used as a marker for characterizing a HTLV-I infection. For example, a HTLV-I gag protein having a predetermined number of HPDSEs may be indicative of a predisposition for pathogenicity or the propensity to induce a particular disease state.

Many blood donors are deferred every year in Canada due to false positive reactions, even though they are truly negatives. This causes significant blood donor loss and promotes confusion and anxiety.

For the purposes of the present disclosure, SARS-CoV is intended to include SARS-HCoV. Examination of the SARS-CoV genomic sequence underscores its unknown origins, representing a new genetic lineage with limited sequence homology to known coronaviruses. Although the SARS-CoV genome sequence defines its biology and carries vestiges of its natural history, it is currently not possible to interpret viral<!-- EPO <DP n="81"> --> host origins or biology, a priori from genomic sequence. We tested the hypothesis that coronaviruses employ a strategy of molecular mimicry during the process of adaptation in a given host. Furthermore, we reason, as further described, that RNA viruses through their high mutability not only have the opportunity to mimic host structures, but also the motive as thereby they gain a selective advantage in the reactive host environment.</p><p id="p0142" num="0142">In accordance with an embodiment, we found that SARS-CoV proteins possess host protein domain sequence elements (HPDSEs) that are comparable to the levels seen for human coronaviruses, suggesting a common evolutionary history of SARS-CoV with humans or primates as well as rodents and á broad host range experience. This means that viruses evolve to match themselves to their hosts by elaborating HPDSEs that have direct implications to infection and detection and treatment of disease as described herein. In addition, we found that SARS-CoV has acquired a highly homologous protein domain or HPDSE of the bacterial Peyer's Patches virulence factor, <i>gipA</i> from invasive bacteria which is known to be a natural pathogen of humans (<figref idrefs="f0024">Fig. 16</figref>).

We found that there were host protein domain sequence elements (HPDSEs) in SARS-CoV that were comparable or exceeded those in the other representative human and mouse coronaviruses, suggesting that SARS-CoV has a significant history of evolution in human or human-like species. Surprisingly, in broad searches of homology, SARS-CoV was also found to have a protein domain homologue or HPDSE, of the bacterial Peyer's Patch virulence factor, <i>gipA</i>, within the S protein that may be involved in the enteric tropism and severity of SARS. For the purposes of the present disclosure, this protein domain homologue is considered a HPDSE as gipA is a component of micro-organisms naturally found living within humans, and thus constitute part of the host. According to one embodiment of the present invention, genes of organisms harbored within hosts are included with host genes for the purposes of HPDSEs.</p><p id="p0145" num="0145">Based on these findings, the molecular mimicry strategy of the present invention has promising applications in the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic protocols for detecting and treating SARS-CoV<!-- EPO <DP n="83"> --> infection, including but not limited to those applications as herein described. This knowledge of the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV provides important insight into the development of effective treatment regimes to combat this virus. The correlation of SARS-CoV virulence with the presence of a bacterial Peyer's Patches virulence factor provides a key target for such a treatment regime. For example, the identification of a bacterial Peyer's Patches virulence factor, <i>gipA</i> in SARS-CoV may serve as a target for a novel therapeutic compound having the ability to attenuate or disable the virulence factor and thereby slow or inhibit the progress of the infection. Furthermore, novel capture agents can be strategically prepared as described herein to be devoid of a predetermined HPDSE, such as the sequence elements within the region of a bacterial Peyer's Patches virulence factor, to more accurately target SARS-CoV variants in a host. As discussed further hereinabove, such capture agents can be employed in assays for detecting a SARS-CoV variant in a test sample. In this regard, an effective diagnostic kit for convenient and effective detection of a SARS-CoV variant in a test sample is here disclosed. The identification of HPDSEs in SARS-CoV indicates that the potential pathogenicity of a virus to a given host can be assessed by analysis of its HPDSE. This will aid in the future identification and characterization of viral and microbial pathogens that can be found in nature.</p><p id="p0146" num="0146">SARS-CoV is a newly emergent virus of unknown origin that was first identified to cause disease in humans in Guangdong province, China in November of 2002<!-- EPO <DP n="84"> --> (1;2). SARS-CoV possesses a unique combination of high virulence and an attack rate that allows it to cause alarming outbreaks of atypical pneumonia, particularly in hospital settings. Speculation regarding the origins of SARS-CoV has largely focused on introduction from animals, given that SARS CoV is a unique coronavirus that does not closely match any known members infecting humans and domestic animals (3). Coronaviruses (CoVs) generally have a narrow host range, infecting one or just a few species, an implication being that SARS-CoV has jumped a relatively discrete species barrier (4). On the other hand the recent isolation of SARS-CoV from the feces of several exotic animals, including Palm civets, in live animal markets in China suggests that this virus has a broad host range (5;6) but cannot currently be interpreted as representing the identification of the source of SARS-CoV.</p><p id="p0147" num="0147">Within the first month of recognition of SARS as a novel entity, SARS-CoV was isolated in several affected countries including Canada where the full genome sequence of the Tor-2 isolate was determined (3). This was followed in rapid succession by genomic comparison among SARS-CoV isolates from patients inside China and abroad that provided a snapshot of a relatively slowly evolving pathogen (7). The isolates could be assigned to 2 groups that primarily differed by 4 mutations and that had accumulated over an indeterminate period within a 3 to 8 months span of independent evolution (twice the span from possible divergence in Guangdong). In contrast to the rapid evolution that is expected of a virus that has entered a new host, this was the amount of mutation that would be expected for a coronavirus in its natural host<!-- EPO <DP n="85"> --> over this time period (predicted to be 5 to 14 mutations from the observed mutation rate for porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of 7 x 10<sup>-4</sup>/nucleotide/year) (8). This suggests an alternate hypothesis for the origin of SARS CoV, as it raises the possibility that SARS CoV has a human-like origin or is a virus of multiple hosts including humans but that has gone undetected until mutating to increased virulence. Given the paucity of pertinent human surveillance, it is conceivable that unrecognized human CoVs exist, especially in less developed regions.</p><p id="p0148" num="0148">Coronaviruses are large, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that usually cause mild respiratory disease in humans and possibly enteric disease in children (4). Human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, are responsible for about 30% of mild upper respiratory tract illnesses. Although examination of the SARS-CoV genome demonstrates a typical CoV genome organization (9), the genome must possess features that are responsible for its unique biological properties. Some of these are expected to reside in the major surface protein, S, that contains important antigenic sites and is a key genetic determinant of virulence (10; 11) and host tropism (12;13).</p><p id="p0149" num="0149">The discovery of sequence homology to a known protein or family of proteins often provides the first insights into the function of a novel gene sequence. Yet, the level of similarity between the predicted amino acid sequence of the S protein of SARS-CoV and other CoVs is low (20-27% pair-wise amino acid identity(9)and therefore the comparison of primary amino acid sequences does not<!-- EPO <DP n="86"> --> readily provide insight into the biological properties of the SARS-CoV S protein (<figref idrefs="f0025">Figs. 17A</figref> &amp; <figref idrefs="f0026">17B</figref>). Also the CoV genetic map is largely incomplete, as most functions have not been ascribed to specific genetic regions or sequences(4). In addition to serving specific replicative functions viral proteins must also be of low immunogenicity in their cognate host. As the host employs the immune response to limit and clear infections, viruses have evolved means of avoiding or inhibiting this response.</p><p id="p0150" num="0150">In contrast to large DNA viruses, which encode multiple proteins with dedicated functions, RNA viruses have smaller genomes (as larger size put them over the fatal error threshold into catastrophe) that possess overlapping genes and multifunctional proteins (23;24). Evolutionary analysis of RNA viruses is therefore confounded by extreme genetic variation occurring at a rate of about 10<sup>-3</sup> per nucleotide per year for synonymous sites and 10<sup>-5</sup> for non-synonymous mutations that are under selective constraints (25). Such rapid evolution means that limited evolutionary relationships can be analyzed (projected to be less than 50,000 years) but it does provide a rich genetic trail to follow. Since RNA viruses produce on average a single mutation per genome replication, a population of viruses that is four times genome length in nucleotides constitutes a pool of viruses comprised of all possible single nucleotide substitutions (1.2 x 10<sup>5</sup> virions for coronaviruses); as individual mutations are the fodder of evolution, such a population size can be said to have reached the maximum diversity threshold (MDT). Viruses exist within hosts as large populations, well beyond MDT (typically &gt; 10<sup>7</sup><!-- EPO <DP n="87"> --> per gram tissue), constituting mutant swarms of variants, termed quasispecies that possess genomes centered around consensus sequences (26;27). As populations beyond MDT are comprised of genomes possessing all possible single nucleotide and amino acid substitutions, if any given single change can positively affect replication in the host it will be selected to eventually replace the population. Continuous reiteration of this process is therefore predicted to incrementally and progressively increase antigenic mimicry of host proteins. In keeping with this concept virus evolution is accelerated on entering a new host environment where new forces select novel variants to better fit the new host, as seen for HIV and influenza A viruses on entry into humans from primates and avians respectively (25). Experimental studies of rapid directed evolution in an alternate host includes the acquisition of optimizing mutations that allow interaction with specific host proteins required in replication (28;29). Viruses can also evolve to mimic host protein structure to avoid detection, as the immune system employs a process of antigenic recognition focused on the discrimination of foreign versus self antigens. In this regard the S protein of several CoVs infecting mice, cows, and pigs contain host Fc gamma receptor (Fc(R) domains that are known to bind immunoglobulins and may play a role in pathogenesis (33). Three short homologous Fcγ receptor domains of 6-13 of amino acid were identified in the S protein of mouse hepatitis virus, (MHV) (34).

This yields protein alignment scores as E<!-- EPO <DP n="89"> --> values, representing the chance probability of obtaining a given homologous sequence from a given data set and where E = 0 indicates identity. Using genomic data sets, E values between 1 and 10 are usually related and values less than 0.01 almost always represent homologous proteins (35;36). The surface protein, S, is composed of a large N terminal ectodomain comprised of 2 subunits, S1 plus S2, that is anchored in the membrane with a short carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain (37). We found that the N-terminal sequence of S1 (1-800 aa) of SARS-CoVs, is extremely divergent and thus significantly distinct from other CoVs. In particular, within the first 250 aa of the S protein, the similarity between SARS-CoVs and other CoVs is as low as to appear unrelated (E value &gt; 10) (<figref idrefs="f0026">Fig. 17B</figref>).

To begin to assess the relative amount of human genome homology, sequential 300 amino acid portions of the S gene were compared to the human protein database. In general the extent of homology was relatively low which may reflect the high variability of the S protein. At the lower level of significance (E value &gt;2.0) HPDSEs were found to correspond to regions within the S protein of all CoVs (<figref idrefs="f0027">Fig. 18</figref>, see Table 7 for protein legend). In contrast maximal homology was found for SARS CoV and multiple instances of high human protein domain homology was also seen for the human and mouse strains that differed from the IBV and BCoV animal strains that each possessed one domain near this level. Overall, the number and degree of homology of HPDs was higher in SARS-CoV and human CoVs than in animal CoVs. This suggests that SARS is as human-like as human coronavirus with respect to host structural mimicry of the highly variable surface protein.</p><p id="p0154" num="0154">We used the same approach to analyze the ORF1a replicase polyprotein required for RNA synthesis of CoVs. Comparisons of 1000 aa blocks of ORF1a from representative CoVs, were made with the human proteome<!-- EPO <DP n="91"> --> (<figref idrefs="f0028">Fig 19A</figref>, Table 8). Again, several HPDSEs with lower homology (E&gt;0.1) were found in all CoVs (not shown), however very high homology HPDSE was identified in a 146 aa replicase region from 1034-1180 aa corresponding to a B aggressive lymphoma cDNA that bore the highest similarity to HCoV-229E (E values to 9e-07), followed by SARS-CoV and then MHV; no significant homology was seen for chicken or bovine CoV. Two other related human proteins had lesser homology to the same HPDSE in HCoV-229E but maintained high levels of homology to SARS-CoV and MHV. Presumably HCoV-229E had evolved towards the B aggressive lymphoma protein but not the 2 other divergent protein homologues (KIAA1268 and LRP16). Interestingly, SARS-CoV had the highest homology to these latter protein domains followed by human and murine viruses. This suggests that SARS is as human like as HCoV-229E but that murine coronavirus also has a close relationship with humans, which was not seen for bovine or chicken coronaviruses.</p><p id="p0155" num="0155">When we searched the mouse proteome for viral homology to mouse proteins using representatives of the four groups of CoVs we found homology to the corresponding mouse family of 3 related proteins, 2 of which (MP1, B aggressive lymphoma; and MP2, BAC40943.1) correspond to human proteins (E = 0 for HP1, B aggressive lymphoma cDNA; and HP2, KIAA1268) (<figref idrefs="f0028">Fig 19B</figref>, Table 8). In this instance the MHV replicase possessed the highest homology (E = 8e-09) to MP2 followed by SARS CoV and then human CoV229E (<figref idrefs="f0028">Fig 19B</figref>). Interestingly, although the human and mouse virus possessed similar homology to MP1 and MP2, SARS-CoV possessed the highest homology to these proteins. Again the extent of homology to HPDSE in CoVs<!-- EPO <DP n="92"> --> of known origin was associated with their host of origin. Alignment of a 70 aa portion of homologous viral sequences with the mouse and human proteins shows SARS-CoV to possess 38.5 % and 34.3 % sequence homology to HP1 and 2 as well as 34 .3 % to both MP1 and 2 (<figref idrefs="f0029">Fig. 20A</figref>). These homologies were similar to those seen for MHV but were higher than those seen for IBV (ranging from 26.2 to 29.2%) (<figref idrefs="f0030">Fig. 20B</figref>). SARS-CoV possesses host genome homology that parallels human CoVs and suggests a human passage history that could also involve rodent transmission as high genome mimicry was also seen relative to the mouse genomes for both human and mouse viruses. The high shared homology of murine and human coronaviruses to both of their alternative hosts is consistent with the close phylogenic relationship between humans and rodents that have diverged relatively recently. The percent identity of pairs of sequences as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0030">Fig. 20B</figref> shows SARS-CoV to be as human-like and as mouse-like as HCoV-229E. As illustrated, the divergence scores are proportional to mutational distance between sequences using the CLUSTAL program of DNA-STAR. As well the pattern of homology of SARS-CoVs to mice may reflect the distant genealogical relationship with the rodent viruses (Rat and MHV) as well as the long history of human and rodent co-habitation which may have contributed to a sharing of viral pathogens including coronaviruses. Indeed rodent to human transmission is very common for bacteria (<i>Salmonella, Francisella, Yersinia</i>) and viruses (Monkeypox, Arenaviruses, Bunyaviruses). Therefore we conclude that SARS-CoV is of human or primate origins but that it may have common history with multiple mammalian species that extends beyond the observed infection of cat-like animals to<!-- EPO <DP n="93"> --> possibly include their prey, rodents. This grouping of hosts constitutes both a confluence of cohabiting organism but as well a group of foods as both rodents, cats in addition to nonhuman primates are consumed by humans in southern China. Local culinary practices that include the butchering and eating of wild caught animals could also promote transmission of their resident viruses to humans.</p><heading id="h0025"><b>SARS-CoV S protein possesses a bacterial virulence factor domain</b></heading><p id="p0156" num="0156">Another important question relates to the basis for the high virulence of SARS-CoV. In contrast to the upper respiratory infections due to typical human CoVs the pattern of SARS disease symptoms and virus isolation indicates infection of both the lower respiratory and gastro enteric tracts (41). In an assessment of clinical progression of 75 patients with SARS, patients initially possessed signs of respiratory infection that included abnormal radiological signs in individual lung lobes. One week after onset of symptoms, most patients developed watery diarrhea coincident with a worsening of radiological findings and respiratory sysmptoms and a high incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, in 15 of 18 patients) requiring mechanical ventilation. Peak virus titres in nasal secretions are seen around the time of onset of diarrhea where virus was shed in feces for several weeks.</p><p id="p0157" num="0157">This pattern of disease indicates that SARS is not only pneumotropic attacking the lungs but that there is subsequent spread of infection to the enteric tract, leading to diarrhea concomitant with spread throughout the lung. SARS infection is systemic as virus was also<!-- EPO <DP n="94"> --> present in blood (42) and urine (41). SARS CoV may be more able to reach or enter and colonize the gastro enteric tract than typical human CoV. Most animal CoVs have dual tropism being able to replicate in the respiratory and enteric tracts. Interestingly the HCoV-OC43, that is very similar to BCoV and may represent a recent introduction from animals, has also been reported to be shed in feces in children and been associated with systemic infection (4). Several viruses enter into the circulation through specialized lymphoid organs called Peyer's Patches that exist in the lumen of the respiratory and enteric tract as seen for enteroviruses, Reovirus, and HIV (43). Specialized epithelial cells called microfold epithelial cells (M) overlay Peyer's Patches and function to sample molecules and particles for presentation to lymphoid cells within Peyer's Patches. Fecal-oral transmission has been implicated in the dissemination of SARS-CoV during a large outbreak in a Hong Kong apartment complex (41).</p><p id="p0158" num="0158">As viral surface proteins are invariably involved in tropism and spread we focused on S protein structure to derive biological clues to its role in virulence. The variable S1 subunit comprises the N-terminal half of S (see <figref idrefs="f0025 f0026">Fig. 17</figref>), and is responsible for binding to specific receptors on the membranes of susceptible cells. Variation in S1 is associated with altered antigenicity and pathogenicity (8). Other biological activities have also been associated with the S1 subunit such as the Fcγ receptor for immunoglobulin, mentioned earlier. To gain insight into the genetic structure of SARS-CoV, we assessed the existence of other protein homology domains in S, we searched all gene<!-- EPO <DP n="95"> --> sequences available in BanBank using a combination of DNA STAR and web-based NCBI programs. Surprisingly, the highest homology SARS-CoV S protein domain was shared with pathogenicity factor, gip<i>A</i>, a Peyer's Patches virulence factor from invasive <i>E. coli</i> CFT073 (44) and <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar typhimurium (45) and (<figref idrefs="f0031">Fig. 21</figref>). The 376 amino acid <i>gipA</i>, protein as characterized in Salmonella is a protein encoded in the lysogenic lambdoid phage, Gifsy-1, that is only expressed in the intestine where it enhances virulence by increasing the ability of <i>Salmonella</i> to grow and survive in Peyer's patch and cause systemic disease. The <i>gipA</i> domain of S protein is located at aa position 177-213 corresponding to <i>gipA</i> aa 102 to 143. All SARS-CoV strains have the same <i>gipA</i> homology (aa identity 45%, 19/45), which is much higher than that predicted by chance (5%).</p><p id="p0159" num="0159">When the SARS-CoV sequence was aligned with the consensus sequence of <i>gip</i>A and its homologous gene family, comprised of bacterial transposases, the homology rose to 54.5% (not shown). The SARS-CoV-<i>gipA</i> homology was higher than that seen for the transposase genes suggesting that SARS-COV S is more likely to possess the virulence function than the transposition function. The sequence alignment of S and <i>gipA</i> indicates that 28% amino acids (105/376) of <i>gipA</i> are identical and align in a mosaic pattern to matched sequences of SARS-CoV S. In comparison to SARS-CoV, the percentage of identical sequence between <i>gipA</i> and S of other CoVs was much lower, (e.g. down to 15% in IBV) but which also suggests a significant homology (data not shown). Although the major SARS <i>gipA</i> domain was not found in other known CoVs, the same region of S1 has been mapped to the control of<!-- EPO <DP n="96"> --> enterotropism in porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Naturally occurring TGEV variants that have lost enterotropism and are restricted to infection of the respiratory tract have a deletion of this region (that has been genetically confirmed to control enterotropism) and other respiratory variants that are not deleted have mutations in this region (8) (<figref idrefs="f0032">Fig. 22</figref>). The occurrence of the <i>gipA</i> virulence factor domain at a position corresponding to the porcine enterotropism controlling element, further supports a proposed role in enterotropism and virulence of SARS-CoV. It is also possible to speculate that pre-existing antibody to uropathogenic <i>E. coli</i> CFT073 or <i>Salmonella</i> typhimurium that occurs commonly in some human populations, may provide cross-protection against SARS-CoV as the <i>gipA</i> domain resides in a location corresponding to 2 antibody binding sites in TGEV (8;46) that also overlaps with a sialic acid binding domain (37;47;48). Regional differences in the existence of cross-reactive immunity in various human populations could help explain the observed differences in disease severity and transmission observed in different geographic regions. The existence of a bacterial gene homologue in a eukaryotic virus represents another example of lateral gene transfer between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, as reported for 40 other genes in the human genome (49). Coronaviruse have demonstrated abilities to recombine with other CoVs as well as transduce genes from other viruses types which infect the same tissues and may now include viruses of bacteria (37). Further experiments are needed to determine the significance of the <i>gipA</i> protein domain in the observed severity of SARS.<!-- EPO <DP n="97"> --></p><p id="p0160" num="0160">We conclude that the SARS-CoV genome possesses evidence of adaptation to human-like and rodent-like hosts as well as the acquisition of a HPDSE having homology to a bacterial virulence factor. Consistent with its broad host range, such adaptation may have allowed SARS-CoV to directly enter the human host without the need for extensive adaptive events or alternatively that SARS-CoV is a variant of a human coronavirus.</p><p id="p0161" num="0161">The embodiment(s) of the invention described above is(are) intended to be exemplary only.
