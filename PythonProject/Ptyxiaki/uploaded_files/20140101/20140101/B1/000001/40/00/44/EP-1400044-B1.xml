Program receivers include television receivers, radio receivers, computers, and/or other devices capable of being tuned to programs that are distributed over the air, over cable systems, by way of satellites, etc. Tuning data, for example, includes the identity of the channel or station to which the program receiver is tuned and/or the identity of the program to which the program receiver is tuned. It is further customary to provide a manual input 20 device that can be used by those audience members who are actually in an audience of a receiver to indicate their identities to the measurement apparatus. This manual input is frequently provided in the form of a Peoplemeter® which not only allows each audience member to manually enter a corresponding audience member identification but also provides a visual status indicator for showing which of the audience members have indicated that they are currently in the receiver's audience. For example, this visual status indicator may comprise a plurality of selectively illuminated light emitting diodes disposed on a box placed adjacent to a receiver and within the field of view of the audience members.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The manual input device alternatively may be a battery-powered remote control or other remote device that includes a keypad and an infra-red pulse transmitter which permit an audience member to manually enter the member's identity and to transmit that identity by way of infra-red pulses to the measurement apparatus or other data collector. The measurement apparatus or other data collector also provides a visual status indication as discussed above. An exemplary remote control of this type is disclosed by <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4876736A"><text>Kiewit in U.S. Patent No. 4,876,736</text></patcit>. Still other alternative devices which collect manually entered audience member identification data and which use the receiver to indicate the currently recorded audience status are known.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The tuning data from the measurement apparatus and the audience member identities from the manual input device are commonly time stamped with the times of each tuning event and/or of each change in audience composition. The time stamped tuning and audience member records are then stored in a store and forward unit within the statistically selected location for subsequent forwarding to a data collection central office, such as on a daily or other basis.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Because audience members forget from time to time to enter their identities, it is known to prompt the audience members to manually enter their identities. However, it is well known in audience measurement that systems relying on prompting signals sent to cooperating audience members must be concerned about the frequency of those prompting signals. If a cooperating individual perceives the prompting signals as being so frequent as to be annoying, he or she may stop cooperating. On the other hand, if the prompting is too infrequent, the cooperating individual may forget to enter data at appropriate times.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US4816904A"><text>McKenna et al., in U.S. Patent No. 4,816,904</text></patcit>, discloses an arrangement in which a prompting message is displayed on a television screen overlaid on viewer selected programming by mixing the prompting message with the video signal being sent to the display. However, McKenna et al. do not teach how to effectively regulate the prompting frequency.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Therefore, the present invention is directed to the use of tuning and/or audience response data in an 10 adaptive prompting algorithm to select the frequency with which prompting occurs.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a method of prompting an audience member to enter an audience member identification into an audience meter comprises the following: determining a probability that the audience member is in an audience of a receiver; prompting the audience member to enter the audience member identification if the probability that the audience member is in the audience of the receiver is less than a threshold; and, suppressing prompting of the audience member if the probability that the audience member is in the audience of the receiver is greater than the threshold.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method of prompting an audience member to enter 15 an audience member identification into an audience meter comprises the following: determining a variable as a function of a number of times that the audience member was in an audience of a receiver and a number of times that the receiver was turned on;

at each prompting occasion, determining a likelihood based upon past audience composition and tuning habits that the audience member is in an audience of a receiver; and, suppressing prompting of the audience member if the determination made at a corresponding prompting occasion indicates that it is likely that the audience member is in the audience of the receiver.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention, a method of prompting an audience member to enter an audience member identification into an audience meter comprises the following: applying a heuristic to determine whether the audience member is in an audience of a receiver; counting the audience members in the audience of the receiver to produce a count; prompting the audience member to enter the audience member identification if the heuristic indicates that the audience member is not in the audience of the receiver and if the count is not equal a number of logged in audience members;

The statistically selected location 12, for example, may be a household. The audience measurement system 10 includes a portable remote control device 14 which controls a receiver 16. The receiver 16, for example, may be a television receiver as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, although the receiver 16 could instead be a radio, a computer, or any other receiver that is capable of being tuned to programs distributed over the air, over cable, by way of satellite, or by way of other communication methodology to the statistically selected location 12.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The portable remote control device 14 may have a user interface such as a keypad which includes buttons to allow an audience member to enter channel numbers, to change channels up and down, to increase and decrease volume, to mute the receiver 16, and to turn the receiver 16 on and off. Thus, the portable remote control device 14 can be<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> used from a remote position 18 in order to change the channel, volume level, and so on of the receiver 16.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The keypad of the portable remote control device may also permit audience members to identify themselves when they are in the audience of the receiver 16. The names and appropriate demographic information of each of the audience members may be associated with a corresponding one of the buttons of the keypad and may be suitably stored in an appropriate memory. Accordingly, when an audience member presses a button for identification purposes, the time and date of the press, the appropriate identification, and the appropriate demographic information may be stored with the corresponding tuning data.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The audience measurement system 10 is arranged to log data on audience membership (hereinafter "audience member identification data"). The audience measurement system 10 may be arranged to also log tuning data regarding the programs and/or channels to which the receiver 16 is tuned. Periodically, the logged data is transmitted over a network 20 to a data collection central office 22. The network 20 may be any mechanism for conveying the logged data to the data collection central office 22. For example, the network 20 may be a public switched telephone network, as is conventional practice in the audience measurement art.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The portable remote control device 14 may be used to enter member identification data into a measurement apparatus 24 which is installed adjacent to the receiver 16. The measurement apparatus 24 may also be arranged to acquire tuning data from the receiver 16 in any conventional manner in addition to the audience member identification data acquired from the portable remote control device 14. Additionally or<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> alternatively, the audience member identification data may be entered by devices other than the portable remote control device 14. For example, a Peoplemeter® may be used to enter member identification data into the measurement apparatus 24 as discussed above. Additionally or alternatively, the audience member identification data may be entered by use of switches mounted directly on the measurement apparatus 24, or the audience member identification data may be entered into the measurement apparatus 24 by use of an electronic program guide (EPG). If an EPG is used, the EPG may also be used to enter tuning data into the measurement apparatus 24. The acquired tuning and audience member identification data can be communicated to the data collection central office 22 by a variety of techniques known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The audience measurement system 10 includes a data storage and forwarding unit 26 which collects the tuning and audience member identification data from the measurement apparatus 24 and which stores the tuning and audience member identification data until a scheduled forwarding time when the tuning and audience member identification data are forwarded to the data collection central office 22. The data storage and forwarding unit 26 may also store and forward tuning and audience member identification data collected from a measurement apparatus, similar to the measurement apparatus 24, associated with each of the other receivers (not shown) located in the statistically selected location 12. The audience measurement system 10, the measurement apparatus 24, and/or the data storage and forwarding unit 26 may be referred to herein as an audience meter.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The measurement apparatus 24 can comprise logic and a memory so that the current tuning data can be acquired and determined by the measurement apparatus 24 based upon channel selection inputs from the portable remote control device 14.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Alternatively or additionally, the measurement apparatus 24 may receive a signal replica from a signal detector 34. For example, this signal detector 34 may be in the form of a video signal source detector such as that disclosed by Chan, in issued U.S.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Patent Application Serial No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US08654309B"><text>08/654,309</text></patcit>. This video signal source detector may be positioned as taught in the Chan application to acquire a replica of a video signal from an input to a CRT of the receiver 16.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Alternatively or additionally, the signal detector 34 may be in the form of a microphone which acquires a replica of an audio output from a speaker of the receiver 16. Accordingly, the signal detector 34 is arranged to non-intrusively acquire from the receiver 16 a replica of the video and/or audio signal processed by the receiver 16.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The signal replica acquired by the signal detector 34 can then be processed by the measurement apparatus 24 according to a variety of tuning measurement methodologies. For example, (i) an ancillary video and/or audio code (such as a source identification (SID) code) identifying the tuned program or channel can be read from the signal replica, if present, (ii) video and/or audio feature signatures characteristic of the tuned program can be extracted from the signal replica and compared to reference signatures in order to identify the program or channel, and/or (iii) the signal replica can be correlated with a contemporary reference signal obtained by a reference scanning tuner controlled by the measurement apparatus 24 in order to identify the program or channel.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As a further alternative, the signal detector 34 may be arranged to detect the local oscillator frequency of the receiver 16. This local oscillator frequency indicates the channel to which the receiver 16 is tuned, as is known in the audience measurement art.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Moreover, whether or not the signal detector 34 is employed, the measurement apparatus 24 may receive an ON/OFF input from an ON/OFF sensor 36. The ON/OFF sensor 36, for example, may be an inductive sensor which determines that the receiver 16 is on by detecting the inductive signals emanating from the receiver 16. In the case where the receiver 16 is a television receiver, the ON/OFF sensor 36 may be an inductive sensor which, as is well known, determines that the receiver 16 is on by detecting the horizontal retrace frequency of the CRT of the receiver 16. Alternatively, the ON/OFF sensor 36 may have a photodetector probe positioned in relation to the screen display of the receiver 16 so that changing light levels or the amount of light emanating from the screen display can be used to indicate when the receiver 16 is on or off. Alternatively, the ON/OFF sensor 36 can be any other type of sensor suitably arranged to determine the on/off status of the receiver 16.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In controlling the receiver 16, the portable remote control device 14 preferably operates in the manner of a conventional universal remote control capable of controlling two or more tuner appliances, such as a television receiver, a VCR, and/or a cable converter. Such a universal remote control conventionally uses several different code sets so that it can operate in multiple user-selected modes. One or more of these modes can be used to transmit a tuning or other command (e.g., a fast forward command sent to a VCR) to the currently active tuner (e.g., the tuner of receiver 16 or of a set-top cable converter or of a VCR) controlling the receiver 16. In addition, one of the modes of<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the portable remote control device 14 is also used to transmit audience member identification data to the measurement apparatus 24.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Optionally, the keypad of the portable remote control device 14 may be provided with dedicated buttons associated with each of the audience members. Accordingly, these dedicated buttons may be used by the audience members exclusively for member identification.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The measurement apparatus 24 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> includes a microprocessor 52 suitably connected to a transceiver 54, the signal detector 34, a ROM 56, a RAM 58, the ON/OFF sensor 36, and an interface 60. The transceiver 54, coupled to the microprocessor 52 executing a program stored in the ROM 56, is used to receive tuning status and/or audience member identification data from the portable remote control device 14. The tuning status data, along with the current audience member identification data and a time stamp, are temporarily saved in the RAM 58. Optionally or alternatively, the measurement apparatus 24 may also respond to the signal detector 34, as discussed above, in order to identify the tuned program from codes, signatures, or correlations, or to determine the tuned channel such as by detecting the local oscillator frequency of the receiver 16. This information can be temporarily stored in the RAM 58. The measurement apparatus 24 additionally may be arranged to determine the ON/OFF status of the receiver 16 from the ON/OFF sensor 36. The ON/OFF status of the receiver 16 is used as discussed below in the prompting of audience members to enter their identifications by use of the portable remote control device 14 (or otherwise) in accordance with a prompting program described below. As discussed above, the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> measurement apparatus 24 transmits the ON/OFF, tuning, and audience member identification data to the data storage and forwarding unit 26 by means of the interface 60.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Accordingly, the measurement apparatus 24 through execution by the microprocessor 52 of a program stored in the ROM 56 acquires and/or determines tuning data associated with the tuning of the receiver 16 and temporarily stores this tuning data in the RAM 58. The measurement apparatus 24 also acquires and/or determines the ON/OFF status of the receiver 16 and temporarily stores this status in the RAM 58. Moreover, the measurement apparatus 24 receives audience member identification data and temporarily stores this data in the RAM 58.

Data collapsing is useful whenever insufficient data has been collected upon which to make predictions about the audience members in the audience of a receiver at a given day part. For example, data collapsing is particularly useful during the first few months of initial data collection because insufficient data is likely to have been collected upon which to make predictions about the audience members in the audience of a receiver at a given day part.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The table shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 5</figref> is only exemplary of the way in which the data may be stored.

These tables permit a variable weighting of data by recency of behavior which may be used, for example, during data collapsing.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Thus, this recency weighting is accomplished by combining all four month tables on a weighted basis into a 10 master table that is used for each receiver to determine whether or not to deliver the scheduled prompt to the audience at that receiver. For example, if the recency<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> weights are 2.1, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, then every cell in the four month tables described above would be combined, giving a 15 weight of 2.1 to the data in the current month table and equal weights of 0.3 to the data in the other three tables.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The program 100 at a block 112 determines whether it is time to evaluate the data in the tables discussed above. For example, the block 112 may use an elapsed time timer such that the block 112 determines that it is time to perform its evaluation when the elapsed time timer accumulates an amount of time T. The time T between evaluations may be set to 42 minutes or any other number of minutes which is deemed appropriate. Accordingly, at T after the receiver 16 has initially been turned on, the program 100 at the block 112 initiates an evaluation of the data stored in the tables to determine if prompting should be suppressed. Thus, a prompt will be given after the passage of T unless the evaluation indicates that prompting should be suppressed.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The evaluation is a probability-based heuristic. 10 The tuning and audience composition history at the statistically selected location 12 is mathematically summarized and represented in multidimensional tables of counts.

Rather than treating this determination as a problem in combinatorics, this determination may be treated as a problem of individual tuning at a receiver, by SID and day part, but including terms that include co-receiving history and current response to an alternate receiver (co-location).</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The operation of the heuristic may be illustrated with the sample frequency tables shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figures 6</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0008">7</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0009">8</figref>. The tables shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figures 6</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">7</figref> correspond to the frequency tables for two SID classifications, SID 11 and SID 12. These SID classes, for example, divide the programs by program type such as daytime drama, prime time drama, sports which can be further broken down into subtypes such as football, baseball, etc. Accordingly, Each SID may be assigned to one of these classes.

Counting of persons may be implemented by using electric eyes, proximity, or other sensing to count the audience members as they enter and leave a reception area associated with the receiver 16. A counter 90 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> for this purpose. The measurement apparatus 24 collects count information from the counter 90 and passes this count information to the data storage and forwarding unit 26 as appropriate. If the block 114 determines that the<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> number of persons who have logged in is not equal to the number of persons who have been counted in the audience, a block 116 permits the prompt to be given to the audience members at the receiver 16 corresponding to the program 100.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">On the other hand, if the block 114 determines that the number of persons who have logged in is equal to the number of persons who have been counted in the audience, a block 118 determines a variable NUMBER as a result of dividing a data value COUNTS by a data value TUOCC. The data value COUNTS is taken from the counts row, at the receiver location, during the day part, and for the SID class corresponding to the current day part and the current SID of the program being received by the receiver corresponding to the program 100. For example, if the current day part is 6:30 AM if the SID from the program being received by the appropriate receiver is in SID class 11, and if the appropriate receiver is the bedroom receiver, the data value for COUNTS is 19.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The data value TUOCC is taken from the tuning occasions row, at the receiver location, during the day part, and for the SID class corresponding to the current day part and the current SID of the program being received by the receiver corresponding to the program 100.

If the variable NUMBER does not exceeds the corresponding threshold, the block 116 permits the prompt to be given to the audience members at the receiver 16 corresponding to the program 100. On the other hand, if the variable NUMBER exceeds the corresponding threshold, a block 122 rounds NUMBER to the nearest integer and compares the rounded NUMBER to the current persons count. This current persons count may be derived, for example, by summing the number of audience members who have logged into the measurement apparatus 24 at the receiver 16 corresponding to the program 100. Alternatively, the current persons count may be derived by using the sensing described above to count the audience members as they enter and leave a reception area associated with the receiver 16.

Therefore, if the rounded NUMBER is not different than the current persons count, a block 124 sets a variable PREDICTED PERSON equal to the person having the maximum probability of being in the audience of the receiver 16 corresponding to the program 100. For example, using the tables of <figref idrefs="f0007 f0008 f0009">Figures 6-8</figref> and as described above, the person having the maximum probability of being in the audience of the bedroom receiver<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> at the current time (6:00 AM + T) watching a program in SID class 11 is the 35-49 year old female. Therefore, the variable PREDICTED PERSON is set to the 35-49 year old female.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Also, the block 124 computes the probability that the PREDICTED PERSON (the 35-49 year old female in the example) is in the audience by dividing the number of times the 35-49 year old female tuned into a program having the relevant SID class and during the current day part by the count for that SID class and day part. For example, the probability that the 35-49 year old female is in the audience of the bedroom receiver which is tuned to a program having the SID class 11 at and during the current time (6:00 AM + T) is 19/20 using the table of <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 6</figref>. This probability 19/20 may be adjusted by a lead-in adjustment factor F<sub>LI</sub>. This lead in factor F<sub>LI</sub> is used to adjust the computed probability when the PREDICTED PERSON was in the audience of the relevant receiver during the immediately preceding day part.

Navigation characteristics indicate the manner in which certain audience members tune the receiver 16. Thus, in the same way that tuning to individual programs or tuning during specific day parts or on specific sets may be correlated with a particular household member as described above, tuning styles may also be associated with individual household members. Accordingly, when tuning patterns are evaluated, the styles in which people select their programs may also be evaluated.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Tuning styles can be described by a variety of terms depending on which paradigm is being used to conceptualize receiver tuning. Tuning styles can be considered to mean or include "navigational patterns", "biometric signatures," or "keystroke dynamics." These styles can be characterized by some very simple "statistics" or by more complex forms of representing knowledge.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">"Statistics" are formally defined by mathematicians as a mathematical projection of a vector or set of data onto a single or simple set of parameters. Thus, statistics are used, in effect, to summarize data. A mean is an example of a statistic which may be used to summarize a set of data. However, in summarizing data, certain<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> knowledge about the data, such as variance, kurtosis, skew, and, of course, the exact value of each data point, is lost. Therefore, the statistics used to summarize the data may or may not be sufficient.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">"Sufficiency" in theoretical statistics refers to the ability of a "statistic" to reproduce the required detail of a data distribution. In some households, a simple statistic can "sufficiently" represent tuning style. One such statistic is the average number of stations or programs tuned per time period. For example, if one audience member views "appointment television" (i.e, an audience member tunes to a channel carrying a selected program and stays on that channel throughout most or all of the selected program), the average number of stations "hit" per half hour will be very small. But if another audience member is a "surfer," the average number of "hits" per half hour will be much, much larger. While summaries of the tuning habits of these audience members may cause knowledge of variance and skew to be lost, the sheer difference between the average velocities (average rate of channel change) of these two audience members is sufficient to distinguish between these audience members. Thus, in this example, the mean rate of Δ is sufficient to identify the individual.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">However, in some households, there may be several members that have the same average rate of channel changing (velocity). In this case, the only way to distinguish these households is to consider channel velocity along with other parameters of tuning which might provide "sufficiency" in order to identify the recent presence of a household member.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">For example, for every time period T (e.g., ½ hr), the average number of channels tuned during that half hour may be recorded and stored in the tables of <figref idrefs="f0007 f0008 f0009">Figures 6-8</figref> for<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> every individual logged on to a receiver. However, velocity may not be sufficient to distinguish between people whose "instantaneous rate of change", often called acceleration, is different. For example, two people may average twenty channel hits per half hour with one of the people methodically surfing by watching every other hit for a minute or two, while the other of the two people surfs through twenty channels, finds an appealing program, and then watches for a half hour. The average velocity is not a sufficient statistic to distinguish these two audience members. However, their acceleration can be used to distinguish between them.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">There are several statistics that can represent "acceleration." An exemplary statistic to represent acceleration is given by the following description. If it assumed that the time period is thirty. minutes, the following ratio may be used to characterize acceleration:
<ul><li><b><u># <i>of channels in past 30 minutes</i></u></b></li><li><b><u># <i>of minutes in which channel was changed in past</i> 30</u><i><u>minutes</u></i></b></li></ul></p><p id="p0075" num="0075">For example, if twenty channels were hit in ten separate minutes of tuning, then the acceleration is 20/10 or a modest 2. On the other hand, if twenty channels were hit in two minutes of surfing, then the acceleration is 20/2 or a moderate ten.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">In some homes, even "acceleration" may not be sufficient to distinguish between audience members. For example, it may be the case that where an audience member surfs in a program or channel space is the key to distinguishing between two audience members. Therefore, in such households, a learning heuristic can be used to classify the "cluster of channels" that an audience member surfs and to match this surfing cluster to the "clusters of programs" to which an audience member tunes. Accordingly,<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> classification and matching may be done specifically to distinguish between the channel-surfing patterns of two audience members with similar velocity and acceleration histories.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Accordingly, the probability determined at the block 124 can be adjusted up or down by velocity, acceleration, and/or program clustering. Alternatively, any combination of these factors can be included in the program 100 as one or more decision blocks.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Certain parameters used by the program 100 may be downloadable from the data collection central office 22 to the measurement apparatus 24 or the data storage and forwarding unit 26 and stored in the RAM 58 or the RAM 88.

For example, it is noted that the portable remote control device 14 may function in several different modes as described above. However, each of these modes may use a separate corresponding remote control.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">Also, the present invention as described above relies on the use of certain infrared transceivers. However, it will be appreciated that other signaling modes, such as ultrasonic or spread-spectrum radio, could instead be employed.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">In addition, the present invention as described above relies on the use of transceivers. Instead, a separate receiver and transmitter could be used in place of each transceiver.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">Moreover, as discussed above, instead of executing the program 100 at the data storage and forwarding unit 26, the program 100 can be executed at each<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> measurement apparatus 24 within the statistically selected location 12. In this case, the data storage tables shown in <figref idrefs="f0006 f0007 f0008 f0009">Figures 5-8</figref> may be modified by eliminating the receiver category. Also in this case, the storing and forwarding function performed by the data storage and forwarding unit 26 can be performed by the measurement apparatus 24 so that the data storage and forwarding unit 26 can be eliminated.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">Furthermore, as described above, the portable remote control device 14 according to the first embodiment 15 of the invention transmits tuning commands which are received by both the controlled tuner and by the measurement apparatus 24. The controlled tuner responds by effecting the tuning indicated by the tuning command, and the measurement apparatus 24 responds by recording the tuning event. Instead, in accordance with the teachings of <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US4876736A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,876,736</text></patcit>, the portable remote control device 14 may be arranged to transmit tuning commands using codes recognized by the measurement apparatus 24 but not by the tuner of the receiver 16. Thus, the measurement apparatus 24 records the tuning event, converts the code into a form recognized by the tuner of the receiver 16, and passes the converted tuning command on to the tuner of the receiver 16.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">Also, a different portable remote control device could be assigned to each person in the household (with additional portable remote control devices provided to visitors). Each person would then carry his or her portable remote control device within the household. The individual's portable remote control device 14 can then be arranged to periodically transit an identification signal to the measurement apparatus 24 either based upon time increments or based upon a command issued by the measurement apparatus 24.<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --></p><p id="p0085" num="0085">Moreover, the prompting permitted by the block 116 may have multiple levels. For example, at the lowest level, the initial prompt could be flashed for 10 seconds. If the audience responds appropriately, the program 100 resumes normal execution. If the audience does not respond appropriately within a predetermined amount of time (e.g. 20 seconds), and the prompt is flashed for 20 seconds at a higher flash rate. If the audience responds appropriately, the program 100 resumes normal execution. If the audience still does not respond appropriately, the block 116 may be arranged to provide an audible tone or a voice command. Different and/or additional levels of prompting may be provided.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">In addition, it may be deemed desirable for audience members to manually update audience composition without prompting as changes in audience composition occur. Prompting serves mainly as a fail-safe, when sufficient time has elapsed without any unprompted change. Therefore, the elapsed time timer used by the block 116 may be reset at each entry of any audience member identification data whether prompted or not.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">As an additional contingency, the interval T between prompts could be lengthened or shortened in order to reinforce timely entry of audience changes. This adjustment of T could be based on the data entry performance of audience members. For example, if a particular audience member typically waits until a prompt appears before reporting an earlier audience change, then the data record will show an improbably high proportion of reported audience changes coinciding with the appearance of the prompt. If this pattern of performance is observed, the program 100 may shorten the interval T between prompts. Shortening the interval T between prompts will tend to reduce any possible lags between the occurrence and reporting of audience changes, as well as to<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> provide a mild negative reinforcement for audience members who fail to report audience changes as they occur.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">Alternatively or additionally, it is possible that 10 audience members will report audience changes when they occur and that the intervals T between prompts are shorter than the interval during which no audience change actually occurs. If this pattern is observed, it may be that the prompting interval T is shorter than required for this audience member. In this instance, the program 100 may lengthen the interval T between prompts in order to provide a positive reinforcement. Indeed, different prompting intervals T could be set for various audience members, depending on their previous performance.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">Furthermore, the heuristic of the present invention as described above relies upon the representation of tuning history and/or style knowledge in the form of a series of probability tables. Such knowledge, however, can be represented in other forms. For example, as receiver tuning events occur, data relating to these events could be stored in a covariance matrix which could then be evaluated through regression, discriminant, or other parametric techniques which would develop prediction scores for each potential household member. Similarly, non-parametric techniques for representing knowledge, such as weighted digraphs, may be used to represent such knowledge. Conceptually, the heuristic has been described above using the simplest form of knowledge representation. However, an important element of the heuristic is its capacity to manage user prompts or questions regardless of how such tuning histories (knowledge) are represented.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">Also, as viewed from the standpoint of a meter, audience members have features: what programs they watch, when they watch, with whom they watch, where they<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> watch, and how they change channels. In some households, one or two of these statistics may suffice to discriminate between audience members. In other households, at certain times of day, many of these statistics may be required. Thus, in a more advanced form of the heuristic described above, aperiodic analysis could be conducted in each household to evaluate the structure, among household members, of each of these features. For example, in a two-person household, one person may surf while the other tunes by appointment. This household would be highly structured with respect to acceleration. In this case, the negentropy, or information content <i>(h<sup>2</sup>)</i> of acceleration, is very high. In an advanced heuristic, the values of each of these features would be weighted by their information content, that is, their ability to discriminate among audience members.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">In addition, specific hardware is described in relation to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>. However, it should be understood that other hardware and/or software arrangements may be used to implement the present invention.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980664" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Verfahren, umfassend:
