load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>Background of the Invention</b></heading><heading id="h0002"><u>1. Field of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a positive resist composition suitably used in super micro lithography processes such as the manufacture of super LSI and high capacity microchips, and other photo-fabrication processes, and a pattern forming method using the same. More specifically, the invention relates to a positive resist composition capable of forming a highly precise pattern with KrF excimer laser rays, electron beams, EUV rays, etc., and a pattern forming method using the same.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>2. Description of the Related Art</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In the manufacturing process of semiconductor devices such as IC and LSI, fine processing by lithography with resist compositions has been conventionally performed. In recent years, with the increment of integration of integrated circuits, ultrafine pattern formation of the level of sub-micron and quarter-micron has come to be required. Under such a circumstance, the exposure wavelengths show a tendency to be shortening, such as from g-ray to i-ray, further to KrF excimer laser rays. Nowadays, further, the development of lithography using electron beams, X-rays or EUV rays, in addition to excimer laser rays, has been advanced.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As the resists suitable for far ultraviolet rays such as KrF excimer lasers, electron beams, X-rays, or EUV rays, "chemical amplification resists" using a radiation-sensitive acid generator capable of generating an acid upon irradiation (hereinafter also referred to as "exposure") with actinic ray or radiation to increase sensitivity of the resists by means of the catalytic action of the generated acid are proposed. As the problem peculiar to such chemical amplification resists, the line width change of a resist pattern or T-shape formation due to the fluctuation of post exposure time delay (hereinafter also referred to as "PED") from exposure to heating treatment after exposure has been conventionally pointed out. However, in late years, various kinds of chemical amplification resists applicable to the manufacture of devices have been proposed including a chemical amplification type radiation-sensitive resin composition using a polymer comprising a hydroxystyrene repeating unit, a t-butyl (meth)acrylate repeating unit, and a repeating unit lowering the solubility of the polymer in an alkali developer after exposure (<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP7209868A"><text>JP-A-7-209868</text></patcit>). However, with the trend of fining of devices of the present state, de-protective groups (a t-butyl protective group, etc.) ordinarily used in chemical amplification resists cannot reveal sufficient contrast, so that it is difficult for these resist compositions to be applied to the manufacture of devices of pattern size finer than now.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In this connection, some resist compositions are known, in which phenolic acid-decomposable resins obtained by<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> copolymerization of acid-decomposable acrylate monomers having an alicyclic group as the de-protective group in place of a t-butyl protective group, etc., are used. For example, positive resist compositions disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5561194A"><text>U.S. Patent 5,561,194</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP9073173A"><text>JP-A-9-73173</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2001166474A"><text>JP-A-2001-166474</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2001166478A"><text>JP-A-2001-166478</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP2003107708A"><text>JP-A-2003-107708</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="JP2001194792A"><text>JP-A-2001-194792</text></patcit> can be exemplified as these resist compositions. It is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="JP9073173A"><text>JP-A-9-73173</text></patcit> that these resist compositions using acid-decomposable resins having such a de-protective group reveal high resolution.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">On the other hand, line edge roughness increases in the degree of importance in late years with the progress of fining. Line edge roughness is minute irregularities of a nanometer scale formed on the sidewall of a pattern when fine lines are formed. Line edge roughness influences line width control, i.e., electrical characteristics of devices.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The above resist compositions using phenolic acid-decomposable resins obtained by copolymerization of acid-decomposable acrylate monomers having an alicyclic group as the de-protective group are not satisfactory with respect to line edge roughness. In addition, further improvement has been required in the point of line width change attendant upon variation of exposure amount, i.e., exposure latitude.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="WO2004051375A1"><text>WO 2004/051375 A1</text></patcit> relates to a positive resist composition comprising a resin component (A), an acid generator component (B) and an organic solvent (C), wherein the component (A) comprises a structural unit (a1) containing an acid dissociable, dissolution inhibiting group, a structural unit (a2) containing a lactone unit and a structural unit (a3) containing a polycyclic group with an alcoholic hydroxyl group. <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="WO2004040371A2"><text>WO 2004/040371 A2</text></patcit> describes a photosensitive composition comprising a specific copolymer, a photoacid generator, a solvent and optionally a base, wherein the copolymer comprises polyhedral siloxanes as pendants from the polymer backbone. <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="EP1091250A1"><text>EP 1 091 250 A1</text></patcit> describes a photoresist composition comprising a photoactive component and a resin binder comprising a polymer that comprises repeating units of a photo-acid labile ester group and a phenolic group. <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="JP2004029437A"><text>JP 2004 029437A</text></patcit> relates to a positive resist composition which comprises (a) a polymer having a structural unit of capable of being alkali-soluble by action of an acid, a structural unit having a lactone skeleton and a structural unit having a phenolic hydroxyl group and (b) an acid generator.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>Summary of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">An object of the invention is to solve the technical problems in fine processing of semiconductor elements using actinic ray<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> or radiation, in particular KrF excimer laser rays, electron beams, or EUV rays, that is, an object of the invention is to provide a positive resist composition showing good line edge roughness and exposure latitude, and another object is to provide a pattern forming method using the same.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention can be achieved by the following constitutions.
