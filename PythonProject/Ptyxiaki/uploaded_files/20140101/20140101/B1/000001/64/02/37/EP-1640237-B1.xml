Furthermore, it includes a pair of front wheels and a leg coupled to said base.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Starting with this premise, a first characteristic is that each of the two front wheels is coupled to a single transversal shaft which is coupled in turn by its ends respectively to one of a pair of side bars that is hinged by one of its ends to the folding base and by its other end to bottom part of the frame structure.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Essentially, the joint of the pair of wheels is coupled under the straight line that joins each one of the end rotating points of the transversal bars, although they could be located at other points.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Another characteristic is that the top part of the frame structure is folding coupling jointedly to a top cross member of the bottom part, at the same time that there are locking means in order to keep this top part stable when the cart is in the unfold position, as a continuation of the bottom part of this frame structure. Meanwhile in the folded position, the top part folds down against the bottom part.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The locking means to keep this top part of the frame stable in the unfolded position consist of a transversal support coupled to and guided on the branches of the bottom part of the frame, at the same time that said support in a raised position provides immobilization of the top part of the frame by means of some complementary anchoring parts connected to the transversal support and the top part of the frame. The transversal support has some stable hooking means in the raised position in order to ensure that the cart remains unfolded.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Said jointed coupling of the top part of the frame structure is coupled to the bottom part by means of some side parts integral to two branches of the top part of the frame structure.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The transversal support has female parts wherein male parts of the top part of the frame structure are inserted in the unfolded position. These male parts constitute far ends of the top part of the frame structure.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Another alternative to that which has been said in the preceding paragraph, is that the transversal support has some male parts that are inserted in some female parts formed in the top part of the frame structure in the unfolded position.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The stable hooking means of the transversal support in the raised position consist of an enveloping portion integral to the support that is coupled by pressure to a cross member of the bottom part of the frame structure encircling said cross member.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">With the described arrangement, we obtain a folding system in a shopping cart structure with four wheels which as we have already seen in other patents or utility models, for example, <patcit id="pcit0017" dnum="ES1044006U"><text>ES-1044006-U</text></patcit>, has important advantages of convenience and use with respect to carts that only have two wheels.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The advantage of this use with respect to other carts with four wheels, such as the above-cited utility model belonging to the applicant hereof, mainly lies on its simplicity, easy usability and size in its folded position.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The fact that the rotating axis of the two accessory front wheels is located under the alignment of the jointing points of the two side bars, facilitates good working in the sense that since the wheels correctly contact the ground keeping good stability of the cart on the whole in the unfolded position, and likewise facilitates folding and unfolding.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The handle or top part of the frame is comprised of a structure independent from the rest of the cart and that is foldable over the bottom part, which constitutes the entire<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> handle structure.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Hence, it is a question of jointing said top handle over the horizontal section of said primary structure, upon which a type of bridge that is provided with anchors for the ends of the top handle, vertically slides.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Therefore, we see that said anchors are comprised of respective recesses where some pivots integral to the top handle are inserted, as well as a small half round platform, to which the horizontal section on which the top handle pivots would be coupled.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In this way, a solid anchoring resistant to the weight that a shopping cart should normally endure during use is obtained.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Hereinafter in order to provide a better understanding of this specification and forming an integral part thereof, some figures wherein the object of the invention has been represented in an illustrative and non-restrictive manner are attached.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></b></heading><p id="p0027" num="0027"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows a perspective view of the shopping cart of the invention in an unfolded position.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2 to 4</figref> show different views of the folding process of the cart.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref> shows the folding process of a top part or handle that forms the frame structure of the whole cart.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b><u>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</u></b></heading><p id="p0028" num="0028">Considering the numbering used in the figures, the shopping cart is defined by a frame structure comprised of a top folding part (1) and a bottom part (2) or primary structure, to whose low area a base or folding seat platform (3) of a bag not represented in the figures, is coupled, as well as a rear support (4), also folding.

The joint of this pair of front wheels (6) is located under the straight line that<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> joins each one of the two end rotating points of the cited side bars (8).</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The top part (1) of the frame structure is jointedly coupled to a top cross member (9) of the bottom part (2) and has locking means to keep this top part stable in the unfolded position as a continuation of the bottom part (2) of the frame structure, whereas in the folded position, the top part folds downward against the bottom part (2).</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">These locking means consist of a transversal support (10) coupled to and guided on the branches of the bottom part (2) of the frame, at the same time that said support (10) in a raised position provides immobilization of the top part (1) of the frame by means of some complementary anchoring parts connected to the transversal support (10) and top part (1) of the frame.
