Background Arts</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Recently, in a field of medical care, a medical diagnosis using ultrasonic images is widely used. In an ultrasonic diagnosis, an ultrasonic is emitted to a required area of a living organism from an ultrasonic probe, and an echo reflected from within the living organism is received and converted into an electronic signal. The echo signal is analyzed and converted into an image. Further, an ultrasonic probe of an electronic scan type is also known, which is provided with plural ultrasonic transducers for transmitting and receiving the ultrasound. The ultrasonic probe of the electronic scan type selectively drives the ultrasonic transducers by using an electronic switch or the like.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As the ultrasonic probe of the electronic scan type, there are a convex scan type and a radial scan type (see <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2134142A"><text>Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2-134142</text></patcit>). The ultrasonic probe of the convex scan type has, plural (for instance, 94 to 128) ultrasonic transducers disposed in a sector shape on a tip of the probe. The ultrasonic probe of the radial scan type has a plurality of (for instance, 360) ultrasonic transducers all around an outer periphery of a tip of the probe.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig.9</figref> shows a conventional ultrasonic diagnosing system 100 of a convex scan type. The ultrasonic diagnosing system 100 is constructed of an ultrasonic probe 101 and an ultrasonic observation apparatus 102 to which the ultrasonic probe 101 is connected. It is possible to design an ultrasonic observation apparatus of a radial scan type by using a structure of the ultrasonic observation apparatus of the convex scan type. However, since the ultrasonic transducers of the radial scan type has more number of ultrasonic transducers, it is necessary to increase the number of input/output lines in each circuit. For instance, terminals of a second connector 105, input lines of a multiplexer (MP) 108, control lines of a scan controller 107 and the like should be increased in number. Likewise, a beamformer (BF) 111 should be modified according to the increase in the number of sound rays forming the ultrasonic image. In the modification, it becomes<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> necessary to newly design the multiplexer 108, the scan controller 107 and the BF 111 in accordance with the number of the ultrasonic transducers, which result in a long-term development and an increasing cost.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Further, an ultrasonic observation apparatus, which is capable of applying both the ultrasonic probes of the convex scan type and the radial scan type, is desired. In particular, it is preferable that the ultrasonic observation apparatus of the convex scan type can be easily modified so as to connect the ultrasonic probe of the radial scan type.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In accordance with the preamble of claim 1, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5924993A"><text>US-A-5 924 993</text></patcit> discloses a system which includes 72 transducers subdivided into four groups, each group including a multiplexer and 18 transducers. Each multiplexer is used for multiplexing the signals to or from four transducers.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">A main object of the present invention is to provide an ultrasonic diagnosing system, which can be easily manufactured at a low cost, by utilizing a structure of the ultrasonic observation apparatus of the convex scan type.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further another object of the present invention is to provide a compatible ultrasonic observation system which is manufactured by modifying the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> ultrasonic observation apparatus of the convex scan type with ease at low cost.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further another object of the present invention is to provide an ultrasonic probe of a radial scan type which is compatible with the ultrasonic probe of the convex scan type.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In order to achieve the above and other objects, the ultrasonic diagnosing system of the radial scan type according to the present invention includes the features of claim 1.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Preferred embodiments are defined by the dependent claims.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Since the ultrasonic probe of the radial scan type uses the same number of output lines as the ultrasonic probe of the convex scan type by the function of the multiplexer, the ultrasonic probe of the radial scan type has become compatible with the ultrasonic probe of the convex scan type. Further, the ultrasonic probe of the radial scan type can be manufactured at the low cost by only incorporating the multiplexer.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Since the ultrasonic observation system of the present invention has a function to switch the multiplexer when the ultrasonic probe of the radial scan type incorporated with the multiplexer is connected,<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> so that both the ultrasonic probes of the radial scan type and the convex scan type can be applied.

The ultrasonic probe 10 is of a radial scan type which is incorporated with a<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> cylindrical substrate 13 with 360 ultrasonic transducers 12 disposed at regular intervals on an outer periphery on a tip of a sheath (not shown) formed of a flexible member. The ultrasonic probe 10 is connected to the ultrasonic observation apparatus 11 by inserting a first connector 14, which is provided at a trailing end of a code (not shown) extended from the sheath, into a second connector 15 provided in the ultrasonic observation apparatus 11.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The 360 ultrasonic transducers 12 are respectively connected to ends of 360 first signal lines 16 which transmit drive signals from a transmitter 23 (which will be described later) of the ultrasonic observation apparatus 11 and echo signals reflected from within a living organism. The other ends of the first signal lines 16 are respectively connected to a multiplexer (MPa) 17.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the 360 ultrasonic transducers 12 are divided into four sensor element groups 40a (a first sensor element group which includes the ultrasonic transducers Nos.1-47 and 314-360), 40b (a second sensor element group which includes the ultrasonic transducers Nos. 44-137), 40c (a third sensor element group which includes the ultrasonic transducers Nos. 134-227) and 40d (a fourth sensor element group which includes the ultrasonic transducers Nos. 224-317). The four sensor element groups 40a-40d<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> divide the outer periphery of the cylindrical substrate 13 into four approximately equal portions.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">There are 94 ultrasonic transducers 12 in each sensor element group. At the boundary of the first sensor element group 40a and the second sensor element group 40b, the ultrasonic transducers 12 Nos. 44-47 are contained in both element groups. At the boundary of the second sensor element group 40b and the third sensor element group 40c, the ultrasonic transducers Nos.134-137 are contained in both sensor element groups. At the boundary of the third sensor element group 40c and the fourth sensor element group 40d, the ultrasonic transducers Nos.224-227 are contained in both element groups. At the boundary of the fourth sensor element group 40d and the first sensor element group 40a, the ultrasonic transducers Nos.314-317 are contained in both element groups. Note that Nos. 1-360 are the numbers assigned to each of the ultrasonic transducers in a clockwise direction for the sake of convenience.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1</figref>, a control line 19 is connected to the MPa 17. The control line 19 receives an element group selection signal from a CPU 20 (which will be described later) of the ultrasonic observation apparatus 11. According to the sensor element group selection signal, the MPa 17 switches the signal of 360 channels, which is transmitted from the first to fourth sensor element groups 40a-40d through the first signal lines 16, to<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> that of 94 channels in the selected sensor element group. One end of each of 94 second signal lines 18 is connected to the MPa 17. The other end of each of the 94 second signal lines 18 is connected to the ultrasonic observation apparatus 11 through the second connector 15.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the MPa 17 is constructed of a decoder 50, and first to fourth switches (SWa-SWd) 51a-51d which are constituted of FET and the like. The decoder 50 receives and decodes the sensor element group selection signal of two-bit sent from the CPU 20 of the ultrasonic observation apparatus 11 through the control line 19.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The signals from the ultrasonic transducers 12 of the first to fourth sensor element groups 40a-40d are respectively input to the corresponding switches (SWa-SWd) 51a-51d through the first signal lines 16.

To be more specific, for instance, when the sensor element group selection signal is "00", the first sensor element group 40a is selected. At that time, the SWa<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> 51a is turned on while the SWb-SWd 51b-51d are turned off. When the sensor element group selection signal is "01", the second sensor element group 40b is selected. At that time, the SWb 51b is turned on while the SWa 51a, SWc 51c and SWd 51d are turned off. Further, when the sensor element group selection signal is "10", the third sensor element group 40c is selected. At that time, the SWc 51c is turned on while the SWa 51a, SWb 51b and SWd 51d are turned off. When the sensor element group selection signal is "11", the fourth sensor element group 40d is selected. At that time, the SWd 51d is turned on while the SWa-SWc 51a-51c are turned off.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the ultrasonic observation apparatus 11 is thoroughly controlled by the CPU 20. A scan controller 21 is connected to the CPU 20. The scan controller 21 is connected to a multiplexer (MPb) 22, the transmitter 23 and a receiver 24, and transmits a reference pulse to each of the above sections to control the operation. An ultrasonic probe of a convex scan type with 94 channels has 94 ultrasonic transducers disposed in a sector shape on its tip (not shown). In a connector section of the ultrasonic probe of the convex scan type, an insertion detector/ probe type identifier, which has the same function as an insertion detector/ probe type identifier 31, is provided, which will be described later.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The MPb 22 selectively switches the signals of five<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> channels out of 94 channels which are input and output through the second connector section 15. The drive signal of five channels is input from the transmitter 23 to the MPb 22, and the MPb 22 outputs the echo signal of five channels to the receiver 24.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The MPb 22 simultaneously drives the five selected ultrasonic transducers 12 as one block, out of one of the sensor element group selected by the MPa 17, under the control of the scan controller 21. Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the MPb 22 selectively switches the ultrasonic transducer 12, which receives and transmits the drive signal and the echo signal, by shifting at least one ultrasonic transducer 12 to be driven in the clockwise direction every time the drive signal and the echo signal are transmitted and received.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Under the control of the scan controller 21, the transmitter 23 transmits the drive signal (a voltage pulse with five channels for driving the ultrasonic transducer 12) to the ultrasonic transducer 12 selected by the MPb 22.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Under the control of the scan controller 21, the receiver 24 receives the echo signal (five channels) reflected from within the living organism, which is obtained by the ultrasonic transducers 12 selected by the MPb 22, and performs Sensitivity Time Control (STC) process to the received echo signal. In the STC, the sensitivity is adjusted according to the time which<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> corresponds to a propagation distance (depth) of the ultrasound. The respective timings of the transmission and the reception of the transmitter 23 and the receiver 24 are switched by the scan controller 21.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The echo signal received by the receiver 24 is input to a beamformer (BF) 25. The echo signal of five channels is delayed by the BF 25 for a predetermined time to be co-phased, and added.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The echo signal, which is added in the BF 25, is digitalized and then stored in a memory 26. A digital scan converter (DSC) 27 reads the digital signal from the memory 26 under the control of the CPU 20, and converts the read digital signal into a television signal of a NTSC format. A D/A converter 28 converts the signal, which has been converted into the NTSC format by the DSC 27, into the analog signal again. A monitor 29 displays the analog signal converted by the D/A converter 28 as an ultrasonic image.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In addition to the above mentioned scan controller 21 and the DSC 27, an operation unit 30 and a serial signal line 32, through which a notification signal from the insertion detector/probe type identifier 31 provided in the first connector 14 of the ultrasonic probe 12 is transmitted, are connected to the CPU 20. The operation unit 30 is constructed of an operation panel in which various operation buttons are disposed, for instance. The CPU 20 controls the operation of each<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> section according to the signals input from the operation unit 30.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">An identification code, which indicates that the ultrasonic probe 12 is of the radial scan type, is stored in the insertion detector/ probe type identifier 31. The insertion detector/ probe type identifier 31 transmits the identification code to the CPU 20 by a serial communication through the serial signal line 32. Further, the CPU 20 detects the insertion of the ultrasonic probe by receiving the identification code.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">When the CPU 20 receives the insertion detection signal and the identification signal from the insertion detector/ probe type identifier 31, and identifies that the ultrasonic probe of the convex scan type with the 94 channels is connected, the CPU 20 controls the operation of the MPb 22 through the scan controller 21 without transmitting the sensor element group selection signal to the MPa 17 (a first mode).
