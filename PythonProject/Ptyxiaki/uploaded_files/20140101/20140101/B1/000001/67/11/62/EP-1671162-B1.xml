The "Fiber Fuse" is characterized by the propagation of a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> bright visible light from the point of initiation toward the laser source. The term "Fiber Fuse" has been adopted for the phenomenon because of the similarity in appearance to a burning fuse. The "Fiber Fuse" has been shown to occur when the end of the fiber is contaminated, and it has also been initiated spontaneously from splices and in-core fiber gratings. Examination of the fiber core after the "Fiber Fuse" passes reveals extensive damage. The silica core is melted and re-fused, and bubbles are formed throughout its length. The damage regions, or bubbles, observed in the core after "Fiber Fuse" propagation, have been the subject of investigations. Atomic force microscope tests show that the bubbles are hollow, indicating vaporization of the silica. The structure of the bubbles is in many cases a periodic structure. The "Fiber Fuse" phenomenon is used here to create scattering, or change of direction of the impinging light by the bubbles, in terminators, thus creating an angularly spread light source at the terminator, that does not reflect the light back into the input fiber but into the cladding and the absorbers surrounding the cladding.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The "Fiber Fuse" is readily initiated in most fibers. It appears as a brilliant white visible spot that propagates from the point of initiation at the fiber end toward the laser source. The spectrum of the light emitted from the fuse corresponds approximately to a temperature of 5400 °K, indicating that the "Fiber Fuse" may consist of plasma. The speed of the "Fiber Fuse" propagation is about 1 meter per second in most fibers. The "Fiber Fuse" can travel through many meters of fiber. The fiber gets non-transparent and scattering, thus serving as a good scatterer for high-power terminators.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The high-energy laser light (e.g., providing 30-35 dBm CW power at 1550 nm wavelength) is fed into large-core fiber/waveguide, where its power per unit area is lower than the "Fiber Fuse" threshold. The laser power flows through the fiber toward a narrowing funnel where its size is tapered to a smaller core size of fiber/waveguide. A contaminating deposition at the end of this fiber creates a "Fiber Fuse" backward (toward the laser), damaging the fiber/waveguide on its way. The resulting damaged fiber, the "Fiber Fuse" processed scatterer, has bubbles along its core.</p><heading id="h0005">The "Laser Plasma" method for scattering inner core manufacturing (Method B)</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><p id="p0020" num="0020">High-energy laser light (e.g., providing 30-35 dBm CW power at 1550 nm wavelength) is fed into the core of the fiber/waveguide, impinging on a partially transparent conductive layer.

The generated plasma greatly increases the absorption of the propagating light, and the energetic discharge creates catastrophic damage at or near the metal surfaces.

The absorber 12 has a surface area that is about 100 times that of the surface area of the scattering core 8. The larger area of the absorber 12 allows better heat conduction outwardly. The absorber 12 should be a relatively short distance from the fiber in order to more easily conduct or convect the heat. Preferably, the absorber 12 should, at a maximum, be 100 microns away from the scattering core 8. Preferably, the absorber should be between about 50 microns and 70 microns away from the scattering core 8.

After this process is finished, the light impinging from core 4 into the absorbing volume 21 is scattered in directions 22 and is absorbed by the conductive and absorbing particles, thus heating the volume 21 to elevated temperatures over 1000 °C. The hottest spot is in the symmetry point 20.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> illustrates the result of the process and method of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig 4</figref>, showing a highly scattering and absorbing volume 24 (that includes the conductors 16 and the dielectric layer 18) having dimensions of about 1-2 micrometers in length and a diameter of, e.g., 125 micrometers.

The matter 26 can be, e.g., an air and fuel mixture, as in an internal combustion engine, where the hot tip 24 serves as an ignition device, optically energized and operated. The matter 26 can be, e.g., an explosive or pyrotechnic material, as in a rocket engine or an exploding device, where the hot tip 24 serves as an ignition fuse, optically energized and operated. The matter 26 can be, e.g., a living tissue to be cut in an operation, where the hot tip 24 serves as a cutting knife, optically energized and operated.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> illustrates another way to create the hot tip of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, with a controllable area of the impinging light. Here a fiber having a constant index of refraction across 28 is coupled (e.g., by fusion splicing) to the light-conducting fiber 6. The light output, not being confined by an index step, diverges in a cone 30, reaching its maximum diameter at spot 32. In this way the light impingement diameter is controlled by the index and length of the core-less fiber 28, enabling the selection of any diameter from the core diameter (e.g., 10 micrometers) to the clad diameter (e.g., 125 micrometers or more).</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">It will be evident to those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the details of the foregoing embodiments.
