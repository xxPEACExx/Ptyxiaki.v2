load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a flow control system for controlling the batchwise delivery of process gas to a semiconductor manufacturing tool. Functional components of the system are assembled on a gas manifold in the form of a narrow delivery "stick".</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">The semiconductor manufacturing process includes a phase in which the process gas is delivered to the tool according to a program that specifies a flow for a period of time. The flow rate is established by a mass flow controller, which is supplied with process gas at a regulated pressure. The output of the mass flow controller is delivered to the manufacturing tool through a pneumatically operated on/off shut-off valve. The delivery is started by actuating the shut-off valve to open and energizing the mass flow controller to deliver a flow at a preset value. The delivery is stopped by actuating the shut-off valve to close and deenergizing the set point of the mass flow controller.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">An important consideration is the accuracy with which the flow is delivered during the process phase. To that effect, it is recommended to set the mass flow controller at a value between 40 and 100% of its full scale. In other words, a given mass flow controller has a rangeability of 2.5 to 1. Also, the mass flow controller must be calibrated for the specific gas to which it is applied. This means that in order to cover a range of flows from 5 to 1000<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm), as many as six mass flow controllers for any given gas may be required. The accuracy consideration also requires that the mass flow controller retain its calibration for some period of time, preferably as long as possible.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A dynamic gas flow controller is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5865205A"><text>U. S. Patent No. 5,865,205 to Wilmer</text></patcit>, for controlling the delivery of a gas from a reservoir to a semiconductor process chamber. The method and apparatus disclosed therein involve determining an initial mass of the gas residing within the reservoir prior to a delivery operation and the final mass of gas residing in the reservoir when the flow of gas to the process chamber is terminated. The initial mass and final mass of gas values are compared to determine the actual mass of gas released from the reservoir during the recipe step. This value serves as an input to a calibration servo loop to update the system calibration constant for a subsequent gas delivery recipe step. The execution of the calibration servo loop serves as a continuous self calibration of a dynamic servo loop, wherein the flow of gas to the process chamber is metered by a variable flow valve upstream of an orifice. The gas pressure created ahead of the orifice during delivery is sensed to measure the gas flow rate.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the patent to Wilmer, the concept of flow control applies to a gas flowing out of a reservoir instead of a gas flowing in a line. The control signal which operates the variable flow valve is determined by a circuit in which an input signal (representing the desired flow) is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> integrated over the duration of the delivery step to define the desired volume/mass. The desired volume is compared to the actual volume taken out of the reservoir. A control signal is generated as a function of that comparison and applied as a set point to the control circuit. In the dynamic control circuit, the set point is compared to the pressure signal sensing the flow and a control signal is applied to the variable flow valve to create the desired pressure/flow. That is, in Wilmer, the flow signal is integrated over time and compared to the actual volume. The control signal is applied to the flow control, which consists of the variable flow valve creating a pressure ahead of the orifice.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The patent to <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US4285245A"><text>Kennedy, U. S. Patent No. 4,285,245</text></patcit>, discloses a method and apparatus for measuring and controlling volumetric flow rate of gases in a line. The patent is of interest for its disclosure of a method of determining the flow rate of gas flowing in a line by imposing a uniform flow rate at a point downstream of a flow measurement chamber in the line, restricting temporarily the flow at a point upstream of the chamber and measuring the pressure decrease in the chamber between the upstream and the downstream points during part of the duration of the restricted flow, the rate of the pressure decrease being substantially proportional to the volumetric flow rate. The patent to Kennedy does not relate to the batchwise delivery of process gas for semiconductor manufacturing or a flow control system therefor operable in a flow mode for the accurate delivery of a batch of process gas and, alternately, in a no-flow mode.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO9734208A"><text>WO 97/34208</text></patcit>, a further gas flow control method is shown, especially related for controlling the delivery of gas to a process chamber, that does not relate to the batchwise delivery of process gas.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The objectife of the present invention was to provide an improved flow control system for controlling the batchwise delivery of process gas for semiconductor manufacturing, which can complement a conventional delivery stick by the addition of only a few components, and which will allow verification of the accuracy of the flow delivered in an active phase. A forther objective was to provide an improved flow control system for controlling the batchwise delivery of process gas for semiconductor manufacturing which increase the effective range of the mass flow controller, ensure long-tent stability of the calibration and eliminate the need to precalibrate for specific gases.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The objectives will be inventively achieved by a flow control system according the characteristics of claim 1. Further preferred embodiments result from the characteristics of the claims 2 to 9.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The flow control system according to the invention is controlling the batchwise delivery of gas within a fluid circuit having a source of pressurized gas to be delivered batchwise at a controlled flow rate to a destination by the flow control system. The flow control system is operable in a flow mode for delivering a batch of gas and, alternately, in a no-flow mode. The flow control system inventively comprises a flow line through which gas from the source of pressurized gas can be delivered, a pressure regulator in the flow line to establish a regulated gas pressure in the line, an on/off valve in the line downstream of the pressure regulator to start and stop the flow mode during which the gas is delivered for a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> delivery period of time, means in said flow line downstream of said pressure regulator for adjusting said controlled flow rate, said means including a mass flow control valve and/or a fixed orifice incorporated in the seat of the on/off valve, a reference capacity in the flow line upstream of the pressure regulator for use in measuring the actual flow rate of gas being delivered by the flow control system, a pressure sensor to measure a pressure drop of the gas in the reference capacity during a measurement period of time commencing after the Start of a delivery period of time, means in the line upstream of the reference capacity for interrupting the flow of the gas from the source of pressurized gas to the reference capacity during delivery of the gas by the flow control system, and a controller for determining from the measured pressure drop the rate of pressure drop in the reference capacity during the measurement period the actual flow rate of a batch of process gas being delivered and, in case the actual flow rate does not agree with a specified flow rate for the delivering, utilizing said means for adjusting the controlled flow rate in the direction of the specified flow rate from the actual flow rate for a subsequent delivery period of time in which another batch of process gas is delivered.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the controller of the system adjusts a set point value of the mass flow control valve for adjusting the controlled flow rate. Advantageously, the mass flow control valve has a range of possible controlled flow rate settings which extends to 100% of its full scale with an effective rangeability of 10:1.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to another preferred form of the invention, the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the pressure regulator has an adjustable pressure setting for adjusting the controlled flow rate.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The flow control system of the invention uses functional components compatible with a 1 1/8 inch width manifold. The assembly features surface mounting on a modular base. A significant benefit is to reduce the length of the delivery stick and to make it possible to place the parallel manifolds side-by-side at a distance of 1.2 inches between center lines instead of the current 1.6 inches. In the flow control system employing a mass flow control valve, increasing the effective rangeability of the controller from 2.5 to 1 up to 10 to 1, makes it possible to cover flows from 5 to 1000 sccm with only three ranges : 1000, 200 and 50 sccm. The long term stability of calibration is also ensured through automatic calibration during each active phase and the need to calibrate for each specific gas is eliminated.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The objectives will further be inventively achieved by an apparatus according the characteristics of claim 10.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of several embodiments of the present invention taken with the accompanying drawings.

The pneumatically operated valve 8 can be selectively opened to allow a purge gas to be passed through the flow line 1 of the flow control system.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The flow control system 10 to be used in conjunction with a conventional mass flow control valve 22, offers a significant improvement by increasing the effective rangeability of the mass flow control valve from 2.5 to 1 up to 10 to 1, making it possible to cover flows from 5 to 1000 sccm with only three ranges: 1000, 200 and 50 sccm. The flow control system also eliminates the need to calibrate the system for each specific gas and ensures the long term stability of the calibration through automatic recalibration during each delivery phase for the next phase.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The method of controlling the batchwise delivery of process gas for semiconductor manufacturing using the flow control system involves setting the desired flow value as a percent<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> of full scale by setting the desired flow setting of the flow controller 3 for making delivery of process gas. The actual flow during the delivery phase is measured and the command to the mass flow control valve is adjusted so that the actual flow is kept equal to the set point value in the following delivery phase(s). This operation may be repeated at each delivery phase or after a desired number of delivery phases. The actual flow rate determined by measuring the pressure change in the reference capacity 5 is expressed in standard units and applies essentially to any gas. The actual value is compared to the desired set point value. If there is any difference between the two values, the flow control system modifies the command signal sent to the mass flow control valve 22 so that the difference (error signal) is reduced to zero.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A digital display 40 in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figs. 7A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">8</figref>, on the controller 3 allows the operator to read, alternately, by switching switch 41, the set point flow value and the actual flow value. The set point value may be adjusted by actuating up and down pushbuttons 42 and 43. A second switch 44 allows to start and stop delivery of the process gas. Typically, the pressure regulator 16 is set to supply the mass flow control valve 22 at a regulated pressure of 10-15 psi. The small reference capacity 5 used to measure the actual flow is mounted directly upstream of the pressure regulator. The pressure transducer 6 measures the pressure in the capacity. The pneumatically operated on/off valve 14 is mounted upstream of the capacity. When the valve 14 is open, it supplies the capacity with process gas from the supply line 12 at a typical pressure of 40-50 psi. It is<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> not required to regulate precisely the supply pressure to the system 10. It can be anywhere between 45 and 60 psi, for example.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Prior to the start of a delivery phase, the supply on/off valve 14 is opened and the reference capacity 5 is filled at the supply pressure. The pressure regulator 16 maintains a constant pressure at the inlet of the mass flow control valve 22. At the start of a given delivery operation, which lasts typically from 20-40 seconds, the on/off valve 24 downstream of the mass flow control valve 22 is actuated to open and the mass flow control valve is energized to deliver flow at the set point value. The measurement period begins after the start of the delivery, e. g., 1 second after the start of the delivery. With continued delivery of the process gas, the pressure in the reference capacity 5 decreases progressively. The measurement period continues for a maximum duration of 20 seconds or is terminated when the pressure in the measurement capacity reaches a predetermined value such as 20 psi. At the end of the measurement period, the flow indication displayed at display 40 on the controller 3 is updated to agree with the measured exact value and, if necessary, any correction factor is determined to be applied to the next delivery phase. The change in pressure at the inlet of the pressure regulator, which occurs at the end of the measurement period, does not affect the regulated outlet pressure, which is typically set at 10-15 psi as noted above. Thus, the pressure in the reference capacity 5 is allowed to go from a nominal value of 50 psi down to a limited value of 20 psi. The measurement period will be limited to the<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> maximum of 20 seconds at lower flow values. At higher flow values, the 20 psi limit may occur before the 20 second limit.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">At the beginning of the delivery phase, the flow indicator 40 on the controller will display the flow value of the previous delivery. Then it will change to an indication of the current flow when the measurement period is completed. As the measurement period is terminated, the on/off valve 14 at the supply side is actuated to open and the pressure in the reference capacity 5 returns to the supply level. This does not affect the regulated pressure applied to the inlet of the mass flow control valve.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The flow control system 10' in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 2A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">2B</figref> eliminates the need of the mass flow control valve 22 and its attendant shut-off valve. The flow control is provided by a pressure regulator 16' and an orifice 36 incorporated in the seat of on/off valve 20. For a given orifice, the flow is proportional to the absolute pressure applied to it by the pressure regulator 16'. In this application, the set point of the pressure regulator is established by a pressure signal applied to the dome of the pressure regulator. The pressure signal is created by an electric/pneumatic convertor 38, see <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 2A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0010">9</figref>, which generates a pressure proportional to the input voltage from the controller 3 (analogous to the signal applied to the mass flow control valve). Any difference (error signal) between the set point and the measured flow is used to correct the pressure signal applied to the dome of the pressure regulator as in the operation of the flow control<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> system of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1A</figref> and IB. At the end of the delivery phase, the on/off valve 20 downstream of the orifice 36 is actuated to close and the pressure signal is removed from the dome of the pressure regulator 16'. This keeps the pressure upstream of the orifice 36 at the set point value and prevents the creep that would normally occur at the outlet of the pressure regulator in a no-flow condition. The given orifice may be used to deliver flow with a rangeability of 10 : 1, making it possible to cover flows from 5-1000 sccm with only three orifice sizes corresponding to 1000, 200 and 50 sccm.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The operating sequence of a program for the flow control system 10 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">1B</figref> is shown in the flow chart of <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 3</figref>. With reference to a functional demonstration of the control system, it is noted that the mass flow control valve 22 of the system in the disclosed embodiment has a range of 200 sccm. The pressure regulator is set at a nominal 10 psi (25 psia). The nominal volume of the reference capacity is 20 cc. The pressure transducer 6 has a range of 0-100 psia. The supply 12 to the reference capacity 5 is at a nominal value of 50 psi (65 psia). It does not have to be very precise (±2 psi) as indicated above.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">A first operation as referred to in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 3</figref> is to establish the calibration factor for the flow control system at mass flow control valve setting of 100%. To accomplish this, the flow check switch 45 on the controller is set to "yes" and a delivery run of process gas is made with the setting of the controller 3 at 100% and the actual<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> flow being delivered is read with a calibrated flow meter. This establishes the relationship between the flow indicated by the digital display 40 (in %) on the controller 3 and the actual flow. The calibration factor is then created in the controller which makes 100% indication correspond to the desired full scale of 200 sccm. Example: the calibration run delivers 220 sccm and the flow indication is 120%. The calibration factor to obtain 100% and 200 sccm will be 100/120 x 200/220 = 0.75. With the controller switch 44 at "stop" and the display switch 41 at "setting" so as to display the calibration factor on digital display 40, the new factor is set by using the up and down buttons 42 and 43 on the controller 3. Another delivery run is then made to verify that the flow is 200 sccm and the indication is 100%. The procedure can be repeated if necessary.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The next step in the process is to establish a mathematical relationship between the actual flow and flow setting over the range of the mass flow control valve flow settings. This is obtained by making a delivery run at 10% setting, followed by a delivery run at 10% setting and determining the actual flow (measured by the controller) in each run. That transfer function is established within the controller where it is used to calculate the control signal to be sent to mass flow control valve so that the flow remains equal to the setting. The following sequence creates the calibration runs: set the display switch 41 to "setting" and the flow operation switch 44 to "stop"; push the two buttons 42 and 43 and hold until the calibration factor is displayed ; and then set display switch 41 to "flow". This<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> initiates the two successive delivery runs.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The next step is to set a desired flow setting of the flow controller 22 for making a delivery of process gas, for example, 80%. This is done by adjusting with the up and down push buttons 42 and 43 on the controller 3 while the display switch 41 is set to "setting". The flow check switch 45 on the controller is set to "yes". Delivery is started by switching flow switch 44 to "start". The display switch 41 is set to "flow" and the indication of flow is watched on digital display 40 during the delivery. At the end of the measurement period, the flow indication on the display will be updated. The start of the updated value will be flashed briefly (1-2 seconds). The delivery is stopped by switching flow switch 44 to "stop". In the case the flow check switch 45 on the controller 3 were set to "no", the flow indication on the display 40 would remain unchanged for the length of the delivery. This mode of operation may be selected if it is felt that the flow controller 3 needs calibration verification only periodically.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The setting is then changed to 50%, the flow check is set to "yes" and another delivery is started and the flow indication on the display is watched. Initially, the flow indication will be close to 50%. At the end of the measurement period, the actual flow value will be shown. If it is not 50%, a correction will be calculated, to be applied to the next delivery. It may take two or three runs to establish the flow value at 50± 0.1%. The setting can then be changed to 20% and the procedure repeated.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Likewise, the setting is changed to 10% and the procedure repeated.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">A functional demonstration of the flow control 10' of the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 2A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">2B</figref> involved the use of an on/off valve 20 which incorporated an orifice 36 having a diameter of 0.004 inch in its seat. This provides a flow of 10 to 150 sccm as the regulated pressure is controlled from 2.5 to 25 psia. To establish a calibration factor, the aforementioned procedure is used to obtain an operating condition of 150 seem at 100% indication. Next a calibration run is made to establish the transfer function or mathematical relationship.

For a given inlet fluid pressure, which may be between about 50-60 psi, and a specified outlet pressure set point of about 15 psi, the system is operated prior to time to in a flow mode, In such mode, gas is delivered through regulator 50 at a steady-state flow rate of, for example, 200 sccm and a regulated outlet pressure of about 14.8 psi. Such pressure is affected under the control of the main pressure setting of the regulator 50 which is adjusted to a nominal pressure of 12 psi, and with signal pressure being supplied to the regulator to apply a differential pressure which is normally 3 psi. Both the main and the differential pressure settings may be set at a lower flow rate of, for example, 50 sccm. In this regard, it may be noted that the actual regulator outlet pressure at steady flow is about 0.2 psi less than the set point due to the affect of "droop" as the flow rate is increased from low flow to its steady-state value.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">At about time to, corresponding to the termination of the flow mode, the mass flow control valve 22 (<figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">Fig. 1</figref>) is commanded "off". Shortly thereafter, i.e., 0.5 sec or less, pneumatic on/off valve 24 is actuated to close such that fluid flow decreases from the steady-state rate to zero. Generally simultaneously with the actuation of valve 24, signal pressure is discontinued to regulator 50 to remove the differential pressure setting. In this regard, the operation of valve 24 and regulator 50 advantageously may be synchronized under the control of a common signal pressure.<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --></p><p id="p0060" num="0060">With the differential pressure setting being removed, the setting of regulator 50 effective is reduced to 12 psi. Inasmuch as the outlet pressure remains at the operating pressure of 14.8 psi, the regulator closes such that the outlet pressure is maintained substantially at 14.8 psi. Depending upon the length of the no-flow period and/or on the interval, typically about 0.5 sec, between when the no-flow mode is initiated and when the control pressure signal is removed to affect the closing of the regulator, the outlet pressure may increase slightly, to perhaps 15 psi over the period Δt<sub>o</sub>. It will be appreciated, however, that by virtue of the controlled differential pressure setting, no appreciable creep effect is evident even when the system is operated with very long intervals. i. e., 1 hour or more, between the flow modes.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Continuing then along trace 250, at time t<sub>1</sub>, corresponding to the initiation of the next flow mode, the pressure signal is resumed to open valve 24 and to re-apply the differential force on the regulator. Shortly thereafter, the mass flow control valve 22 is commanded to again control flow. In such operation, flow may be increased from zero to a steady-state value before any appreciable increase in the outlet pressure as a result of creep induced from the effective change in the regulator setting from 12 psi to 15 psi. Thus, as the flow rate increases, the outlet pressure decreases only about 0.2 psi to settle quickly at the operating pressure within a very short period Δt<sub>1</sub> of about 0.5 sec or less. Importantly, as no overshoot or other oscillatory effects are observed, the<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> transition from zero to steady-state flow is able to be established within 1 sec or less.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">For purposes of comparison, the pressure trace of a regulator conventionally operated at a constant pressure setting of 15 psi is shown at 250'. At time t<sub>o</sub> and continuing over the period Δt<sub>o</sub>' which may be 100 sec or more, the outlet pressure of trace 250' may be noticed to increase by about 2 psi from the operating pressure. As compared to the 0.2 psi increase for valve 50 of the invention, such increase is significant, as is the period Δ t<sub>1</sub>' which may be 1.5 sec or more with some overshoot or other oscillatory effects being evident.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Thus, in the disclosed flow control system, this unique and efficient fluid pressure regulator construction mitigates the effect of pressure creep and, when the flow control systems are operated in alternate flow and no-flow modes, allow faster pressure response and steady-state operation for improved process gas utilization or other system economy.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Unless otherwise specified, materials of construction are to be considered conventional for the uses involved. Such materials generally will be corrosion resistant and otherwise selected for compatibility with the fluid being transferred or for desired mechanical properties.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">As it
