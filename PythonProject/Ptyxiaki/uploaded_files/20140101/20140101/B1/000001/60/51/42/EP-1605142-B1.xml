load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine with a variable valve train mechanism capable of changing a lift and the like of an intake valve or an exhaust valve of the internal combustion engine.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Prior art document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="GB2322412A"><text>GB 2 322 412 A</text></patcit> discloses an operating mechanism for a valve which comprises a cam mounted for rotation about an axis thereof, a rocker having an abutment surface which is movable to operate said valve, and a follower mounted for pivoting motion. The follower has a point of contact with the outer surface of the cam so that, as the cam rotates, the follower is caused to pivot. The follower also has roller to provide a point of contact with the rocker so that, as the follower pivots, the rocker is caused to pivot to thereby operate the valve. The mechanism also comprises adjustment means operable to move the axis of the follower relative to the axis of the cam and the axis of the rocker to thereby shift the point of contact between the cam and the follower to thereby alter the timing of the operation of the valve relative to the rotation of the cam.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A further prior art document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2002371816A"><text>JP 2002371816 A</text></patcit> teaches a variable valve mechanism that is provided with a lift control device for changing an oscillation starting angle of a valve having a camshaft with a rotating cam. Said device comprises a first interposing arm that operates as a swing cam. A rocker arm, having a roller, is in contact with a cam face of said first interposing arm. Said rocker arm swings in connection with the swing cam to open and close the valve. A relative distance between a rotational cam abutment portion, being in contact with the rotational cam of the cam shaft and a center axis of a swing shaft of the first interposing arm, is variable to control lift characteristic of the valve. Said swing shaft functions as a control shaft provided with a protecting part, wherein a second interposing arm is connected to said projecting part by means of a rotational joint.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> The rotational cam abutment portion is supported at the second interposing arm and said arm comprises a sliding surface being in sliding contact with a sliding surface of the first interposing arm.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">There is conventionally known a variable valve train mechanism capable of controlling to change a lift and the like of an intake valve or an exhaust valve of an internal combustion engine according to operating conditions of the internal combustion engine. Such variable valve train mechanism improves fuel economy and provides steady operating performance under low-load conditions, and increases intake air charging efficiency to ensure sufficient engine output under high-load conditions.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The variable valve train mechanism of this type includes the one having an intermediate driving mechanism and intermediate phase angle changing means. The intermediate driving mechanism is driven in connection with a rotational cam on a camshaft rotationally driven by a crankshaft of the internal combustion engine, and causes an output portion to drive a valve as an input portion is driven by the rotation cam. The intermediate phase angle changing means changes a relative phase angle between the input portion and the output portion of the intermediate driving mechanism.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The intermediate phase angle changing means is a helical spline mechanism having: a sliding gear having two types of helical splines of different angles and being displaceable in the axial direction of the intermediate driving mechanism, and<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> displacement controlling means for controlling axial displacement of the sliding gear. The input portion is engaged with one of the two types of helical splines of the sliding gear, and the output portion is engaged with the other.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As the input portion and the output portion are swung relative to the sliding gear according to an axial displacement of the sliding gear through the displacement controlling means, the input portion and the output portion in engagement with the respective helical splines of different angles of the sliding gear are also swung relative to each other. A relative angle between the input portion and the output portion is thereby changed.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The variable valve train mechanism having the intermediate driving mechanism and the intermediate phase angle changing means thus allows driving the valve without a long and complex link mechanism between the rotational cam and the intermediate driving mechanism. Further, changing the relative phase angle between the input portion and the output portion can advance and retard the timing of starting a lift according to the driving state of the rotational cam. Thus, it is possible to control a lift and the like associated with the drive of the rotational cam (see <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2001263015A"><text>JP-A-2001-263015</text></patcit> (Figs. 21 and 24) for example).</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further, there is disclosed such a mechanism that a rocker arm which abuts and is depressed by a camshaft which rotates in one direction, and an output cam which depresses a solid lifter are connected through a control cam and a control shaft, in "<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>A Study of a Mechanical Continuous Variable Rocker Arm (VRA)," by Thitiphol Anontaphan, SAE TECHNICAL PAPER SERIES No. 2003-01-0022; SAE International, USA; March 3, 2003</text></nplcit>.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A roller is provided at one end of the rocker arm. The roller receives a load from the camshaft, which is then exerted on an arm of the rocker arm, transmitted to a nose on the opposite side with respect to the control cam, and then transmitted from the nose to the solid lifter via the output cam, so that the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> lifter is moved upward and downward.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As the control cam is rotated through the control shaft, a relative angle between the rocker arm and the output cam is changed.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Changing the relative angle in such manner allows controlling a lift of the solid lifter.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">However, in the former variable valve train mechanism, in which a relative phase angle between the input portion and the output portion of the intermediate driving mechanism is changed by means of the helical spline mechanism as intermediate phase angle changing means so that a lift and the like of the valve is controlled, the helical spline mechanism can swing the input portion and the output portion relative to each other, but has difficulty in controlling a relative phase angle between the input portion and the output portion to a specified angle. Therefore, in some cases, precise control of a valve lift and the opening and closing timing of the valve is hard, which results in a problem of difficulty in increasing reliability of operation of the variable valve train mechanism. Further, manufacturing the helical spline mechanism is hard, resulting in a problem of an increase in manufacturing time and cost.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Further, since changing a lift is accomplished by controlling a relative phase angle between the input portion and the output portion, the timing of a maximum lift cannot be changed in some cases.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Further, in the latter, a load is inputted to one end of the rocker arm (roller) from the camshaft, and then transmitted to the solid lifter via the output cam from the other end of the rocker arm. Since large bending moment acts on the overall rocker arm, the rocker arm needs to have higher strength.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">It is the object of the present invention to provide an internal combustion engine capable of reducing manufacturing cost with a simplified<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> structure, changing a lift and the timing of a maximum lift of a valve through reliable operation, and securing reliability.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to the present invention said object is solved by an internal combustion engine having the features of independent claim 1. Preferred embodiments are laid down in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Accordingly, it is provided a variable valve train mechanism of an internal combustion engine, for changing a lift of an intake valve or an exhaust valve of the internal combustion engine, having: a camshaft rotationally driven by a crankshaft of the internal combustion engine; a rotational cam disposed on the camshaft; a swing shaft disposed parallel to the camshaft; and a swing cam supported with the swing shaft and being swingable through the rotational cam, in which the swing cam has a movable rotational cam abutment portion which contacts the rotational cam and transmits driving force from the rotational cam to the swing cam, and a guide portion for guiding the rotational cam abutment portion in a certain direction, and the driving force from the rotational cam is inputted to the guide portion via the rotational cam abutment portion so that the swing cam is swung, in which an abutment portion displacing mechanism is provided for displacing the rotational cam abutment portion along the guide portion to change a relative distance between the rotational cam abutment portion and a center axis of the swing shaft, and in which the abutment portion displacing mechanism has: a drive shaft formed continuously from the swing shaft along its axial direction and having a center axis parallel to and eccentric from the center axis of the swing shaft; and an arm with one end connected to the rotational cam abutment portion and the other end connected to the drive shaft, and as the swing shaft is rotated to displace the drive shaft around the center axis of the swing shaft, the rotational cam abutment portion is displaced through the arm, so that the relative distance between the rotational cam<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> abutment portion and the center axis of the swing shaft is changed, whereby a lift and the like of the valve is changed.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The present teaching is further characterized in that the drive shaft is formed in a manner such that its peripheral edge is within the peripheral edge of the swing shaft, as seen in the axial direction.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The present teaching is further characterized in that the other end of the arm is formed with a fitting recess in which the drive shaft is rotatably fitted, and a coming-off prevention member is provided, on the side of an open end of the fitting recess, for preventing the drive shaft from coming off toward the open end.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The present teaching is further characterized in that the guiding direction of the guide portion is inclined relative to the radial direction of the camshaft.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The present teaching is further characterized in that the guide portion is a slot.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The present teaching is further characterized in that the guide portion is an inclined surface formed on a side of the swing cam on the rotational cam side.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The present teaching is further characterized in that the rotational cam abutment portion is a roller supported with a roller shaft having a center axis parallel to the center axis of the swing shaft, and the rotational cam abutment portion is supported at one end of the arm through the roller shaft.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The present teaching is further characterized in that the roller shaft is in sliding contact with the guide portion.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The present invention is further characterized in that one end of the arm closer to the roller shaft is in sliding contact with the guide portion.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The present teaching is further characterized in that the rotational cam abutment portion is a slipper portion which slides on the rotational cam.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The present invention is further characterized in that the swing shaft is urged toward the rotational cam by a spring.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The present teaching is further characterized in that a rocker<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> arm swung by the swing cam is urged toward the swing cam by a spring.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The present teaching is further characterized in that one end of the swing cam is provided with an actuator for rotationally driving the swing shaft within the range of a specified angle.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The present teaching is further characterized in that a cam face of the swing cam is formed with a concentric arcuate idle running zone centered on the center axis of the swing shaft.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The present invention is further characterized in that in the abutment portion displacing mechanism, the swing shaft is rotated about 180 degrees between a small lift setting state and a large lift setting state, and in each setting state, a straight line which connects the center axis of the swing shaft and the center axis of the drive shaft extends generally along the direction of extension of the arm.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">According to the present teaching, the variable valve train mechanism of an internal combustion engine is capable of changing a lift of an intake valve or an exhaust valve of the internal combustion engine and has: a camshaft rotationally driven by a crankshaft of the internal combustion engine; a rotational cam disposed on the camshaft; a swing shaft disposed parallel to the camshaft; and a swing cam supported with the swing shaft and being swingable through the rotational cam. The swing cam has a movable rotational cam abutment portion which contacts the rotational cam and transmits driving force from the rotational cam to the swing cam, and a guide portion for guiding the rotational cam abutment portion in a certain direction. The driving force from the rotational cam is inputted to the guide portion via the rotational cam abutment portion so that the swing cam is swung. An abutment portion displacing mechanism is provided for displacing the rotational cam abutment portion along the guide portion to change a relative distance between the rotational cam abutment portion and a<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> center axis of the swing shaft. Changing the relative distance allows changing a lift of the valve. The structure is thus simplified, thereby reducing manufacturing cost. Further, unlike the conventional art, controlling a valve lift and the timing of a maximum valve lift is not achieved by means of a spline mechanism. The valve lift and the timing of the maximum valve lift are, therefore, changed through reliable operation, and reliability is secured. Further, since a load from the rotational cam is transmitted to the swing cam via the rotational cam abutment portion and the guide portion of the swing cam, no large bending moment acts on the abutment portion displacing mechanism for displacing the rotational cam abutment portion. Thus, there is no need to obtain strength of the abutment portion displacing mechanism, thereby preventing an increase in weight and size of the abutment portion displacing mechanism.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Further, the abutment portion displacing mechanism has: a drive shaft formed continuously from the swing shaft along its axial direction and having a center axis parallel to and eccentric from the center axis of the swing shaft; and an arm with one end connected to the rotational cam abutment portion and the other end connected to the drive shaft. As the swing shaft is rotated to displace the drive shaft around the center axis of the swing shaft, the rotational cam abutment portion is displaced through the arm, so that the relative distance between the rotational cam abutment portion and the center axis of the swing shaft is changed. A lift and the like of the valve are thereby changed. Even when a rotational angle of the swing shaft is increased, the arm is prevented from interfering with the swing shaft, which allows the amount of change in the relative distance to be larger. Further, even when the distance between the center axis of the swing shaft and the center axis of the drive shaft is shortened, such amount of change in the relative distance is provided. Thus, twisting moment transmitted from the arm through the drive shaft and exerted<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> on the swing shaft can be reduced.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Further, since the rotational angle of the swing shaft can be increased for the amount of change in the relative distance, fine adjustments to the relative distance are easily made, and good controllability of the swing shaft for rotation is provided.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">According to a further configuration, the drive shaft is formed in a manner such that its peripheral edge is within the peripheral edge of the swing shaft, as seen in the axial direction. Thus, the drive shaft can be easily formed, and the twisting moment exerted on the swing shaft can be reduced.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">According to a further configuration, the other end of the arm is formed with a fitting recess in which the swing shaft is rotatably fitted, and a coming-off prevention member is provided, on the side of an open end of the fitting recess, for preventing the swing shaft from coming off toward the open end. Thus, the arm can be easily disposed.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">According to a further configuration, the guiding direction of the guide portion is inclined relative to the radial direction of the camshaft. The relative distance between the rotational cam abutment portion and the center axis of the swing shaft is thus changed, which allows flexibly changing a combination of a valve lift and the timing of a maximum valve lift.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">According to a further configuration, the guide portion is a slot. This facilitates assembly work of the variable valve train mechanism.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">According to a further configuration, the guide portion is an inclined surface formed on a side of the swing cam on the rotational cam side. Thus, the guide portion can be easily formed.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">According to a further configuration, the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> rotational cam abutment portion is a roller supported with a roller shaft having a center axis parallel to the center axis of the swing shaft, and is supported at one end of the arm through the roller shaft. Since the rotational cam abutment portion can rotate on the rotational cam face, it is possible to reduce loss of the driving force transmitted from the rotational cam to the rotational cam abutment portion.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">According to a further configuration, since one end of the arm is in sliding contact with the guide portion, the structure can be simplified. According to the present invention of the further configuration, since the rotational cam abutment portion is a slipper portion which slides on the rotational cam, the structure can be notably simplified.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">According to a further configuration, since the swing cam is urged toward the rotational cam by a spring, normally no gap is created between the rotational cam and the swing cam independently of a valve clearance. The swing cam moves smoothly along the rotational cam face and is prevented from being hit with the rotational cam. Specifically, although a cam face of the swing cam includes an idle running zone as described later, since the swing cam normally moves along the rotational cam face, the swing cam is prevented from being hit with the rotational cam.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">According to a further configuration, a rocker arm which is swung by the swing cam is urged toward the swing cam by a spring. Thus, looseness between the rocker arm and the swing cam can be prevented independently of a valve clearance. Further, since a roller does not rotate by itself, wear is restricted in a sliding contact portion between the roller and the swing cam.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">According to a further configuration, one end of the swing shaft is provided with an actuator for rotationally driving the swing shaft within the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> range of a specified angle. Thus, driving the actuator causes the plural drive shafts for the respective cylinders to be displaced.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">According to a further configuration, a cam face of the swing cam is formed with a concentric arcuate idle running zone centered on the center axis of the swing shaft. Thus, even when the swing cam is swung, the rocker arm is not swung while the roller is moving along the idle running zone.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">According to a further configuration, in the abutment portion displacing mechanism, the swing shaft is rotated about 180 degrees between a small lift setting state and a large lift setting state, and in each setting state, a straight line which connects the center axis of the swing shaft and the center axis of the drive shaft extends generally along the direction of extension of the arm. Therefore, even when a force is exerted on the arm by the rotational cam, no twisting moment acts on the swing shaft, which allows reducing the strength of the swing shaft. This is especially advantageous in the largest lift duration, and also provides good controllability of the arm in the smallest lift duration, when the motion of the arm in connection with the rotation of the swing shaft becomes less responsive.</p><heading id="h0001">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0048" num="0048"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a vertical

The variable valve train mechanism 1 has a camshaft 2, a rotational cam 3, a swing shaft 4, a swing cam 5, and a rocker arm 6. The camshaft 2 is rotationally driven by a crankshaft (not shown) of the internal combustion engine. The rotational cam 3 is disposed on the camshaft 2. The swing shaft 4 is provided parallel to the camshaft 2. The swing cam 5 is supported with the swing shaft 4 and is swingable through the rotational cam 3.

The drive shaft 9 has a center axis O4 parallel to and eccentric from the center<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> axis O2 of the swing shaft 4.

One end 10a of the arm 10 is formed with a through hole 10c in which the roller shaft 7 is fitted, and the other end a semi-circular through hole 10d as "fitting recess" in which the drive shaft 9 is fitted. The roller shaft 7 is rotatably fitted in the through hole 10c at the one end 10a, and the drive shaft 9 is rotatably fitted in the semi-circular through hole 10d at the other end 10b. There is provided a pin 16 as "coming-off prevention member" to prevent the drive shaft 9 from coming off the through hole 10d.

Then, the roller shaft 7 is rotated through the arm 10 in connection with the drive shaft 9. The roller shaft 7 is then displaced within the guide portion 5b while keeping a certain distance between the center axis O3 of the roller shaft 7 and the center axis O4 of the drive shaft 9 by means of the arm 10, so that the relative distance between the center axis O2 of the swing shaft 4 and the roller 8 is changed.

The top end of the intake valve 11 is attached with the shim 23.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">In such manner, the swinging motion of the swing cam 5 causes the rocker arm 6 to swing, which moves the intake valve 11 upward and downward. Thus, changing the relative distance between the center axis O2 of the swing shaft 4 and the roller 8 to control a position of the swing cam 5 at which the swing cam 5 starts swinging, allows controlling to change the timing of a maximum lift of the intake valve 11 through the rocker arm 6.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">The guide portion 5b is a slot inclined relative to the radial direction of the camshaft 2, but is not limited to this.

For instance, a side of the swing cam 5 on the rotational cam 3 side may be formed with an inclined surface as the guide portion 5b which is inclined relative to the radial direction of the camshaft 2, so that the roller shaft 7 abuts the inclined surface and is guided moving along it. Further, although the guiding direction of the guide portion is inclined relative to the radial direction of the camshaft 2, the configuration is not limited to this. Changing the guiding direction to any direction can change the setting of a lift and the opening and closing timing of the valve to, for example, the one in which a lift is unchanged and the timing of a maximum lift is changed, or the one in which a lift is changed and the timing of a maximum lift is unchanged.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Function of the variable valve train mechanism 1 constituted as above will next be described.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">First, description will be made in detail of function of the variable valve train mechanism 1 of an internal combustion<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> engine when the largest lift is required, with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a vertical sectional view of a portion of the variable valve train mechanism of an internal combustion engine in accordance with the Embodiment 1 of the present invention, when the largest lift is required, showing the state of the intake valve being closed. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a vertical sectional view of a portion of the variable valve train mechanism of an internal combustion engine in accordance with the Embodiment 1 of the present invention, when the largest lift is required, showing the state of the intake valve being opened.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the roller shaft 7 is first displaced to the end of the guide portion 5b on the rotational cam 3 side, to change a relative distance between the center axis O2 of the swing shaft 4 and the roller 8.

This causes the roller shaft 7 to be rotated through the arm 10 and displaced to the end of the guide portion 5b on the rotational cam 3 side, so that the relative distance between the center axis O2 of the swing shaft 4 and the roller 8 is changed. Then, the cam face 5a of the swing cam 5 is displaced.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, when the roller 8 on the swing cam 5 is in contact with the base face 3a of the rotational cam 3, the swing cam 5 is not swung toward the intake valve 11.

In such manner, the relative distance between the center axis O2 of the swing shaft 4 and the roller 14 in contact with the cam face 5a of the swing cam 5 is increased from the relative distance M as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> to the relative distance N as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, and thus the rocker arm 6 is swung toward the intake valve by a larger amount.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">Then, the rocker arm 6 thus swung toward the intake valve 11 by a larger amount depresses the top face of the shim 23 with the depressing portion 6a formed at its end, to depress the intake valve 11 by a larger amount.

As described above, when the roller shaft 7 is displaced to the end of the guide portion 5b on the swing shaft 4 side to change the relative distance between the center axis O2 of the swing shaft 4 and the roller 8, the relative distance from the center axis O2 of the swing shaft 4 to the roller 14 in contact with the cam face 5a of the swing cam 5 is reduced, so that the intake valve 11 is depressed by a smaller amount. As a result, the intake valve 11 can be opened with the smallest lift, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref> by the broken line C, in the Embodiment 1.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">Further, in the Embodiment 1, when the roller shaft 7 is displaced to the end of the guide portion 5b on the swing shaft 4 side to depress the intake valve 11, a valve opening becomes small.

The abutment portion displacing mechanism is provided for displacing the roller 8 to change a relative distance between the roller 8 and the center axis O2 of the swing shaft 4, and changing the relative distance allows changing a lift and the like of the valve. The structure is thus simplified, thereby reducing manufacturing cost. Further, controlling the valve lift and timing of the maximum valve lift is not achieved by means of the spline mechanism as in the conventional art. The valve lift and timing of the maximum valve lift are, therefore, changed through reliable operation, and reliability is secured.</p><p id="p0107" num="0107">Further, a load from the rotational cam 3 is inputted to the roller 8, and then directly transmitted to the guide portion 5a of the swing cam 5 from the roller shaft 7, and then from the swing cam 5, transmitted to the intake valve 11 via the rocker arm 6. Therefore, unlike the conventional art, no large bending moment acts on the arm 10 for supporting the roller 8, but only a compressive force is exerted longitudinally of the arm 10. Thus, there is no need to significantly increase the strength of the arm 10, thereby preventing an increase in weight and size<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> of the arm 10.</p><p id="p0108" num="0108">On the other hand, in the latter of the foregoing conventional art, a load is inputted to the roller at one end of the rocker arm and then transmitted to the nose opposite the roller with respect to the control cam. Since large bending moment acts on the overall length of the rocker arm, the strength of the rocker arm necessarily needs to be increased.</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">The abutment portion displacing mechanism has the drive shaft 9 disposed to be movable so that the center axis O4 of the drive shaft 9 is displaced relative to the center axis O2 of the swing shaft 4, and the arm 10 with one end 10a connected to the roller shaft 7, and the other end 10b the drive shaft 9. As the drive shaft 9 is displaced, the roller 8 is displaced through the arm 10 and the roller shaft 7, so that the relative distance between the roller 8 and the center axis O2 of the swing shaft 4 is changed. Thus, the relative distance between the roller 8 and the center axis O2 of the swing shaft 4 is easily changed with a simple constitution, so that a combination of the valve lift and timing of the maximum valve lift can be flexibly changed.</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">The drive shaft 9 is provided in the swing shaft 4, and the center axis O4 of the drive shaft 9 is eccentric from the center axis O2 of the swing shaft 4. As the swing shaft 4 is rotated to a specified angle, the roller shaft 7 is displaced through the arm 10 to change the relative distance between the roller 8 and the center axis O2 of the swing shaft 4. Thus, the structure can be simplified and the variable valve train mechanism 1 can be compactly made.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111">The swing cam 5 has the guide portion 5b for guiding the roller 8 to a given position. The guiding direction of the guide portion 5b is inclined relative to the radial direction of the camshaft 2. Thus, simply displacing the roller 8 along the guide portion 5b can easily change the relative distance between the center axis O3 of the roller shaft 7 and the center axis O2 of the swing shaft 4, so that the lift and opening and closing timing<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> of the valve is changed. Further, the guide portion 5b is a slot. This prevents the roller shaft 7 from falling off in assembling the variable valve train mechanism 1, thereby facilitating assembly work.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">Further, there is provided the drive shaft 9 formed continuously from the swing shaft 4 along the axial direction thereof and having the center axis O4 parallel to and eccentric from the center axis O2 of the swing shaft 4. The arm 10 is rotatably attached to the drive shaft 9. Therefore, even when a rotational angle of the swing shaft 4 is increased, the arm 10 is prevented from interfering with the swing shaft 4, which allows the amount of change in the relative distance to be larger. Further, even when the distance between the center axis O2 of the swing shaft 4 and the center axis O4 of the drive shaft 9 is shortened, such amount of change in the relative distance is provided. Thus, twisting moment transmitted from the arm 10 via the drive shaft 9 and exerted on the swing shaft 4 can be reduced.</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">Further, since the rotational angle of the swing shaft 4 can be increased for the amount of change in the relative distance, fine adjustments to the relative distance are easily made, and good controllability of the swing shaft 4 for rotation is provided.</p><p id="p0114" num="0114">Further, the drive shaft 9 is formed in a manner such that its peripheral edge is within the peripheral edge of the swing shaft 4, as seen in the axial direction. Thus, the drive shaft 9 can be easily formed, and the twisting moment exerted on the swing shaft 4 can be reduced.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">Further, the arm 10 is formed with the semi-circular through hole 10d, and the pin 16 is provided, on the side of an open end of the semi-circular through hole 10d, for preventing the drive shaft 9 from coming off toward the open end. Thus, the arm 10 can be easily disposed. Further, while the rotational cam 3 is being driven, a compressive force acts on the arm 10,<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> and thus no large force acts on the pin 16. Therefore, this coming-off prevention member may have less strength.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">Further, since the swing cam 5 is urged toward the rotational cam 3 by the spring 15, normally no gap is created between the rotational cam 3 and the swing cam 5 even when there is a valve clearance. The swing cam 5 moves smoothly along the rotational cam face and is prevented from being hit with the rotational cam 3. Specifically, although the cam face 5a of the swing cam 5 includes the idle running zone c as described later, since the swing cam 5 normally moves along the rotational cam face, the swing cam 5 is prevented from being hit with the rotational cam 3.</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">Further, the rocker arm 6 which is swung by the swing cam 5 is urged toward the swing cam 5 by the spring 17. Thus, looseness between the rocker arm 6 and the swing cam 5 can be prevented even when there is a valve clearance. Further, since the roller 14 does not rotate by itself, wear is restricted in a sliding contact portion between the roller 14 and the swing cam 5.</p><p id="p0118" num="0118">Further, the actuator is provided at one end of the swing shaft 4. Thus, driving the actuator causes the plural drive shafts 9 for the respective cylinders to be displaced.</p><p id="p0119" num="0119">Further, in the abutment portion displacing mechanism, the swing shaft 4 is rotated about 180 degrees between a small lift setting state and a large lift setting state, and in each setting state, the straight line L which connects the center axis O2 of the swing shaft 4 and the center axis O4 of the drive shaft 9 extends generally along the direction of extension of the arm 10. Therefore, even when a force is exerted on the arm 10 by the rotational cam 3, no twisting moment acts on the swing shaft 4, which allows reducing the strength of the swing shaft 4. This is especially advantageous in the largest lift duration, and also provides good controllability of the arm 10 in the smallest lift duration, when the motion of the arm 10 in connection with the rotation of the swing shaft 4 becomes less responsive.<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --></p><heading id="h0003">[Embodiment 2 of the Invention]</heading><p id="p0120" num="0120"><figref idrefs="f0010 f0011 f0012 f0013">Figs. 10 through 13</figref> show Embodiment 2 of the present invention.
