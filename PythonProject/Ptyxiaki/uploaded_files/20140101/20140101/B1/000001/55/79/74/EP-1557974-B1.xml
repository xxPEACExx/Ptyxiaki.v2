particularly to conserving power in networks containing computing devices.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>BACKGROUND</u></b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Certain Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) networks connect a number of computing devices over links based on TDMA technology. With TDMA, network access is subdivided to between a number of computers to within a number of sequential time slots. One computing device is allocated the use of the network during each time slot within a time frame. A computing device may be awake for a particular timeslot if it is transmitting or receiving data within that time slot. To conserve power (particularly in wireless networks and/or with battery operated computing devices such as personal display assistants (PDAs) and hand-held or cellular telephones) it may be desired to let computing devices go to sleep during those time slots that they are not transmitting or receiving data. However, waking up a computing device also consumes considerable power. As such, power management of computing devices within a network often involves this balancing of the power consumed by keeping computing devices awake compared to the power consumed by letting certain computing devices go to sleep, and soon thereafter waking up the computing devices.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Certain computing devices, wireless and cellular telephones, PDAs, and wireless electronic devices use batteries. Reducing energy consumption for battery-based computing devices increases the battery charge lifetime for the devices. Power consumption is often related to whether the computing device is kept awake, allowed to go to sleep, or transitioned between an awake state and an asleep state. Power management becomes an important factor in<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> designing computing devices that can operate on the networks for extended periods.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It would be beneficial to improve the power management for computing devices.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5371734A"><text>US-A-5 371 734</text></patcit> relates to a medium access control technique or protocol for selectively activating and deactivating the transmitters and receivers of means for communicating between resources to save electrical power consumed while still permitting LAN like functionality. Communication occurs among members of a group of communicators. One of the communicators of the group is designated as a hub and the remaining communicators are designated as remotes. The hub establishes repeating communication cycles, each of which has intervals during which the hub and the remotes transmit and receive frames. The hub transmits control information to the remotes to establish the communication cycle and to establish a plurality of predeterminable intervals during each communication cycle. In one example, the hub allocates transmission opportunities to the remotes. The transmission opportunities allocation information is communicated to the remotes. Previous transmission opportunities allocations may be revoked or relinquished for non use or very low use as determined by the hub monitoring the frames transmitted by each remote. In addition, the transmission opportunity allocations may be varied or adjusted by the hub from one communication cycle to the next to account for changes in activity of the remotes. The adjustment occurs in relation to the number of frames or quantity of data transmitted by each remote during recent communication cycles. Thus, the desirable aspects of TDMA are achieved by providing specific predeterminable intervals for transmission opportunities and the desirable aspects of PRMA are achieved by adjusting the durations of the transmission opportunities to accommodate the communication of the more active remotes.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5636220A"><text>US-A-5 636 220</text></patcit> relates to a technique for assuring the delivery of packets in a wireless local area network.

"Flows", as described with respect to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 3, 4a, and 4b</figref>, relate to the desired communication paths between different computing devices within the TDMA-based network that can be arranged in certain sequences. This disclosure provides a reduced degree searching technique that derives sequences for the respective flows to reduce the number of wakeups for the computing devices in a TDMA-based network.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The reduced degree searching technique models the TDMA network using a computer-based vertex/edge graph, examples of which are described with respect to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 5, 6</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0005">8</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0006">9, and 10</figref>. In the vertex/edge graph, the vertices model individual computing devices and the edges model flows between the individual computing devices. The degree of each vertex in the vertex/edge graph (which is considered in the reduced degree searching technique) indicates the number of edges that connect to the vertex. One embodiment of the reduced-degree searching technique is described in a flow-process of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref>.</p><heading id="h0006"><b>Power Management</b></heading><p id="p0024" num="0024">Computing devices (such as personal computers; networked computers; workstations; mainframes; wireless devices consumer electronic devices; portable, wireless, and cellular telephone devices; audio devices; video devices; graphic devices; portable multimedia devices; etc.) can be attached to a large variety of networks, such as a Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN). In this disclosure, the term "computing device" is intended to be taken broadly and applies to any device that derives, uses, and/or displays the results of a computation. An applicable WPAN standard, IEEE 802.15.3, is entitled "Part 15.3: Wireless WPAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications for High Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN)". Often, networks such as a WPAN include one or more battery-based computing devices. The charge duration of such battery-based computing devices is often limited, and can play a factor in the power management of the network to extend the battery charge duration of the computing devices.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The WPAN protocol relies on Time Division Multiple Access<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> (TDMA) concepts as applied to the Medium Access Control layer to allocate time slots (e.g., channel allocation slots in WPAN) to the different computing devices within the network. Within this disclosure, the term TDMA is applied to any protocol in which time slots are allocated to the computing devices. With TDMA, multiple networked computing devices each share access to a resource (such as a network or a server) using some contention allocation scheme. TDMA is based on a frame structure that includes a sequence of frames, and each frame includes multiple time slots. During each time slot, one particular computing device is allocated the use of the network.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">One computing device (referred to in this disclosure as a network coordinator device) controls which computing device transmits data during any time slot over the network. The network coordinator device allocates the time slots based on a contention scheme. In one embodiment, the network coordinator allocates the time slots for each frame among those computing devices that are requesting network usage.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The present disclosure provides a power management technique that reduces the power spent by many of the computing devices by reducing how frequently the devices are awoken from a sleeping state. Reducing the power used by the computing devices on the network extends the battery charge life (before replacing or recharging the battery) of those computing devices.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> shows a block diagram of one embodiment of a computing environment 100 that includes the network 101. The network 101 can include a LAN, a WPAN, a combination of network types, or any other type of network. The network 101 1 described with respect to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> may be configured either as a stand-alone network; or alternately the network may be connected to communicate data with such additional networks. The networked computing environment 100 may include a network coordinator device 105,<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> one or more computing devices 106, and a plurality of beacon signals 107. The network coordinator device 105 of the network 101 may be configured as a hub, a router, or another switch device to (in effect) create a wireless and/or wired network 101 within the networked computing environment 100.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The beacon signals 107 may be physically transmitted over either wireless and/or wired connectors. It is envisioned that in different embodiments, the computing devices 106 will operate using either a rechargeable or disposable battery (not shown). The battery provides portability to a variety of computing devices and other computing devices.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Power management within the network 101 relates to reducing the power exerted by the computing devices when functioning within the network 101. Three power states may be of concern to each computing device in the network within the present disclosure. A first power state of the computing device 101 is awake, in which the computing device is capable of performing its normal operations. While the term "awake" can allow different functions with different computing devices and different networks, it is envisioned that awake computers can operate on the network to transmit/receive signals in a normal manner. A second power state of the computing device 101 is asleep, in which the computing device is in a power-saving state and is incapable of performing normal operation. A third power state of the computing device 106 is transitioning between the asleep state and the awake state (i.e., waking up), during which time the computing device exerts a considerable amount of power.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Each data signal 108 digitally couples one of the computing devices 106 to another computing device in a manner to provide TDMA service between the computing devices 106. The network coordinator device 105, the computing devices 106, and the data signals 108 together delineate the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> TDMA network 101.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, one beacon signal 107 extends from the network coordinator device 105 to each respective computing device 106 within the network 101. In one embodiment, the network coordinator device 105 transmits beacon signals 107 to transmit (e.g., broadcast) to each computing device 106 the sequence that the time slots within the different frames are allocated to the different computing devices. The network coordinator 105 can be constructed and considered as one computing device 106 that can effectively communicate with the other computing devices over the network, and can perform the central controlling functionalities to the network 101. The network coordinator 105 may be similar to (considering hardware, software, and/or firmware aspects) the other computing devices within the network 101 except for the addition of those components that provide for the functionality of coordinating the network access between the different computing devices. The network coordinator can be responsible for the system timing, Quality of Service (QoS) control, power management, security, etc. of the computing devices within the TDMA network.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Certain embodiments of the TDMA based network 101 use channel allocation slots 206 (which are one embodiment of time slots such as used in WPAN networks) as described with respect to the frames 202 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>. Only one computing device can transmit data (e.g., packets) within the network 101 during each channel allocation slot 206. The computing devices 106 that operate within the network 101 are awake during those TDMA-based channel allocation slots 206 (or time slots) that they are transmitting or receiving a signal, and can be asleep during other channel allocation slots (or time slots) that they are transmitting or receiving a signal to conserve power. Waking up a computing device 106 from a sleeping state to an awake state requires a<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> considerable amount of power to be spent by that computing device 106. As such, to provide an efficient power management design for a network 101 involves balancing the power saved from maintaining the computing device in its awake state compared to the power spent to transition the computing device to its more energy efficient asleep state, then having to wake up the computing device into its awake state during the next time slot in which the computing device is participating.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The power management mechanisms as described relative to the network 101 within this disclosure diminish the battery discharge rate of the networked computing devices 106. Waking the computing devices from their "asleep" state less often increases the battery life (between recharging) of the computer devices 106. In general, increasing the duration for which battery life lasts in certain networks assists the network 101 in becoming better accepted by users. WPANs are particularly designed for low power/low cost devices. The power conservation aspects of the present disclosure are thus particularly suited for WPANs to extend the battery-charge duration of the computing devices.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> describes one embodiment of a frame 202 (such as a superframe as described in as the WPAN protocol) that provides structure to the communications within the network 101 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. The MAC layer of the network 101 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> relies largely on TDMA concepts such as the use of the frame 202 as described with respect to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>. During normal operations, the network coordinator device 105 broadcasts a beacon signal 107 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> to each other computing device 106 within the network 101 during the beacon period 208 within the frame 202 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>. The beacon signal 107 sent during the beacon period 208 describes the specific sequence and duration of the channel allocation slots 206 for each computing device.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Each frame 202 as described with respect to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> includes a channel allocation period 204, the beacon period 208, and a contention access period 210. The frame 202 may also be referred to as a "superframe" in certain embodiments (e.g., such as applied to WPAN networks). The contention access period 210 can be used to communicate commands and/or asynchronous data if it is presented in the frame 202.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">One embodiment of the channel allocation period 204 includes one or more management channel time allocation (MCTA) periods 212 and one or more channel allocation slots or time slots 206. Though only two illustrative channel allocation slots or time slots 206 are shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, there can be a large number of the channel allocation slots or time slots. In one embodiment, the MCTAs 212 are a type of CTA 206 that are used for communications between the computing devices 106 and the coordinator device 105. The channel allocation slots 206 are considered within the frame 202 as units in a contention-based TDMA protocol in which one particular computing device can transmit data over the network. Each user within the network 101 controls the data transfer within the network during their respective channel allocation slot 206 within the frame 202.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The network coordinator 105 as described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> assigns different channel allocation slots 206 within the channel allocation period 204 to different computing devices 106 based on the reduced degree searching mechanism described herein. Which computing device is to receive or send data during a particular channel allocation slot 206 is identified by the network coordinator 105 using the beacon signal during the beacon period 208. The network coordinator 105 derives the computing device that has control of signal transmissions during each channel allocation period, as discussed in more detail below. The duration of the channel<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> allocation periods typically can be set within the network 101.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> describes one embodiment of a flow topology graph 310 that is arranged with a plurality of vertices, each of which represents a computing device; and flows that represent requested signal connections between computing devices. Within the flow topology graph 310, flows (shown as f<sub>AB</sub>, f<sub>BC</sub>, and f<sub>CD</sub> in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>) represent a graphical representation of the data signal 108 between the computing devices 106.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Computing devices typically expend considerably more energy when they are in an awake state than when they are in an asleep state. To conserve power in general, it is desired to allow computing devices 106 to sleep during those channel allocation periods 206 that they are not actively transmitting or receiving data as indicated by either end of the flow being in contact with the device, and wake up during the channel allocation periods that are allocated for their flows. Each computing device 106 can therefore wake up only in those channel allocation periods in which they are included (at either end of the data signal 108 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> or the flows as described with respect to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>). Each computing device can go to sleep at the end of the channel allocation period if that computing device is not included in the next channel allocation period 206.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">As described herein, the power management problem becomes associated with selecting the sequence of flows between computing devices 312 in a flow topology graph 310 (which relate to the computing devices 106 within the network 101 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) to reduce the total number of computing device wakeups. Applying the power management technique (such as the reduced degree searching technique as described herein) is beneficial within a typical multi-computing device and multi-flow environment.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The flow topology graph 310 in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> includes a flow f<sub>AB</sub> that<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> extends between the computing device A 312 and the computing device B 312. A flow f<sub>BC</sub> extends between the computing device B 312 and the computing device C 312. A flow f<sub>CD</sub> extends between the computing device C 312 and the computing device D 312. With the flow topology graph 310 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, the computing device B 312 can forward a data stream between the computing device A 312 and the computing device C 312. Computing device C 312 transmits a data stream between the computing device B 312 and the computing device D 312. During an illustrative flow such as f<sub>AB</sub> between computing device A and computing device B for example, data can be transmitted either from the computing device A to the computing device B, or vice versa. As such, flows can be considered as non-directional.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The sequence of the flows determines the number of computing devices 312 that have to be woken up during each frame. The effect of the sequence of the flows on the power management in the network 101 is demonstrated within the flow diagrams of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 4a and 4b</figref>. The flow diagrams of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 4a and 4b</figref> are based on the illustrative flow topology graph 310 of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 4a and 4b</figref> show two alternate example flow diagrams 400 that illustrate multiple sequences of the flows f<sub>AB</sub>, f<sub>BC</sub>, and f<sub>CD</sub> as shown in the illustrative flows of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>. The series of the three flows f<sub>AB</sub>, f<sub>BC</sub>, and f<sub>CD</sub> are each arranged as the frame 202 in both <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 4a and 4b</figref>. The sequence of the flows within a flow diagram 400 determines how many computing devices 106 have to be woken up during a frame 202. Each flow within the flow diagram 400 can wake up zero, one, or two computing devices. In a flow which has two wake-ups, two computing devices have to be woken up. In a flow which has one wake-up, only one computing device has to be woken up.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> In a flow which has no wake-ups, no computing device has to be woken up.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">If there is more than one flow between any pair of computing devices 106, the multiple flows can be combined into a single flow within a flow diagram such as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> since the multiple flows can be allocated at contiguous channel allocation periods within the frame 202. These repetitive flows between the same pair of flows thereby contribute zero wake-ups beyond the one wake-up associated with a single flow extending between a pair of computing devices. Combining multiple flows between the same pair of computing devices into a single flow reduces the power used by computing devices within the network.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">As discussed within this disclosure, the power management problem as described within this disclosure largely results from each computing device often requiring much power to wake up after it has gone to sleep. The greater the number of wake-ups for a flow diagram, the more average power is used by the computing devices within the network 101.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Therefore, the fewer times that all of the computing devices 105 within the network 101 are awaken (which can be indicated by a reduced order of all of the flows), generally, the less power is used by the computing devices within the network 101. As the computing devices 105 within the network 101 are awoken fewer times, more power is conserved by the computing devices within the network 101.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 4a and 4b</figref> provide two embodiments of flow diagrams which are used to demonstrate the power that certain computing devices can save by using certain flows compared to other flows. Consider the flow diagram of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4a</figref>. The flow f<sub>AB</sub> contributes a wake-up of 2 because it is the first flow, and therefore cannot share a computing device with a prior flow because there are no prior flows in the frame 202. Two consecutive flows sharing the<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> common computing device A results in a wake-up of 1 for the computing device. With the flow diagram of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4a</figref>, the flow f<sub>AB</sub> occurs directly prior to flow f<sub>BC</sub>. These two consecutive flows share the computing device B, thus the flow f<sub>BC</sub> has one wake-up. Flow f<sub>BC</sub> occurs immediately prior to flow f<sub>CD</sub>, and these two consecutive flows share computing device C, thus the flow f<sub>CD</sub> has one wake-up. The total number of wake-ups in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4a</figref> is therefore 2+1+1=4.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">With the flow diagram of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4b</figref>, the flow f<sub>AB</sub> contributes two wake-ups because it is the first flow and cannot share a computing device with a prior flow (because there is no prior flow to flow f<sub>AB</sub> in the frame 202 shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4b</figref>). As such, both computing devices A and B have to wake up. The flow f<sub>CD</sub> contributes two wake-ups because it does not share any devices with the prior flow f<sub>AB</sub>. As such, both computing devices C and D have to wake up. The computing device B will therefore go back to sleep after flow f<sub>AB</sub>, and considering that the computing device B is included in the third flow f<sub>BC</sub>, then the computing device B needs to wake up again for the 3rd channel allocation period for flow f<sub>BC</sub>. Flow f<sub>BC</sub> is adjacent to flow f<sub>CD</sub>, and these two flows share computing device C and therefore the flow f<sub>CD</sub> has one wake-up. The total number of wake-ups in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4b</figref> is therefore 2+2+1=5.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Based on the above disclosure, since the flow diagram in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4a</figref> has a total of four wake-ups while the flow diagram in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4b</figref> has a total of five wake-ups.

Considering the large number of frames 202 that occur within even a relatively small network 101, reducing the number of wakeups within many of the frames 202 can<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> thereby result in a considerable power savings to the computing devices within the network 101.</p><heading id="h0007"><b>Reduced Degree Searching Using Vertex/Edge Graphs</b></heading><p id="p0051" num="0051">As mentioned above, one aspect of the power management problem can be viewed as deriving a desired sequence of flows within the flow topology graph 310 of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>.

The reduced degree searching mechanism is now described, and the relation between the reduced degree searching mechanism of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref> and the flow topology graph of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> is described below.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The degree of a vertex describes the number of vertices that terminate at the vertex. The reduced degree searching mechanism operates within the realm of graphs that derive sequences based on edges and vertices as described in this disclosure. One embodiment of the "reduced degree searching" mechanism can derive a sequence of edges that can be used to conserve power for many of the computing devices that are operating within the network 101 by decreasing the total number of wakeups for all of the computing devices 105 within the network 101 is now described. The "reduced degree searching" mechanism of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref> involves establishing a vertex/edge graph G1, examples of which are described with respect to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 5 and 6</figref>, according to the following rules:
<ol><li>1. Each computing device 106 within the networked computing environment 100 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is denoted as a vertex V<sub>m</sub> 504 within the vertex/edge graph G1, where m represents an integer that distinctly<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> identifies each individual computing device 106 based on the integer value of the vertex 504. As such, the reference character "V<sub>m</sub>" is shown within the node for the corresponding computing device in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 5 and 6</figref>.

For example, the vertex/edge graph in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 6</figref> includes three interconnected vertices 504 in a first patch 602a and two interconnected vertices in a second patch 602b. Each "patch" may be visualized as an island<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> of interconnected vertices in which all of the vertices are interconnected either directly or indirectly by at least one edge to each other vertex within the patch. No vertex contained within one patch is connected by an edge to a vertex contained in another patch. For example, no vertex in the patch 602a can be connected (either directly or indirectly) to any vertex in the patch 602b since the vertices are in different patches. When the vertex/edge graph G1 is a connected graph in which those vertices that are connected by edges are maintained within only one patch, such as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>, the lower bound of the reduced number of the wakeups is N+1.

As noted in footnote 1 of step 2 in Table<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> the phrase "both of the edge's associated vertices having the lowest degree" means that first, among all candidate vertices, find those with the minimum degree (with the degree being &gt; 0). For each candidate vertex with the minimum degree, find the one whose neighboring vertex has the minimum degree. Finally, choose the pair of vertex with the minimum degree. Such computing devices experience a reduced number of wake-ups of the computing devices, and thereby may be considered as operating using a power management technique. The reduced degree searching technique 700 of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref> relies on generating and analyzing a representative vertex/edge graph G1 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 5 and 6</figref> (and also <figref idrefs="f0005">Figs. 8</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0006">9, and 10</figref> where the edges are indicated by their adjacent vertices instead of by the edge number) in which the selections of the edges between their respective associated vertices can be determined for each time slot. In operation 704, a modified vertex/edge graph G is derived from (and can initially be a copy of) the vertex/edge graph G1. The vertex/edge graph G1 and the modified vertex/edge graph G include edges with interconnecting associated vertices which correspond graphically to the data signals 108 communicating between computing devices within the network 101 as described with respect to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. The edges can be computationally removed from the modified graph G using the reduced degree searching technique. Note that the order in which the edges are removed corresponds to the selected sequence of the flows within the flow topology graph 310 of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>.

In operation 706, any edge whose two associated vertices share the same reduced degree (e.g., which may be a minimal degree) is selected. The reduced degree is found by a) finding all of the vertices within the modified vertex/edge graph that have a smallest degree, and then b) using the vertices found in a, select an edge that has at least one of the vertices from a and that has associated vertices with the smallest sum.

The sequence of the flows that are obtained from the second reduced degree searching example corresponds to edge BC, edge AB, edge AD, edge DE, edge AF, and edge FG in the vertex/edge diagram G1. Although the vertex/edge graph G1 is a connected graph, there is no way to achieve the lower bound. There is no common vertex from edge DE to edge AF, and following the reduced degree searching technique actually progresses through step 5 of Table 1 three times. As such, even in vertex/edge graph instances where there is only one patch (e.g., for a connected graph), we may need to loop through to step 5 of Table 1 multiple times.<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --></p><heading id="h0009"><b>Computing Devices</b></heading><p id="p0096" num="0096">One embodiment of a computer environment 1100 that can support the network 101 and the computing devices 106 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> to run the reduced degree searching technique 700 of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref> is described within this disclosure is described with respect to <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 11</figref>.
