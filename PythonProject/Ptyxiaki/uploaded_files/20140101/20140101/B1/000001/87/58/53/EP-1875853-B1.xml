load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0002">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an endoscope including an operation portion to which a display device for displaying an endoscope image picked up by image pickup means is connected.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventionally, as a light source of an endoscope, well-known is a light source lamp built in a light source device as a peripheral device to which an endoscope is connected. When illumination light is supplied to an endoscope from a light source device, the illumination light emitted from a light source lamp is transmitted to a distal end of an insertion portion via from a universal cord to an operation portion of the endoscope, by means of light guide fiber extended inside of the endoscope, and then the illumination light is irradiated from the distal end of the insertion portion to a region to be inspected.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In addition, in recent years, for the purpose of simplifying a whole endoscope apparatus including an endoscope and peripheral devices, well-known is an endoscope having a configuration in which a light source is configured of a light emitting diode provided in the endoscope and a display device for displaying an endoscope image is connected to an operation portion.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Providing a light source configured of the light emitting diode in the endoscope eliminates the need for a light source device connected to the endoscope, thereby simplifying the endoscope apparatus. In addition, the light emitting diode is capable of emitting light with lower electric power compared with light source lamp and the like, thereby realizing power saving in the endoscope apparatus. Furthermore, connecting the display device to the operation portion eliminates the need for a monitor device to be separately connected to the endoscope, thereby simplifying the endoscope apparatus.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In addition, in the endoscope, also provided is a light emitting diode driving<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> circuit which is a light source driving circuit for applying electric power supplied from a battery provided to the display device, for example, to the light emitting diode after adjusting the electric power to the current rating of the light emitting diode.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Incidentally, an endoscope generally has watertight structure, since the outer surface of the endoscope is cleaned after use. That is, inside of the endoscope except for an opening of a duct and the like, is occluded by an exterior member. In order to reduce the weight of the whole endoscope, the exterior member of the endoscope is usually made of plastic material.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, if the light emitting diode emits light, and in addition, the light emitting diode driving circuit continues to be driven, for example, in an enclosed space inside the operation portion in the endoscope covered with the plastic exterior member, there is a problem such that the light emitting diode is degraded by heat radiated in the enclosed space inside the operation portion due to the light emission of the light emitting diode and the driving of the light emitting diode driving circuit, and the lifetime of the light emitting diode is shortened, since the plastic exterior member has a low heat transfer efficiency.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Therefore, conventionally, there has been a compelling circumstance to make the light emitting diode emit light with electric power lower than the rated value in consideration of heat radiation efficiency of the plastic exterior member and the lifetime of the light emitting diode.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In view of such a circumstance, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP9285443A"><text>9-285443</text></patcit> discloses an endoscope having a configuration in which a small size illumination lamp as a light source is provided in a distal end portion of an insertion portion of the endoscope, and a light emission control circuit serving as a light source driving circuit for supplying electric power to the small size illumination lamp is provided in an operation portion of the endoscope. With such a configuration, the small size illumination lamp and the light emission control circuit are provided in different spaces, so that a heat radiating position from the small size illumination lamp and a heat radiating position from the light emission control circuit are different. Therefore, in the configuration, heat radiation points are dispersed, so that heat is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> radiated from the whole endoscope, while preventing localized heat radiation.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In addition, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2002112953A"><text>2002-112953</text></patcit> discloses a light source device which is mounted to a light source mounting port of an operation portion of an endoscope, and the light source has such a configuration that an LED lamp as a light source and a constant current source as a light source driving circuit are disposed separately from each other. With such a configuration, a heat radiating position from the LED lamp and a heat radiating position from the constant current source are different, thereby preventing localized heat radiation.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A similar configuration is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2005192739A"><text>2005-192739</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Incidentally, an operator usually grasps an operation portion of an endoscope and performs an operation using the endoscope, while watching a display portion of a display device. Therefore, in radiating heat from the light emitting diode and the light emitting diode driving circuit which are disposed in the above-described endoscope, it is necessary to radiate heat in a direction avoiding the operator in order not to disturb the operation by the operator.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">However, in the configurations disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publications No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP9285443A"><text>9-285443</text></patcit> and No. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2002112953A"><text>2002-112953</text></patcit>, the heat radiation direction is not taken into consideration. Accordingly, there is a case where heat from the light source and the light source driving circuit is radiated toward the operator, so that there is a problem that the operator has a difficulty in performing an operation with the endoscope due to hotness of the radiated heat.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In view of such a problem, also there is well-known a configuration in which heat of a light source is radiated in a direction avoiding an operator, for example, in a body cavity, via a duct through which fluid passes, for example, an insufflation duct. However, in such a configuration, no consideration is paid as to how to radiate heat from the light source driving circuit in a direction avoiding the operator.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Document <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US20020022769A1"><text>US 2002/0022769 A1</text></patcit> concerns a portable video laryngoscope. The laryngoscope consists of information gathering means including a camera, a handle comprising a compartment and display means located within the compartment.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The present invention has been conceived in view of the above-described problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide an endoscope having a configuration in which not only heat of a light source but also heat of a light source driving circuit can be surely radiated in a direction other than a direction of an operator<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> who uses the endoscope.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">The problem mentioned above is solved by an endoscope as defined in claim 1.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become more clearly understood from the following description referring to the accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view showing an endoscope according to an embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a partial perspective view showing the endoscope in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> viewed from a rear surface side in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.<br/>
