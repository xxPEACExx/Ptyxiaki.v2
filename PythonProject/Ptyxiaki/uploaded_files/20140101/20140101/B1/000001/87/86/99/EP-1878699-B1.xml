More specifically, the present invention relates to a method for producing hydrogen peroxide characterized in that specified amounts of ethylanthraquinone and ethyltetrahydroanthraquinone are used as the anthraquinone compounds.</p><heading id="h0003">2. <u>Description of the Related Art</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">An anthraquinone process is known as an industrial hydrogen peroxide production process. In this process, an anthraquinone compound is dissolved in an organic solvent to obtain a working solution, and in a hydrogenation step the anthraquinone compound is reduced with hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst so as to produce an anthrahydroquinone compound. Next, in an oxidation step the anthrahydroquinone compound is converted back into the anthraquinone compound, with hydrogen peroxide being produced at the same time. The hydrogen peroxide in the working solution is separated out from the working solution by a process such as water extraction. The working solution from which the hydrogen peroxide has been extracted is returned into the hydrogenation step, whereby a cyclic process is formed.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The hydrogenation step is the most important step in the anthraquinone process, and as a characteristic feature can be broadly classified according to whether an anthraquinone (hereinafter this refers to either a substituted anthraquinone or unsubstituted anthraquinone) is used, or a tetrahydroanthraquinone (hereinafter this refers to either a substituted tetrahydroanthraquinone or unsubstituted tetrahydroanthraquinone) is used, or both are used as a reaction medium.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Prior art in which an anthraquinone or a tetrahydroanthraquinone is used as the reaction medium is collected together in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP6191803A"><text>6-191803</text></patcit>. That is, hitherto, problems have been cited that in the case that a tetrahydroanthraquinone is used as the reaction medium, the reaction conditions in the oxidation step must be strengthened, whereas in the case that an anthraquinone is used as the reaction medium, the solubility of the anthrahydroquinone produced through the hydrogenation is low. As a method for producing<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> hydrogen peroxide efficiently and economically, there has thus been proposed a hydrogen peroxide production process in which in the reduction step all of a tetrahydroanthraquinone and some or all of an anthraquinone in a working solution are reduced, and the content of an anthrahydroquinone in the working solution after the reduction step is kept higher than the content of a tetrahydroanthrahydroquinone. That is, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP6191803A"><text>6-191803</text></patcit>, there is proposed a process according to which the amount of hydrogen peroxide obtained per cycle is kept high. Moreover, by using more of the anthrahydroquinone for which the oxidation reaction proceeds readily than the tetrahydroanthrahydroquinone for which the oxidation reaction rate is slow, the energy consumption in the oxidation step can be kept down.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Moreover, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP6191803A"><text>6-191803</text></patcit>, a case in which two or more anthraquinone compounds are used is introduced, the use of such a mixture of anthraquinone compounds having been known from long ago.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2001163608A"><text>2001-163608</text></patcit> and Published Japanese Translation of <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2002511377W"><text>PCT Application No. 2002-511377</text></patcit>, a case that mainly a tetrahydroanthraquinone is used as the reaction medium is introduced. In Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP2001163608A"><text>2001-163608</text></patcit>, a case is shown in which a mixture of an ethylanthraquinone and an amylanthraquinone is used as the anthraquinone compounds, and in Published Japanese Translation of PCT Application No. <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="JP2002511377PCT"><text>2002-511377</text></patcit>, a case is introduced in which a mixture of an ethylanthraquinone and novel compounds 2-(4-methyl-3-pentenyl)-anthraquinone and 2-(4-methylpentyl)-anthraquinone is used. These Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="JP2001163608A"><text>2001-163608</text></patcit> and Published Japanese Translation of <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="JP2002511377W"><text>PCT Application No. 2002-511377</text></patcit> are very similar in that two or more different anthraquinone compounds are used, and mainly a tetrahydroanthraquinone is used as the reaction medium; the difference is the substituents of the anthraquinone compounds used. Moreover, a characteristic feature is that the amount of hydrogen peroxide obtained per cycle is kept high due to using mainly a tetrahydroanthraquinone as the reaction medium.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, in the case of using mainly a tetrahydroanthraquinone as the reaction medium, strengthening the conditions in the oxidation step for the tetrahydroanthrahydroquinone which has a slow oxidation reaction rate is a problem as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="JP6191803A"><text>6-191803</text></patcit>. Moreover, the hydrogen peroxide obtained through such a hydrogen peroxide production process using mainly a tetrahydroanthraquinone as the reaction medium has therein a very large amount of decomposition product originating from the tetrahydroanthraquinone. This is decomposed matter having as a main component thereof an<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> alkylated phthalic acid compound originating from the tetrahydroanthraquinone or a tetrahydroanthraquinone epoxide which is an oxidation product of the tetrahydroanthraquinone. The grounds for being originating from the tetrahydroanthraquinone are that the phthalic acid compound obtained is all an alkylated phthalic acid compound originating from the reaction medium. That is, in the case of using 2-ethyltetrahydroanthraquinone as the reaction medium, this generally mainly comprises a β-tetrahydroanthraquinone, and ethylphthalic acid is present in the hydrogen peroxide obtained. Moreover, such alkylated phthalic acid compounds are hardly seen in hydrogen peroxide obtained using a hydrogen peroxide production process in which an anthraquinone compound as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="JP6191803A"><text>6-191803</text></patcit> is used as the reaction medium. That is, such decomposed matter is a problem due to being present as impurities in the product hydrogen peroxide, this depending on the amount of the tetrahydroanthraquinone in the working solution.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Such impurities can be separated out industrially by any of various processes, but even in the case, for example, of distillation or removal by adsorption, if the amount of impurities in the hydrogen peroxide used as the starting material is high, then the apparatus must be correspondingly large and hence the equipment cost burden becomes high, and moreover the equipment operating time becomes long, and hence this is clearly undesirable. Moreover, when removing the impurities, loss or decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide itself may occur, and hence the burden on the production amount and variable costs cannot be ignored.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Moreover, there are various fields in which the hydrogen peroxide produced may be used, but in any of these fields, for example bleaching of paper pulp, addition to food, or an electronics industry cleaning solution, it is clear that low-impurity hydrogen peroxide is preferable. In particular, hydrogen peroxide for the electronics industry is generally known as ultra-pure hydrogen peroxide, being hydrogen peroxide that has been subjected industrially to special purification, and the amount of impurities in the starting material hydrogen peroxide is a burden as is on the purification process, which is undesirable, and moreover leads to an increase in the amount of impurities in the ultra-pure hydrogen peroxide obtained through the purification, which is undesirable.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Meanwhile, with the process described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="JP6191803A"><text>6-191803</text></patcit>, more anthraquinone than tetrahydroanthraquinone is used for the reaction medium, and hence as described above, it is clear that the amount of impurities which comprise mainly an alkylated phthalic acid compound is lower than in the case of using mainly tetrahydroanthraquinone as the reaction medium. However, it is clearly stated in Japanese<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="JP6191803A"><text>6-191803</text></patcit> that it is preferable to use amylanthraquinone as the anthraquinone, and in addition to this an alkylated anthraquinone, i.e. ethylanthraquinone or tertiary-butyl-anthraquinone, or a mixture of a plurality of anthraquinones can be used, but it is not made clear that it is advantageous to use any specific mixture. For example, in the case of using amylanthraquinone whose use is clearly stated as being preferable, with the process of Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0014" dnum="JP6191803A"><text>6-191803</text></patcit>, it is a fact that the reaction rate in the hydrogenation step is reduced. That is, in the hydrogenation step, to make up for the slow reaction, a large reactor is required, and hence the equipment cost burden is increased. Moreover, as another solution, the amount of a catalyst may be increased so as to make up for the slow reaction rate, but not only is purchasing the catalyst an initial investment, moreover there is a problem that upon increasing the amount of the catalyst, the amount of leaching out of metal from the catalyst increases. The metal leaching out from the catalyst may be, for example, palladium, platinum or nickel, and these not only bring about decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide produced in the oxidation step, but moreover leach out as impurities in the hydrogen peroxide produced, so as to become a problem as described above.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Overall, there is a problem that with the process described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0015" dnum="JP6191803A"><text>6-191803</text></patcit>, inorganic impurities such as metal contaminate the hydrogen peroxide produced, and with the process described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0016" dnum="JP2001163608A"><text>2001-163608</text></patcit> or Published Japanese Translation of <patcit id="pcit0017" dnum="JP2002511377W"><text>PCT Application No. 2002-511377</text></patcit>, organic impurities contaminate the hydrogen peroxide produced.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Goor G, et al., Hydrogen Peroxide, Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Vol. A13, 1989 discloses the anthraquinone process wherein 2-alkyl-9,10-anthraquinones react with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst to form the corresponding hydroquinones.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><patcit id="pcit0018" dnum="GB943683A"><text>GB 943,683</text></patcit> discloses a process for the manufacture of hydrogen peroxide by a cyclic process in which an alkylanthraquinone is catalytically hydrogenated in solution in a solvent medium to the corresponding alkyl-anthrahydroquinone and the latter is subsequently oxidized to hydrogen peroxide and alkylanthraquinone.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><patcit id="pcit0019" dnum="WO9528350A"><text>WO 95/28350</text></patcit> discloses a method for producing hydrogen peroxide by cyclic hydrogenation and oxidation of a working solution containing an "all-tetra" hydroanthraquinone compound.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for producing hydrogen<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> peroxide according to which the problems of the prior art described above are resolved, and the impurity content of hydrogen peroxide produced using the anthraquinone process is low.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">One embodiment of the present invention is a method for producing hydrogen peroxide by alternately reducing and oxidizing a working solution containing anthraquinone compounds as a reaction medium, wherein there are contained, as solvents for the anthraquinone compounds constituting the reaction medium, an aromatic hydrocarbon being a quinone solvent, and at least one selected from the group consisting of higher alcohols, alkyl phosphates, tetra-substituted urea compounds, cyclohexanol carboxylates, and cyclic urea compounds being a hydroquinone solvent, and wherein a mixture of alkyl-substituted anthraquinones and alkyl-substituted tetrahydroanthraquinones in a molar ratio of from 2:1 to 8:1 is used as the anthraquinone compounds in the working solution, in the reduction step all of the tetrahydroanthraquinones and some or all of the anthraquinones in the working solution are reduced, the method comprises a step of keeping the content of alkyl-substituted anthrahydroquinones in the working solution after the reduction step and before the oxidation<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> step higher than the content of alkyl-substituted tetrahydroanthrahydroquinones, and ethylanthraquinone and ethyltetrahydroanthraquinone are used as anthraquinone compounds in the working solution in a total proportion of both of from 10 to 45 mol% of all of the anthraquinone compounds in the working solution, wherein anthraquinone compounds other than the ethylanthraquinone and the ethyltetrahydroanthraquinone are amylanthraquinone and amyltetrahydroanthraquinone, wherein the ethylanthraquinone concentration in the working solution is from 0.10 to 0.45 mol/L, and wherein the concentration of the anthraquinone compounds in the working solution is not more than 1.2 mol/L.

The following embodiment is merely illustrative for explaining the present invention, and the present invention is not intended to be limited to only this embodiment.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In one embodiment of the present invention, there are steps of alternately reducing and<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> oxidizing a working solution containing anthraquinone compounds as a reaction medium, a mixture of alkyl-substituted anthraquinones and alkyl-substituted tetrahydroanthraquinones being used in a molar ratio of from 2:1 to 8:1 as the anthraquinone compounds in the working solution. Moreover, in a reduction step all of the tetrahydroanthraquinones and some or all of the anthraquinones in the working solution are reduced, and the method of the present invention comprises a step of keeping the content of alkyl-substituted anthrahydroquinones in the working solution after the reduction step and before an oxidation step higher than the content of alkyl-substituted tetrahydroanthrahydroquinones. Furthermore, ethylanthraquinone and ethyltetrahydroanthraquinone are used as anthraquinone compounds in the working solution in a total proportion of both of from 10 to 45 mol% of all of the anthraquinone compounds in the working solution.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the present invention, both tetrahydroanthraquinones and anthraquinones are reduced as the reaction medium, so as to obtain a mixed state of different hydroquinones in the working solution, whereby the solubility of the hydroquinones is increased, and as a result the amount of hydrogen peroxide obtained per cycle of the working solution can be kept high. Moreover, in the present invention, for the reaction medium for producing the hydrogen peroxide, more of the anthrahydroquinones for which the oxidation reaction proceeds readily are used than the tetrahydroanthrahydroquinones for which the oxidation reaction rate is slow, whereby the energy consumption in the oxidation step can be kept down. Moreover, in the present invention, the amount of the tetrahydroanthraquinones used in the reaction medium is restricted to be lower than the amount of anthrahydroquinones in the reduction step, whereby contamination of the produced hydrogen peroxide with decomposed matter originating from the tetrahydroanthraquinones can be reduced.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The anthraquinone compounds used in the present invention are characterized in that the proportion of ethylanthraquinone compounds (hereinafter this refers to ethylanthraquinone and ethyltetrahydroanthraquinone) is from 10 to 45 mol% of all of the anthraquinone compounds. As other anthraquinone compounds, amylanthraquinone compounds are used (hereinafter this refers to amylanthraquinone and amyltetrahydroanthraquinone) which have a high solubility; a mixture with a small amount of tertiary-butyl-anthraquinone compounds, unsubstituted anthraquinone compounds or the like may be used.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">By using the ethylanthraquinone compounds in the reaction medium, the reaction rate in the hydrogenation step is increased, and hence compared with the case of using mainly amylanthraquinone compounds as the reaction medium, the amount of a catalyst used can be<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> reduced, and hence the amount of metal leaching out from the catalyst can be reduced, and thus leaching out of metal into the product hydrogen peroxide can be reduced. However, it is well known that although the reaction rate is fast for ethylanthraquinone compounds, ethylanthraquinone compounds have a lower solubility in the reaction medium solvent than amylanthraquinone compounds. The solubility of a mixture of amylanthraquinone and ethylanthraquinone is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. As is clear from <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the solubility changes greatly due to being a eutectic mixture. The concentration of the anthraquinone compounds in the working solution is limited by the density, being substantially not more than 1.2 mol/L; it is undesirable for the concentration to be above this, since then the density increases, and hence liquid separation becomes problematic in an extraction step, and moreover the liquid viscosity increases. For example, an increase in the liquid viscosity causes an increase in the pressure difference for a catalyst filtering filter in the hydrogenation step, whereby the load on a liquid feeding pump increases, which is a problem. That is, as is clear from <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the amount of ethylanthraquinone that can be mixed into a working solution at the maximum of 1.2 mol/L is not more than 45 mol%. An effect is obtained even if the amount of the ethylanthraquinone compounds required for increasing the reaction rate is very small, but a marked effect is seen from 10 mol% upwards.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The maximum amount added of ethylanthraquinone can be easily calculated as 1.2 mol/L x 0.45 mol%, but in the case of a working solution some of the ethylanthraquinone is converted into ethyltetrahydroanthraquinone as the hydrogenation reaction is repeated. A regeneration reaction is carried out such that the amount of the tetrahydroanthraquinones including the ethyltetrahydroanthraquinone relative to the amount of the anthraquinones is from 1:2 to 1:8. Moreover, a small amount is changed into degraded matter. The actual ethylanthraquinone concentration is thus from 0.1 to 0.45 mol/L by subtraction. More preferably, this is from 0.2 to 0.35 mol/L which is close to the maximum concentration. Moreover, considering the ethyltetrahydroanthraquinone concentration, the proportion of the ethylanthraquinone compounds is more preferably from 20 to 40 mol% of all of the anthraquinone compounds.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Ethyltetrahydroanthraquinone has better solubility than ethylanthraquinone, and hence by increasing the ethyltetrahydroanthraquinone proportion, the mixing ratio of the ethylanthraquinone compounds relative to all of the anthraquinone compounds can be increased. However, reaction conditions for which only the ethyltetrahydroanthraquinone remains without being subjected to the regeneration are difficult, and hence the concentration of the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> tetrahydroanthraquinones overall increases, and thus accumulation of degraded matter originating from the tetrahydroanthraquinones and contamination of the produced hydrogen peroxide therewith occur.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Incidentally, ethylanthraquinone has smaller molecules than the other anthraquinone compounds, and thus is conjectured to more readily enter the pores in the catalyst, so that the hydrogenation reaction is fast. As a result, the hydrogenation reaction takes place preferentially, and hence the probability of being converted into ethyltetrahydroanthraquinone is high. However, the ethylanthraquinone also readily enters the pores of the regeneration catalyst, and hence the regeneration reaction is also fast. Looking overall, the ethyltetrahydroanthraquinone proportion thus fluctuates approximately proportionately with the total concentration of the tetrahydroanthraquinones.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Moreover, one other advantage of using a mixture with ethylanthraquinone is that the hydrogenation degree in the hydrogenation step can be reduced. <maths id="math0001" num="Equation (1)"><math display="block"><mi>Hydrogenation degree</mi><mspace width="1em"/><mfenced><mo>%</mo></mfenced><mo>=</mo><mi>hydroquinones</mi><mspace width="1em"/><mfenced separators=""><mo>:</mo><mspace width="1em"/><mi>amount of hydrogen peroxide obtained</mi><mspace width="1em"/><mfenced><mi>mol</mi></mfenced></mfenced><mo>/</mo><mi>quinones</mi><mspace width="1em"/><mfenced><mi>mol</mi></mfenced></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="165" he="15" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>

quinones (ethyltetrahydroanthraquinone, amyltetrahydroanthraquinone, ethylanthraquinone, amylanthraquinone, etc....)</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As described above, the anthraquinone solubility is limited by the density so as to determine the maximum amount dissolved, and ethylanthraquinone has a lower molecular weight than other anthraquinones, mainly amylanthraquinone in the present invention, and hence comparing at the same density, the maximum amount dissolved (: number of mols) can be increased. That is, the denominator in Equation (1) can be increased, and hence overall the hydrogenation degree can be reduced. It is well known that if the hydrogenation degree is high, then the tetrahydroanthraquinone selectivity worsens. In addition, the amount of organic compound impurities in the hydrogen peroxide produced also increases, and hence this is undesirable. The hydrogenation degree must thus be reduced as much as possible, and using a mixture with ethylanthraquinone compounds is preferable in this respect.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The hydroquinone solubility changes depending on the mixing ratio between tetrahydroanthrahydroquinones and anthrahydroquinones; if the concentration of the hydroquinones in the working solution is increased, then as well as the above hydrogenation degree, the concentration of partially liberated hydrogen peroxide becomes too high in the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> oxidation step, and hence a safety problem arises. A mixing ratio giving a preferable solubility is thus selected considering safety and economics. The ratio between the anthraquinones and the tetrahydroanthraquinones in the working solution used in the present invention is preferably adjusted to be from 2:1 to 8:1, more preferably from 3:1 1 to 6:1.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Reducing the energy consumption in the oxidation step through the present invention can be achieved by using predominantly anthrahydroquinones for which the oxidation proceeds readily in the reaction medium. The reaction temperature in the oxidation step is thus preferably made to be not more than 50 °C from the viewpoint of safety. A reaction temperature of from 35 to 45 °C is more preferable. In the case that the temperature exceeds 50 °C, depending on the solvent used this may be close to the flash point so that the risk of explosion is increased. Moreover, the reaction temperature becomes high, and hence production of oxidized impurities typified by tetrahydroanthraquinone epoxides in the oxidation reaction is promoted, which is undesirable. These oxidized impurities of course accumulate in the working solution, and moreover the amount of impurities contaminating the hydrogen peroxide produced increases, which is undesirable. There are no particular limitations on the pressure range in the oxidation step, but it is preferable to carry out the oxidation step in a range of from 0.01 to 1.0 MPa. From common sense, considering the load on the reaction apparatus and a compressor, carrying out the oxidation step at a lower pressure is more economical. There are also no particular limitations on the reaction apparatus in the oxidation step, it being possible to use an oxidation tower that is common knowledge in chemical engineering. For example, there are no particular limitations on whether counterflow oxidation or parallel flow oxidation is used, it being possible to use either utilizing the technical merits thereof.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">A solvent used for preparing the working solution in the present invention contains an aromatic hydrocarbon being a quinone solvent, and at least one selected from the group consisting of higher alcohols, alkyl phosphates, tetra-substituted urea compounds, cyclohexanol carboxylates, and cyclic urea compounds being a hydroquinone solvent. There are no particular limitations on the operating conditions in the reduction step in the present invention, but there can be preferably used a method in which the reduction is carried out using hydrogen or a hydrogen-containing gas in a pressure range of from 0.01 to 1.0 MPa and a temperature range of from 10 to 80 °C in the presence of a catalyst such as a palladium catalyst, a platinum catalyst or a nickel catalyst.

A mixed solvent of 60 vol% of pseudocumene and 40 vol% of diisobutylcarbinol was used as the solvent for the working solution. The flask, which could have the inside thereof perfectly sealed and was equipped with a magnetic induction type stirrer and a vacuum tap, was installed in an ordinary pressure hydrogenation reaction apparatus. With this apparatus, pressure fluctuations in the flask were detected through the water level, and hydrogen in an amount corresponding to the hydrogen absorption was supplied in from a measuring tube via a relay type electromagnetic valve. The hydrogen measuring tube comprised a buret portion and a water storage portion, water in the hydrogen measuring tube acting as a piston, so that the pressure in the flask was kept equal to atmospheric pressure. The amount of hydrogen absorbed was measured from the difference in liquid level in the hydrogen measuring tube. The flask was immersed in a water bath at 30 °C, and exhaustion of the inside of the flask and introduction of hydrogen were repeated three times. After 5 minutes, the stirrer was operated, whereby hydrogen absorption was commenced, and then the hydrogen absorption was measured from commencement up to after 30 minutes. This was converted into the amount of hydrogen absorbed at 0 °C and 1 atm. The amount of hydrogen absorbed was 131 Nml.

However, the effect was not very large for a proportion of EtAQ added of from 30 to 50 mol%. Moreover, at EtAQ = 100 mol%, the absorption amount decreased at the last moment of end of a measurement. This is because precipitation occurred due to the insufficient solubility of the ethylanthrahydroquinone, and hence the pores of the catalyst were clogged up, and thus the catalytic activity dropped.</p><heading id="h0013"><u>Example 3</u></heading><p id="p0040" num="0040">Using a hydrogen peroxide production apparatus having a hydrogenation step, an oxidation step, an extraction step and a regeneration step, a working solution was cycled around, and the composition of the hydrogen peroxide produced was investigated.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The hydrogen peroxide production apparatus was constituted as follows.
