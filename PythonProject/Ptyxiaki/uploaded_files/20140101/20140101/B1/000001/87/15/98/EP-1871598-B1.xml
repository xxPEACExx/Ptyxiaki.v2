Disclosures of such prior art are found in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4289405A"><text>U.S. Patent Nos: 4,289,405</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5163012A"><text>5,163,012</text></patcit>; and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5774225A"><text>5,774,225</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In those methods that utilize a color video camera, the camera is used as a light sensor with three wide-band light detectors, commonly referred to as Red, Green or Blue (RGB) with spectral sensitivities that peak in the "blue", "green" or "red" regions of the visible spectrum. The light sensor integrates or sums all of the light rays with wavelengths within its passband. The camera sensors are then used to approximate the responses of a Standard ISO Status Density, as defined in ISO 5/3. It is important to note that the spectral response of the three camera sensors only approximate the ISO Status Density spectral curves.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The densitometer or the camera measures "substrate relative" density. That is, the camera is first pointed to the unprinted substrate and the light projected onto the substrate. The projected light that is reflected from the substrate is collected by camera in each of its three sensors. Typical RGB camera signals are binary coded values with a range of 0 to 255 (8 bits). The camera is adjusted so that a perfect white object will read RGB values (255, 255, 255). The values are normalized so that the perfect white will have relative values of (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) as is disclosed in patents 5,724,259 and 5,767,980. The normalized values of the sensors are converted into density by computing the negative of the logarithm of the sensor value. Next, a printed area is move into the field of view of the camera and the light projected onto that area. The camera captures the light reflected from the printed area, comprised of the ink and the substrate. The camera readings are again converted to density. The previously computed substrate density is then subtracted from the ink-on-substrate density to leave only the density of the ink. The density of the ink is assumed to be proportional to the thickness of the ink layer.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Because of the differences between the camera sensors and an ISO Status Densitometer, it is not possible to simultaneously obtain colorant concentration and ink film thickness. On a commercial offset press the only parameter that is available to the pressman to control is the weight of ink applied to the substrate which modulates the ink film thickness. Accordingly, there is a need in the printing industry to have a press<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> inspection system that measures and tacks the color and the concentration of the inks as they are being printed. This object is achieved with the features of the claims.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description and appended claims.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows plots of the spectral K/S for a series of inks with varying amounts of pigments in the ink:</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A method has been discovered to measuring the reflectance of an ink film as printed on a printing press, and during the operation of that press with the intent of monitoring the ink concentration or the ink film thickness.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Accordingly, the camera sensor in the present invention is used as an absolute reflectometer. The camera is not standardized to the substrate but to an absolute white standard, as disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5821993A"><text>US Patent Nos. 5,821,993</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US6151064A"><text>6,151,064</text></patcit>. The measurements of the substrate, the ink on the substrate are all made on the same basis as readings made off-line on a spectrophotometer or spectrocolorimeter. Knowing the spectral response of the camera will allow the offline instrument to approximate the camera measurements on the off-line spectral instrument and provide absolute data to the camera about the color, film thickness and concentration dependence of the ink.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">When the press is operating, the camera may be used to capture the color of the press sheets during startup and compare them to the standard values computed<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> off-line. This greatly reduces the print "make-ready" time for the printer. Getting acceptable prints sooner results in lower waste amounts and in better utilization of the printing machinery.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Additionally the camera may be used to monitor the color of the printing through out the run by comparing the current printed image to the laboratory colors or to the colors in the first acceptable image. If the color begins to drift, the data supplied by the camera may be used to adjust either the ink film thickness (also known as the film weight) or the concentration of base color in the ink well using the process described below.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In offset lithography, the inks are very thick pastes, loaded with as much pigment as modern chemical engineering can allow. The paste is mixed with water, either from a press fountain or at the ink factory in the form of pre-emulsified ink. The only operational controls on the press, known as "keys" control the amount of ink transferred from the roller train to the plate and from the plate to the blanket and from the blanket to the substrate. Since the ink does not evaporate, the weight of film on the substrate can be determined indirectly by weighing the rollers before and after printing. The difference in weight represents the amount of ink transferred. The film weight or thickness is historically controlled, offline by status densitometry.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In direct gravure printing or flexographic printing, the inks are thin liquids and the amount of ink<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> transferred is controlled by the size and shape of the impressions in the gravure cylinder or anilox cylinder. The film thickness is quite difficult or nearly impossible to assess, even offline. Because the inks are thin liquids, held in simple wells, it is possible to adjust the amount of base ink relative to the printing solvent and thus adjust the concentration of the pigment in the ink transferred to the substrate.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">One well known method for computing the optical properties of a thin, transparent, pigmented coating in the laboratory uses the model of turbid media developed by Kubelka and Munk in the 1940s. In this model the coating is assumed to be transparent and absorbing of light and the substrate is assumed to be opaque and scattering of light. The ratio of absorption (K) to scattering (S) is derived from the reflectance (ρ) of the transparent coatings over the opaque substrate as shown in equation 1: <maths id="math0001" num="(1)"><math display="block"><mfrac><mi>K</mi><mi>S</mi></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><msup><mfenced separators=""><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>ρ</mi></mfenced><mn>2</mn></msup><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>ρ</mi></mrow></mfrac></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="51" he="12" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">This derivation assumed that the light was taken in small increments of energy or wavelength bands, such as found in monochromatic light.

In the application of this model to color<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> formulation in the laboratory, it has been assumed that the ratio of absorption to scattering (K/S) is modulated by both the concentration (c) of the absorbing species and the thickness (t) of the coating such that the total K/S is proportional to a value, k/s which is the relative (relative to the scattering of the substrate) unit absorption coefficient, a predetermined measurement of the pre-printed ink per unit concentration per unit thickness as shown in equation 2: <maths id="math0002" num="(2)"><math display="block"><mfrac><mi>K</mi><mi>S</mi></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mi>k</mi><mi>s</mi></mfrac><mo>×</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>t</mi></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="47" he="11" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Using this formalism, it is possible to substitute a camera response (R, G, or B) or a CIE colorimetric response (X, Y, or Z), obtained by linear transformation from RGB for the value of ρ in equation 1 thus yielding an equation that can be used to control either the film thickness (t) or the concentration (c) using readings captured by the camera on-line over a printing press. <maths id="math0003" num="(3)"><math display="block"><mtable><mtr><mtd><msub><mfenced open="[" close="]"><mfrac><mi>K</mi><mi>S</mi></mfrac></mfenced><mi>R</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><msup><mfenced separators=""><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>R</mi></mfenced><mn>2</mn></msup><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>R</mi></mrow></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><msub><mfenced open="[" close="]"><mfrac><mi>K</mi><mi>S</mi></mfrac></mfenced><mi>G</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><msup><mfenced separators=""><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>G</mi></mfenced><mn>2</mn></msup><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>G</mi></mrow></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><msub><mfenced open="[" close="]"><mfrac><mi>K</mi><mi>S</mi></mfrac></mfenced><mi>B</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><msup><mfenced separators=""><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>B</mi></mfenced><mn>2</mn></msup><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math><img id="ib0003" file="imgb0003.tif" wi="57" he="55" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In Table 1, an abridged table of camera spectral response functions for a typical RGB video camera is given.
