load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0002">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to an ink jet recording method and an ink jet recording device, and specifically relates to an ink jet recording method and an ink jet recording device favorably used for forming a high-quality image at high-speed.</p><heading id="h0003">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">An ink jet method of ejecting ink in the form of liquid droplets from an ink ejector has been used in various kinds of printers for the reasons of being compact and less expensive, capable of forming an image without contacting a recording medium, or the like. Among these ink jet methods, there are a piezo ink jet method utilizing deformation of piezoelectric elements to eject ink and a thermal ink jet method utilizing boiling phenomenon of ink due to thermal energy to eject ink in droplets, which have the characteristics of high resolution and high-speed printability.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Improvements of speed and image quality have currently become important objectives, upon printing by ejecting ink droplets onto a plain paper sheet or a non-water absorbing recording medium made of plastics or the like with an ink jet printer.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Ink jet recording is a method of ejecting ink droplets according to image data to form a line or an image on a recording medium with the liquid droplets. However, there have been problems in practical use, particularly in the case of recording on the above described non-absorbing recording medium, e.g., bleeding of an image easily occurs, or mixing of adjacent ink droplets occurs on the recording medium to inhibit formation of a sharp image, when it takes time for the liquid droplets to dry or penetrate into the recording medium after being ejected. When the liquid droplets mix with each other, ejected adjacent liquid droplets coalesce with each other to shift from the positions at which they have landed, thereby causing unevenness in line width in a case of forming fine lines or unevenness in, color in a case of forming a colored area, or the like. Further, since the degree of occurrence of unevenness in line width or color unevenness in a colored area varies depending on ink absorption and wettability of the surface of the recording medium, there has also been a problem that different images are formed among various types of recording media, even though the same ink is used under the same ejection conditions.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As a method of suppressing image bleeding or nonuniformity of line width, there is a method of promoting fixation of liquid droplets. For example, there have been disclosed the methods of using inks of two-liquid type having reactivity and allowing them to react with each other on a recording medium to achieve a describing property with high definition, such as a method of recording with ink containing an anionic dye after application of a liquid containing a basic polymer (for example, refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP63060783A"><text>63-60783</text></patcit>), or a method of applying ink containing an anionic compound and a coloring material after application of a liquid composition containing a cationic substance (for example, refer to <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP8174997A"><text>JP-A No. 8-174997</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">An ink jet recording method has also been proposed in which an ultraviolet-curable ink is used as the ink, and the ejected ink dots on a recording medium are irradiated with an ultraviolet ray in conformity with the timing of ejection, then the dots are pre-cured to be thickened to such an extent that the adjacent dots do not mix with each other, and thereafter the dots are further irradiated with an ultraviolet ray to complete curing (for example, refer to <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2004042548A"><text>JP-A No. 2004-42548</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Further, a method has been proposed that improves visibility or bleeding of color ink and the problem such as variation in the obtained images formed on different types of recording media, by applying a radiation curable white ink to form a uniform undercoating layer onto a transparent or a semi-transparent non-absorbing recording medium, then curing or thickening the layer by irradiating with a radiation ray, thereafter recording with a radiation curable color ink (for example, refer to <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2003145745A"><text>JP-A No. 2003-145745</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2004042525A"><text>JP-A No. 2004-42525</text></patcit>). There has also been proposed a method in which a substantially transparent active ray-curable ink is applied onto a recording medium in place of the radiation curable white ink by an ink jet head (for example, refer to <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP2005096254A"><text>JP-A No. 2005-96254</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, in the method described in <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="JP2004042548A"><text>JP-A No. 2004-42548</text></patcit>, although blurring can be suppressed, there still remains the problem of variation in images among various types of recording media, and thus the problem of unevenness in line width, color or the like due to mixing of ink droplets are not sufficiently solved. This problem of unevenness in line width, color or the like due to mixing of ink droplets are also not sufficiently solved by any of the methods described in <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="JP2003145745A"><text>JP-A No. 2003-145745</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="JP2004042525A"><text>JP-A No. 2004-42525</text></patcit>.

Therefore, image bleeding or unevenness in line width of fine lines may easily occur, thereby impairing formation of an image having high sharpness. However, in the ink jet recording method of the invention, an undercoating liquid is applied onto a recording medium and half-cured, and even when ink droplets are applied so as to partly overlap each other onto the half-cured undercoating liquid, image bleeding or unevenness in line width of fine lines can be effectively prevented by the interaction between the undercoating liquid and the ink droplets.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Therefore, the ink jet recording method of the invention enables formation of sharp lines with uniform width and recording of an ink jet image with high image density, i.e., a reverse character, with favorable reproducibility of fine images such as fine lines.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The ink jet recording method of the invention is particularly effective, for example, in the case of recording an image onto a non-permeable or slow permeable recording medium having low liquid absorption.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the invention, the description "adjacent ink droplets" refers to the liquid droplets<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> ejected from an ink ejecting port with an ink of a single color so as to have an overlapping portion, or the liquid droplets ejected from an ink ejecting port with inks of different colors to have an overlapping portion. The adjacent ink droplets may be the liquid droplets that are ejected at the same time, or may be composed of the preceding liquid droplets and the following liquid droplets where the former are ejected prior to the ejection of the latter.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the invention, at least one kind of ink and at least one kind of undercoating liquid are used as the liquids for formation of an image. The undercoating liquid preferably has a different composition from that of the ink. The undercoating liquid is preferably applied onto the region that is equal to, or larger than, the region on which an image is formed by ejecting ink droplets onto a recording medium.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Further, the ink in the invention is preferably used as inks of plural colors in a multicolor ink set. In the case of using the multicolor ink set, it is preferable that after each ejection of the ink of each color, half-curing is further performed.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">One of the specific configurations of the ink jet recording method of the invention includes the steps of applying, onto a recording medium, an undercoating liquid containing a polymerizable or crosslinkable material in advance in the region that is equal to, or larger than, the region on which an image is formed with ink; applying an energy ray or heat to the undercoating liquid applied onto the recording medium; and ejecting the ink droplets of plural colors on the side of the recording medium onto which the undercoating liquid has been applied, after half-curing the undercoating liquid by the active energy ray or heat, wherein the ink droplets contain a polymerizable or crosslinkable material for formation of the image and have a different composition from that of the undercoating liquid.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the above method, it is preferable to provide a step of fixing the recorded image by applying energy, after the undercoating liquid has been applied and at least all of the inks of plural colors have been ejected, from the viewpoint of achieving excellent fixing properties. By applying energy, curing reaction caused by polymerization or crosslinking of the polymerizable or crosslinkable material contained in the undercoating liquid or the ink is promoted, thereby enabling formation of a tougher image with more efficiency. For example, in a system containing a polymerization initiator, generation of active species is promoted due to decomposition of the polymerization initiator by applying of active energy such as an active energy ray or heat, and the curing reaction, which is due to polymerization or crosslinking of the polymerizable or crosslinkable material caused by the active species, is promoted by the increase in the amount of the active species or the increase in temperature.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Application of energy can favorably be performed by irradiation with an active<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> energy ray or heating. As the active energy, similar ones to the later discussed active lights for image fixation can be used, such as ultraviolet rays, visible rays, a rays, γ rays, X rays and electron beams, wherein ultraviolet rays and visible rays are preferable and ultraviolet rays are particularly preferable, from the viewpoint of cost and safety.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Further, the heating can be performed using a non-contact type heating device, and preferable ones include a heating device in which the recording medium passes through, such as an oven, or a heating device in which exposure is performed over the whole area with light in the range of ultraviolet light-visible light-infrared light, or the like. Examples of the preferable light sources for use in exposure as a heating device include a metal halide lamp, xenon lamp, tungsten lamp, carbon arc lamp and a mercury lamp.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">When the energy is applied by irradiation with active light, the amount of the energy required for curing reaction varies depending on the type or content of the polymerization initiator, but is generally preferably from about 100 to about 10000 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>.

In the Comparative Examples, the line quality was deteriorated, and the area of the void part was decreased in case of a pattern in which a fine non-image area is formed in a wide area such as a reversal character. In the case of curing the undercoating liquid completely, the undercoating liquid became just like plastics and the dot shape could not be maintained and a bleeding was caused, the uniform line width was not obtained, stickiness and scratch resistance were inferior, and the advantages of using two types of liquids could not be achieved.</p><p id="p0302" num="0302">The value of the ratio [A (after polymerization) / A (before polymerization)] in the Examples were in the range of from 0.3 to 0.7, respectively, by which the state of being half-cured was determined (the quantitative accuracy is presumed to be about ± 20% considering the unevenness in application or stability of the light source).</p><p id="p0303" num="0303">In the image parts obtained in Examples, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>, a part of the cured material of ink liquid was exposed and a part thereof was submerged in the undercoating liquid layer.

In the recording medium having the surface onto which an ink wets well, there is a tendency that the interdroplet interference is suppressed whereas the bleeding is worsened; On the other hand, in the recording medium having the surface onto which an ink hardly wets, there is a tendency that the bleeding is suppressed wherein the interdroplet interference is worsened. Therefore, the interdroplet interference and the bleeding are in such a trading-off relationship that the image quality varies depending on the types of the recording medium, and both of them cannot be satisfied at the same time.</p><p id="p0311" num="0311">The triangle-shaped plot indicates a result of the case that the undercoating liquid was applied and the exposure was not performed (equivalent to the comparative example shown in Table 1), and both of the interdroplet interference and the bleeding are not achieved at the same time.</p><p id="p0312" num="0312">The square-shaped plot indicates a result of performing half-curing of the undercoating liquid in the invention, where the bleeding can be suppressed without generating the interdroplet interference.</p><p id="p0313" num="0313">In this system, it is presumed that such an effect is achieved because the curing is hard to proceed on the oxygen-rich surface since a radical monomer as a curing component contained in the undercoating liquid is prevented from polymerizing under the existence of oxygen when the light irradiation is performed on the undercoating liquid, and a low intensity light from the light source for half-curing only causes the half-curing of the undercoating liquid. On the other hand, the oxygen-rich surface of the undercoating layer is also cured by the final curing light source having high light intensity. However, the above mechanism does not limit the invention. The same action also works in a case of the ink, and both of the interdroplet interference and the bleeding of an ink ejected onto another ink that has been ejected in advance can be prevented at a high level. In the case of recording an image on a<!-- EPO <DP n="73"> --> non-absorbing recording medium having uneven surface such as Yupo paper, when the undercoating liquid was applied, and the exposure was not performed (corresponding to the Comparative Example shown in Table 1), unevenness in the medium tone was observed due to the change in the thickness of the undercoating liquid layer due to the unevenness in the surface thereof. When the half-curing of the undercoating liquid according to the invention is performed, unevenness was not observed at all and a high quality image having a uniform medium tone was obtained.</p><heading id="h0064">(Example 2)</heading><p id="p0314" num="0314">The liquids I-1 to 1-4 and the undercoating liquid was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1, and the image recording and the evaluation of the character quality of the reversal characters were performed, except that the liquids I-1 to I-4 and DPGDA (manufactured by Akcros Chemicals Ltd.) used for the preparation of the undercoating liquid used in Example 1 were changed to the same mass of an organic high boiling point solvent S-15 as shown below.
