in meetings of congresses, conferences, etc., incorporating equipment which allows developing, in a practical manner, all the necessary activities for the intervention of the users from the armchairs themselves.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">This armchair object of the invention comprises a structural assembly incorporating a backrest that can be lowered over the seat, a column being linked to the rear part of a side, on which column there is incorporated a table board in an articulated assembly, which table board can swivel between a horizontal position for use and a vertical folded position behind the backrest.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The table board is attached to an actuation mechanism formed by a series of articulated connecting rods, there being provided a shock absorbing cylinder that can determine two stable provisional positions on both sides of a rotation point on which the articulation of the mechanism is established by means of a common shaft with the rotating assembly of the backrest.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In this manner, the swiveling movement of the table board is linked to the swiveling movement of the backrest, such that when the backrest is lowered over the seat, the table board rises to the horizontal position behind the armchair and when the backrest rises to the position for use, the table board is lowered to the vertical folded position.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The table board is incorporated in a sliding assembly on the support for the attachment to the articulated assembly, being able to slide backwards in the position for use, so as to be in a more comfortable location for the user from a rear armchair, incorporating a retaining shock absorbing device maintaining the stability of the placement.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">This arrangement allows the board to be moved forwards by a simple push, determining an antipanic quality because the user only has to push the board to clear the space in front of his/her seat armchair in order to leave without obstructions.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The column bearing the table board is assembled on the structure of the armchair by means of a ball joint anchor, by means of which the column can be positioned so that the board is horizontal in the position for use, independently of the seating of the armchair on the floor.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The mentioned column bearing the table board can be substituted by others of a different height, which allows adapting the height of the table board to the location of the rear armchairs in distributions on stepped floors.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The incorporation of the table board on the bearing column can be established either centered or moved towards a side, allowing the incorporation of the armchair both in distributions of rows with the armchairs correspondingly aligned one behind the other, or in distributions of rows with the armchairs in a staggered formation.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A wiring installation with electrical, computer connection elements etc. is incorporated in the armchair, being able to incorporate an individual

arrangement by means of the movement of the table board.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The armchair of the invention thus has features providing it with its own identity and a preferred character with

conference halls or similar applications, including an equipment allowing the users to carry out all the necessary actions for the participation in this type of activities.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The armchair consists of a general structure (1), in which a seat (2) and a backrest (3) are arranged, the latter being in a rotating assembly on a shaft (4), with the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> possibility of swiveling between the normal raised position and a lowered position over the seat (2).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A column (5) is further incorporated in the rear part of one of the sides, a table board (6) being assembled on the upper end of said column, which table board can swivel between a vertical lowered folded position behind the armrest (3), as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, and a horizontal cantilevered position for use, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The board (6) is assembled on a support (7) rotating with respect to an articulation point (8) for the swiveling, said support (7) being attached to a set of articulated connecting rods (9) moving in a rotating manner in attachment with the shaft (4) for swiveling the backrest (3).</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In this manner, the swiveling movement of the board (6) is associated to the swiveling movement of the backrest (3), by means of the set of connecting rods (9), with such a relationship that when the backrest (3) is raised, the board (6) is lowered to the vertical folded position (<figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>) and on the contrary, when the backrest (3) is lowered, the board (6) is raised to the horizontal position for use (<figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>).</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The set of connecting rods (9) is further attached to a shock absorbing cylinder (10) by means of a rocker (11), therefore the movement in the change from one position to another is absorbed, preventing the abruptness, insofar as the cylinder (10) also establishes a retention for the stable provisional maintenance in the two functional movement positions when its articulation with the rocker (11) surpasses the location of the rotating shaft (4) towards either side.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A plate (12) is arranged behind the backrest (12), which plate is a base for supporting objects such as briefcases, books, etc thereupon when the backrest (3) is located in the lowered position over the seat (2).</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As observed in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 4 and 5</figref>, the board (6) is attached to the assembly support (7) by means of guides (13), allowing the movement of said board (6) in a forward and<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> backward longitudinal direction in the cantilevered position, as observed in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 6A to 6C</figref>, such that the position that is moved backwards facilitates its use by a user from a rear armchair, whereas the possibility of forward movement confers an antipanic quality, because only a small push in this direction is required to withdraw the board (6), leaving the space in front of the rear armchair free, therefore the user who is seated in said rear armchair can get up and leave without any difficulties.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Said sliding movement of the board (6) on the guides (13) has a retaining device formed by a lever (14) and a pushing cylinder (15), between which a sliding support is determined against the structure supporting the board (6), as observed in <figref idrefs="f0004">figures 4 and 5</figref>, therefore the sliding of the board (6) occurs with a smooth movement and stable maintenance in the end positions.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The column (5) bearing the board (6) is attached on the structure (1) of the armchair by means of a ball joint fastening (16) which allows adapting the position of the column (5) such that the board (6) is horizontal in the folded position for use, independently of the seating of the armchair on the floor.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As observed in <figref idrefs="f0007">figures 8 and 9</figref>, the column (5) can further be of different heights, its substitution being possible in order to adapt the height of the board (6) to the location of a rear armchair in distributions of armchairs on stepped floors (17) as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">figure 7</figref>.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Figures 12 and 13</figref>, the fastening of the board (6) on the bearing column (5) can be in a position that is moved towards a side, the board (6) can therefore be centered with respect to the corresponding armchair for the distribution of armchairs in rows with the respective armchairs aligned one behind the other, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">figure 10</figref>.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0011">Figures 14 and 15</figref>, said fastening of the board (6) on the bearing column (5) can also be in a centered<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> position, the board (6) is therefore moved towards the side with respect to the corresponding armchair in a suitable manner for the distribution of armchairs in rows with the respective armchairs in a staggered formation, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 11</figref>.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The armchair can be equipped (<figref idrefs="f0012">Figure 16</figref>) with an acoustic communication system by means of microphones (18) and with an installation provided with connection bases (19) for electrical, computer connections etc., an individual lighting system can also be included, the wiring (20) of said systems being incorporated inside the sides (21) of the armchair which are prepared for that purpose, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0013">Figure 17</figref>.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The installations of the mentioned equipment systems of the armchair are provided with automatic disconnection means according to the position of the board (6), for example by means of contacts (22) which are closed when said board (6) is located in the position for use and which open disconnecting the systems when said board (6) is moved from the position for use, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">figures 4 and 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The board (6) incorporates a leather upholstery (23) or the like in the face intended to remain upwards, which confers the surface of said board (6) with a suitable quality for the use as a table and particularly for writing on documents or sheets of paper using it as a support.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56979410" lang="DE"
