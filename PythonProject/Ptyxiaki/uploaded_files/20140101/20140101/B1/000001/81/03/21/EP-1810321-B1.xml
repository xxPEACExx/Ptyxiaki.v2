mxw-id="PDES63957376" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>Technical Field</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a polishing apparatus and a polishing method, and more particularly to a polishing apparatus and a polishing method to polish a substrate such as a semiconductor wafer by a polishing tape.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background Art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Heretofore, a polishing tape having abrasive particles has been employed to polish a notch portion formed in a semiconductor wafer. Specifically, a polishing tape is brought into contact with a notch portion of a semiconductor wafer and moved in a direction perpendicular to a surface of the wafer to polish the notch portion of the wafer.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In this conventional method, a polishing tape is deformed along a notch portion of a wafer under a polishing load. Edge portions of the polishing tape may scratch the notch portion of the wafer according to polishing conditions. Accordingly, a wafer may be flawed or unevenly polished at the notch portion according to polishing conditions. Further, if the polishing tape is insufficiently deformed, an area of the polishing tape contacting the wafer is reduced so that it is difficult to conduct stable polishing. In this case, it is difficult to achieve uniform polishing. Additionally, it is uneconomic in that the entire surface of the polishing tape is not used for polishing. Further, if an area of the polishing tape contacting the wafer is small when a curved surface is polished, the wafer needs to be divided into several small areas, which are sequentially polished. Accordingly, it takes much time to complete the polishing process.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Thus, if polishing conditions are improperly set when the notch portion of the wafer is polished, there arise problems such as scratches on the wafer by the edge portions of the polishing tape or unevenly polishing. In order to overcome such problems, a polishing tape may be thinned so as to accord with a shape of the notch portion. However, when a polishing tape is thinned, resistance to tension is reduced. Thus, the polishing tape has a limitation of the thinness.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2002098787A1"><text>US 2002/098787 A1</text></patcit> discloses a polishing apparatus and method as per the preamble of claims 1, 2, 9 and 10, having a feed reel for feeding a polishing tape wound thereon and having a polishing surface, a take-up reel for reeling up the polishing tape from the feed reel, a presser for pressing the polishing tape between the feed reel and the take-up reel against a surface, to be polished, of a workpiece, and a motor for rotating the take-up reed. The feed reel, the take-up reel, the presser are housed in a cartridge, which is detachably held by a cartridge holder.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In accordance with the present invention, a polishing apparatus as set forth in claim 1 and a polishing apparatus as set forth in claim 2 are provided. Further, a polishing method as claimed in claims 9 and 10 is provided. Preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the dependent claims.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><b>Disclosure of Invention</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention has been made in view of the above drawbacks. It is, therefore, a first object of the present invention to provide a polishing apparatus and a polishing method which can uniformly polish a notch portion or the like of a substrate such as a semiconductor wafer at a high speed without scratches on the substrate due to polishing by a polishing tape.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a polishing apparatus as per claims 1 or 2, which can achieve uniform and high-speed polishing without scratches on a substrate due to polishing. The polishing apparatus has a polishing tape, a supply reel for supplying the polishing tape to a contact portion at which the polishing tape is brought into contact with a portion of a substrate to be polished, and a take-up reel for winding up the polishing tape from the contact portion. The polishing apparatus also has a first guide portion having a guide surface for guiding the polishing tape from the supply reel to supply the polishing tape directly to the contact portion, a second guide portion having a guide surface for guiding the polishing tape supplied directly from the contact portion to supply the polishing tape to the take-up reel, and a drive mechanism configured to move the polishing tape and the substrate relative to each other. At least one of the guide surface of the first guide portion and the guide surface of the second guide portion has a shape corresponding to a shape of the portion of the substrate to be polished.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a polishing method as per claims 9 or 10, which can achieve uniform and high-speed polishing without scratches on a substrate due to polishing. According to this polishing method, a polishing tape is supplied to a guide surface of a first guide portion. The polishing tape is supplied from the guide surface of the first guide portion directly to a contact portion at which the polishing tape is brought into contact with a portion of a substrate to be polished. The polishing tape is supplied from the contact portion directly to a guide surface of a second guide portion. A portion of the polishing tape is deformed so as to correspond to a shape of the portion of the substrate to be polished by at least one of the guide surface of the first guide portion and the guide surface of the second guide portion. The portion of the substrate to be polished and the polishing tape are moved relative to each other to polish the portion of the substrate.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Specifically, when a polishing tape is brought into contact with a portion of a semiconductor substrate to be polished, and the substrate and the polishing tape are moved relative to each other to polish the portion of the substrate, a portion of the polishing tape is deformed so as to correspond to a shape of the portion of the substrate to be polished. For example, a portion of a polishing tape is brought into contact with a notch portion formed at a peripheral portion of a semiconductor substrate, and the polishing tape is moved in a direction perpendicular to a surface of the substrate to polish the notch portion. At that time, a portion of the polishing tape is deformed in a width direction of the polishing tape so as to correspond to a shape of the notch portion.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the present invention, a polishing tape is deformed so as to correspond to a shape of a portion such as a notch portion of a semiconductor substrate before the portion of the semiconductor substrate is polished. Therefore, the polishing tape becomes likely to be brought into uniform contact with the entire portion of the substrate to be polished. Accordingly, the substrate becomes unlikely to be scratched due to polishing. Thus, uniform and high-speed polishing can be achieved.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The above and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following

Accordingly, the polishing tape 21 is curved near the second guide portion 25 into an arcuate shape having a small curvature along the guide surface of the second guide portion 25 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 23C</figref>.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Thus, the polishing tape 21 between the first guide portion 124 and the second guide portion 25 is deformed from an arcuate shape 21 d having a large curvature to an arcuate shape 21f having a small curvature. The polishing tape 21 at the contact portion contacting the wafer 10 has an intermediate shape 21e between the arcuate shape 21d and the arcuate shape 21f as shown in <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 23B</figref>.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Forces to widen the polishing tape 21 from the arcuate shape 21d to the arcuate shape 21f are applied to the intermediate shape 21e. Accordingly, when the polishing tape 21 is pressed against the notch portion 11 of the semiconductor wafer 10, end portions of the polishing tape 21 in the width direction reliably accord with the notch portion 11. Therefore, even if the shape of the notch portion 11 in the wafer 10 has a variation, the polishing tape 21 can reliably accord with the shape of the notch portion 11.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">As described above, this variation 20b can achieve the similar effects to the aforementioned first variation 20a. In this example, curvatures of the guide surfaces of the first guide portion and the second guide portion are adjusted to adjust a curvature of the polishing tape at the contact portion to a desired value. Thus, the polishing tape 21 can reliably accord with the shape of the notch portion 11. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 22</figref>, the first guide portion 124 may be<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> exchanged with the second guide portion 25.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060"><figref idrefs="f0020">FIG. 24</figref> is a side cross-sectional view showing a third variation 20c of the polishing mechanism 20. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0020">FIG. 24</figref>, the polishing mechanism 20c has a third guide portion 224 and a fourth guide portion 225 in addition to the first guide portion 24 and the second guide portion 25 shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. The third guide portion 224 is disposed upstream of the first guide portion 24 and has a guide surface for guiding the polishing tape 21 from the supply reel 22 to supply the polishing tape 21 directly to the first guide portion 24. Further, the fourth guide portion 225 is disposed downstream of the second guide portion 25 and has a guide surface for guiding the polishing tape 21 supplied directly from the second guide portion 25 to supply the polishing tape 21 to the take-up reel 23.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">When the polishing tape 21 is fed only with the first guide portion 24 and the second guide portion 25 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the polishing tape 21 may slide from a central portion of the guide surface to a portion near either flange according to progress of the polishing process because the guide surfaces of the first guide portion 24 and the second guide portion 25 are curved.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">The third guide portion 224 and the fourth guide portion 225 shown in <figref idrefs="f0020">FIG. 24</figref> serve to prevent the polishing tape 21 from sliding on the guide surfaces of the first guide portion 24 and the second guide portion 25. The guide surfaces of the third guide portion 224 and the fourth guide portion 225 are substantially flat in a cross-section perpendicular to a feed direction of the polishing tape 21. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0020">FIG. 24</figref>, when the polishing tape 21 is not brought into contact with the wafer 10, a direction in which the polishing tape 21 is supplied from the guide surface of the third guide portion 224 to the guide surface of the first guide portion 24 is substantially the same as a direction in which the polishing tape 21 is supplied from the guide surface of the first guide portion 24 to the guide surface of the second guide portion 25. Similarly, when the polishing tape 21 is not brought into contact with the wafer 10, a direction in which the polishing tape 21 is supplied from the guide surface of the first guide portion 24 to the guide surface of the second guide portion 25 is substantially the same as a direction in which the polishing tape 21 is supplied from the guide surface of the second guide portion 25 to the guide surface of the fourth guide portion 225. When the third guide portion 224 and the fourth guide portion 225 are thus arranged, the polishing tape 21 is prevented from sliding<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> on the guide surfaces of the first guide portion 24 and the second guide portion 25.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">When the wafer 10 is separated from the polishing mechanism 20c as shown in <figref idrefs="f0020">FIG. 24</figref>, the first guide portion 24 and the second guide portion 25 are brought into slight contact with the polishing tape 21 at tips of the guide surfaces thereof. When the wafer 10 is pressed against the polishing tape 21 (or the polishing tape 21 is pressed against the wafer 10) as shown in <figref idrefs="f0021">FIG. 25</figref>, the polishing tape 21 is curved in the width direction by the guide surfaces of the first guide portion 24 and the second guide portion 25. The polishing tape 21 is supported upstream of the first guide portion 24 by the substantially flat guide surface of the third guide portion 224 and supported downstream of the second guide portion 25 by the substantially flat guide surface of the fourth guide portion 225. Accordingly, the polishing tape 21 is prevented from sliding on the guide surfaces of the first guide portion 24 and the second guide portion 25.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In this polishing mechanism 20c, the guide surfaces of the first guide portion 24 and the second guide portion 25 may have the same curvature or may have different curvatures to cope with a variation of the notch shape.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">The present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiments.
