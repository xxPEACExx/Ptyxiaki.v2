In rewritable optical discs such as WORM, CD-R, DVD-R, and the like, laser beam is collimated onto a quite small area in an optical recording layer to perform recording through changing the properties of the optical recoding layer at the area, and playing-back is performed based on the difference between the amount of light reflected in the recorded area and that in an unrecorded area.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Currently, in the above-mentioned optical disc, the wavelength of semiconductor laser used for recording and playing-back is 750 to 830 nm for CD-R, or 620 to 690 nm for DVD-R. However, for further increasing the capacity, there is examined an optical disc to which a laser having a shorter wavelength is applied; for example an optical disc to which light in 380 to 420 nm is applied for recording.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For an optical recording layer in such an optical recording medium for<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> short-wavelength light, an indole derivative has been examined as an optical recording material.
