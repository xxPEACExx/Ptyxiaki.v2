The sides of both the upper and lower cups typically comprise fingers that support a fruit so that it can be squeezed without bursting. The fingers of the upper cup interdigitate or intermesh with those of the lower cup.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">An orange or other fruit can be fed, for example, to the bottom cup by a cam-operated feeding device. The upper and lower cups are then brought together so that the respective fingers of the cup intermesh and the fruit therebetween is accordingly squeezed. Sharp, typically circular, cutters are positioned in the top and bottom cups. As the cups move relative to one another, the fruit is pressed against the cutters. The cutters cut plugs from both the top and bottom portions of the fruit as the interdigitating fingers of the two cups mesh together.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The cutting of the plug from the top portion of the fruit promotes separation of the peel from the internal portions of the fruit (i.e., juice and pulp). The plug cut from the lower portion of the fruit allows the internal portions of the fruit to be forced down into a strainer tube, positioned just below the lower cup cutter. The strainer tube, in turn, is positioned within a manifold.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Such whole fruit juice extraction is disclosed in commonly assigned <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5970861A"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 5,970,861</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5992311A"><text>5,992,311</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5996485A"><text>5,996,485</text></patcit>; and <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6568319A"><text>6,568,319</text></patcit>, for example. Moreover, various fruit feeding arrangements have been developed for juice extractors. For example, <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US3040864A"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 3,040,864</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US3367473A"><text>3,367,473</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US3499519A"><text>3,499,519</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US4309944A"><text>4,309,944</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US4343393A"><text>4,343,393</text></patcit> disclose such fruit feeding arrangements.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A typical fruit feeder includes a drive shaft, a plurality of fruit feed members for feeding fruit to the juice extracting positions based upon rotation of the drive shaft, and a drive motor. A rotatable drive hub is rotatably carried by the drive shaft and connected to the drive motor, a further hub is fixed to the drive shaft adjacent the rotatable drive hub, and a shear pin extends between the rotatable drive hub and the further hub. The shear pin may couple the rotatable drive hub and the further hub together during normal operation, and shear to decouple the rotatable drive hub from the further hub when the fruit feed members become jammed.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Unfortunately, a typical juice processing plant may have banks of extractors attended by relatively few operators. Accordingly, a feeder may become jammed and the shear pin may fail, incapacitating extraction until an operator discovers the incapacitated extractor and replaces the shear pin. This may cause an undesirable loss in productivity.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">In view of the foregoing background, it is therefore an object of the invention to provide a juice extractor to notify an operator of a fruit feeder jam.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">This and other objects, features and advantages in accordance with the present invention are provided by a fruit feeder for a juice extractor comprising a plurality of juice extracting positions, the fruit feeder being as defined in claim 1. More particularly, the load sensitive coupler may comprise a rotatable drive hub rotatably carried by the drive shaft and connected to the drive motor, a further hub fixed to the drive shaft adjacent the rotatable drive hub, and a shear pin extending between the rotatable drive hub and the further hub. The shear pin may couple the rotatable drive hub and the further hub together during normal operation and shear to decouple the rotatable drive hub from the further hub when the fruit feed members become jammed.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">For example, the decoupling detector may comprise a proximity sensor. In addition, the fruit feeder may include at least one proximity sensor trigger rotatably carried by the drive shaft, and the proximity sensor may be positioned adjacent a path of the at least one proximity sensor trigger. Each fruit feed member may include a finger shaft, a plurality of fruit flipper<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> fingers carried by the finger shaft, and a drive cam connected between the drive shaft and the finger shaft. The fruit feeder may further comprise a cam mounting hub enclosing the drive cams. In this embodiment, the at least one proximity sensor trigger may be carried by the cam mounting hub.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The at least one proximity sensor trigger may comprise at least one ferrous fastener, and the proximity sensor may comprise a magnetic proximity sensor. In other embodiments, the decoupling detector may comprise an optical sensor, an electric field sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, and/or an infrared sensor.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">An extraction drive may be connected to the plurality of juice extraction positions. The decoupling detector may shut-down the extraction drive a predetermined time after detecting decoupling. Alternately or additionally, the decoupling detector may operate an indicator based upon detecting decoupling.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The invention also extends to a juice extractor comprising a plurality of juice extracting positions and a fruit feeder as just described, for feeding fruit thereto; and also to a method of producing juice by means of such a juice extractor, as defined in claim 12.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>Brief Description of the Drawings</b></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description of the invention which follows, when considered in light of the accompanying drawings in which:

The illustrated embodiments also provide a fruit guide assembly including a hollow fruit guide body forming a multi-lane feeder table, also known as a feed hopper, which receives fruit from the feed belt adjacent the extractor line and delivers fruit to a multi-position fruit feeder. The illustrated embodiments facilitate faster changing of the fruit guide body forming a feeder table, a feed hopper, and eliminate the requirement to remove the vibrator with the feeder table. The fruit guide body bolts to a separate support frame and is easily removable. The vibrator can be removable from the top as an additional service and safety feature. The illustrated embodiments also eliminate the deadhead previously used with a feeder table.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">A multi-position fruit feeder as shown uses a proximity switch to detect movement of a load sensitive coupler that incorporates a shear pin. If the shear pin breaks, the load sensitive coupler no longer rotates and the proximity sensor detects this change. This is advantageous over other prior art juice extractors, which continued running when foreign material jammed the fruit feeder, breaking the shear pin. The proximity sensor can be attached to a timer. When the juice extractor is in operation, the sensor detects movement and produces respective ON/OFF pulses. If, after a predetermined period of time, the pulses are no longer detected, for example, when the shear pin is broken, the juice extractor will automatically shut down.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The juice extractor also advantageously incorporates a return cam, typically formed as a mathematical conjugate of the extractor cup drive cam to hold the cam followers to the cam and lift the cup support member, i.e., cup beam, during the juice extraction cycle. A counterweight can be mounted to the main drive gear located within the gearbox, or<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> mounted on the camshaft that supports the drive cam and return cam. The counterweight provides balance to the machine during extractor operation.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The juice extractor of the illustrated embodiment also has inner side panels that define a medial product material area, i.e., a juice and peel area, where the fixed and moveable extractor cups are located, and opposing drive mechanism cavities located between the inner side panels and outer covers of the extractor frame. Peel, of course, includes pulp, seeds, membranes, and core materials. Drive linkages such as a pull-rod assembly, are positioned in each drive mechanism cavity and operatively connect the orifice beam with the orifice beam drive cam mounted on the camshaft. A tapered water spray nozzle can be mounted flush on the inner side panels to spray cleaning fluid to aid in cleaning. To enhance cleaning of the juice extractor, the illustrated embodiment includes a cup bridge formed integral with the juice manifold. Juice piping extends from the juice outlet at the side and exits through the side of the juice extractor, thus eliminating a current piping arrangement where "bullhorn" pipes extend out the front or rear and allow debris build-up. The integrated cup bridge and juice manifold typically has juice outlets at the side juxtaposed to the inner wall panels, which allows the juice piping to exit the sides.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The strainer tube is preferably bottom loaded, and includes an improved sealing assembly between the juice manifold and strainer tube. The cams are now preferably held by friction on the camshaft through an appropriate cup-drive, shaft-coupler frictionally securing the camshaft in the cam hub. Alignment of the cams can be arranged by positioning an alignment rod through holes placed in the cams during assembly.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The integrated cup bridge and juice manifold includes a number of pressure actuated spray nozzles, i.e., also referred to as pop-up nozzles, mounted on the integrated cup bridge and juice manifold (<figref idrefs="f0025 f0026 f0027 f0028 f0029 f0030">FIGS. 28-45</figref>). These pop-up nozzles can be used for both oil recovery and cleaning. In the illustrated embodiments, the ends of the orifice beam extend through each inner wall or "side" panel into the drive mechanism cavity where the orifice beam drive mechanism is located. This penetration through the inner wall panels is protected by a moving "window" between the ends of the orifice beam and the side wall panel and formed as a preferred labyrinth seal.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">It is clear that the present invention provides numerous advantages over the prior art juice extractors as will be explained in greater detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">For purposes of facilitating understanding of operation of the juice extractor of the present invention, a general description of the overall juice extraction process from fruit unloading to final processing and waste handling is described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is an environmental, partial isometric and sectional view of a portion of a single juice extractor unit, which would be positioned in a respective juice extractor machine 40 shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> and forming respective juice extractor positions where fruit is compressed and juice extracted. The description will proceed by first describing an overall flow of citrus fruit, followed by an explanation of various component parts of a juice extractor unit relative to the overall juice extractor machine, thus giving a general working background of juice extractor principles used in the present invention.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, fruit F can be unloaded by manual, hydraulic, or truck unloading. For example, fruit can be unloaded manually by workers handling many field boxes or cartons, which can be set on a dump ledge 20 for unloading into a hopper 22. Additionally, citrus fruit could be dumped into the hopper 22 by means of an automatic hydraulic dump 23. A large load carrying citrus fruit F, such as oranges, could also arrive by truck, which would dump the fruit into the hopper 22, which includes a vertical conveyor belt 24 that carries fruit F on the necessary conveyors to a brush washer 26. Typically, the conveyor belt 24 has about three inch (76 mm) cleats to elevate fruit to the brush washer 26, as known to those skilled in the art. As the fruit is unloaded, the fruit enters a washer and passes under spray nozzles 28, where fruit cleaners can be applied.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The fruit, as it is washed, passes over a series of brushes in the brush washer 26, where the fruit is gently scrubbed to remove field oils, soil, mold and dust. The brush washer 26 discharges the fruit onto a roller grader 30 where workers can easily select the fruit. Typically, the roller grader 30 is formed such that workers can stand on either side and remove any broken pieces, leaves and other undesirable materials from the flow of fruit<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> supply. It is at this point that some foreign material can still pass through the roller grader. Foreign material, such as milkweed pods, is one example that workers often miss. These milkweed pods are indigenous to citrus growing areas and can cause problems during the juice extraction process. The juice extractor is preferably designed to shut down when the orifice tube becomes lodged within the strainer tube, such as by foreign material, and it allows the juice extractor to shut down operation if a milkweed pod or other similar foreign material becomes stuck in the orifice tube.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The fruit discharges from the roller grader into a cleated belt conveyor 32 that elevates the fruit typically by three inch (76mm) cleats to the tilted feed belt conveyor 34, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. If two or more juice extractors are placed in tandem as illustrated, a sizing roller 36 provides a single, continuously rotating roller on the tilted feed belt conveyor 34 to separate the fruit into sizes equivalent to the size range of the moveable and fixed extractor cups to ensure maximum yield and quality. For example, as illustrated with the three juice extractors 40, one juice extractor can be used for one range of fruit size, and the other two juice extractors can be used for respective two other ranges of fruit sizes.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, each juice extractor 40 includes individual juice extractor units 50 (illustrated as five units) that are ganged together in a common extractor frame 52 forming a juice extractor machine 40. The juice extractor unit 50 defines respective juice extractor positions where an individual fruit is received on a fixed extractor cup and compressed or squeezed by a respective moveable extractor cup. The fixed and moveable extractor cups can be horizontally aligned or aligned vertically as explained with reference to the drawings. With vertically aligned extractor cups as illustrated, the fixed extractor cup is typically a lower extractor cup and the moveable extractor cup is typically an upper extractor cup.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The fruit is moved to the feed hoppers 46, i.e., multi-lane feeder table 46 of the juice extractors 40 by a feed belt conveyor 34 that is designed at an angle of about 18° with the low side adjacent to the feeder table 46. The feeder table 46 is formed as a fruit guide assembly that guides fruit from the fruit conveyor to a multi-position fruit feeder as will be explained in detail below. Any fruit that passes by the feeder table is recirculated through a<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> fruit handling system by a return fruit conveyor 48. This fruit could be transferred back to the fruit handling system prior to washing.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The fruit enters the juice extractor feed table 46 and is fed into the fixed, e.g., lower extractor cup 54 by fruit flipper fingers (not shown) operable as part of the multi-position fruit feeder. As will be explained later in detail, the fruit is separated into three primary product streams, a pulpy juice, the peel, and the fruit material that enters an orifice tube 56 (<figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>). The waste peel is directed onto a peel screw 58 located under the juice extractor platform 60 and is discharged into a discharge hopper 62 or other waste disposal container, or it can be conveyed through an exterior wall to a truck or trailer, or to further processing.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Typically, the juice extractors 40 are supported on an elevated platform 60 not only to provide support for the juice extractors, but also to provide access for mechanical operation and maintenance. The juice from the various juice extractors 40 enters a stainless steel discharge header 64 extending from each juice extractor and is gravity fed into a surge tank 66 that is designed to maintain a constant flow of juice, preferably to an optional finisher 68. The finisher further removes pulp from the juice by using stainless steel screens with small perforations. A finisher 68 typically is used when a number of juice extractors are placed in tandem, as illustrated.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The juice can be pumped from the surge tank 66 or finisher 68. The juice extraction process shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref> is illustrative of a small juice extraction facility. Larger juice extraction facilities are similar in process, but are larger in scale and may include additional equipment known to those skilled in the art. Additional equipment (not shown) may include bucket elevators for lifting and conveying fruit; fruit storage bins for temporary storage of unloaded fruit; sizing equipment for sorting fruit based on size; byproduct recovery systems such as pulpwash systems, and oil recovery systems; feedmills for drying of peel waste; and pasteurizers and evaporators for the processing of juice. These and other equipment are known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, a portion of a basic juice extractor unit 50 defining a juice extracting position of a juice extractor is illustrated. A moveable extractor cup 80 is mounted on a<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> common cross bar, i.e., a cup support member, also referred to as the cup beam 82 in the illustrated embodiment. The cup beam 82 interconnects other moveable extractor cups as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. The cup beam 82 reciprocates by a cam drive (not shown) contained in an upper portion of a juice extractor in this non- limiting embodiment. The fixed extractor cups 54, e.g., lower extractor cups in the illustrated embodiment, are rigidly positioned relative to the extractor frame 52 and mounted on a cup bridge. The moveable and fixed extractor cups 80, 54 are formed as interdigitated extractor cups that have fingers 84 that intermesh together when the moveable extractor cup 80 engages fixed extractor cup 54.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The moveable and fixed extractor cups 80, 54 and their associated components, such as the prefinisher strainer tube 86, the orifice tube 56, and associated cup bridge, form one juice extractor unit 50. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, a number of juice extractor units are ganged together in one juice extractor machine 40 to increase production. The illustrated juice extractor machine 40 includes five juice extractor units 50 positioned at respective juice extracting positions. The fruit feeder, which will be explained in greater detail below, also can work as a cam-operated device, and includes feeding fingers (not shown in this figure), which deposit a single fruit in the fixed extractor cup 54, such as by tossing the fruit into the extractor cup after receiving the fruit from the feeder table formed as a fruit guide assembly.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The cam-operated drive system in the upper part of the juice extractor forces the moveable extractor cup 80 into the fixed extractor cup and as this occurs, the fruit F is pressed against a circular cutter 90 located at the top of the prefinishing strainer tube 86. This cutter 90 cuts a plug in the bottom of the fruit to allow the internal portions of the fruit access to the strainer tube 86. Another cutter 92 also cuts a plug in the top of the fruit to permit separation of the peel from the internal portions of the fruit, such as the pulp. As the fingers 84 of the extractor cups 54, 80 interdigitate or mesh together, the inner portion of the fruit, such as the pulpy juice, is forced down into the strainer tube 86 contained within the juice manifold 94. The peel surfaces do not contact the juice and any contamination by the extractives in the peel is minimized. The peel falls away outside the juice manifold 94 and can be collected by the peel screw conveyor 58 under the extractor platform 60 and discharged into the hopper 62 or other waste disposal container and conveyed through an exterior wall to a truck or trailer or to further processing.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The continuing stroke of the moveable extractor cup 80 and the presence of a restrictor, for example, in the form of blockages, force the juice-bearing portion of the fruit through the perforated wall of the strainer tube. This perforated wall is formed by small strainer tube holes 98, which allow discharge of juice into the juice manifold 94.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Back pressure is preferably applied into the orifice tube, for example, by a hydraulic device as described in <patcit id="pcit0027" dnum="US5992311A"><text>U.S. 5,992,311</text></patcit> or by limiting the size of the restrictor. The orifice tube reciprocates within the strainer tube to compress any entrapped fruit particles and force any remaining juice through the perforated wall of the strainer tube. Core material, such as section membrane and seeds, are ejected typically from the lower portion of the orifice tube during reciprocating movement of that tube. This cycle of extraction is then complete.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Additionally, the amount of juice yield and the type of juice can be varied by using different strainer tubes with different size holes 98. Additionally, the back pressure can be changed to vary the juice yield and type of juice. Peel oil, such as liberated by the shredding action of the moveable and fixed cups' fingers, typically can be washed by water sprays around the extraction cups.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0006">6</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">7</figref>, there are illustrated different views of the juice extractor 100, including a respective front perspective view (<figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>), a rear perspective view from a first angle (<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>), an enlarged rear perspective view from a second angle (<figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>), and a rear perspective view with outer covers removed (<figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>).

A load sensitive coupler 206 couples a drive motor, for example, the electric drive motor 118 via the feeder mechanism drive 112, to the drive shaft 202 during normal operation, and decouples the drive motor from the drive shaft 202 when the fruit feed members 204 become jammed.

A shear pin 214 extends between the rotatable drive hub 210 and the further hub 212 to couple the rotatable drive hub 210 and the further hub 212 together during normal operation, and to shear and decouple the rotatable drive hub 210 from the further hub 212 when the fruit feed members 204 become jammed. This decoupling detector 208 is preferably a proximity sensor. Also, at least one proximity sensor trigger 216 is rotatably carried by the drive shaft 202. When the proximity sensor is positioned adjacent a path of the at least one proximity sensor trigger 216, a pulse is preferably generated. For example, the proximity sensor trigger could be at least one ferrous fastener, for example, screws that act as the trigger. The proximity sensor can also be connected to a timer. When the juice extractor is running, the proximity sensor detects the movement of the trigger and produces on/off pulses.

The cam assembly comprises a drive cam connected between the drive shaft 202 and each finger shaft 220, and a cam mounting hub enclosing the drive cams. The proximity sensor trigger 216 may be carried by the cam mounting hub.

The cam follower train 234 includes appropriate support frame members 236 that are secured to the extractor frame 52 and guide rods 238. A cam follower mechanism 240 is slidable on the guide rods 238 and secured to the cup beam or other cup support member.
