load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method of producing liquid koji having enhanced activities of plant fiber degradation enzymes such as cellulolytic enzymes and xylanolytic enzymes, and uses of the liquid koji obtained by the method.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">As for koji used in production of alcoholic beverages, there are solid koji, which is cultured such that spores of filamentous fungi are inoculated to raw material which has been treated with cooking and the like, and liquid koji, which is cultured such that liquid medium is prepared by adding raw material and other nutrient sources to water, and then spores of koji molds or pre-cultured mycelia of koji molds and the like are inoculated thereto.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the conventional production of fermented foods and drinks such as alcoholic beverages including, for example, sake, shochu, soy sauce, fermented soybean paste, sweet sake and the like, what is called solid koji which is prepared with the solid culture method has been widely used. The solid culture<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> method is the culture method in which spores of koji molds such as <i>Aspergillus kawachii, Aspergillus awamori</i>, <i>Aspergillus niger</i>, <i>Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus sojae</i> and the like are dispersed on solid raw material such as steam-cooked cereals to allow koji molds to grow on the solid surface.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For instance, for the production of shochu, the solid koji such as <i>Aspergillus kawachii</i> and <i>Aspergillus awamori</i> have been widely used. However, as the solid culture method is a culture system in which raw materials and koji molds disperse unevenly, it is difficult to make even the factors such as temperature, water content, and various nutrient compositions, and the solid culture method is very complicated in culture control. In addition, the production of koji is often conducted under open conditions, and cares are required in terms of quality control so as to prevent contamination with other bacteria. Therefore, the solid culture method is unsuitable for large-scale production.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In contrast, the liquid culture method is easy to culture control and quality control, so it is suitable for efficient production. However, due to the reason that, for example, enzymatic activity is insufficient for brewing shochu, the culture product obtained by liquid culturing koji molds is rarely used as shochu koji.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In addition to the above-mentioned reasons, a major<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> reason of the culture product obtained with the liquid culture method not being used for producing fermented foods and drinks such as shochu is that the behavior of koji molds to produce enzymes such as amylase and cellulase in the liquid culture is known to be much different from that in the solid culture, and productivity thereof is also known to be poor overall (see Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In production of the alcoholic beverages such as shochu, alcohol is usually generated by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. Therefore, saccharolytic enzymes from koji molds, which affect supplying glucose to the koji molds, particularly glucoamylase and acid-stable α-amylase are key enzymes in the alcoholic fermentation. However, it is known that activity of glucoamylase is remarkably low in the culture product obtained with the liquid culture method and production behavior thereof is also much different from that in the solid culture (see Non-Patent Documents 3 to 6).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">As a method of improving glucoamylase activity of koji molds, there are reported the method of culturing koji molds while giving stresses on the growth of mycelia (see Patent Document 1) and the method of adding roasted cereals to koji mold culture fluid (see Patent Document 2). The method disclosed in Patent Document 1 conducts culture on porous membrane or in inclusive immobilization agent having air gaps to allow<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> expression of the novel gene glaB that encodes glucoamylase, to thereby enhance enzymatic activity. Accordingly, the method requires strict control or specific culture devices, and thus it is not practical. The method disclosed in Patent Document 2 cultures koji molds in liquid medium using roasted cereals as, at least, a portion of the raw material, which requires an additional production step of roasting cereals.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The inventors of the present invention provided an invention related to a method of culturing koj i molds using liquid medium containing the saccharides which the koji molds hardly decompose (see Patent Document 3). By liquid culturing koj i molds with the invention, a koji mold culture product having high activity of glycolytic enzymes such as glucoamylase, which can be used for producing fermented foods and drinks such as sake, can be obtained conveniently and inexpensively.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">On the other hand, recently, the molecular biological analysis on acid-stable α-amylase has been conducted to the details (see Non-Patent Document 7). The analysis has reported as follows: A white koj i mold has two different amylase genes which are respectively responsible for two different characteristics, that is, acid-unstable α-amylase and acid-stable α-amylase. The expression behaviors of the respective genes are much different from each other. In liquid culturing, the acid-unstable α-amylase is sufficiently produced,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> while the acid-stable α-amylase, a key enzyme for brewing shochu is hardly produced.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">For producing shochu, brewing is conducted under low-pH environments for preventing the shochu mash from putrefaction. The acid-unstable α-amylase contributes very little to glycolysis in shochu brewing because it is deactivated precisely under low-pH conditions. Therefore, it is indispensable for producing shochu that the acid-stable α-amylase is produced with high yield, which is thought to contribute to the glycolysis in shochu brewing, by liquid culturing koji molds.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The production behavior of acid stable α-amylase in liquid culturing koji molds has been investigated in detail and reported. However, the method uses synthetic medium containing peptone and citrate buffer solution, and requires an culture time of 100 hours or more, so it would be difficult to apply to actual shochu brewing (see Non-Patent Documents 8 to 10).</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The inventors of the present invention have already developed a method of producing liquid koji sufficiently having enzymatic activities of glucoamylase and acid-stable α-amylase which are necessary for producing shochu, which involves culturing white koji molds and/or black koji molds in liquid medium containing the cereal of which surface is covered with husks as culture raw material to generate and accumulate<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> simultaneously glucoamylase and acid-stable α-amylase in the culture product. The inventors have succeeded in producing shochu using the liquid koji for the first time (see, for example, the specification of Japanese Patent Application No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004350661A"><text>2004-350661</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Meanwhile, there has been conducted investigation on plant fiber degradation enzymes produced with koji in order to additionally improve productivity of sake and shochu. It has been reported that utilization ratio of the raw material of sake mash is improved when plant fiber degradation enzymes such as a cellulolytic enzyme, a xylanolytic enzyme, and a pectolytic enzyme are employed in production of sake (see, Non-patent Documents 11 and 12).<br/>
It has been also reported that alcohol yield in shochu is improved by creating the recombinant shochu koji molds to which the cellulolytic enzyme gene of Trichoderma viride is introduced and producing shochu with the recombinant shochu koji molds (see Non-patent Document 13).</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As described above, it is widely known that improvement in productivity of the plant fiber degradation enzymes to be used in production of sake or shochu is extremely important for promoting efficiency in production of fermented foods and drinks such as sake or shochu.<br/>
However, employing the expensive plant fiber degradation<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> enzyme preparation in production of sake may increase cost, and is not preferable.<br/>
In addition, using the recombinant shochu koji mold would let the consumer worries about safety, and is also not preferable.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">By the way, ethanol as industrial alcohol is used as raw material for producing foods and drinks such as sweet sake, vinegar and the like, or as raw material for producing industrial chemicals such as flavor, detergent and the like. Further, the ethanol is expected recently to serve as novel energy source which is alternative to a fossil fuel such as petroleum. For instance, investigations and developments of an alcohol fuel such as E3 gasoline which is obtained by mixing gasoline with 3% of ethanol are promoted.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">When the industrial alcohol is produced by fermentation method using cereals or tubers as raw material, an enzyme preparation (liquefying enzymes or saccharolytic enzymes) needs to be used for high enzymatic activities (see, for example, Non-patent Document 14).<br/>
It has been reported that glucoamylase and acid-stable α-amylase can be produced simultaneously using submerged culture of Aspergillus kawachii NBRC4308 (see Non-patent Document 15).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">However, use of the enzyme preparation causes a problem that, in addition to high cost, mashing can not be conducted at high concentration. The mash produced with an enzyme preparation generally has an alcohol content of about 8%. Thus, mashing at higher concentration has been expected for improving productivity.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> -->There may be suggested to use solid koj i in which koj i molds are grown on the surface of cereals or beans, instead of the enzyme preparation. However, the solid koji is not suitable for large-scale production because it has to be produced in a specific culture mode, that is, solid culture.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">On the other hand, liquid koji in which koji molds are cultured in liquid medium is able to control culture easily, so that it is suitable for efficient production.<br/>
However, it is known to persons skilled in the art that liquid koji does not provide enzymatic activities required for the alcohol fermentation sufficiently, so there has been no examples where liquid koji is used in actual production.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><ul><li>Non-patent Document 1: <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Iwashita K. et al: Biosci.

A first aspect of the present invention relates to a method of producing liquid koji having enhanced activity of a cellulolytic enzyme and xylanolytic enzyme.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In the first aspect of the present invention, there is used a liquid medium containing barley, naked barley or wheat the surface of which is entirely covered with husks. Therefore, it takes much time for saccharification of starches in the cereals, the rate of releasing saccharides into culture system is suppressed, and enzymatic activity of liquid koji is enhanced.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In the first aspect of the present invention, the cereal to be used as culture raw material of liquid koji is barley, naked barley, or wheat. The raw materials need to have the form of which surface is entirely covered with husks. There can be used an unpolished stuff or that having equal to or more of the<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> polishing ratio at which it has been polished so that husks are at least remained on the surface of kernels, and crude rice, crude barley, and the like also can be used.<br/>
When the cereal is barley, there can be used the unpolished stuff having a polishing ratio of 100%, or provided that the polishing ratio of the unpolished stuff is defined as 100%, the stuff having a polishing ratio not less than the value determined by subtracting the husk ratio of barley (generally 7 to 8%) from the polishing ratio of the unpolished stuff (100%), i.e., about 92% to 93%.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Here, the term "polishing ratio" refers to the remained ratio of cereals after the cereals are polished. For instance, the term "polishing ratio of 90%" means that 10% of the husks or the like on the surface layer portion of cereals is shaved away. In the present invention, the term "crude barley" comprises those from unpolished barley to polished barley having husks remained on kernels' surface, that is, the stuff having polishing ratio of 90% or more. In addition, the term "husk" refers to the outside part that covers the surface of a cereal particle.<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">"Amaranthus" is a generic term of plants belonging to the genus Amaranthus of the family Amaranthaceae. Among cereals, amaranthus has high protein content and the content of lysine, which is one of amino acids, is nearly equal to that in soybean. Besides, amaranthus is a highly nutritious cereal containing large amounts of calcium, iron, and fibers when compared to polished rice. The countries of origin are specific areas of South/Central American countries, India, Himalayas, and Nepal. On the other hand, quinoa is an annual herb of Agatha family, which is mainly cultivated in highlands such as the Andes located in the southern part of Peru and the western part of Bolivia. Quinoa is rich in minerals, vitamins, proteins, and dietary fibers.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The above-mentioned culture raw materials are used alone, or two or more of them are used in combination for preparing the following liquid medium.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> -->That is, the culture raw materials are mixed with water to prepare a liquid medium.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In the present invention, it is necessary to control amount of the culture raw material to be used in the liquid medium.<br/>
In general, plant fiber degradation enzymes such as a cellulolytic enzyme (cellulase) and a xylanolytic enzyme (xylanase) are enhanced when amount of the culture raw material is slightly fewer than that preferable for that glucoamylase and acid-stable α-amylase are generated and accumulated in a balanced manner.<br/>
The amount of the culture raw material to be used in the liquid medium is within a range in which glucoamylase and acid-stable α-amylase are selectively generated and accumulated during the koji molds are cultured and, at the same time, the plant fiber degradation enzymes such as the cellulolytic enzyme (cellulase) and the xylanolytic enzyme are enhanced.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> -->When the culture condition is at 37°C for 42 hours, liquid medium is prepared by adding 1.4 to 1.8% (w/vol) or preferably 1.4 to 1.7% (w/vol) of the barley or naked barley to water. The same is applied to the case where unpolished barley or naked barley is used and the case where 95%-polished barley or naked barley is used as raw material.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The amounts of the culture raw materials to be used<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> for the blending may appropriately be selected because the optimal amounts vary dependent on the kinds of the culture raw materials to be used, the polishing degrees of the culture raw materials, and the like.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">When koji molds are cultured in the liquid medium to which the culture raw material is added in an amount within the above-mentioned range, there can be produced liquid koji which has enzymatic activity (glucoamylase activity and acid-stable α-amylase activity) sufficient to be used for producing fermented foods and drinks such as shochu and, at the same time, has enhanced activity of plant fiber degradation enzymes such as a cellulolytic enzyme (cellulase) and a xylanolytic enzyme (xylanase).</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">When the amount of the culture raw material to be used exceeds the upper limit, the liquid koji having enhanced activity of plant fiber degradation enzymes such as a cellulolytic enzyme (cellulase) and a xylanolytic enzyme (xylanase) can not be obtained. Further, viscosity of the culture liquid increases and supply of oxygen or air required for aerobically culturing koji molds becomes insufficient. That decreases oxygen content in the culture product, restricts culture progress, and is not preferred. On the other hand, when the amount of the raw material to be used is less than the lower limit, the intended enzymes can not be produced in high yields.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --></p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Starches included in the culture raw material may be preliminarily gelatinized before culturing. Gelatinizing starches may be conducted according, but not particularly limited, to any of the conventional methods comprising a steaming method, a roasting method and the like. In the step of sterilizing liquid medium as described later, when the starches are heated to the gelation temperature or higher by sterilization at high temperatures and high pressures, gelatinization of starches is simultaneously carried out by such the treatment.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In addition to the above-mentioned culture raw material, it is preferable that an organic substance, an inorganic salt, and the like be appropriately added as nutrient source to the liquid medium.<br/>
Those additives are not particularly limited as long as they are generally used for culturing koji molds. Examples of the organic substance comprise rice bran, wheat bran, corn steep liquor, soybean cake and defatted soybean. Examples of the inorganic salt include aqueous compounds such as an ammonium salt, a nitrate salt, a potassium salt, an acid phosphate salt, a calcium salt, and a magnesium salt. Two or more organic substances and/or inorganic salts may simultaneously be used. The addition amounts thereof are not particularly limited as long as growth of the koji molds is promoted. The addition amount of the organic substance is preferably about 0.1 to 5% (w/vol) and<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> the amount of the inorganic salt is preferably about 0.1 to 1% (w/vol).<br/>
The liquid medium of koji molds thus obtained may be subjected to sterilization treatment if necessary and the treatment procedures are not particularly limited. For example, it may be the high-temperature and high-pressure sterilization method carried out at a temperature of 121°C for 15 minutes.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The sterilized liquid medium is cooled down to a culture temperature, and then koji molds are inoculated to the liquid medium.<br/>
The koji molds to be used in the first aspect of the present invention are white or black koji molds capable of producing a glycolytic enzyme, preferably one capable of producing glucoamylase and acid-stable α-amylase. Examples thereof comprise Aspergillus kawachii, Aspergillus awamori and Aspergillus niger.<br/>
The white koji molds and the black koj i molds may be used alone, or two or more of them may be used in combination. It is preferable that the white koji molds and the black koji molds be used alone, or both of them be used in combination.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Those koji molds may be used for the single strain culture or for the mixed culture with two or more homologous or<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> heterogeneous strains. It is allowed to use either form of the spores or the mycelia obtained in pre-culture. However, the mycelia is preferably used because shorter times are required for the logarithmic growth phase. The amount of the koji molds to be inoculated into the liquid medium is not particularly limited, but the number of the spores may be in the range of about 1×10<sup>4</sup> to 1×10<sup>6</sup> per ml of the liquid medium. For the mycelia, about 0.1 to 10% of the pre-culture liquid is preferably inoculated.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The culture temperature of the koji molds is preferably 25 to 45°C, or more preferably 30 to 40°C, but not particularly limited as long as the growth is not adversely affected. If the culture temperature is low, it tends to be contaminated by infectious microbes as growth of the koji molds becomes slow. The culture time is preferably in the range of 24 to 72 hours.<br/>
The culture apparatus may be any of those capable of carrying out liquid culture. The koji molds have to be cultured aerobically. Thus, the culture should be conducted under aerobic conditions in which oxygen or air can be supplied into the medium. In addition, it is preferable to stir the medium so that the raw materials, oxygen, and the koji molds can be uniformly distributed in the apparatus during culture. The stirring conditions and the amount of aeration may be arbitrary as long as aerobic culture environment is maintained and thus may be<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> appropriately selected depending on the culture apparatus, the viscosity of the medium and the like.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">By culturing with the above-mentioned culture method, the enzymes such as glucoamylase and acid-stable α-amylase are simultaneously generated in a balanced manner, and at the same time, activity of plant fiber degradation enzymes such as a cellulolytic enzyme (cellulase) and a xylanolytic enzyme is enhanced in the liquid koji.<br/>
The liquid koji obtained in the present invention comprises a culture product itself, a culture liquid obtained from the culture product by centrifugal separation or the like, a concentrate or a dry product thereof, and the like.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">As described above, according to the above-mentioned culture method, the enzymes such as glucoamylase, acid-stable α-amylase, a cellulolytic enzyme, and a xylanolytic enzyme are highly produced.<br/>
Therefore, the method of producing enzymes described in the fourth aspect of the present invention is substantially the same as the method of producing liquid koji described above.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The liquid koji can be produced by the method according to the first aspect of the present invention. The liquid koji, which is obtained by the production method according<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> to the first aspect of the present invention, can be suitably used for producing fermented foods and drinks such as shochu, sake, soy sauce, miso and sweet sake, as described in the fifth aspect of the present invention.<br/>
The liquid koji may be used instead of the solid koji, for instance, in the case of producing shochu as described in the fifth aspect of the present invention, at the stage of mashing shochu mash; in the case of producing sake, at the stages of mashing yeast or sake mash; in the case of producing soy sauce, at the stage of piling; in the case of producing miso, at the stage of mashing; in the case of producing sweet sake, at the stage of mashing.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">When fermented foods and drinks are produced using the above-mentioned liquid koji, all steps may be carried out in liquid phase. A method of producing fermented foods and drinks in liquid phase through the whole steps, for instance, when shochu is produced, is that corn, wheat, rice, potato, sugar cane and the like are as raw material heated at about 80°C to liquefy by dissolving with a heat-resistant enzyme preparation, the above liquid koji and yeast are added thereto to allow the mash to alcohol ferment, and then it is distillated under normal pressure or reduced pressure and the like.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The liquid koji obtained by the method according to the first aspect of the present invention can be utilized for an<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> enzyme preparation, a pharmaceutical such as a digestive agent and the like because of high enzymatic activity thereof. In this case, the resultant koji mold culture product may be concentrated and purified to desired extent by conventional method, and an appropriate excipient, thickening agent, sweetener and the like are added thereto.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">According to the second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of producing a liquid koji dry product comprising, drying the liquid koji which is obtained as described above.<br/>
The preferred drying method comprises freeze drying, and, in particular, vacuum freeze-drying is more preferable because inactivation of an enzyme hardly occurs. The vacuum freeze-drying may be conducted according to conventional methods. Conditions for the vacuum freeze-drying are not particularly limited, but in general, pre-freezing may be conducted at a temperature of from -10 to -40°C for 1 to 6 hours and drying may then be conducted at 5 to 30°C for 10 to 30 hours at a degree of vacuum of 1 Torr or less, or preferably 0.7 Torr or less.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In this manner, an intended liquid koji dry product can be produced.<br/>
The liquid koj i dry product, which is obtained by the production method according to the second aspect of the present invention,<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> can suitably be used for producing fermented foods and drinks as described in the sixth aspect of the present invention.<br/>
The liquid koji dry product may be used instead of the solid koji or the liquid koji for instance, in the case of producing sake, at the stage of mashing yeast or sake mash; in the case of producing shochu, at the stage of mashing shochu mash; in the case of producing soy sauce, at the stage of piling; in the case of producing miso, at the stage of mashing; in the case of producing sweet sake, at the stage of mashing.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In the case where fermented foods and drinks are produced using the liquid koji dry product, there may be used liquid koji dry product an enzyme preparation without modification, the product obtained by mixing steamed barley, yeast cells and the liquid koji in advance and drying, or the preparation obtained by mixing the various dried raw materials. As described above, if the raw materials are integrated into a sort of kit, the kit would serve as a simple starter by which fermented foods and drinks such as shochu can be conducted with addition of water.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">When fermented foods and drinks are produced using the above-mentioned liquid koji dry product, all steps may be carried out in liquid phase. A method of producing fermented foods and drinks in liquid phase through the whole steps, for instance, when shochu is produced, is that corn, wheat, rice,<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> potato, sugar cane and the like are as raw material heated at about 80°C to liquefy by dissolving with a heat-resistant enzyme preparation, the above liquid koji and yeast are added thereto to allow the mash to alcohol ferment, then it is distillated under normal pressure or reduced pressure and the like.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The liquid koji obtained by the above-mentioned production method is used for producing ethanol by a fermentation method according to the ninth aspect of the present invention. In production of ethanol, industrial alcohol (ethanol) can be produced according to a known method of producing industrial alcohol (ethanol) except that the liquid koji is used instead of solid koji.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">An example of the method of producing ethanol by a fermentation method is represented hereinbelow.<br/>
The raw material to be used for producing ethanol may be starch-containing raw material, and examples thereof comprise cereals such as barley, naked barley, rice, wheat, buckwheat, barnyard millet, foxtail millet, millet, kaoliang and corn; and tubers such as sweet potato and cassava.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The production of ethanol by fermentation method can be conducted using a continuous steaming and boiling apparatus such as a low-temperature continuous steaming and boiling apparatus. First, yeast capable of producing ethanol such as shochu yeast, the above-mentioned raw materials and water are<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> added to the liquid koji to conduct mashing. Lactic acid may be used if necessary.<br/>
After the mashing, the mixture is steamed and boiled at low temperature and fermented at temperature of about 20 to 30°C, to thereby conduct secondary mashing after the primary mashing.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In the case of the ninth aspect of the present invention, although no enzyme preparation is used and only the liquid koji is used, mash obtained after completion of the fermentation has high alcohol content of 18 to 20%.<br/>
The mash obtained after completion of the fermentation can be distilled with a distillator such as a microdistillation apparatus, preferably a continuous distillator, to thereby remove impurities and concentrate the mash. As a result, industrial alcohol (ethanol) with high quality, having an alcohol concentration of 95% or more can be produced.<br/>
According to the ninth aspect of the present invention, the obtained mash already has high alcohol content of 18 to 20% after completion of the fermentation, resulting in effects such as scale reduction and energy saving.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail by way of examples.
