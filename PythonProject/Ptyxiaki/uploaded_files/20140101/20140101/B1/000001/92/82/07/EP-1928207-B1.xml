The invention is particularly useful for determining the position of a mobile point in a room.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The invention also relates to an apparatus for determining positions in a room, including a device for generating distributed sound waves according to the invention.</p><heading id="h0002">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">Sound waves can, for example, be generated by a point sound source or a plane sound source. A point sound source radiated sound waves uniformly in all directions. The sound will be spread out spherically. The effect, i.e. the sound pressure level, of the sound waves at a distance from the sound source will depend on the surface area of the sphere, the distance from the sound source and the frequency of the sound source. Due to difficulties in connection with increasing the surface area of the sound source, the effect of the sound waves at a large distance from a point sound source will be relatively low. With a large distance is meant in the order of 3-10 meter. However, some applications require sound waves of a high effect at a large distance from the sound source. In order to increase the area of a point<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> sound source, the mass of the emitter has to be increased. This will cause manufacturing problems. Another problem that will occur if the mass is increased is that the transient time for the emitter is increased.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A plane sound source, having a large area in relation to the wave length of the sound, generates sound waves having an essentially plane wave front, which means that the sound waves are distributed in mainly in one direction. For a plane sound source, the sound intensity level will be independent on the distance from the sound source assuming that there is no loss in acoustic energy. Thus, the effect at a point in room will only depend on the surface area of the sound source. An example of a plane sound source, having a large area in relation to the wavelength of the sound, is an electrostatic transducer. For example, a single-ended electrostatic transducer comprises two electrically conducting layers, also denoted diaphragms; a static diaphragm, and a movable diaphragm arranged movable relative to the static diaphragm. The electrostatic transducer further comprises a power supply applying a variable alternating electrical voltage across the static and movable diaphragm to initiate vibrations in the movable diaphragm due to variations of the electrostatic forces acting between the layers, thereby serving as a loudspeaker. Such an electrostatic transducer is, for example, disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US7095864B"><text>US7,095,864</text></patcit>. The effect at a point in room will depend on the surface area of the diaphragm, which is easily increased. Advantages with an electrostatic transducer, compared to a piezoelectric emitter, is that it is much faster and has a considerably larger frequencies range. As the electrostatic transducer is faster it also has a shorter transient time.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In some applications, it is a desire to be able to generate highly dispersed sound waves, dispersed over 140°, of a large sound pressure level, such as at least 0.2 Pa in each point within the measuring area, at a large distance from the sound source. An example of such an application is position-detecting systems<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> having an ultra sonic transmitter. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5280457A"><text>US5280457</text></patcit> discloses a system for determining the position of a mobile point of interest in a m dimensional coordinate system. The system comprises an ultrasonic transmitter mounted on the point of interest and a plurality of stationary ultrasonic receivers, the number being at least m + 2, and control means for processing the received signals and compute the location of the point of interest. A commonly used ultrasonic transmitter in such applications is a piezoelectric transmitter. A piezoelectric transmitter often sends at its resonant frequency. The dispersion angle for a piezoelectric transmitter, having a resonant frequency above 35kHz is at maximum 110°.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly, there is a desire to increase the dispersion angle of the electrostatic transducer. It is also a desired to have almost the same intensity is all directions within the dispersion angle. Many solutions to this problem have been proposed during the years. One solution is to provide the transducer with a curved diaphragm. Another solution is to use a cross-over network when designing a multi-speaker system. Line arrays of loudspeakers are often employed to provide increased directivity. Another solution is to use a striped panel loudspeaker. The panel loudspeaker consists of a plurality of individual sound radiating areas in the form of narrow stripes. Each stripe can be driven individually so that the panel radiation pattern can be modified and it can be used as a directivity-controlled sound source in audio applications. A series of electrode rings are fed with delay lines, so each ring responds to the change in current a split second after the previous ring, creating movement in the diaphragm identical to a ripple in the pond.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The trouble with the solutions presented up to now is that they have less dispersion in the vertical plane than in the horizontal plane and that they are not suitable for determining the position of a point in room since the location of the sound source is not well defined.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Thus, it is difficult at high frequencies to generate a sound signal having a high sound pressure level and large dispersion in the vertical plane as well as in the horizontal plane. Both the sound pressure level and the amount of the dispersion of the sound depend on the area of the sound source.</p><heading id="h0003">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">One object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for measuring positions in a three dimensional room capable of generating sound waves with a high sound pressure level at a large distance from the sound source and with a large dispersion in the vertical plane as well as in the horizontal plane.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">This object is achieved by an apparatus as defined in claim 1.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Such an apparatus comprises: a pointing device for pointing out the positions to be measured, a device for generating sound waves connected to the pointing device, at least three microphones for detecting the sound waves located at a distance from each other in the room, and a computation unit adapted to compute the time it takes for the sound waves to travel between the pointing device and the microphones and on bases thereof determining the position of the pointing device.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Such an apparatus comprises a scattering unit having a surface of a parabolic shape, whereby the sound-wave generator and the scattering unit are arranged such that the generated sound waves are reflected in said parabolic surface. The device further comprises an opening arranged such that the reflected sound waves are allowed to leave the device and be distributed to the surroundings. In order to achieve a high reflection and thereby low losses, the scattering unit should be made of a material having high acoustic impedance, which means that the speed of sound in the material should be large compared to the speed of sound in air. Examples of suitable materials are metals and dense wood.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The device according to the invention includes a separate sound wave generator and a separate scattering unit, which makes the sound pressure level and the dispersion almost independent of each other. The dispersion angle depends on the shape of the parabola, i.e. on parameters in the equation of the parabola, and the sound pressure level depends on the shape of the sound wave generator. Therefore it is possible to produce a device<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> having a high sound pressure level as well as a large dispersion angle.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Due to the parabolic surface, the sound waves are first converged towards the focus of the parabola and then diverged and distributed to the surroundings through the opening. Thus, the location of the sound source is the focus of the parabolic surface, which means that the location the sound source is well defined. Depending on the shape of the parabola, the dispersion angle can be up to 160 degrees, which is enough for many applications. The dispersion in the horizontal and vertical plane will be about the same.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The device is suitable for generating disperse sound waves of a frequency above 2kHz.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to the invention, the opening is arranged in the vicinity of the focus of the parabolic surface, the sound-wave generator is adapted to generate sound waves having an essentially plane wave front, and the sound-wave generator and the scattering unit are arranged such that the reflected sound waves are gathered at the focus of the parabolic surface before they are distributed to the surroundings. Although it is possible to use a sound-wave generator that generates sound waves having non-plane wave fronts, the resulting dispersion is far from optimal and will not be sufficient for all applications. Due to the fact that plane sound waves are gathered in the focus of the parabola before they are dispersed, a sound-wave generator that generates sound waves with plane wave fronts provides on optimal dispersion, and makes it easy to control the dispersion. With an optimal dispersion is meant an optimal dispersion angle as well as almost the same sound intensity level, in all directions within the dispersion angle.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Another advantage using a parabolic surface for dispersing the sound waves is that all the generated sound passes through a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> common point, i.e. the focus of the parabola, which means that the time it takes from the sound wave is generated until it reaches the focus is the same for the whole wave front. The whole wave front reaches the focus at the same time. This is important in applications in which the traveling times of the generated waves are measured, for example when a position in the room is measured by means of ultra sound.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to an embodiment of the invention, the sound-wave generator comprises: a static diaphragm, a movable diaphragm arranged movable relative to the static diaphragm, and a power supply applying a variable alternating electrical voltage across the static and movable diaphragm to initiate vibrations in the movable diaphragm due to variations of the electrostatic forces acting between the diaphragms, and the movable diaphragm is facing the parabolic surface. According to this embodiment, the sound-wave generator is an electrostatic transducer producing plane waves. Such an electrostatic sound-wave generator is easy to build with a large surface area, which means that it is possible to generate a large sound pressure level. Another advantage with this embodiment is that the mass of the diaphragm is small compared with, for example, a piezoelectric transmitter, which causes a short rise and fall time, which is important for position measurements.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to an embodiment of the invention, the sound-wave generator comprises a layer of an insulating material arranged on a surface of the static diaphragm, which surface is facing the movable diaphragm. In order to achieve as large sound pressure level as possible, the voltage between the static and movable diaphragm should be as close as possible to the electrical strength of the diaphragms. The insulating layer provides an improved electrical strength between the static and movable diaphragms and thereby makes it possible to increase the generated sound pressure level with about 10 times.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to an embodiment of the invention, the static diaphragm comprises a plurality of protrusions extending towards the movable diaphragm. The protrusions are distributed over the surface of the static diaphragm, which faces the movable diaphragm. Preferably, the protrusions are evenly distributed over the surface of the static diaphragm. If the electrical strength of the diaphragms is very high, there is a risk that the mechanical stress in the movable diaphragm becomes to high and the diaphragm is stretched and bent such that it will come into contact with the static membrane. If this happens the sound generator will stop functioning. By the introduction of protrusions on the surface of the static diaphragm, which faces the movable diaphragm, the bending of the diaphragm is reduced and with that the risk for contact between the movable and static diaphragm is reduced. Measurements have shown that it is possible to increase the sound pressure level about three times with a static diaphragm having protrusions.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to an embodiment of the invention, the opening is provided in the scattering unit. Thus, it is possible to utilize a larger area of the sound-wave generator and accordingly to increase the effect of the sound-wave generator. In order to provide a good dispersion, the focus of the parabolic surface preferably should be located at the opening or in front of the opening at the outside of the scattering unit.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to an embodiment of the invention, the scattering unit is truncated along a plane, which is parallel to the symmetric line of the parabolic surface and the opening is located the truncated part the scattering unit. For example, the scattering unit is shaped as a half parabola or less than a half parabola. This embodiment facilitates the manufacturing process.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to an embodiment of the invention, the sound-wave generator is adapted to produce ultra sound, i.e. sound-waves having a frequency between 20kHz and 70kHz.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">An industrial robot is programmed to carry out work along an operating path. In order to program or teach the robot the work, the robot is manipulated to positions along the desired operating path. These positions are stored as instructions in a memory in the control unit. To avoid the trouble to move the robot to the desired positions, the positions on the desired path can be measured with a position-measuring device. A device according to the invention is suitable for measuring positions in a room, and in particularly suitable for measuring the position of a point in a room in connection with programming of an industrial robot.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0026" num="0026">The invention will now be explained more closely by the description of different embodiments of the invention and with reference to the appended figures.

The device comprises a sound-wave generator 2 for producing and emitting sound waves. In this embodiment the sound-wave generator is an electrostatic transmitter. The device further comprises a scattering unit 3 having a surface 4 of a parabolic shape. The sound-wave generator 2 and the scattering unit 3 are arranged such that the generated sound waves are reflected in the parabolic surface 4 and gather at a focus 5 of the parabolic surface. In this embodiment, the sound-wave generator 2 is provided with<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> an opening 6 arranged such that reflected sound waves are allowed to leave the device and be distributed to the surroundings.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The shape of the parabolic surface is chosen such that its focus is located at or in the close vicinity of the opening 6. The sound-wave generator 2 is disc shaped and has a two-dimensional extension in a direction perpendicular to the symmetric axis of the parabolic surface. The sound wave generator is arranged opposite the parabolic surface of the scattering unit such that the generated sound waves are directed in parallel to the symmetric axis of the parabolic surface. In order to achieve as large high sound pressure level as possible, the area of the sound-wave generator shall be as large as possible. The sound-wave generator is adapted to generate sound-waves having an essentially plan wave front, which means that the waves produced over the entire area of the generator are essentially parallel, as shown in the figure. The scattering unit is cup-shaped. In this embodiment the dispersion angle α is about 160 degrees.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The scattering is controlled by the value of a parameter a in the equation of the parabola, which is the distance from the lowest part of the parabola to the focus of the parabola.

The metal is preferably nickel or stainless steel, and the metal layer on the plastic is, for example, aluminum or gold. The distance between the static and movable diaphragm is preferably as small as possible in order to achieve as large sound pressure level as possible.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Further, in order to achieve as large sound pressure level as possible, the voltage U<sub>B</sub> is to be close to the electrical strength limit for the material of the movable diaphragm. The isolating layer 25 considerably increases the electrical strength of the static diaphragm. However, if the strength is very large, there is a risk that the mechanical tension in the movable diaphragm becomes so large, when it is stretched, and bends so much that the movable diaphragm will come into contact with the static diaphragm. If this happens the sound wave generator will stop functioning. In order to avoid this problem, a plurality of protrusions 28 is provided on the surface of the static diaphragm 20, which surface faces the movable diaphragm. The protrusions 28 are arranged such that they are extending towards the movable diaphragm 21. The protrusions, arranged between the diaphragms limit the bending of the movable diaphragm and thereby reduce the risk for contact between the diaphragms.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The area of the protrusions should be minimized, to avoid reducing the effective sending area of the generator. One way to achieve a small area is to integrate the protrusions in the static diaphragm. The integration is, for example, made by an electrolytic process in which the areas, as well as the heights of the protrusions, are carefully controlled. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 6a</figref> shows the static diaphragm 20 seen from above. The height of the protrusion is between 100-300 µm, typically 200 µm. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 6b</figref> shows the movable diaphragm 21 resting on the protrusions 28 of the static<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> diaphragm 20, when a high potential U<sub>B</sub> + U<sub>C</sub> is applied between the diaphragms. When electric voltage is applied between the static and the movable diaphragm, the movable diaphragm is moved and an acoustic signal is emitted from the generator. The voltage U<sub>c</sub> is, for example, generated by a transformer.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The area of the sound-wave generator, i.e. the area of the static and movable diaphragm, and the location of the focus of the parabola determined the dispersion of the sound waves. The theoretical limit is 180 degrees, however in practice it is possible to achieve 160 degrees as a maximum. By choosing the shape of the parabola, and thereby the distance between the bottom part of the parabola and the focus, the dispersion of the sound can be chosen as large or small. The area of the sound-wave generator, i.e. the area of diaphragms, influences the dispersion such that if the area is smaller than the opening of the parabola, it is not possible to utilize all the possibilities of the parabola. In order to achieve a plane wave front of the sound, it is important that the area of the sound-wave generator is large in relation to the wavelength of the emitted sound wave. The parabola and the sound-wave generator will then function optimally and the dispersion of the sound, within reasonable limits, can be calculated.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 7</figref> shows the change of the potential U<sub>B</sub> + U<sub>C</sub> between the diaphragms 20, 21 and the sound-wave signal generated in response to the change in the applied voltage 31. The signal 30 is the electrical signal connected to the sound generator and the signal 31 is the acoustic signal detected by the microphone. As seen from the figure the response time is small which means that the response is fast and the sound generator can work with fast transients. In relation to most piece of electric sound generator, the building up process is very short. This means that the technique using burst measurements, which is often used by the electric sound generators used for measuring distances, is no longer needed. By utilizing the fastness of the sound generator<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> it is possible to use a first half period of the signal for measuring of distances. The technical possibilities will thereby be considerably increased. By means of integrated protrusions, the parabola and electrostatic sound generator it is possible to increase the accuracy and extend the measuring area position measurements.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 7</figref> shows an apparatus for measuring positions in a room according to an embodiment of the invention. The apparatus comprises a pointing device 35 including a tip for pointing out the positions to be measured, a device 1 according to the invention for generating sound-waves, which is connected to the pointing device, at least three microphones 37, 38, 39 for detecting the sound-waves located at a distance from each other in the room, and a computation unit 40 adapted to compute the time it takes for the sound-waves to travel from the pointing device 35 to the microphones, and on basis thereof determining the position of the tip of the pointing device. The apparatus further comprises a start signal generator 42, which generates a start signal for the measurement upon activation of a user. The start signal is transferred to the device 1 for generating sound waves and to the computation unit 40. The sound-wave generator generates ultra sound pulses.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The microphones are positioned in such a way that a three dimensional room is created. The microphones are, for example, of capacitor type. The area of a microphone of capacitor type is small in relation to conventional microphones. Preferably, the microphones are acoustically damped for frequencies below 40 kHz, and their upper frequency is above 100 kHz. The computation unit 40 receives signals from the microphones 37-39 and the start signal from the start signal generator 42. The computation unit 40 calculates the time difference between the start signal and the signals received by the microphones and based thereon calculates the position of the pointing device in the room.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The microphones are connected to the computation unit, which for example is a personal computer. The start signal is a synchronization signal, which is transferred to the computation unit, for example, via a cable or as a light signal. The synchronization signal is sent at the same time as a sound pulse is generated. By determining the time it takes for the sound pulse to reach each of the microphones, which registers the sound pulse, the position of the tip of the pointing device in the room can be determined in three dimensions. The position of the microphones in the room has to be known to make it possible to determine the position of the pointing device.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">According to an embodiment of the invention, the apparatus may include two or more devices for generating sound waves located at a distance from each other. By using two or more sound-wave generators it is possible to determine the direction of the pointing device, as well as the position of the tip of the pointing device. For example, the apparatus can be provided with three devices for generating sound-waves which are positioned in such a way that they create a coordinate system wherein the position for each of their devices are determined at the same time. This means that not only the position of the pointing device, but also the orientation of the pointing device can be determined. Such a device is, for example, useful during robot programming in order to determine the positions and orientations of a tool at points on a robot path.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 8</figref> shows a sound pulse 30 generated by the device 1 and the same sound pulse 31 detected by one of the microphones 37-39.
