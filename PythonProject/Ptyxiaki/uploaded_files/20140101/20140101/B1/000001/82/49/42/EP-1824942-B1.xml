imidazole derivatives having novel structures, and organic electronic device using the same.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">This application claims the benefit of the filing date of Korean Patent Application Nos. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="KR1020050066731"><text>10-2005-0066731, filed on 2005. 07. 22</text></patcit>, with the Korean Intellectual Property Office.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background Art</b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">As used herein, the term "organic electronic devices" refers to devices wherein charge exchange between electrodes and organic layers occurs using holes and/or electrons. The organic electronic devices can be broadly divided, according to the operating principle, into the following two groups. The first group includes electronic devices in which excitons are formed in an organic layer by photons from an external light source introduced into the devices, and are separated into electrons and holes, which are then transferred to different electrodes so as to be used as current sources (voltage sources). The second group includes electronic devices in which voltage or current is applied to at least two electrodes to inject holes and/or electrons into an organic semiconductor forming an interface with the electrodes, such that the devices operate using the injected electrons and holes.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Examples of the organic electronic devices include organic light-emitting devices, organic solar cells, organic photoconductor (OPC) drums, and organic transistors, all of which require a hole injection or transport material, an electron injection or transport material, or a light emitting material for driving thereof. A description will be given below mainly of organic light-emitting devices, however, the principle of action of the hole injection or transport material, the electron injection or transport material, and the light-emitting material is similar between organic electronic devices.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In general, an organic light-emitting phenomenon is a phenomenon in which electrical energy is transformed into light energy by means of an organic material. The organic light-emitting device employing the organic light-emitting phenomenon generally has a structure comprising an anode, a cathode and an organic layer interposed therebetween. Herein, the organic layer frequently consists of a structure of a plurality of layers made of different materials in order to increase the efficiency and stability of the organic light-emitting device. For example, it may consist of a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a light-emitting layer, an electron transport layer,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> an electron injection layer and the like. In this structure of the organic light-emitting device, when voltage is applied between the two electrodes, holes and electrons are injected into the organic layer from the anode and the cathode, respectively. When the holes and electrons injected as described above are recombined, excitons are formed. When the excitons drop to a ground state, light is emitted. This organic light-emitting device is known to have various characteristics, including spontaneous emission, high brightness, high efficiency, low driving voltage, wide viewing angle, high contrast, and high-speed response characteristics.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Materials for forming the organic layer in the organic light-emitting device can be divided, according to function, into light-emitting materials and charge transport materials, for examples, hole injection materials, hole transport materials, electron transport materials, electron injection materials and the like. Also, light-emitting materials can be divided, according to the color of light emission, into blue, green and red light-emitting materials, and yellow and orange light-emitting materials required for exhibiting more natural colors. Meanwhile, if only one material is used as light-emitting material, there occur problems in that the peak emission wavelength shifts to a long wavelength due to the interaction between molecules, thereby reducing color purity, or the efficiency of the device is reduced due to a quenching effect. For this reason, in order to improve color purity and to increase light emission efficiency through energy transfer, a host/dopant system can be used as a light-emitting material.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In order for the organic light-emitting device to sufficiently exhibit the above-described excellent characteristics, materials forming the organic layer in the device (e.g., a hole injection material, a hole transport material, a light-emitting material, an electron transport material, an electron injection material, etc.) must be stable and efficient materials. However, the development of efficient organic layer materials for the organic light-emitting devices is not yet sufficient, and thus there remains a need for the development of new materials. There is also the need to develop these materials for other organic electronic devices.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="GB1054107A"><text>GB 1,054,107</text></patcit>, dye compounds containing a trimethylene naphtimidazole scaffold are disclosed which are useful as silver halide sensitizers.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP9073181A"><text>JP 09-73181 A</text></patcit>, an electrophotographic photoreceptor is disclosed which contains a photosensitive layer on an electrically conductive substrate, wherein the photosensitive layer contains an azo pigment which has a substructure in which a naphthimidazole is condensed to a phenol ring.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2005044790A"><text>JP 2005-044790 A</text></patcit>, an organic electroluminescent element is disclosed which has at least one light-emitting layer and a layer containing a compound having a benzimidazole substructure between a cathode and said light-emitting layer.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>A.

Typically, in the case of a compound in which each of R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>2</sup> in Formula 1 is a 2-naphthyl group and R in the moiety B is hydrogen, i.e., a compound containing five-membered aromatic heterocycles, which are one more than those of anthracene, the compound had a maximum absorption wavelength (λ<sub>max</sub>) of 360 nm and a band gap of 2.95 eV. From this fact, the core represented by the moiety A can be expected to have a blue emission band slightly shifted to the long wavelength region compared to anthracene.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">It is known that the imidazole group is frequently used as a substituent group of an electron injection and/or transport material or a light-emitting material in organic light-emitting devices, and has an important effect on electron injection or transport or light emission. Thus, because the moiety A of the compound of Formula 1, which has a structure forming a fused ring with an imidazole group, still has the nature of the imidazole group, it has the n-type nature, in which electron injection and transfer is easy. As used herein, the term "n-type nature" generally refers to a conductive property according to the LUMO level, and thus an anionic property resulting from the formation of electrons.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">For example, a compound, in which R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>2</sup> in the structure of Formula 1 are substituted with a 2-naphthyl group and R is hydrogen, was measured to have a HOMO value of 5.8-6.0 eV, which corresponds to a relatively low energy level. Also, the LUMO value of the compound was measured to be 2.9-3.1 eV. Such HOMO and LUMO values shows that the compound can perform electron transport in organic light-emitting devices, and when used as the material of an electron transport layer, it<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> can also perform the role of hole-blocking that prevents holes injected and transported from a hole injection layer and hole transport layer from being injected into a cathode located at the opposite side so as to reduce the stability of the devices.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Moreover, R<sup>1</sup> to R<sup>10</sup> in the structure of Formula 1 can be introduced with various substituents. Thus, the energy level or energy band gap of the compound of Formula 1 can be variously controlled to various levels by introducing into the structure of Formula 1 an arylamine substituent that is resistant to holes, or a substituent having a suitably controlled conjugation length. The compound of Formula 1, which has an energy level controlled by the introduction of such various substituents, can be used not only as electron injection and transport materials, but also as hole injection, hole transport and light-emitting materials. In the present invention, among the compounds of Formula 1, compounds having suitable energy levels according to substituents are selected and used in organic electronic devices, including organic light-emitting devices, and thus devices having low driving voltage and high light efficiency can be realized.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Also, because R<sup>1</sup> to R<sup>10</sup> in Formula 1 are introduced with various substituents, the pi-pi interaction in the compound structure can be reduced to suppress excimer or exciplex formation, which occurs in materials having a planar structure.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Hereinafter, the substituents in Formula 1 or Formula 2 will be described in detail.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The alkyl group, alkoxy group and alkenyl group of R<sup>1</sup> to R<sup>10</sup> in Formula 1 or Form ula 2 preferably have 1 to 30 carbon atoms.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Examples of the aryl group of R<sup>1</sup> to R<sup>10</sup> in Formula 1 or Formula 2 include a phenyl group, naphthyl group, anthranyl group, biphenyl group, pyrenyl group and perylene group, but are not limited thereto.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Example of the arylamine group of R<sup>1</sup> to R<sup>10</sup> in Formula 1 or Formula 2 include a diphenylamine group, phenylnaphthylamine group, ditolylamine group, phenyltolylamine group, carbazole group and triphenylamine group, but are not limited thereto.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Examples of the heterocyclic group of R<sup>1</sup> to R<sup>10</sup> in Formula 1 or Formula 2 include a pyridyl group, a bipyridyl group, acridyl group, thiophene group, imidazole group, oxazole group, thiazole group and quinolinyl group, but are not limited thereto.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Examples of the halogen group of R<sup>1</sup> to R<sup>10</sup> in Formula 1 or Formula 2 include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In the present invention, when R<sup>1</sup> to R<sup>10</sup> in Formula 1 or Formula 2 are substituted with other substituents, these substituents are preferably selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group, alkenyl group, aryl group, arylamine group, heterocyclic group and alicyclic group.
