Each half-head usually comprises a frame with two levers actuable by a secondary oil-pressure jack to respectively grip the end of one of the two rails to be connected by welding. The half-heads are also provided with suitable electrodes 6 for applying the welding current to the rail ends.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">During the welding operation, thanks to the high induction caused by the current, the two ends of the rails heat up to the melting point and, after an initial pre-heating step, the two ends are squashed against each other so that the so-called upsetting or forging of the connecting portion occurs at the same time as their continued progressive melting. Such approach of the ends of the two rails, which is carried out by actuating the main oil-pressure jacks, requires a very high pulling or traction strength, which mainly depends on the length of the same rail and on the friction between the rail and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the same rail and on the friction between the rail and the sleepers and/or the ballast.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The pulling strength required for most butt welds of rails currently carried out is about 500 kN. In an attempt at speeding up the operations for laying and maintaining railway lines, the length of the single rail profiles to be connected by welding has been increased. However, such increase of the rail profile length also implies an increase of the friction that must be overcome by the pulling strength of the welding head to move the rail ends close to one another during the welding operation.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">To increase the pulling strength of the welding head it is necessary to replace the entire welding head with a new, more powerful welding head or replace, into an existing welding head, the original oil-pressure jack with a more powerful oil-pressure jack.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4929816A"><text>US-A-4929816</text></patcit> shows a welding head having two welding halves, movable towards and away from each other in a direction of the rail, and parallel hydraulic cylinders for moving the two welding head halves in said direction, a pair of clamping and welding jaws on each welding head half, and a hydraulic clamping cylinder connecting the jaws of each pair, and an apparatus for tensioning or longitudinally sliding the rail, the apparatus being<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> associated in parallel with the welding head for encompassing the welding head, the apparatus being associated externally and in parallel with the welding head for encompassing the welding head in a horizontal plane passing through the rail and comprising two pairs of rail clamping jaws for engaging adjacent rail section ends immediately ahead of, and behind, the welding head, the welding head, and a separate hydraulic cylinder-piston arrangement extending in the direction of the rail and comprising respective separate and disposed in parallel operating cylinders connecting the pairs of rail clamping jaws for operation thereof.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Since the cost of a welding head is high and the normal operating life of a welding head is very long, a replacement of the entire welding head would imply both a high cost for purchasing the new welding head and the loss of years or decades of amortisation of the investment made with the purchase of the old welding head.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The replacement of the original oil-pressure, jack with a new, more powerful one inside a welding head implies several disadvantages, related on the one side to the need of removing the original jack from the assembly of the structure carrying the welding head, with the risk of impairing its mechanical resistance, and on the other side related to problems of overall dimensions, for<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> example due to the larger diameter of the more powerful jack, which is normally incompatible with the shape of the original structure of the welding head. A series of changes to the half-head carrying structure is therefore unavoidable to replace the main oil-pressure jack with a new more powerful one.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Since with machines or installations that have to stand high mechanical stresses any changes to the original carrying structure are regarded as very dangerous, the replacement of the main oil-pressure jack is not accepted as a satisfactory alternative to the expensive replacement of the entire welding head.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The object of the present invention therefore is to provide an accessory 15 which allows increasing the pulling strength in existing welding heads without changing the carrying structure of the existing welding head.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A further object of the present invention is to provide a method for equipping an existing welding head with the above accessory 15 so as to increase its pulling strength without changing the carrying structure of the existing welding head.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A further object of the present invention is to provide a welding head for welding rails having a high pulling capability compared to an existing welding head<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> and being manufactured using said existing welding head without intervening on the carrying structure in the area of structural interaction between the oil-pressure and the half-heads of the existing welding head.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">These and other objects are achieved by an accessory for a welding head for welding the ends of two rail profiles according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The above objects are further achieved by a method for manufacturing a welding head for welding the ends of two rail profiles according to claim 12.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The above objects are further achieved by a welding head for welding the ends of two rail profiles according to claim 11.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">To better understand the invention and appreciate its advantages, some exemplary non-limiting embodiments thereof will now be described with reference to the annexed figures, wherein:</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> is a perspective view of a welding head according to the invention;</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0001">figures 2 and 3</figref> are views of a self-propelled machine for welding rails provided with the welding head according to the invention;</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0002">figure 4</figref> is a longitudinal section view of a welding head according to the invention;</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0003">figure 5</figref> is an enlarged view of a detail of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> welding head according to the invention;</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0004">figure 6</figref> is a longitudinal section view of a main cylinder of the welding head according to the invention;</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0004">figure 7</figref> is a longitudinal section view of a centring member of the welding head according to the invention;</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0004">figure 8</figref> is a longitudinal section view of an additional cylinder 17 of the welding head according to the invention;</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0004">figure 9</figref> is a partly longitudinal section view of an additional stem of the welding head according to the invention;</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0004">figure 10</figref> is a front view of the additional stem of <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 9</figref>;</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0004">figure 11</figref> is a front view of a connecting flange of the welding head according to the invention; and</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0005">figure 12</figref> is an enlarged perspective view of a detail of the welding head according to the invention.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, a welding head for welding the ends of two rail profiles is globally indicated with reference numeral 1.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The welding head 1 comprises two half-heads 2, 3 aligned with one another and slidingly movable relative<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> to one another in a longitudinal direction L.
