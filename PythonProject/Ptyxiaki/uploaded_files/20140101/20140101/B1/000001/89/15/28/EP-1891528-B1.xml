centralized mapping of the physical connectivity of all the different components of a telecommunication network is well known. In these networks, the dynamic interconnections between communication ports located within patch panels or active devices are provided by multiconductor cables, also known as patch cords. Accordingly, monitoring and mapping the physical connectivity of the network require real-time identification of changes in the interconnections between the ports.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Some existing solutions for providing centralized mapping of the interconnectivity of ports require the use of special ports having an additional contact and a special patch cord with additional contacts and a dedicated scanning wire to enable a delivery of scanning signals indicative of the connectivity status.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Other existing systems are aimed to provide a retrofitting solution to existing standard network devices. New components which are mechanically and electronically adapted to work with conventional devices are added to the standard devices to impart the required centralized mapping of the physical connectivity to the network. The existing retrofitting solutions have several drawbacks.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Firstly, they involve attaching an adapter board or gluing a strip on an existing device. Accordingly, the device may be physically interfered as it does not remain in its original form. Additionally, the solution of retrofitting is not suitable for various devices, such as high-density switches due to spatial constrains. Furthermore, the physical characteristics of the configuration of the ports, namely, number of ports, grouping, distance between ports and the like may vary between vendors and designs. Accordingly, the retrofit kit should be tailor-made to fit the target device. This process is complex, time consuming and costly.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6684179B"><text>US patent no. 6,684,179</text></patcit> determines and monitors the connection pattern of data ports which are connected by multiconductor cables without requiring special patch cables or patch panels. An adapter jacket having an external contact is placed over a standardised cable such as an RJ45 cable which connects the data ports. An adapter board having a plurality of socket contacts is placed adjacent a plurality of data ports. An output and input module are coupled to the socket contacts. A microprocessor which is coupled to the output and input module scans the socket contacts to determine the connection pattern of the data ports.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to the present invention there is provided an apparatus for monitoring connectivity status of communication ports, comprising: a board positionable opposite and physically isolated from a frontal surface of a target device, the frontal surface having sockets of communication ports, wherein said board comprises a plurality of bus lines being coupled to a scanning system; a multiconductive cable having a cord, two plugs, each attached to one end of said cord and at least one cable signal-terminal attached to an external surface of said cord in proximity and detached from a first one of said plugs; and a module with one or more slots, wherein each slot is configured to cradle the cord, each slot has a slot signal-terminal, and said module is connectable to the board such that at least some of said slots are substantially aligned with respective sockets of the target device, wherein when one of the plugs is inserted into a particular socket and said cable signal-terminal is inserted into a corresponding slot, transmission of signals between the scanning system and the cable signal-terminal (66) is enabled.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for monitoring connectivity status of communication ports, comprising: connecting, physically and electrically, to a board one or more modules having one or more slots, each slot has an electrically conductive slot-contact and each of the slots is configured to cradle a cord of a multiconductor cable; positioning said board opposite and physically isolated from a target device having a frontal surface with sockets of communication ports such that at least some of said slots are substantially aligned with corresponding sockets of the target device; inserting a plug of the multiconductor cable into a socket of the target device, said cable having an external electrically conductive cable-contact positioned on a cord of the cable separated from said plug; inserting said cable-contact into a slot positioned substantially aligned with said socket; and connecting said board via bus lines to a scanning unit such that transmission of signals between the scanning system and said cable-contact is enabled.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further features of the present invention are defined in the dependent claims.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0002">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The subj ect matter regarded as the invention is particularly pointed out and distinctly claimed in the concluding portion of the specification.

Before the installation of connectivity apparatus 40 to a high density target device 68, the specific configuration of the assembly should be determined. Accordingly, the number, shape and position of modules 44 is determined based on the configuration of target device 68. Then, the modules may be assembled to board 42 such that upon positioning the board opposite the target device at least a portion of the slots of the modules may be substantially aligned with corresponding sockets 18.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Patch cords 56 having ordinary plugs 58 may be inserted into some of the slots as required such that cable signal-terminal 66 may be coupled to slot signal-terminal 48 to enable the scanning operation. As required, plugs 60 may be inserted to corresponding sockets 18. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, the connectivity apparatus may be regarded as<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> "floating", namely, there may be no need for any mechanical assembly between the apparatus and the target device as the patch cords support the connectivity apparatus. Therefore, the connectivity apparatus according to embodiments of the present invention may be fitted to a large variety of target devices that may contain either vertically or horizontally distributed ports. It should be noted that in the initialization phase, two non-active patch cords may be used to hold the connectivity apparatus.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">According to other embodiments of the present invention the connectivity apparatus may be mechanically assembled to the target device using any suitable connection means. It should be noted that in these embodiments the gap between board 42 and the socket at the frontal surface of the target device remains and the physical connection may be made to other parts of the target device.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">After the installation, scanning system may forward a scanning signal to a first cable signal-terminal 66 via slot signal-terminal 48. Then, if a connectivity path from the first cable signal-terminal to a second cable signal-terminal associated with another socket exists, according to the signal received at the scanning system, the system may determine the connectivity status for this pair. Alternatively, the system may determine that this port is not connected. By repeating this process for all the sockets the connectivity map of the system may be determined.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">It is appreciated that one or more of the operations of the assembly method described herein may be omitted or carried out in a different order than that shown, without departing from the scope of the claims.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">While certain features of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, many modifications will now occur to those of ordinary skill in the art. It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56979386" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Vorrichtung (20, 40) zum Überwachen des Konnektivitätsstatus von Komminikationsports, umfassend:
