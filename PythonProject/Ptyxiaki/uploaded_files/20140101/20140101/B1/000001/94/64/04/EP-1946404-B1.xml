The vent may be a valve such as relief or burst valve to permit effluent to escape the cell. An aperture may be in fluid communication with the interior of the cell. When the cell is in its normal operating mode, the aperture is blocked by some element. In the event that effluent builds up to a predetermined threshold, the element may move to expose the aperture such that effluent may escape the cell. According to an exemplary embodiment, a vent may be configured to allow gas and/or other materials to escape from the cell when the pressure within the cell reaches a particular threshold (e.g., a high pressure threshold of between approximately 3 psi and 30 psi).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A plurality of cells electrically coupled together may be arranged in a module, such as that shown in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US976169A"><text>U.S. Patent Application No. 10/976,169</text></patcit> (e.g., having channels for airflow and effluent removal, etc.), for use with the present invention.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The number of cells provided within a particular module may vary according to various exemplary embodiments.

One advantageous feature of providing a flexible member 244 is that the temperature sensor may be maintained in close proximity of the bottom of a cell 250 that is provided on the platform 232 with an appropriate level of force. For example, when placed on the platform 232, the cell may force the device 242 downward through the aperture 233. The flexible member 244 allows for movement of the device 242 while maintaining close proximity between the device 242 and the cell 250 (e.g., the flexible member 244 may be made of a relatively resilient material). <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGURE 6</figref> illustrates a portion of the underside of the base 230 illustrating the flexible member 244 in position adjacent the aperture 233.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">A member or element 246 such as a gasket or washer (e.g., a ring-like structure or member) is provided above the flexible member 244 according to an exemplary embodiment. According to an exemplary embodiment, the member 246 surrounds the device 242 to provide a relatively isolated environment in which the device 242 may operate (e.g., a cooling fluid such as air flowing by the cells may not pass over the device 242, which allows for more accurate temperature sensing for the cell). By providing gasket 246, the need to encapsulate the temperature sensor with an epoxy or other material may be eliminated, as it keeps the temperature sensor within the proximity of the cell.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The one or more wires 240 extending from the device 242 may be coupled to a system (e.g., a battery management system, a vehicle communication system such as a vehicle bus, etc). The system may act to control the temperature of the module and/or individual cells within the module based at least in part on information transmitted from the device 242. For example, in the event that the temperature of a cell or a module exceeds a predetermined threshold, the module may be disconnected from the vehicle power system according to an exemplary embodiment. According to another exemplary embodiment, individual cells may be disconnected from the vehicle power system. Other actions may also be taken according to other exemplary embodiments (e.g., routing additional cooling fluid to a particular cell, decreasing the amount of power provided by a particular cell, etc.) that are intended to manage the temperature of individual cells in the module.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIGURE 7</figref> shows a battery module 200 having a plurality of cells 250 provided within a housing 202. A member or base 230 of the module 200 includes a plurality of features or platforms 232 on which the cells 250 are placed. A member or device 242 (e.g., a temperature sensor) is maintained in contact with a bottom surface of a cell 250 by a flexible member 244 such as a diaphragm and the force from the cell 250 held in place above the member 244 by the housing 202. It should be noted that while <figref idrefs="f0005">FIGURES 7</figref> illustrates only one device 242, any number of similar devices may be used. For example, one such device may be provided for each of the platforms (i.e., for each of the cells in the module).</p><p id="p0040" num="0040"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIGURE 8</figref> illustrates the use of a member or device 342 similar to the device 242 utilized in a battery system or module 300 having a plurality of generally prismatic cells 350. The cells 350 are provided between a first (e.g., top) cover 320 and a second (e.g.,<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> bottom) cover 330. A member or element 331 in the form of a plate or panel is provided to secure or clamp the first and second covers and cells together as a battery pack. An aperture or hole 333 is provided in the second cover 330, and the device 342 having one or more wires 340 coupled thereto is provided on a flexible member 344 provided between the second cover 330 and the member 331. A depression or cutout 337 is provided in the member 331 into which the device 342 and the flexible member 344 may extend when provided in contact with the cell 350. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIGURES 8</figref>, the flexible member 344 constrains movement of the device 342 while maintaining it in close contact with a portion of the cell 350. As with the other exemplary embodiments shown and described herein, any number of devices 342 may be provided in the module 300 (e.g., one for each cell, etc.).</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The flexible members (e.g., flexible members 244 and 344) may be provided as a single piece of adhesive-backed neoprene (or other suitable material) in the form of a diaphragm according to an exemplary embodiment. The adhesive may act to secure the flexible member to the temperature sensor. According to other exemplary embodiments, the flexible member does not include an adhesive for securing the member to a temperature sensor.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">It should be understood by those reviewing this disclosure that temperature sensors may be provided as shown herein in a variety of different modules, including modules that utilize oval-shaped cells, prismatic cells, cylindrical cells, or other types of cells. For example, the cells shown having a generally oval shape may be provided in a module along with one or more temperature sensors that are held in contact with a surface of the cells by a flexible member such as a diaphragm.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">It would be desirable to provide a battery system of a type disclosed in the present application that includes a battery system that includes one or more battery cells (e.g., lithium-ion cells, NiMH cells, etc.) for providing power to a vehicle. It would also be desirable to provide a battery system that includes a system for monitoring the temperature of a battery cell. Furthermore, it may be advantageous to provide a battery system that includes features for maintaining temperature sensors in contact with cells in the battery system.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Various advantages may be obtained by providing temperature sensors or the like in contact with batteries or cells using a flexible member such as a diaphragm. For example, battery modules using such a configuration may be assembled and disassembled relatively simply, and may use fewer components as compared to other battery modules having different temperature sensing configurations and devices. For example, no fasteners are required to secure the temperature sensor in position.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Another advantageous feature of the temperature sensor arrangement is that the mounting method maintains a relatively consistent and appropriate (e.g., not excessive) force holding the sensor to the cell while allowing for some dimensional variation of the components. Furthermore, an appropriate amount of holding force may reduce or eliminate damage to the sensors.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">It is important to note that the construction and arrangement of the systems and structures shown in the various exemplary embodiments are illustrative only. Although only a few embodiments have been described in detail in this disclosure, those skilled in the art who review this disclosure will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible (e.g., variations in sizes, dimensions, structures, shapes and proportions of the various elements, values of parameters, mounting arrangements, use of materials, colors, orientations, etc.) without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of the subject matter recited in the claims. For example, elements shown as integrally formed may be constructed of multiple parts or elements, the position of elements may be reversed or otherwise, and the nature or number of discrete elements or positions may be altered or varied. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims. The order or sequence of any process or method steps may be varied or re-sequenced according to alternative embodiments. Other substitutions, modifications, changes and omissions may be made in the design, operating conditions and arrangement of the various exemplary embodiments without departing from the scope of the present inventions.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56979293" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Ein Akkumulatorsystem aufweisend:
