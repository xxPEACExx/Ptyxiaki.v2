In such treatments, a high viscosity gelled liquid hydrocarbon fracturing fluid having particulate proppant material, e.g. sand, suspended therein is pumped through a well bore into a subterranean formation to be stimulated at a rate and pressure such that one or more fractures are formed and extended in the formation. The suspended proppant material is deposited in the fractures when gelled hydrocarbon fracturing fluid is broken and returned to the surface. The proppant material functions to prevent the formed fractures from closing whereby conductive channels remain through which produced fluids can readily flow to the well bore.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Polyvalent metal salts of orthophosphoric acid esters have heretofore been utilized as gelling agents for forming high viscosity gelled liquid hydrocarbon fracturing fluids. Such gelled liquid hydrocarbon fracturing fluids have included fracture proppant material and delayed breakers for causing the fracturing fluids to break into relatively thin fluids whereby the proppant material is deposited in formed fractures and the fracturing fluid is produced back. Descriptions of such heretofore utilized high viscosity gelled liquid hydrocarbon fracturing fluids and methods of their use are set forth in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4622155A"><text>U.S. patents nos. 4,622,155</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5846915A"><text>5,846,915</text></patcit>. The gelled liquid hydrocarbon fracturing fluids described in the above patents utilise ferric iron or aluminium polyvalent metal salts of phosphoric acid<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> esters as gelling agents and delayed breakers such as hard burned magnesium oxide which is slowly soluble in water.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">While the heretofore utilized high viscosity gelled liquid hydrocarbon fracturing fluids and methods have been used successfully for forming fractures in subterranean formations, problems have been encountered as a result of the use of the gelling agent, i.e., the polyvalent metal salt of a phosphoric acid ester. That is, in recent years plugging of refinery towers which process oil produced from formations fractured with gelled liquid hydrocarbon fracturing fluids has caused many expensive, unplanned shut-downs. The plugging material is high in phosphorus and has been attributed to the phosphate esters used as gelling agents. The phosphate esters contribute volatile phosphorus which condenses on distillation tower trays, causing plugging. The volatile phosphorus may also carry over the tops of the distillation towers causing contamination of the hydrocarbon products produced.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Thus, there are needs for improved methods of using and preparing gelled liquid hydrocarbons which upon breaking and being refined substantially reduce volatile phosphorus in distillation towers, improved liquid hydrocarbon gelling agents and improved gelled liquid hydrocarbon compositions. More specifically, in fracturing oil producing subterranean formations in areas where volatile phosphorus is a problem in refineries, there is a need to reduce the production of volatile phosphorus in the refineries to levels where the above described unscheduled refinery shut downs are not required without compromising CO<sub>2</sub> compatibility with the gelled oil fracturing fluids used. Concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> as high as 40-50% are commonly used in gelled oil fracturing fluids which form miscible mixtures with the fluids. The presence of the CO<sub>2</sub> enhances fluid recovery, minimizes the amount of oil based fracturing fluid which must be recovered, and reduces costs in areas where CO<sub>2</sub> is less expensive than the oil based fracturing fluid.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In one aspect of the present invention, we have devised an additive which will cause certain hydrocarbon gels gelled with a ferric iron polyvalent metal salt, to break by reduction of the ferric iron to ferrous.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Thus, the invention provides the use of an additive for causing a water-containing liquid hydrocarbon gel formed with a gelling agent comprised of a ferric iron polyvalent metal salt of a phosphonic acid ester or of a phosphoric acid ester to break and revert to a thin fluid, characterised in that said additive comprises a water-soluble reducing agent which upon dissolving in said water and contacting said liquid hydrocarbon gel reduces the ferric iron in the gel to ferrous iron.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In a second aspect, we have devised a liquid hydrocarbon gel which comprises a hydrocarbon liquid, a ferric iron polyvalent metal salt of a phosphoric acid ester, water and an additive for breaking said gel into a thin fluid, said additive being a water soluble reducing agent which upon dissolving in said water and contacting said liquid hydrocarbon gel reduces said ferric iron in the gel to ferrous iron.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In an embodiment, a gelled liquid hydrocarbon fracturing fluid of the invention is comprised of a hydrocarbon liquid, a gelling agent comprised of a ferric iron polyvalent metal salt of a phosphonic acid ester, a proppant material, water and an amount of a delayed gel breaker effective to break the gelled hydrocarbon fracturing fluid.

For example, the gelled liquid hydrocarbon fluids are suitable for use in fracturing treatments carried out in subterranean formations whereby the production of hydrocarbons from the subterranean formations is stimulated. In accordance with the present invention, a fracturing fluid comprised of a gelled liquid hydrocarbon or mixture of hydrocarbons containing a proppant material and a delayed gel breaker is pumped through a well bore into a subterranean formation to be stimulated. The fracturing fluid is pumped at a rate and pressure such that one or more fractures are formed and extended in the subterranean formation.

The phosphoric acid ester suffers from the problem that it decomposes in refinery distillation towers to form volatile phosphorus which condenses on the trays of the distillation towers and causes plugging. Also, the phosphoric acid ester may itself be volatile, dependent upon its molecular weight. By the present invention, improved methods and compositions for fracturing subterranean formations with gelled liquid hydrocarbon fracturing fluids are provided wherein the gelling agent utilized is a ferric iron or aluminum polyvalent metal salt of a phosphonic acid ester.

In addition, if water is not already contained in the hydrocarbon liquid or added thereto as a component in a cross-linker solution or the like, water is added to the hydrocarbon liquid in an amount, for example, of about 0.05% or greater by weight of the hydrocarbon liquid. The presence of the water allows slowly water soluble or encapsulated breakers to be dissolved or released.

That is, alkylphosphonic acid monomethyl (or monobutyl) esters were prepared using the alkylphosphonic acid dimethyl (or dibutyl) esters prepared in accordance with the above described procedure as follows. 0.045 mole of alkylphosphonic acid dimethyl (or dibutyl) ester was charged to a 100 milliliter round bottom flask. A solution of 1.9 grams (0.048 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 38 milliliters of methanol was added to the flask and the flask was fitted with a reflux condenser. The mixture was stirred magnetically and heated to reflux for 3 hours. 10 milliliters of water and 50 milliliters of hexane were added and the resulting mixture was shaken. The phases were separated and the hexane layer containing the unreacted dimethyl (or dibutyl) ester was discarded. The aqueous layer was washed twice with 20 milliliter portions of hexane and the hexane layer was discarded. 3.6 milliliters of 38% hydrochloric acid (0.045 mole) was added to the aqueous phase followed by 40 milliliters of water. The mixture was extracted 3 times with 20 milliliter portions of hexane. The combined organic fractions were washed with water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate.
