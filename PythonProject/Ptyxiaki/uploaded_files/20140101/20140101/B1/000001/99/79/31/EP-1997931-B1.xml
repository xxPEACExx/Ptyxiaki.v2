Incidentally, the term "transparent conductor" as used herein includes a transparent conductive film.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Today, the material that is being used most as a transparent electrode of flat panel displays and the like is ITO (Indium Tin Oxide), which is obtained by doping indium oxide with an appropriate amount of tin.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The reason why ITO plays the leading part in a transparent conductor is that the various characteristics of ITO such as low resistivity and high transmittance in the visible light region, which are required in a transparent conductor, are superior in comparison to transparent conductors prepared from other materials.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Nevertheless, In (indium) as the raw material to be used in ITO entails problems in that the cost of the end product will increase because indium is expensive, and the supply of materials may become impossible due to resource depletion because indium is a scarce resource. Although the development of a zinc<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> oxide-based transparent conductor having zinc oxide as its primary component is being actively pursued as the development of the substitute material of ITO, there is still a problem in that the resistivity is significantly high in comparison to ITO.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The reason for this is that the conventional development policy of zinc oxide-based transparent conductive materials was only based on the search of an optimal single dopant. In other words, the foregoing policy is to find an element from a periodical table that will serve as an n-type dopant and emit electrons as a result of doping the zinc oxide as the parent material with such element. Specifically, for example, in most cases, a target doped with a candidate element having an atomic valence that is greater than bivalence, which is the valence of zinc, in an appropriate range of concentration is prepared, and this is subject to sputter-deposition to evaluate the resistivity of the film.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As a result of this development policy, although candidate dopants having an atomic valence of trivalence (refer to Patent Document 1) and tetravalence (refer to Patent Document 2) were discovered, the actual condition is that the resistivity of such candidate dopants is far inferior to ITO.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Meanwhile, it has been reported recently that a zinc oxide-based transparent conductor with low resistivity was developed by applying the so-called co-doping theory (refer to Patent Document 3). The subject matter thereof merely requires that an n-type dopant having a concentration above a specified level is contained in an amount that is greater than a p-type dopant.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">As it stands now, there have been no other reports in the past in addition to the foregoing report which actually succeeded in preparing a zinc oxide-based transparent conductor with low resistivity, though they have simply satisfied the foregoing requirement.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In addition, although the foregoing report refers to the Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) method and Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) method in the examples as the method of manufacturing a zinc oxide-based transparent conductor, both of these methods are inappropriate for preparing a large-area transparent conductive film.

Moreover, in the development based on the co-doping theory, the subject matter thereof is ambiguous, and the current status is that the adopted manufacturing methods are unable to manufacture a large-area transparent conductor that is suitable for industrial application.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present invention was devised in view of the foregoing problems. Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a zinc oxide-based transparent conductive film with low resistivity that is comparable to ITO and which can be manufactured in a large area.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As a result of intense study to overcome the foregoing problems, the present inventors succeeded in realizing a zinc oxide-based transparent conductive film with low resistivity that is comparable to ITO and which can be manufactured in a large<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> area by setting the type, range of concentration and relative value of concentration of the n-type dopant and the p-type dopant to be within an appropriate range, and further adopting an appropriate doping raw material and doping method. The present inventors thereby conceived the present invention.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The co-doping theory utilizes the effect of lowering the respective impurity levels based on mutual interaction by doping both the n-type dopant and the p-type dopant, and in particular is being reviewed for application to realize p-type zinc oxide which is considered to be difficult to manufacture. In other words, lowering the impurity level of the p-type dopant is to provide numerous holes, which exceeds the effect of normally existing the n-type dopant, and the results lead p-type zinc oxide to be realized.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Meanwhile, the present invention is unique in that it took particular note of n-type impurities. Specifically, since the impurity level of the n-type dopant is also lowered, the theoretical rationale that the present invention can be realized is the application of the foregoing effect to a zinc oxide-based transparent conductor.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The reason why the co-doping theory is considered to be effective in manufacturing an n-type zinc oxide-based transparent conductor is based on the discovery that, by introducing an n-type dopant and a p-type dopant at a ratio of 2:1 to zinc oxide, a compound is formed between the two dopants, the n-type impurity level is lowered further based on mutual interaction, and the activation rate of n-type impurities will increase. Thus, it is possible to reduce the doping amount of n-type impurities for obtaining a certain level of carrier concentration, and reduce the scattering of ionized impurities.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Nevertheless, the co-doping theory is only a theory, and it is hypothecating an ideal condition that is different from the actual condition for calculating the impurity<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> level. In other words, the co-doping theory is based on the premise that the n-type dopant and the p-type dopant are respectively substituted with appropriate atoms and form a prescribed atomic arrangement.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Specifically, for example, in a case where the n-type dopant is gallium and the p-type dopant is nitrogen, in the co-doping theory, calculating the impurity level is based on the assumed ideal condition where the gallium is completely substituted with zinc and the nitrogen is completely substituted with oxygen in a lattice position.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In addition, the co-doping theory merely shows the calculation result of the impurity level once the foregoing substitution is realized, and it does not explain whether this kind of substitution actually occurs, nor does it refer to or suggest any means for realizing such substitution.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In fact, the present inventors identified that there are elements in which the foregoing ideal substitution is difficult such as the dopant getting caught between the lattices, and elements that in which the foregoing ideal substitution can be attained relatively easily, depending on the type, combination and introduction method of the dopants to be introduced,.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Specifically, since the ion radius of nitrogen that is suitable as the p-type dopant is larger than that of oxygen, when nitrogen is introduced, zinc oxide will be subject to the influence of strains toward the direction of partially enlarging crystal lattice.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Moreover, since the n-type dopant similarly has an ion radius that is greater than that of zinc to which it is to substitute, and zinc oxide will be further subject to the influence of strains toward the direction in which the crystal lattice is enlarged, when the doping amount is increased, the appropriate substitution of these dopants to the lattice position will no longer be possible, the dopants may get caught between the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> lattices, and the ideal condition hypothesized under the co-doping theory can no longer be realized.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Thus, when using nitrogen as the p-type dopant, an element having an ion radius that is smaller than the ion radius of zinc is used as the n-type dopant. Consequently, the dopants are substituted at the lattice position based on the alleviation effect of the lattice strain caused by the introduction of the dopants, and the effect of the co-doping theory was thereby realized.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Moreover, the present inventors also discovered that the ratio of the n-type dopant and p-type dopant does not necessarily have to be within the range of 2:1, which is the optimal value of the co-doping theory, and the effect is yielded across a certain range.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Based on the foregoing discovery, the present invention provides:
<ol><li>1) A zinc oxide-based transparent conductor characterized in having zinc oxide as its primary component, containing an element at 1 to 10 atomic % which has a smaller ion radius than the zinc in the zinc oxide and serves as an n-type dopant for the zinc oxide, and containing nitrogen in which the atomicity ratio of nitrogen in relation to the n-type dopant (nitrogen/n-type dopant) is 0.3 to 0.6.</li></ol></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Incidentally, the atomic % of the n-type dopant means the ratio of the number of atoms of the n-type dopant in relation to the total number of atoms of the zinc element as the constituent element other than oxygen and nitrogen in the material, and the n-type dopant (hereinafter the same). Moreover, the atomicity ratio in relation to the n-type dopant of nitrogen is obtained by dividing the number of atoms of nitrogen by the number of atoms of the n-type dopant. Thus, if the atomicity ratio in relation to the n-type dopant of nitrogen is 0.5, this means that the number of atoms of nitrogen is half the number of atoms of the n-type dopant (hereinafter the same).<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> The present invention additionally provides:

Contrarily, if the atomicity ratio in relation to the n-type dopant of nitrogen exceeds 0.6, the compensation effect of the n-type dopant based on the addition of the p-type dopant will become great and reduce the number of electrons that contribute to the conduction, and this will also lead to increased resistivity.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Accordingly, by obtaining a zinc oxide-based transparent conductor characterized in having zinc oxide as its primary component, containing an element at 1 to 10 atomic % which has a smaller ion radius than zinc in the zinc oxide and serves as an n-type dopant for the zinc oxide, and containing nitrogen in which the atomicity ratio in relation to the n-type dopant is 0.3 to 0.6, it is possible to obtain a transparent conductor having stable and low resistivity.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">As a method of manufacturing a target to be used as the sputtering target, for instance, if the n-type dopant is gallium, the foregoing target can be manufactured by weighing and mixing Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powder, GaN powder and ZnO powder in appropriate amounts so that the concentration of the respective elements becomes a prescribed value, and retaining the mixed powder for 2 hours at a temperature of 950°C and a pressure of 300kgf/cm<sup>2</sup> according to the hot pressing method.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">When using Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as another n-type dopant, for example, the foregoing target can be manufactured by adding Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powder in substitute for or in addition to the Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powder.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">A film that is formed by sputtering the foregoing target will be a film having the same composition as the target, and such film will become a transparent conductive film with low resistivity by setting the composition to be in an appropriate range.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The target may also be formed as an integral sputtering target.
