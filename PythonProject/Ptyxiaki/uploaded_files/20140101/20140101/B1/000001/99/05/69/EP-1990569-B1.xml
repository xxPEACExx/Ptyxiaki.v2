load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to a pressure regulating valve which is compact and can be controlled without consuming electric power and whose operating pressure can be easily controlled; a fuel cell system using the pressure regulating valve; and a hydrogen generating facility which decomposes a metal hydride to generate hydrogen.</p><heading id="h0001">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">As energy problems have attracted increasing attention in recent years, there has been a demand for a power source having a higher energy density and involving clean emissions. A fuel cell is a power generator having an energy density several times as high as that of the existing battery, and is characterized in that it has a high energy efficiency, and it is free from, or reduced in, nitrogen oxides or sulfur oxides contained in an emission gas. Thus, the fuel cell can be said to be a very effective device fulfilling requirements for a next-generation power source device.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">With such a fuel cell, methanol or hydrogen is used as a fuel. To supply such a fuel continuously responsive to the consumption of the fuel, a pressure regulating valve is necessary. To achieve downsizing of the fuel cell, the pressure regulating valve needs to be downsized.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">With the fuel cell which obtains an electromotive force by an electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, hydrogen is required as a fuel. A known example of a facility for generating a hydrogen gas is a hydrogen generating facility of a structure which has a reaction vessel accommodating a metal hydride (boron hydride salt),<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> and a water tank, and in which water within the water tank is gushed to the metal hydride in the reaction vessel by a pump (see, for example, Patent Document 1).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In such a hydrogen generating facility as well, a pressure regulating valve is required for supplying water into the reaction vessel in accordance with the consumption of hydrogen. Such a pressure regulating valve similarly needs to be downsized.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For the pressure regulating valve in a fuel cell system as mentioned above, a proposal has been made for a control mechanism which controls the amount of the fuel supplied from a fuel tank by utilizing a differential pressure between the pressure of a fuel electrode chamber and the pressure of an oxygen electrode chamber or outside air (see Patent Document 2).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The pressure regulating valve of this document, however, poses the problem that since a valve element acting in response to the differential pressure undergoes the pressure from the fuel tank, it fails to act normally unless the internal pressure of the fuel tank is constant. Such a document naturally targets the fuel cell using a hydrogen absorbing alloy, whichpresents a region where the hydrogen desorption pressure becomes constant. Thus, the above problem is supposed not to grow to a serious problem. On the other hand, the aforementioned hydrogen generating facility involving great changes in pressure, for example, suffers from the problem that the pressure regulating valve cannot be used.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In fields other than the above-mentioned fuel cell system and hydrogen generating facility, too, there is an intense demand for the advent of a pressure regulating valve which is compact and controllable without being supplied with electric power, and whose operating pressure<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> can be set easily.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2002137903A"><text>JP-A-2002-137903</text></patcit><br/>

As a result, the fuel or the fuel generating material is supplied to the fuel demand side, which is the object of fuel supply, from the supply source of the fuel or fuel generating material connected to one of the first and second flow passages 140 and 150. When the pressure on the fuel demand side becomes higher than the atmospheric pressure because of this supply, the above-mentioned closed state is produced. In order that the fuel or the fuel generating material is supplied when the communication passage 160 comes to an open state, it is only natural that the pressure on the supply source side needs to be higher than the pressure on the object of supply side.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">As described above, the pressure regulating valve 100 can exercise opening and closing control in accordance with the state of the pressure on the fuel demand side applied to the first pressure deformation portion 120, namely, without consumption of electric power. The operating pressure for switching between opening and closing is nearly the pressure exerted on the second pressure deformation portion 130, the atmospheric pressure in this case. The reason why the operating pressure is set at nearly the atmospheric pressure is as follows: Circumstances differ according to which of the first and second flow passages 140 and 150 the supply source of fuel or the like is connected to. When the supply source is connected to the second flow passage 150, for example, the closed state of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(b)</figref> results in the application of the pressure from the supply source to the inside of the valve element 172 existent within the communication passage 160. This pressure has been confirmed to exert<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> minimal influence on the opening and closing action or motion, partly because the area subjected to the pressure is small.

The hydrogen generating facility 20 is equipped with a reaction portion (reaction chamber) 22, which is a site accommodating a hydrogen reaction substance 21 and adapted to generate hydrogen, and a liquid storage portion 24 for storing a hydrogen generating aqueous solution 23, and has the pressure regulating valve 100 provided halfway through a supply passage 25 for supplying the hydrogen generating aqueous solution 23 from the liquid storage portion 24 to the reaction portion 22.

Examples of the metal hydride are compounds of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and complex metals with hydrogen, such as sodium hydride, sodium boron hydride, sodium aluminum hydride, lithium aluminum hydride, lithium boron hydride, lithium hydride, calcium hydride, aluminum hydride, and magnesium hydride. Examples of the additive mixed with the metal hydride are solid organic acids or their salts, metal chlorides, and metals consisting of platinum, gold, copper, nickel, iron, titanium, zirconium, and ruthenium, and their alloys. Advisably, at least one additive selected from them is used. The use of such an additive results in the incorporation of an accelerator or a catalyst for a hydrogen generating reaction into the metal hydride, thus making the rate of the reaction extremely fast. Consequently, when water is supplied to the metal hydride, the internal pressure of the reaction portion can be raised immediately.<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --></p><p id="p0081" num="0081">As the hydrogen generating aqueous solution 23, it is preferred to use water itself, or an aqueous solution containing an organic acid or its salt, an inorganic acid or its salt, or a metal chloride, mixed with water. By this use, an aqueous solution as an accelerator for accelerating the hydrogen generating reaction can be obtained. Thus, the reaction rate becomes so fast that when the hydrogen generating reaction occurs, the internal pressure of the reactionportion can be raised immediately. Such substances added to water are not limited, but organic acids or their salts, inorganic acids or their salts, and metal chlorides can be named. For example, sulfuric acid, malic acid, citric acid, and succinic acid can be named as the acids, and cobalt chloride, iron chloride, nickel chloride, and chlorides of platinum group metals can be named as the metal chlorides.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">As further combinations of the hydrogen generating aqueous solution 23 and the hydrogen reaction substance 21, there can be named those comprising the hydrogen generating aqueous solution 23 which is an aqueous solution of an acid or a base, and the hydrogen reaction substance 21 which is a metal. Here, it is preferred to use hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or the like as the acid, and use a base metal as the metal applied to any of these acids. As the aqueous solution of the base, an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide or an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide can be named. The metal applied to such an aqueous solution of the base is an amphoteric metal.

The pressure regulating valve 100 is used such that the first flow passage 140 communicates with the reaction portion 22, and the second flow passage 150 is connected to the supply passage 25 which is a flow passage in communication with the liquid storage portion 24.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">According to the above-described configuration, the pressure regulating valve 100 receives the pressure within the reaction portion 22, which communicates with the negative electrode chamber 2, by the outside of the first pressure deformation portion 120, and receives atmospheric pressure by the outside of the second pressure deformation portion 130. Therefore, if the pressure within the reactionportion 22 exertedon the first pressure deformation portion 120 is higher than the atmospheric pressure exerted on the second pressure deformation portion 130, the first and second pressure deformation portions 120 and 130 move upward in the drawing, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(b)</figref>, together with the valve member 170. This brings the valve element 172 into contact with the partition member 112 to close the communication passage 160, namely, interrupt the communication between the first flowpassage 140 and the second flow passage 150.

Thus, the valve element 172 abuts on the partition member 112, causing a state in which the communication passage 160 is closed, namely, a state in which the communication between the first flow passage 140 and the second flow passage 150 is interrupted. As a result, the supply of the hydrogen generating aqueous solution 23 from the liquid storage portion 24 to the reaction portion 22 is cut off.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">At this time, the covering portion 185a of the isolation member 185 abuts on the peripheral edge of the penetrating portion 111.

Thus, the influence of the pressure on the fuel demand side after closure of the valve element 172 can be eliminated. Even if the internal pressure of the reaction portion 22 changes (rises) after the valve element 172 is closed, the influence of the internal pressure of the reaction portion 22 is not exerted on the first pressure deformation portion 120.<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --></p><p id="p0091" num="0091">The first pressure deformation portion 120 is formed of an elastic body. Thus, if pressure is applied to the first pressure deformation portion 120 after closure of the valve element 172, warpage is expected to occur in the first pressure deformation portion 120. When warpage occurs in the first pressure deformation portion 120 after closure of the valve element 172, the hydrogen generating aqueous solution 23 remaining within the piping path may be pushed out to cause a further reaction with the hydrogen reaction substance 21, presenting an excess reaction.
