load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><u>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><heading id="h0002"><u>Field of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for producing a diol mixture. More particularly, the present invention is concerned with a method for producing a diol mixture comprising 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol and 1,6-hexanediol, which comprises: (A) providing a dicarboxylic acid mixture comprising succinic acid, glutaric acid and adipic acid and having a nitric acid content which does not exceed a specific value, wherein the dicarboxylic acid mixture is prepared by denitrating an aqueous by-product solution obtained in an adipic acid production process, and (B) subjecting the dicarboxylic acid mixture to hydrogenation in the presence of water, hydrogen gas and a hydrogenation catalyst containing an active metal species comprising ruthenium and tin, to thereby obtain a hydrogenation reaction mixture comprising a diol mixture comprising 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol and 1,6-hexanediol.<br/>
The method of the present invention for producing a diol mixture is advantageous not only in that an aqueous<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> by-product solution (containing a dicarboxylic acid mixture comprising succinic acid, glutaric acid and adipic acid) obtained in an adipic acid production process can be used as a raw material for a useful diol mixture, but also in that a diol mixture comprising 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol and 1,6-hexanediol can be produced stably for a long period of time directly from the dicarboxylic acids by hydrogenation thereof, not through esterification thereof.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Prior Art</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Diols are very important compounds which are widely used as raw materials for polyester resins, urethane foams, urethane coating materials, adhesives and the like in various industrial fields. Diols are commercially produced in large amounts. The production of diols is conducted mainly by a method which comprises subjecting a dicarboxylic diester to hydrogenation. Hereinbelow, an explanation is made with respect to the production of diols by this method involving hydrogenation of a dicarboxylic diester, taking production of 1,4-butanediol as an example.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As a method for producing 1,4-butanediol, a method is known in which two hydroxyl groups are introduced into n-butane to thereby produce 1,4-butanediol. This<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> method is very disadvantageous from an economical viewpoint. Therefore, at present, it is virtually impossible to produce 1,4-butanediol on a commercial scale by the above-mentioned method. For this reason, at present, 1,4-butanediol is produced from n-butane by a method comprising: subjecting n-butane to air oxidation to produce succinic acid, maleic acid, succinic anhydride or maleic anhydride, especially maleic acid or maleic anhydride; and producing 1,4-butanediol from the thus produced acid or acid anhydride.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In general, a dicarboxylic acid, such as maleic acid, can be easily converted to a diol by a reduction reaction. In the reduction reaction, generally, an appropriate reducing agent is used. Usually, the reduction reaction of a dicarboxylic acid requires the use of a strong reducing agent having extremely high reactivity, such as lithium aluminum hydride. Special care must be taken in the handling and storage of such a strong reducing agent. Therefore, such a strong reducing agent is not suitable for use in the commercial scale production of a diol.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">On the other hand, the so-called hydrogenation reaction, i.e., a reduction reaction performed using hydrogen gas as a reducing agent in the presence of an appropriate catalyst, is suitable for practice on a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> commercial scale. However, usually, the hydrogenation reaction cannot be applied to the reduction of a dicarboxylic acid. This is because the conventional catalyst used for hydrogenation is soluble in a dicarboxylic acid, so that the catalytic activity of the catalyst cannot be maintained in the presence of a dicarboxylic acid.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Therefore, at present, the production of 1,4-butanediol is performed by a method in which maleic acid or maleic anhydride obtained by air oxidation of n-butane is reacted with an appropriate alcohol to obtain a maleic diester, and the obtained maleic diester is subjected to a hydrogenation reaction in the presence of a copper-containing catalyst under high temperature and high pressure conditions, to thereby convert the diester to 1,4-butanediol.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The method for producing an alcohol by the hydrogenation of an ester in the presence of a copper-containing catalyst under high temperature and high pressure conditions is described in, for example, Japanese Patent Application prior-to-examination Publication (Kohyo) No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2000510837A"><text>2000-510837</text></patcit> (corresponding to <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6100410A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,100,410</text></patcit>), Japanese Patent Application prior-to-examination Publication (Kohyo) No.<patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2000510475A"><text> 2000-510475</text></patcit> (corresponding to <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6077964A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,077,964</text></patcit>),<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Japanese Patent Application prior-to-examination Publication (Kohyo) No. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2000506134A"><text>2000-506134 </text></patcit>(corresponding to <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US5981769A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,981,769</text></patcit>), Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Specification No.<patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="JP7196558A"><text> 7-196558</text></patcit> (corresponding to <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US5414159A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,414,159</text></patcit>) and <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US5334779A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,334,779</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, in any of the methods of these patent documents, three steps (i.e., production of a dicarboxylic acid, esterification of the produced dicarboxylic acid, and hydrogenation of the produced ester) are required, so that the process for producing an alcohol inevitably becomes complicated. The complicated process poses a problem in that the process needs a number of apparatuses, such as an apparatus for the esterification of the dicarboxylic acid and an apparatus for separating, recovering and recycling an alcohol which is by-produced in the step for hydrogenation of the ester, wherein the alcohol is that which has been used in the esterification of the dicarboxylic acid.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">As is understood from the above, the production of a diol by the hydrogenation of a diester is disadvantageous from the viewpoint of the production cost and the like. Therefore, various studies have been made with respect to the method for simplifying the process for producing a diol.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As an example of such a method, there can be mentioned a method in which a dicarboxylic acid (but not an ester thereof) is directly subjected to hydrogenation using a catalyst which can maintain its catalytic activity even in the presence of an acid, to thereby obtain a diol.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In this method, a diol can be obtained by a two-step process, i.e., a process comprising the steps of producing a dicarboxylic acid and then hydrogenating the produced dicarboxylic acid. In this method, esterification of a dicarboxylic acid (such esterification is required in the conventional process) is not required, so that an apparatus for the esterification is not required. Further, since this method does not involve esterification, this method is free from the problem that an alcohol (used in the esterification) is by-produced in the hydrogenation of the ester, and therefore this method does not need an apparatus for recovering and recycling the by-produced alcohol. As a result, the process for producing a diol can be simplified, and plant and equipment required for practicing the process can also be considerably simplified.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A number of proposals have been made with respect not only to catalysts for use in the hydrogenation of a dicarboxylic acid to produce a diol and but also to<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> methods for producing a diol using such catalysts. Some of these proposals are concerned with technologies for producing 1,4-butanediol by the direct hydrogenation of succinic acid or maleic acid. In these technologies, usually, the hydrogenation is performed in the presence of water. Only the catalyst systems used in these technologies are enumerated below.

<patcit id="pcit0025" dnum="EP0712830A"><text>EP 0712830</text></patcit> discloses a method for obtaining adipic acid from an aqueous nitric acid mother liquor that arises during an industrial adipic acid production, wherein the method involves a step for removing nitric acid from the aqueous nitric acid mother liquor by evaporation.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">An aqueous by-product solution containing a dicarboxylic acid mixture, wherein the aqueous by-product solution is obtained in an adipic acid production process, has little utility. However, if it becomes possible for such an aqueous by-product solution to be used as a raw material for a hy-drogenation<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> reaction to produce diols which are useful as raw materials for polyurethanes and polyesters, a great commercial advantage would be obtained. This point is more specifically described below.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Adipic acid is produced by a process in which a cyclic aliphatic compound, such as cyclohexanone or cyclohexanol, is subjected to oxidation with nitric acid to thereby obtain an aqueous reaction mixture containing adipic acid, and the adipic acid contained in the aqueous mixture is subjected to crystal deposition, and the deposited crystals are then isolated from the reaction mixture to obtain an aqueous by-product solution. This aqueous by-product solution is an aqueous solution containing a dicarboxylic acid mixture comprising succinic acid, glutaric acid and adipic acid. An esterification product of this aqueous by-product solution has been used as a solvent, but the demand for such an esterification product as a solvent is not so large and, therefore, at present, a part of the aqueous by-product solution is discarded as a waste. However, if the aqueous by-product solution containing a dicarboxylic acid mixture, wherein the by-product solution is obtained in an adipic acid production process, can be used as a raw material for a hydrogenation reaction, there can be produced diols (specifically 1,4-butanediol,<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> 1,5-pentanediol and 1,6-hexanediol) which are useful as raw materials for polyurethanes and polyesters. This is a great commercial advantage.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">However, in the studies by the present inventors, it has been found that, when an aqueous by-product solution containing a dicarboxylic acid mixture, wherein the by-product solution is obtained in an adipic acid production process, is directly subjected to hydrogenation, the catalytic activity of a catalyst used is markedly lowered in accordance with the lapse of the reaction time. Therefore, conventionally, there has not been practiced a method in which diols are produced on a commercial scale from an aqueous by-product solution containing a dicarboxylic acid mixture, wherein the by-product solution is obtained in an adipic acid production process.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">In this situation, the present inventors have made extensive and intensive studies with a view toward developing a method for efficiently producing diols stably for a long period of time, in which an aqueous by-product solution containing a dicarboxylic acid mixture, wherein the by-product solution is obtained in an adipic acid production process, is used as a raw material<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> for a hydrogenation reaction. As a result, it has unexpectedly been found that diols can be efficiently produced stably for a long period of time without a lowering of the catalytic activity of a catalyst, by a method which comprises: providing a dicarboxylic acid mixture having a nitric acid content which does not exceed a specific value, wherein the dicarboxylic acid mixture is prepared by denitrating an aqueous by-product solution obtained in an adipic acid production process; and subjecting the dicarboxylic acid mixture to hydrogenation in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst containing an active metal species comprising ruthenium and tin. Further, it has also unexpectedly been found that, in the above-mentioned method, the stability of the diol production can be further increased (i.e., efficient diol production can be performed for a longer period of time) by performing an additional step for reducing to a specific level or less the amounts of further impurities, such as metal values (e.g. copper values and vanadium values) and sulfur values, which are contained in the dicarboxylic acid mixture.

In such a process, in addition to adipic acid which is a desired compound, other dicarboxylic acids, i.e., succinic acid, glutaric<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> acid, malonic acid and oxalic acid, and a small amount of a tinting substance are formed as by-products. These by-products exhibit a high solubility in water. Therefore, simply by cooling a reaction mixture obtained by the above-mentioned oxidation to room temperature or lower, deposition of crystals of adipic acid in the reaction mixture occurs. The deposited crystals of the adipic acid are isolated from the reaction mixture by filtration, wherein the resultant filtrate (aqueous by-product solution) contains the above-mentioned by-products, as well as nitric acid and oxidation catalyst. Generally, this aqueous by-product solution is condensed, followed by addition of an appropriate amount of further nitric acid, and the resultant is recycled to the reaction system for producing adipic acid. However, when the recycle of the aqueous by-product solution is repeated, the by-product concentration of the reaction mixture is increased, thereby lowering the purity of the desired adipic acid.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In order to prevent the lowering of the purity of adipic acid, generally, a part of the aqueous by-product solution is withdrawn from the production system for adipic acid. From the withdrawn aqueous by-product solution, useful components are recovered, wherein, for example, the nitric acid is recovered by<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> distillation, and the catalyst is recovered by ionexchange. The remainder of the by-product solution is recovered as an aqueous by-product solution containing a dicarboxylic acid mixture. The aqueous by-product solution containing a dicarboxylic acid mixture is comprised mainly of succinic acid, glutaric acid and adipic acid which has not been recovered. Conventionally, these dicarboxylic acids are esterified and the resultant esters are used as solvents and the like.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">By contrast, in the present invention, as a raw material in the process for producing a diol mixture, an aqueous by-product solution obtained in an adipic acid production process is used, wherein the adipic acid production process comprises subjecting at least one C<sub>6</sub> cyclic aliphatic compound to oxidation with nitric acid in an aqueous medium in the presence of an oxidation catalyst to thereby obtain an aqueous reaction mixture, depositing crystals of the adipic acid in the reaction mixture, and isolating the deposited crystals from the reaction mixture to obtain the aqueous by-product solution. In the present invention, the aqueous by-product solution may be either an aqueous solution obtained by removing adipic acid from the above-mentioned reaction mixture obtained in the adipic acid production process or an aqueous solution obtained<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> by recovering, from the above-mentioned reaction mixture, useful components (such as the nitric acid and the catalyst) as well as the adipic acid. In the aqueous by-product solution used in the present invention, the concentration of the dicarboxylic acids is generally from 5 to 40 % by weight, and the dicarboxylic acids contained therein mainly include succinic acid and glutaric acid which have been by-produced, and adipic acid which has not been recovered. In the aqueous by-product solution, generally, the concentrations of succinic acid, glutaric acid and adipic acid are, respectively, from about 15 to about 35 % by weight, from about 45 to about 75 % by weight and from about 3 to about 40 % by weight, each based on the total weight of succinic acid, glutaric acid and adipic acid. In addition, the aqueous by-product solution contains nitric acid which has not been recovered, copper and/or vanadium derived from the catalyst used in the oxidation using nitric acid, and small amounts of other impurities. The nitric acid content of the aqueous by-product solution varies depending on the conditions employed for recovering the nitric acid, but is generally about 6 % by weight or more, based on the total weight of succinic acid, glutaric acid and adipic acid. Further, the aqueous by-product solution assumes a yellow<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> color which is considered to be due to the impurities present in the solution.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the present invention, as mentioned above, the diol mixture is produced using the aqueous by-product solution obtained in the above-mentioned adipic acid production process. More specifically, the diol mixture is produced by providing a dicarboxylic acid mixture which is prepared by denitrating the aqueous by-product solution to adjust the nitric acid content of the solution to 0,2 % by weight or less, based on the total weight of the succinic, glutaric and adipic acids, followed by subjecting the dicarboxylic acid mixture to hydrogenation.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">With respect to the dicarboxylic acid mixture used in the present invention, the nitric acid content thereof is 0.2 % by weight or less, preferably 0.05 % by weight or less, based on the total weight of the succinic, glutaric and adipic acids. It is most preferred that the nitric acid is completely removed from the dicarboxylic acid mixture; however, it is not practical to completely remove the nitric acid, since it is necessary to repeatedly conduct a treatment, such as a heat treatment or a treatment using an ion exchange resin. In a treatment generally conducted, it is difficult to<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> achieve a lowering of the nitric acid content to a level as low as less than about 0.01 ppm. When the nitric acid content of the dicarboxylic acid mixture is more than 0,2 % by weight, the activity of the hydrogenation catalyst used in the production of the diol mixture is lowered with time, so that it becomes impossible to produce the diol mixture stably for a long period of time. The influence of the nitric acid on the hydrogenation reaction has not yet been elucidated, but it is considered that a part of the metal species of the hydrogenation catalyst is eluted under the influence of the nitric acid to thereby lower the catalytic activity. Whether or not the elution of the metal species occurs due to the presence of nitric acid depends on the atmosphere in which the catalyst is present. For example, it is known that a stainless steel has a passive film formed on the surface thereof and, hence, will not be corroded even in the presence of nitric acid. However, it is considered that, under the hydrogenation conditions employed in the present invention, since the catalyst is present in a reducing atmosphere containing hydrogen, the passive film on the surface of a metal becomes unstable to cause the elution of the metal in the presence of nitric acid.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">With respect to the removal of nitric acid from<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> the aqueous by-product solution obtained in the adipic acid production process, any of the conventional methods can be employed. As an example of the method for removing nitric acid from the aqueous by-product solution, there can be mentioned a method in which the aqueous by-product solution is heated at a temperature of from 80 to 200 °C under atmospheric or lower pressure which is not less than about 80 kPa. More specifically, in this method, by heating the aqueous by-product solution in an evaporator at a temperature of from 80 to 130 °C under atmospheric or less pressure which is not less than 80 kPa, the nitric acid is removed together with water by azeotropic distillation. In this case, when the amount of water is smaller than that of nitric acid, the nitric acid concentration in the evaporator after removal of all of the water by azeotropic distillation becomes high. The high nitric acid concentration in the evaporator does not necessarily cause a problem; however, for continuing the azeotropic distillation after removal of all of the water, it is preferred that the removal of nitric acid by azeotropic distillation is conducted while adding water to the evaporator. As another example of the method for removing nitric acid from the aqueous by-product solution, there can be mentioned a method in which the<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> aqueous by-product solution is heated at a temperature of from 100 to 200 °C, preferably from 130 to 180 °C, under approximately atmospheric pressure to distill off nitric acid from the aqueous by-product solution. In this method, at an initial stage of the distillation, nitric acid is distilled in the form of an azeotropic mixture thereof with water. As a further example of the method for removing nitric acid form the aqueous by-product solution, there can be mentioned a method using an anion exchange resin. The above-mentioned methods can be used individually or in combination. Especially preferred for removing nitric acid from the aqueous by-product solution is a method in which the aqueous by-product solution is heated at a temperature of from 100 to 130 °C under atmospheric pressure for 10 minutes to 3 hours to distill off most of nitric acid and water, followed by heating at a temperature of from higher than 130 °C to 200 °C, preferably from 160 to 180 °C, for 1 minute to 1 hour. This method is simple and, hence, is preferred. In this method, especially by heating at a temperature of from 160 to 180 °C, not only nitric acid but also a part of the below-described impurity component having an oxygen-nitrogen bond can be removed. Further, with respect to this especially preferred method, the reason why the heating is conducted<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> in two stages is that the desirable time for heating differs between the heating conducted at a temperature of from 100 to 130 °C and the heating conducted at a temperature of from higher than 130 °C to 200 °C. The above-method using an anion exchange resin is also effective; however, when the amount of nitric acid to be removed is large, it becomes necessary to use a large amount of an anion exchange resin, so that large amount of labor becomes necessary to regenerate the anion exchange resin. The method using an anion exchange resin is effective for removing nitric acid which is present in a very small amount. Further, when the nitric acid content of the aqueous by-product solution is from several % by weight to about 10 % by weight, it is also possible to use a method in which nitric acid is neutralized by a hydroxide, carbonate, hydrogencarbonate or the like of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal (e.g., caustic soda).</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Alternatively, by subjecting the aqueous by-product solution to reduction treatment, it is possible to remove nitric acid together with the impurity component having an oxygen-nitrogen bond. Specifically, the nitric acid and the impurity component having an oxygen-nitrogen bond, which are contained in the aqueous by-product solution, can be removed by subjecting the<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> aqueous by-product solution to a reduction treatment comprising contacting the aqueous by-product solution with hydrogen gas in the presence of a reduction catalyst containing an active metal species comprising at least one metal selected from the group consisting of metals of Groups 7 to 10 of the Periodic Table, to thereby reduce and/or decompose the nitric acid and the impurity component having an oxygen-nitrogen bond. The conditions for the reduction treatment are not particularly limited so long as the nitric acid is removed and neither reduction nor decomposition of the dicarboxylic acids occurs. However, it is preferred that the reduction treatment is conducted at a temperature of from 50 to 200 °C, more advantageously from 100 to 180 °C.<br/>
When the reduction treatment is conducted at a temperature lower than 50 °C, it is likely that the reaction rate becomes low, so that a very long time is needed to effect the reduction satisfactorily. On the other hand, when the reduction treatment is conducted at a temperature higher than 200 °C, it is likely that the dicarboxylic acids are also reduced or decomposed depending on the time of the treatment. With respect to the hydrogen gas pressure for the reduction treatment, the hydrogen gas pressure is preferably from 0.2 to 5 MPa, more preferably from 1 to 4 MPa. When the hydrogen gas<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> pressure is lower than 0.2 MPa, it becomes difficult to effect the reduction satisfactorily. On the other hand, when the hydrogen gas pressure is higher than 5 MPa, disadvantages are likely to be caused that it is necessary to use an expensive apparatus for conducting the reduction treatment, and that the dicarboxylic acids are decomposed. The time needed for the reduction treatment is generally from several minutes to several tens of hours, preferably 10 minutes to 5 hours. With respect to the manner for contacting the aqueous by-product solution with hydrogen gas, there is no particular limitation. For example, the contacting can be effected either in a batchwise manner using an agitation vessel or in a continuous manner using a fixed-bed reaction column.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">With respect to the reduction catalyst used in the reduction treatment for removal of nitric acid, which contains an active metal species comprising at least one metal selected from the group consisting of metals of Groups 7 to 10 of the Periodic Table, such a catalyst is generally used in a hydrogenation reaction. It is preferred that the active metal species contained in the reduction catalyst is at least one metal selected from the group consisting of platinum, rhenium, palladium, rhodium, nickel, iridium and ruthenium. From the<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> viewpoint of the activity of the reduction catalyst, it is more preferred that the active metal species contained in the reduction catalyst is at least one metal selected from the group consisting of platinum, rhenium, palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium.

Examples of such conventional methods include a dipping method and an ion exchange<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> method. The metal compounds used as sources for the active metal species may vary depending on the method for producing the catalyst. Representative examples of metal compounds include an inorganic acid salt, such as a nitrate, a sulfate, and a chloride; an organic acid salt, such as an acetate; a hydroxide; an oxide; and an organometallic compound. In the reduction catalyst comprising a carrier having carried thereon the active metal species, the amount of the active metal species is 0.5 to 50 % by weight, based on the weight of the carrier.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Further, as the reduction catalyst for removing nitric acid, it is also possible to use a catalyst containing an active metal species comprising ruthenium and tin, which is described below in detail and is used as a hydrogenation catalyst in the hydrogenation for producing the diol mixture. In this case, the catalyst which has been used in the reduction treatment, as such, can be used in the hydrogenation. However, generally, when a catalyst is used for a long period of time, it is possible that a lowering of the catalytic activity occurs. Therefore, in the present invention, separately supplied catalysts are generally used in the reduction treatment and the hydrogenation, respectively. When the reduction treatment of the aqueous by-product<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> solution is conducted in a batchwise manner using an agitation vessel, it is preferred to use the reduction catalyst in an amount of 0.01 to 50 parts by weight, relative to 100 parts by weight of the aqueous by-product solution. The amount of the reduction catalyst can be appropriately selected in accordance with the reduction treatment conditions, such as a treatment temperature and a treatment pressure.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Further, it is preferred that, with respect to the dicarboxylic acid mixture used in the present invention, the copper content thereof is controlled to 10 ppm by weight or less, more advantageously 5 ppm by weight or less, and the vanadium content thereof is controlled to 10 ppm by weight or less, more advantageously 5 ppm by weight or less, each based on the total weight of succinic, glutaric and adipic acids. The forms of the compounds containing copper and vanadium, which are present in the aqueous by-product solution, are not clearly known. In the present invention, the copper content and the vanadium content are, respectively, measured in terms of the amounts of a copper atom and a vanadium atom. Each of copper and vanadium is derived from the oxidation catalyst used in the adipic acid production process. When a diol mixture is produced using as a raw material a dicarboxylic acid mixture<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> having high contents of copper and vanadium, the copper and vanadium values are accumulated on the active metal species of the hydrogenation catalyst to decrease the surface area of the catalyst, so that the activity of the catalyst is lowered. It is most preferred that the copper and vanadium values are completely removed from the dicarboxylic acid mixture; however, it is not practical to completely remove the copper and vanadium values, since it is necessary to repeatedly conduct a treatment, such as a treatment using a cation exchange resin.

Illustratively stated, in the method using a cation exchange resin, an aqueous by-product solution (or an aqueous solution obtained by addition of ion-exchanged water to a solid dicarboxylic acid mixture<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> which is, as explained below, obtained during the purification of the aqueous by-product solution) is contacted with the cation exchange resin at a temperature of from room temperature to 100 °C, to thereby remove the copper and vanadium values.

Such a cation exchange resin is contacted with the aqueous by-product solution (or the above-mentioned aqueous solution obtained by adding ion-exchanged water) by agitation-mixing or by using a packed column having packed therein a cation exchange resin, wherein the cation exchange resin is used in an amount of from 1 to 100 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the dicarboxylic acids contained.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Further, with respect to the dicarboxylic acid mixture used in the present invention, the sulfur content thereof is preferably controlled to 200 ppm by weight or less, more preferably to 40 ppm by weight or less, most preferably to 20 ppm by weight or less, based on the total weight of the succinic, glutaric and adipic acids. When a diol mixture is produced using as a raw material a dicarboxylic acid mixture having a high sulfur content, sulfur compounds are accumulated<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> on the active metal species of the hydrogenation catalyst to decrease the surface area of the catalyst, so that the activity of the catalyst is lowered. It is most preferred that the sulfur values are completely removed from the dicarboxylic acid mixture; however, it is not practical to completely remove the sulfur values, since it is necessary to repeatedly conduct a treatment, such as a treatment using an anion exchange resin. In a treatment generally conducted, it is difficult to reduce the sulfur content of a level as low as less than about 0.2 ppm.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In the dicarboxylic acid mixture, the sulfur values are considered to be present in the form of sulfate group-containing compounds or the like; however, actually, the forms of sulfur-containing compounds present in the dicarboxylic acid mixture are not clearly known. Further, the reason why the sulfur values are contained in the dicarboxylic acid mixture is also not clearly known. However, it is presumed that, when a cation exchange resin having a sulfonic acid group is used for removing copper values and vanadium values, sulfur-containing impurities are eluted into the dicarboxylic acid mixture by liberation of the sulfonic groups or decomposition of the sulfonic group-containing polymer chain of the cation exchange resin. This presumption<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> is supported by the fact that the sulfur values can be removed by an anion exchange resin.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">With respect to a method for the removal of the sulfur-containing compounds from the aqueous by-product solution obtained in the adipic acid production process, there is no particular limitation. However, the removal of the sulfur-containing compounds can be effectively performed by a method in which the aqueous by-product solution is contacted with an anion exchange resin. In this method, when the removal of the sulfur-containing compounds is conducted with respect to a solid dicarboxylic acid mixture (which is, as explained below, obtained during the purification of the aqueous by-product solution), anion-exchanged water is added to the dicarboxylic acid mixture to obtain an aqueous solution containing 5 to 50 % by weight of the dicarboxylic acid mixture, and the obtained aqueous solution is contacted with an anion exchange resin. As the anion exchange resin, it is preferred to use a styrene polymer or an acrylic polymer, which has a quaternary ammonium salt as a functional group. Further, if desired, a weakly basic ion exchange resin can also be used. As the weakly basic ion exchange resin, a styrene polymer or an acrylic polymer, which has a tertiary amine as a functional group, can be used. In the<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --> method using an anion exchange resin, the anion exchange resin is contacted with the dicarboxylic acid mixture by agitation-mixing or by using a packed column having the anion exchange resin packed therein, wherein the anion exchange resin is used in an amount of 1 to 100 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the dicarboxylic acid mixture.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Further, in the present invention, it is preferred that the dicarboxylic acid mixture in the form of a solution thereof in distilled water exhibits an absorption coefficient of advantageously 0.3 or less, more advantageously 0.1 or less, most advantageously 0.03 or less, as measured at 355 nm, wherein the absorption coefficient is determined by the following formula: <maths id="math0002" num=""><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">E</mi><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">A</mi><mo>/</mo><mfenced><mi>c x b</mi></mfenced></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="40" he="6" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths>wherein
<ul><li>E represents the absorption coefficient as measured at 355 nm,</li><li>A represents the absorbance of the solution of the dicarboxylic acid mixture in distilled water at room temperature,</li><li>c represents the amount (g) of the dicarboxylic acid mixture dissolved in 100 g of distilled water, and</li><li>b represents the length (cm) of a cell used for measuring the absorbance.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --></p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The absorption observed at 355 nm is not ascribed to succinic, glutaric and adipic acids. Therefore, it is apparent that this absorption is ascribed to an impurity contained in the dicarboxylic acid mixture. The present inventors have not yet determined the molecular structure of this impurity; however, from the literature (for example, <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Zh. Prikl. Khim. Leningrad, Vol.47, No.4, p.862-865, 1974</text></nplcit>), it is considered that the impurity is any one of dinitrophenols (such as 2,5-dinitrophenol, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and 2,6-dinitrophenol), trinitrophenols, 1-nitrocyclohexene, and 2-nitrocyclohexenol, or a mixture thereof, and that the impurity is by-produced during the oxidation conducted using nitric acid in the adipic acid production process. As described above, each dicarboxylic acid in the dicarboxylic acid mixture, which is a raw material for the production of a diol mixture, exhibits no absorption at 355 nm. Therefore, it is most preferred that the above-mentioned absorption coefficient as measured at 355 nm is 0. However, it is not practical to obtain an absorption coefficient of 0 as measured at 355 nm, since it is necessary to repeatedly conduct a treatment, such as a treatment using an activated carbon or an ion exchange resin, which is very cumbersome. In a treatment generally conducted, it is difficult to<!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --> decrease the absorption coefficient at 355 nm to a level of lower than about 0.0001.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">With respect to a method for removing the impurity which exhibits an absorption as measured at 355 nm, there is no particular limitation, and any of the conventional decoloring methods can be used. For example, the removal of the impurity can be conducted by a method in which the aqueous by-product solution is treated with an anion adsorptive substance, followed by heating at 120 to 200 °C (see Examined Japanese Patent application Publication No.<patcit id="pcit0026" dnum="JP53041652A"><text> 53-41652</text></patcit>). Examples of anion adsorptive substances include an activated carbon, an anion exchange resin and a liquid anion-exchanger. The liquid anion-exchanger is at least one amine selected from a group consisting of primary, secondary and tertiary water-insoluble amines, having a molecular weight of from 200 to 500.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">For example, the removal of the impurity by using an activated carbon can be conducted as follows. A powdery or granular activated carbon is mixed with the aqueous by-product solution, wherein the activated carbon is used in an amount of from 1 to 20 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the dicarboxylic acids contained in the aqueous by-product solution, and the resultant mixture is stirred for 5 minutes to 2<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> hours, followed by separation of the activated carbon by filtration. With respect to the removal of the impurity by using an anion exchange resin, the removal of the impurity can be conducted in the same manner as in the removal of the sulfur values by using an anion exchange resin, which is explained above. The removal of the impurity by using a liquid anion-exchanger can be conducted as follows. A liquid anion-exchanger, such as tri-n-octylamine, is dissolved in a water-insoluble organic solvent to obtain an adsorptive solution having a liquid anion-exchanger content of from 0.1 to 10 % by weight, and the resultant adsorptive solution is contacted with the aqueous by-product solution, wherein the liquid anion-exchanger is used in an amount of from 1 to 30 % by weight, based on the weight of the dicarboxylic acids contained in the aqueous by-product solution. As examples of appropriate water-insoluble organic solvents, there can be mentioned carbon tetrachloride, Perclene, Trichlene and a liquid paraffin. The contacting of the adsorptive solution with the aqueous by-product solution can be conducted using an apparatus which is generally employed for a liquid-to-liquid contact. Examples of such apparatuses include an extraction column and a mixer-settler extractor. Further, the present inventors have found that the<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> absorption coefficient can be lowered by a treatment which comprises adding a C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>14</sub> aromatic hydrocarbon having a boiling point of 200 °C or less (as measured under atmospheric pressure) to a dehydrated and denitrated dicarboxylic acid mixture, heating the resultant mixture at a temperature which is not higher than the boiling point of the aromatic hydrocarbon, followed by cooling, and recovering from the resultant mixture the dehydrated and denitrated dicarboxylic acid mixture by filtration. By the above-mentioned treatment of the dehydrated and denitrated dicarboxylic acid mixture with an aromatic hydrocarbon, sulfur values can also be removed from the denitrated dicarboxylic acid mixture. Therefore, the treatment with an aromatic hydrocarbon can be employed instead of the above-mentioned treatment for removing sulfur values with an anion exchange resin. Examples of C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>14</sub> aromatic hydrocarbons having a boiling point of 200 °C or less, which can be used in this treatment, include benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, isopropylbenzene, propylbenzene, trimethylbenzene and butylbenzene. Of these, benzene, toluene and xylene are preferred for the following reason. Each of benzene, toluene and xylene has a low boiling point. Therefore, even if any of these aromatic hydrocarbons remain in the dicarboxylic acid mixture which<!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --> has been recovered by filtration, the aromatic hydrocarbons can be easily removed from the dicarboxylic acid mixture by, for example, heating under a reduced pressure. It is preferred that the amount of the aromatic hydrocarbon used is 0.5 to 20 times the total weight of succinic, glutaric and adipic acids contained in the dicarboxylic acid mixture. When the amount of the aromatic hydrocarbon is less than 0.5 time the total weight of the succinic, glutaric and adipic acids, the effect of decoloration of the dicarboxylic acid mixture becomes markedly lowered. As the amount of the aromatic hydrocarbon is increased, the effect of decoloration of the dicarboxylic acid mixture tends to be increased. However, when the amount of the aromatic hydrocarbon is larger than 20 times the total weight of the succinic, glutaric and adipic acids, the effect of decoloration cannot be improved any longer, as compared to the case where the amount of the aromatic hydrocarbon is 20 times. Therefore, in such a case, only a disadvantage is caused that the amount of the aromatic hydrocarbon which needs to be recovered and treated for recycling is increased.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Further, it is noted that the tinting substances (which include the below-mentioned impurity component having an oxygen-nitrogen bond) can also be removed<!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --> from the aqueous by-product solution by the above-mentioned reduction treatment for denitration. Specifically, the tinting substances can be removed from the aqueous by-product solution by contacting the aqueous by-product solution with hydrogen gas in the presence of a reduction catalyst containing an active metal species comprising at least one metal selected from the group consisting of metals of Groups 7 to 10 of the Periodic Table, thereby reducing and/or decomposing the tinting substances.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Further, in the present invention, it is preferred that the dicarboxylic acid mixture contains an impurity component having an oxygen-nitrogen bond in an amount of 2,000 ppm by weight or less, more advantageously 1,200 ppm by weight or less, in terms of the amount of nitric acid, based on the total weight of the succinic, glutaric and adipic acids. In the present invention, the term "impurity component having an oxygen-nitrogen bond" is used to indicate organic compounds having a functional group (such as -NO<sub>2</sub>, -NH-NO<sub>2</sub> or =N-OH) having an oxygen-nitrogen bond, and nitrogen oxide type inorganic compounds (such as nitrous acid) excluding nitric acid.<!-- EPO <DP n="51"> --></p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The amount of the impurity component having an oxygen-nitrogen bond contained in the dicarboxylic acid mixture is obtained as follows. NaOH is added to an aqueous solution of the dicarboxylic acid mixture (containing both the originally present nitric acid and the impurity component having an oxygen-nitrogen bond), followed by heating. From the resultant mixture are removed volatile components, such as ammonia. Then, the resultant mixture is subjected to a reduction treatment with Devarda's alloy, and the amount of ammonia produced in the reduction treatment is determined. The determined amount of ammonia produced is expressed in terms of the weight of nitric acid. The obtained weight of nitric acid corresponds to the total of the weight of the nitric acid which has been originally present in the dicarboxylic acid mixture and the weight of the nitric acid which corresponds to the amount of the ammonia produced from the impurity compounds (except the nitric acid) having an oxygen-nitrogen bond. From the thus obtained total weight (in terms of the weight of nitric acid) of compounds having an oxygen-nitrogen bond (including both the originally present nitric acid and the impurity component having an oxygen-nitrogen bond) is subtracted a separately measured weight of the nitric acid which has been originally present in the dicarboxylic acid mixture to obtain the amount (in terms of the weight of nitric acid) of the impurity component having an oxygen-nitrogen bond (which does not include nitric acid). Some of the compounds as the impurity component having an oxygen-nitrogen bond exhibit an absorbance at a wavelength of 355 nm. The impurities, such as the impurity component having an oxygen-nitrogen bond, are considered to be by-produced by the<!-- EPO <DP n="52"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="53"> --> oxidation reaction with nitric acid in the adipic acid production process. It is most preferred that the impurity component having an oxygen-nitrogen bond is completely removed from the aqueous by-product solution; however, it is not practical to completely remove the impurity component having an oxygen-nitrogen bond, since, in order to completely remove the impurity component having an oxygen-nitrogen bond, it is necessary to repeatedly conduct a treatment with an activated carbon, which is very cumbersome. In a treatment generally conducted, the amount of the impurity component having an oxygen-nitrogen bond contained in the dicarboxylic acid mixture cannot be reduced to a level of lower than about 50 ppm in terms of the amount of nitric acid, based on the total weight of the succinic, glutaric and adipic acids.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The compound having an oxygen-nitrogen bond can be removed from the aqueous by-product solution by the method as used for denitration. Specifically, the compound can be removed by a method in which the aqueous by-product solution is heated at a temperature of from 80 to 200 °C under atmospheric pressure to a reduced pressure of about 80 kPa. Alternatively, the compound can be removed by a method in which the aqueous by-product solution is subjected to a reduction treatment<!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --> in the presence of a reduction catalyst containing an active metal species comprising at least one metal selected from the group consisting of metals of Groups 7 to 10 of the Periodic Table. The present inventors made studies with respect to a method for removing the impurity component having an oxygen-nitrogen bond, especially an organic compound having a functional group containing an oxygen-nitrogen bond. As a result, it has been found that it is effective to use a method in which the aqueous by-product solution is contacted with an activated carbon.

As a preferred example of methods for denitrating the aqueous by-product solution, there can be mentioned a method in which the aqueous by-product solution is heated at a temperature of from 80 to 200 °C under atmospheric or lower pressure. Specifically, this method comprises heating the aqueous by-product solution at a temperature of from 80 to 130 °C under atmospheric or lower pressure for about 10 minutes to about 3 hours, followed by heating at a temperature of from higher than 130 °C to 180 °C under atmospheric pressure for about 1 minute to about 1 hour.
