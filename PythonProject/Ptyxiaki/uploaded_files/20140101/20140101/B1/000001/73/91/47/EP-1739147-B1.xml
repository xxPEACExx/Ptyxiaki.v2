The present invention relates also to a release liner. In particular, the present invention relates to a release liner for an adhesive sheet, having embosses and being excellent in terms of smoothness. The present invention relates further to an adhesive sheet with a release liner, comprising the aforementioned adhesive sheet and the aforementioned release liner.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">An adhesive sheet comprising an adhesive layer on one side of a resin film is covered with a release liner and stored. Generally, a release liner which is composed of paper or an drawn resin film such as drawn PET or OPP has a shrinkage rate of from about 0 to 0.2 % when it is stored at ambient temperature for more than three months. Meanwhile, a resin film for an adhesive sheet is formed in a heat rolling or extruding process and sometimes shrinks by about 1 % or more under the same storage conditions as mentioned above. As a result, after storage, wrinkles or curls appear on the adhesive sheet, or the edge of release liner runs out of the edge of the adhesive sheet since the dimension of the release liner does not change but that of the adhesive sheet does. These problematic phenomena deteriorate the appearance of the adhesive sheet.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Another problem is that when an adhesive sheet is applied on an article, air tends to remain between the adhesive layer of the adhesive sheet and the article, which also deteriorates the appearance of the adhesive sheet or impairs adhesion to an article. To resolve these problems, the following literature Nos. 1 - 6 disclose methods wherein an adhesive sheet is provided with small projections or concave-convex structure on a surface of the adhesive layer, or with continuous grooves as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> to<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> form paths for air to flow toward the side surfaces of the adhesive layer.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, the aforesaid deterioration of appearance caused by shrinkage of the resin film, which occurs when the adhesive sheet is stored together with a release liner thereon, still remains unsolved. Further, when the adhesive sheet with grooves on its adhesive layer as described above is applied to an article, the adhesive agent flows toward the grooves, so that the shape of the grooves on the adhesive layer changes. This change in the shape of the grooves and the flow of the adhesive agent near the grooves affect the appearance of the resin film which is located on the side opposite to the grooves of the adhesive layer, so that a crater-like pattern appears on the surface of the adhesive sheet as if the adhesive sheet is embossed, which significantly deteriorates the appearance of the adhesive sheet after applied.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Meanwhile, paper or a drawn resin film is used as a substrate for a release liner for an adhesive sheet.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For instance, in known release liners with a paper substrate, one or both sides of the paper is treated with a releasing agent such as silicone, or a polyolefin resin is laminated to one or both sides of the paper and the surface of the resin is treated with a releasing agent such as silicone. Paper surface tends to be unlevel. Therefore this is laminated with a polyolefin resin in order to make the unlevelness of the surface of paper less noticeable. Suppression of the concavity and convexity of the paper surface improves surface smoothness of a release liner and, accordingly, smoothness of an adhesive sheet. However, even when a polyolefin resin is laminated with paper, it is difficult to completely eliminate the concavity and convexity of paper. Accordingly, when a release liner with a paper substrate is applied to an adhesive sheet, the concavity and convexity on the release liner surface are transferred to the adhesive layer of the adhesive sheet, so that the adhesive sheet has a drawback that concavo-convex pattern appears on the surface of the adhesive sheet opposite to the side which is in contact with the release liner, when the adhesive sheet is applied to an article. Particularly, in a case of high gloss adhesive sheet which has a mirror-like surface with high gloss,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> such concavo-convex pattern on the surface deteriorate the mirror-like property and, therefore, such a release liner is unsuitable.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Also known is a release liner, where a surface of a polyolefin resin laminated to paper is treated with a releasing agent and further provided with embossing finish. This liner is suitable for use in adhesive sheets having grooves on the surface of the adhesive layer, but unsuitable for such a high gloss adhesive sheet that has a mirror-like surface with high gloss because concavo-convex pattern caused by paper still remains on the liner surface even when embossing finish is provided.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A release liner where a drawn resin film, such as a drawn PET or OPP, is used as a substrate is also known. A drawn resin film is good in smoothness and, therefore, even when it is applied to an adhesive sheet that has a mirror-like surface with high gloss, smoothness of the adhesive sheet is not impaired. However, the above-mentioned drawn resin film is less suitable for embossing and, therefore, may not be embossed. For instance, a drawn PET has a high melting point of 258 degrees C and, therefore, it is difficult to supply enough heat to PET to soften it for embossing with a heat roll or the like. If OPP is heated around a melting point, the heating causes significant shrinkage and, therefore, it may not be used as a release liner any more.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Also known is a release film where a release layer of polyolefin is laminated to a polyester film (see, for instance, Patent Literature 7). This release film may have concavo-convex surface caused by deposit of fine particles which are added to improve a sliding property and is not provided with embossing finish. The polyester film is from 5 to 100 micrometers thick.

Further the adhesive sheet has good appearance and an adequate adhesion force when it is applied to an article. The present invention also provides a release liner for the adhesive sheet.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Thus, the present invention provides an adhesive sheet comprising a resin film and an adhesive layer adhering to one side of the resin film, wherein the adhesive layer has one or more grooves on a side opposite to a side on which the adhesive layer adheres to the resin film, the groove or grooves exist only in an inner area of the opposite side of adhesive layer and are not open at side surfaces of the adhesive layer.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The aforementioned adhesive layer further has a groove or grooves which are open at the side surfaces of the adhesive layer on the aforementioned opposite side.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The present invention also provides a release liner, comprising a substrate film with a thickness of from 50 to 150 micrometers and a polyolefin resin-containing layer on one or both sides of the substrate film, with the polyolefin resin being not ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymers or ionomers thereof, wherein at least one of the polyolefin resin-containing layers has embosses on a side opposite to a side which is in contact with the substrate film; the substrate film comprises one or more selected from the group consisting of polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene terephthalate with inner cavities, copolymer of phthalic acid isomers and ethylene glycol, polyethylene naphthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, and polytrimethylene terephthalate; and the thickness of the polyolefin resin-containing layer is 10 micrometers or more and is at most 0.3 times the thickness of the substrate film when the polyolefin resin-containing layer exists<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> only on one side of the substrate film, or 10 micrometers or more and is at most 0.5 times the thickness of the substrate film, with the ratio of the thickness of the two layers being from 0.3 to 1, when the polyolefin resin-containing layers exist on both sides of the substrate film.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to another embodiment of the present invention, the aforementioned embosses are formed so that the surface comprising embosses has surface structure complementary to the adhesive layer of the aforementioned adhesive sheet.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The present invention also provides an adhesive sheet with a release liner comprising the aforementioned adhesive sheet and the aforementioned release liner.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">The adhesive sheet of the present invention comprises a resin film and an adhesive layer on one side thereof, wherein there is no difference in shrinkage rate between the resin film and the release liner and, therefore, a good appearance is maintained after stored with release liner thereon for a prolonged time, and the adhesive sheet has a good appearance and a good adhesion force when it is applied to an article.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The release liner of the present invention has embosses on its surface and, therefore, the release liner is useful as a release liner for an adhesive sheet having grooves on a surface of an adhesive layer. The release liner of the present invention is also good in smoothness and, therefore, it is useful, in particular, as a release liner for a high gloss adhesive sheet whose surface opposite to the adhesive layer is a mirror-like surface and has high gloss.</p><heading id="h0006"><b>PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">The adhesive sheet of the present invention will be elucidated by referring to the drawings.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> shows an adhesive sheet. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.2</figref>, Adhesive Sheet 1<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> comprises Adhesive Layer 3 adhering to one side of Resin Film 2, and the adhesive layer has one or more Grooves 4 on a surface opposite to the surface adhering to the resin film. In this embodiment, the aforementioned grooves exist only in an inner area of the aforementioned opposite side and are not open at the side surfaces of the adhesive layer.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">After it is stored for a prolonged time together with a release liner which has structure complementary to the surface structure of the adhesion layer, there is no difference in shrinkage rate between the Resin Film 2 and the release liner. This is because Grooves 4 engage with the complementary structure of the release liner, not shown in the figure, so that the shrinkage of the adhesive sheet is suppressed, which is referred to as "anchor effect".</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As described above, the adhesive agent flows generally towards the grooves in an adhesive layer of an adhesive sheet to deform the grooves on the surface of the adhesive layer. The deformation reaches the side adhering to a resin film to cause dents on the surface of the adhesive sheet. This deteriorates the appearance of the adhesive sheet after applied. However, in the adhesive sheet of the present invention, discontinuous grooves are present on the adhesive layer and therefore the deformation of the grooves, which is caused by the flow of the adhesive agent towards the grooves, is suppressed by the adhesive agent existing around the grooves. As a result, a good appearance is maintained after the adhesive sheet is applied to an article.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> shows the adhesive sheet according to the present invention. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig 3</figref>, the adhesive sheet of the present invention may further have Grooves 5 which are open at the side surfaces of the adhesive layer on the opposite side.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the above-described adhesive sheet, Grooves 4 are added to a conventional adhesive sheet having Grooves 5 only. By adding Grooves 4, the above-described anchor effect is obtained. The adhesive sheet has both Grooves 4 and 5. Therefore, when the deformation due to the flow of the adhesive agent reaches the resin<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> film, stress is delocalized more than in conventional adhesive sheets where Grooves 5 alone are provided for deaeration. Therefore, less dents appear on the surface of the adhesive sheet. Accordingly the adhesive sheet of the present invention can maintain good appearance after stored with a release liner thereon as well as after applied to an article.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The groove in the present invention may have any shape. Preferably its cross-section is selected from (a) rectangle, (b) trapezoid, (c) U-shaped form, and (d) triangle, each having a width of 5 to 100 micrometers and a depth of 5 to 50 micrometers, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>, where "w" means the width of the groove and "h" means the depth of the groove.

Examples of the adhesive agent include acrylic adhesives, urethane adhesives, polyester adhesives, and silicone adhesives. Preferred are acrylic adhesive and urethane adhesive. The thickness of the adhesive layer depends on the purpose of the adhesive sheet and preferably is in the range of from 5 to 50 micrometers.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In order to enhance the adhesion strength between the resin film and the adhesive layer in the adhesive sheet according to the present invention, the surface of the resin film to which the adhesive agent is to be applied may be subjected to primer coating, corona discharge treatment, plasma discharge treatment or the like in advance.

The lamination may be done in a heat lamination method, a wet or dry lamination method using an adhesive in combination with heat, or a method using a pressure-sensitive adhesive.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The adhesive sheet of the present invention can be manufactured in a common method. For example, it can be manufactured by applying a layer of an adhesive on a surface of a resin film and then laminating the adhesive layer with a release liner having surface structure complementary to the desired surface structure of the adhesive layer. Alternatively, it can be obtained by applying an adhesive on a release liner having a complementary surface structure to provide grooves on the adhesive layer, and then laminating the adhesive layer with a resin film.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In the following, the release liner of the present invention will be elucidated. The release liner of the present invention comprises a substrate film and a polyolefin resin-containing layer on one or both sides of the substrate film. The polyolefin resin-containing layer on said one or both sides has embosses on a side opposite to a side which is in contact with the substrate film.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The substrate film of the release liners of the present invention comprises one or more selected from the group consisting of polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene terephthalate with inner cavities, copolymer of phthalic acid isomers and ethylene glycol, polyethylene naphthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, trimethylene terephthalate, polyarylate, polyether ether ketone, polyether sulfone, polylactic acid, triacetyl cellulose, and polycarbonate. Preferably, the aforementioned film comprises polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene terephthalate with inner cavities or copolymer of phthalic acid isomers and ethylene glycol.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The aforementioned film preferably has flexural strength by loop stiffness of from 0.2 to 1.5 N/25mm and a yield point load of<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> from 50 to 200 N/10mm. If the aforementioned values are less than the lowest limits, the resulting release liner tends to cause curling at its edges and, therefore, the handling property is poor. Above the upper limits, the resulting release liner is too stiff for use as a release liner material.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The aforementioned film is preferably a biaxially drawn film. As a commercially available biaxially drawn film, mention may be made of Emblet S 125 from Unitika and Tetron<sup>™</sup> S 100 from Teijin.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The thickness of the substrate film may be from 50 to 150 micrometers, preferably from 100 to 150 micrometers, and more preferably from 100 to 125 micrometers. If the substrate is thinner than 50 micrometers, the resulting release liner tends to cause curling. If the substrate is thicker than 150 micrometers, the substrate is too thick to be suitably used as a release liner material.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The release liner of the present invention comprises a polyolefin resin-containing layer on one or both sides of the aforementioned substrate film. As the aforementioned polyolefin resin, mention may be made of (co)polymers of one or more olefins selected from, for instance, ethylene, propylene, butylene, and butadiene. The polyolefin cannot be ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymers or the ionomers thereof. Preferably, the polyolefin resin is selected from polyethylene resins and polypropylene resins, specifically low density polyethylene (LDPE), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), and polypropylene (PP). Particularly preferably, the polyolefin resin is LDPE.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The polyolefin resin preferably has a Vicat softening point of from 80 to 150 degrees C as determined according to JIS K 7206. If the Vicat softening point is lower than the lower limit, embosses are difficult to be retained. If the Vicat softening point is higher than the upper limit, emboss processing is difficult.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The polyolefin resins are also preferably resistant to hot solvents. The aforementioned polyolefin resins do not dissolve in organic solvents, such as toluene or ethyl acetate at an ambient temperature, but sometimes cause cracks or wrinkles at a temperature higher than 80 degrees C. In general, adhesives are<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> diluted with toluene or ethyl acetate. If the polyolefin resin layer is not resistant to hot solvents when these adhesives are applied to a surface of polyolefin resin of a release liner and dried, abnormality takes place on the surface of the polyolefin resin layer, so that the appearance of the adhesive sheet is significantly deteriorated, which is undesirable.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The polyolefin resin-containing layer may comprise heat stabilizers or processing aids as required.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The polyolefin resin layer should be thicker than 10 micrometers. The thickness precision of a polyolefin resin layer is not high, so that the surface tends to be concavo-convex due to the uneveness of the surface thickness if the layer is thinner than 10 micrometers. As a result, a surface of a release liner may not be adequately smooth. The layer thickness should be equal to 10 micrometers or more also for the reason that embosses may be high enough to accommodate the aforementioned grooves. The release liner with the embossed polyolefin resin-containing layer tends to cause curling at its edges. In order to suppress this, the upper limit of the thickness of the polyolefin resin-containing layer is the thickness of the substrate film multiplied by 0.3 when the polyolefin resin-containing layer is provided only on one side of the substrate film; and thickness of the substrate film multiplied by 0.5 when the layers are provided on both sides of the film. If the polyolefin resin-containing layers are provided on both sides of the substrate film, the thickness of each layer is selected so that the thickness ratio of one layer to the other layer is from 0.3 to 1. When the polyolefin resin-containing layer is provided only on one side of the substrate film, the thickness of the polyolefin resin-containing layer is preferably 10 micrometers or more and is from one-tenth to a quarter of the substrate film thickness. When the polyolefin resin-containing layers are provided on both sides of the substrate film, the thickness of the polyolefin-containing layer is 10 micrometers or more and is from one-tenth to a quarter of the substrate film thickness, with the ratio of the thickness of each layer being from 0.5 to 1, more preferably from 0.6 to 1, even more preferably 1. The substrate film in a preferred release liner of the present invention is from<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> 100 to 125 micrometers thick and the polyolefin resin-containing layer is from 15 to 25 micrometers thick. When the polyolefin resin-containing layers are provided on both sides of the substrate film, each layer is from 15 to 25 micrometers thick.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The release liner of the present invention may have a polyolefin resin layer on one or both sides of the substrate film as described above. The release liner preferably has polyolefin resin layers on both sides since curling of the release liner on its edges is suppressed more effectively. However, in terms of costs, the release liner having the polyolefin resin layer on one side is more advantageous. In the latter case, the curling may be suppressed by controlling the thicknesses of the substrate and the polyolefin resin layer within the above-described ranges.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">At least one polyolefin-containing layer in the present release liner has embosses on a side opposite to a side which is in contact with the substrate film. Preferably, the aforementioned embosses are formed so as to be complementary to the aforementioned grooves, so that the release liner may be applied to an adhesive sheet having grooves on a surface of its adhesive layer. More preferably, the aforementioned embosses are formed so that the surface having embosses has a surface structure complementary to the adhesive layer of the adhesive sheet of the present invention and thus the embossed release liner may be combined advantageously with the adhesive sheet of the present invention.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The release liner of the present invention may be manufactured by laminating a polyolefin resin-containing layer to one or both sides of a substrate film, embossing at least one polyolefin resin-containing layer, and then surface-treating the polyolefin resin-containing layer with a releasing agent, such as silicone. The above laminating may be performed by melt extruding a polyolefin resin on a substrate film and press them using cooling rolls or by preparing a film from a polyolefin resin in advance and then thermo-pressing the resulting film using heated rolls. Here, in order to improve adhesion between the substrate film and the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> polyolefin resin-containing layer, the surface of the substrate film, which surface is to be in contact with the polyolefin resin-containing layer, is preferably provided with anchor coat or subjected to treatment, such as corona treatment and plasma treatment, in advance. The embossing may be performed in a conventional process, for instance, by pattern pressing under heat using an engraving roll or an engraving plate.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In the following, the present invention will be further elucidated with reference to the Examples or Comparative Examples but not be limited thereto.
