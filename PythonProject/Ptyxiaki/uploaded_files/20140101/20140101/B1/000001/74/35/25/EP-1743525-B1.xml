and drawn atomisers, i.e. moved by a land vehicle such as a tractor.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Each atomiser is defined by a tank, containing a chemical substance, preferably in a water solution, for treatment of crops.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The tank exhibits a conduit connected to a pump, through which the chemical substance is circulated under pressure; the pump is hydraulically connected to a plurality of nozzles for spraying the solution.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In order to improve dispersion of the product, the plurality of nozzles is arranged on the periphery of a turbine which enables regular dispersion of the product atomised by the nozzles.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">From a mechanical point of view the atomiser comprises a shaft, powered by a motor when the atomiser is connected either to a power take-off if the atomiser is a trailer drawn by, for example, a tractor, which shaft turns the pump, or connected via a universal joint to an overgear which is externally controlled by a rotary motion group turned by the turbine.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the type of crop to be treated, or the type of chemical substance to be sprayed, or even in line with the height of the plants to be treated, prior-art atomisers internally exhibit a gear change integrated with the overgear so that the turbine speed can be regulated, and consequently<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the degree of dispersion of the atomised chemical substance can be controlled.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The atomisers summarised above exhibit an operative drawback linked to the difficulty of engaging the gears on the overgear.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">For example, in the case of a drawn atomiser, the user drives a tractor and at the same time powers the atomiser through a power take-off.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">When the turbine rotation speed is to be changed, it is necessary to intervene directly on the overgear, which means leaving the tractor cockpit.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">To insert the desired gear, a lever external of the overgear has to be operated.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">During this operation a crown gear, mounted on the input shaft, enmeshes with a pinion mounted on the output shaft, i.e. the cogs of the crown insert between those of the pinion.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">If, however, the crown gears clash against those of the pinion, the gear cannot be engaged.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">When this happens, the driven shaft has to be slightly rotated, as consequently does the overgear input shaft, in order to change the position of the crown with respect to the pinion, to enable engagement of the desired gear.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">By putting the tractor gear change into idle this rotation of the driven shaft can be done manually to obtain the desired result.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The above operation, however, is not always practicable.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">If the tractor is on hilly terrain, there is the risk that by putting it into idle it might move forwards or backwards, an undesirable eventuality.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In order to avoid such an occurrence, the tractor must be left in gear and the operator, not being able to work manually on the power take-off because of the high torque needed to rotate it, has no option but to return into the cockpit and activate the motor to achieve the small rotation of the drive<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> shaft. Thereafter the operator has to jump down again from the cockpit to see if the gear can now be engaged. If not, the above operation will have to be repeated - a very time-consuming operation.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Tired of jumping up and down from the cockpit, the operator may resort to forcing gear engagement with the motor on, leading to potential wear on the overgear wheels and indeed possible breakage of the whole transmission.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Alternatively, two operators may be employed, one to drive the tractor and the other to control the overgear. This is obviously uneconomic, needing two operators, but is also absolutely inadvisable due to risk of injury. Should the first operator, driving the tractor, and the second, in charge of the overgear, misinterpret each other's signals, the first operator might engage the motor when the second still has his hands on the power take-off, which could lead to very serious injury to limbs.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">An atomiser according to the above description is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="FR2770741"><text>FR 2770741</text></patcit>. The atomiser comprises an overgear which has a lever for varying the transmission ratio of the overgear by moving axially one gear wth respect to the other, and means for assisting the variation of the transmission ratio. The means for assisting the transmission ratio comprises an elastic member mounted on a slider which is moved by the operator against a wheel that is mounted fixed on the input or output shaft of the overgear, so that the movement of the slider sets in a slow rotation the wheel which in turn moves one gear with respect to the other, so aiding the engagement between the gears. During all the operation of the operator on the slider, the operator also has to hold the lever for holding one gear pushed against the other.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The main aim of the device of the invention is to provide an atomiser with facilitated engagement which enables a gear to be engaged without intervening on the driven shaft of the atomiser.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A second aim of the invention is to provide an atomiser with facilitated engagement which enables a "soft" engagement of the selected gear, thus obviating the wear phenomena existing in the prior art connected with the gear changing operations.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">A further aim of the invention is to provide an atomiser with facilitated engagement which enables a preselected gear to be engaged in a single operation performed by a single operator.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">These aims and advantages and more besides are all attained by the invention, as it is defined in claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The invention will now be described in detail with reference to the figures of the appended drawings, which illustrate three non-limiting preferred embodiments thereof, and in which:
