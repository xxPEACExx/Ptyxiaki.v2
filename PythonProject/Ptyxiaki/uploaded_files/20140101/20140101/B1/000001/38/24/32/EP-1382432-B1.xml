A goal common to all manufacturers of sheet flooring is to provide flooring products having appealing surface decorative effects that are both attractive from an aesthetic viewpoint and useful from a functional standpoint. To illustrate, many methods and processes such as mechanical embossing, chemical embossing or inlaying have been utilized to provide contrasting surface finishes and thereby impart<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> decorative effects to the sheet flooring.

The embossed textured article comprises both peaks and valleys which are measured and quantified to determine a profile of the textured article. Typically, the textured article comprises<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> both chemically and mechanically embossed areas. The method uses moving average subtraction and peak/valley determinations to eliminate web flutter that often distorts the quantification of the mechanically embossed texture. The resulting profile may then be used to set a desired embossed profile.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The term quantifying as used herein includes determining the number of features for a given distance on a textured article or surface covering. Features can be defined as the peaks and valleys found on a given textured article. Peaks are typically defined as the high points relative to the low points or valleys found on the textured article. In greater detail, the term quantifying can be further defined by the disclosed-algorithm wherein the peaks and valleys are determined by implementing the first derivative over the filtered profile with the change in slope polarity used to find peaks and valleys.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The term profile can refer to a cross-sectional view of a textured article for a given distance or length of the textured article. The profile includes the cumulative number of peaks and valleys of a given length of textured article. Furthermore, the profile includes the distance between each feature or the distances between the valleys and peaks. Additionally, the profile includes the height of each peak and the depth of each valley.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The predetermined optimum profile is a profile selected to give the desired appearance of the textured article. For example, the optimum profile may be that profile that results in the chemically embossed areas having essentially no mechanically embossed surface texture and the remaining areas retaining the mechanically embossed surface texture. There are, of course, many such options for the predetermined optimum profile, and the determination of such is usually that<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> profile that imparts the desired visual appearance upon the surface of the textured article.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The term softwear filters refers to any selected technique for analyzing the surface texture detail data and separating the selected data from the original data set. Software filters can include, but are not limited to, moving average, frequency, angle, low/high/bandpass filters, and subtraction of filtered profiles.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In greater detail, the present method includes creating an embossed textured article by mechanically embossing a mechanically embossed texture onto the article and quantifying the mechanically embossed texture and determining a resulting profile. The step of quantifying the mechanically embossed texture includes differentiating between a chemically embossed texture and the mechanically embossed texture. The mechanically embossed texture then is controlled such that the resulting profile corresponds to a predetermined optimum profile. Typically, the method is continuous.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Furthermore, the method for creating an embossed textured article may include both chemically and mechanically embossing a surface texture onto the article. Both the chemically and mechanically embossed areas are then quantified to determine a profile of the embossed textured article. The mechanically embossed texture and the chemically embossed texture includes valley features and peak features which also are quantified. The mechanically embossed texture then is controlled such that the profile of the embossed textured article corresponds to a predetermined optimum profile. Typically, the mechanically embossed texture is controlled by cooling the textured article at a predetermined rate to achieve the predetermined optimum profile.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The apparatus for mechanically embossing a substrate includes a cooled embossing roller and a backup roller operatively positioned with the embossing roller<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> such that a nip is formed between the backup roller and the embossing roller whereby the substrate may pass through the nip and engage the embossing roller for imparting a mechanically embossed pattern. A profilometer is included that is capable of quantifying the mechanically embossed pattern. Any known profilometer with appropriate sensitivity may be used, including optical profilometers which include, but are not limited to, a vision system (camera, lighting, and a computer with analysis software) or a laser and a computer with analysis software. The profilometer quantifies the mechanical embossed textures and the chemical embossed textures, and the profilometer analysis software then differentiates between the chemically embossed textures and mechanically embossed textures. The wrap of the substrate around a portion of the cooled embossing roller may then be adjusted such that the mechanically embossed texture is controlled in the substrate, with the resulting profile of the substrate being substantially similar to an optimized profile.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In further detail, the present method and apparatus may quantify surface texture on vinyl flooring using a laser profilometer and software for extracting mechanical and chemical embossing features from the random, uneven, texture. Surface textures perceived by the human eye may be objectively quantified and the system can handle multiple (e.g., coarse, medium, fine, etc.) textures at the same time.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The software extracts chemical and mechanical surface texture depths, wall angles, and a number of associated features, and its strong correlation to the human eye. An important measurement is the number of mechanically embossed features per linear distance (e.g., more features equals more texture to the eye). Mechanical texture is typically fine and sharp, which greatly affects gloss. Due to the profilometer's sensitivity of 0,254 µm (0.01 mils) resolution, any movement or web flutter in the Z-axis of the web as it passes under the sensor would typically make it very difficult<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> to measure mechanical features accurately. Typically, this high resolution is required to measure mechanical textures. This problem may be eliminated by using the moving average subtraction and peak/valley procedures. In essence, all low frequency variation (e.g. web flutter) is ignored resulting in a very reliable on-line measurement of textures. This system can be capable of measuring the amount of mechanical texture in a chemically restricted area (e.g., grout line) which can be important in achieving the desired visual.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">For rotary mechanical embossing, the following variables can affect the desired surface texture:
<ol><li>1. Proper temperature and temperature gradient of the substrate to soften the surface to receive texture;</li><li>2. Sufficient nip pressure between embossing and backup rolls to impress texture; and</li><li>3. Sufficient substrate cooling while in contact with embossing roll to freeze-in the texture.</li></ol></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In one embodiment, variable substrate wrap around the cooled embossing roll is used to control the amount of mechanically embossed (ME) texture. With maximum wrap, the substrate can be sufficiently cooled to retain 100% of impressed texture. With zero wrap, the substrate may not be sufficiently cooled and most, if not all, impressed texture can completely fade away. Essentially, wrap controls the amount of texture fade-away.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The adjustment of the wrap is a fast and simple way to control texture for rotary mechanical embossing (ME) on vinyl sheet flooring. With accurate on-line<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> texture measurement as feedback, the wrap control can be automated to insure consistent mechanical texture from run to run. Variable wrap control can be used on any rotary ME process that requires substrate cooling to freeze-in the image. An example of an apparatus capable for use in mechanically embossing a substrate can be found in <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US4142849A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,142,849</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The advantages of using variable wrap for texture control include quick control and immediate response to wrap change. Also, fine control is possible since large wrap changes can cause small texture change. Furthermore, 100% control and maximum texture to zero texture is possible depending upon process conditions.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In one embodiment, texture control can provide the ability to remove ME texture in the CE restricted areas. With the amount of wrap properly adjusted, ME texture impressed in the restricted areas can recover/rebound without major loss of texture in the unrestricted area.</p><heading id="h0006"><u>Texture Measurement Hardware:</u></heading><p id="p0031" num="0031">The texture measurement system consists of a laser profilometer (e.g., LMI Laser twin sensor, Model LTS 15/1) capable of measuring depth (i.e., distance from a surface to the laser head) with 0,254 µm (.00001-inch) resolution with a spot size of 25,4 µm (.001") at a frequency up to 100 kHz. The analog output of the profilometer sensor and linear displacement encoder are inputs to a high-speed data acquisition system, such as the Sciemetric Model 270 Process Verification System, that records depth measurements every 50,8 µm (.002") of linear movement of the target.

Chemical texture is generally deeper, larger, and less sharp than mechanical texture. An example of chemical texture is a grout area around a ceramic tile pattern. An example of mechanical texture is the fine wood ticking found in real wood grain. These textures, as they occur naturally, vary in shape, size, and distribution.</p><heading id="h0013">General Chemical Embossed (CE) texture characteristics used in current flooring products:</heading><p id="p0038" num="0038"><ul><li>Depth: about 127 to 635 µm (5 to 25 mils)</li><li>Width: about 762 µm to 12,7 (30 to 500 mils)</li><li>Wall Angle (angle relative to surface): about 5 to 20 degrees</li><li>Frequency: about 0 to 5 features per 25,4 mm (1 inch)</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><heading id="h0014">General Mechanical Embossed (ME) texture characteristics used in current flooring products:</heading><p id="p0039" num="0039"><ul><li>Depth: about 12,7 to 101,6 µm (0.5 to 4 mils)</li><li>Width: about 127 to 381 µm (5 to 15 mils)</li><li>Wall Angle (angle relative to surface): about 5 to 40 degrees</li><li>Frequency: about 10 to 50 features per 25,4 mm (1 inch)</li></ul></p><heading id="h0015"><u>Description of Measurement System:</u></heading><p id="p0040" num="0040">Three fixed measurement points across a moving 304,8 mm (12') wide sheet may be used to measure surface texture at the center and edges of the sheet. An incremental encoder will provide linear displacement of the sheet with a resolution on 60,96 µm/pulse (.0024"/pulse). Profiles may be taken every 1,524 m (5 feet) of sheet travel for 62,23 mm (2.45") (i.e., 1024 data points). At a line speed of 45,72 m/min (150 fpm), a new set of measurements will occur once every 2 seconds. Algorithms below may be applied to extract ten measurements from each of the three profiles for a total of 30 measurements. Each of the 30 measurements may be averaged over 10-30 profile sets before sending to an Allen Bradley PLC via DeviceNet or Data Highway. The PLC will provide a signal to enable/disable measurements.</p><heading id="h0016"><u>Algorithm for Chemical Embossing:</u></heading><p id="p0041" num="0041">Normalize the profile data by subtracting the profile average from each point.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Calculate a moving average at each point (e.g., the average of 10 points before and after).</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Calculate the slope for each (moving average) point.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Determine peaks and valleys via slope/polarity change.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Calculate absolute value of depths by subtracting all peak/valley and valley/peak features.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Calculate run (i.e., distance from peak/valley and valley/peak) for each features.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Determine if feature meets criteria for chemical feature (i.e. min/max depth &amp; run).</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Calculate wall angle for each valid peak/valley and valley/peak using depth and run info.</p><heading id="h0017"><i>Final Measurements</i></heading><p id="p0049" num="0049"><ul><li>* Calculate average of depths and angles.</li><li>* Determine maximum depth and angle.</li><li>* Count number of valid chemical features.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0018"><u>Algorithm for Mechanical Embossing:</u></heading><p id="p0050" num="0050">Normalize the sample data by subtracting each point from each moving-average point.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Calculate the slope for each point.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Determine peaks and valleys via slope/polarity change.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Calculate absolute value of depths by subtracting all peak/valley and valley/peak features.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Calculate run (i.e., distance from peak/valley and valley/peak) for each features.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Determine if feature meets criteria for mechanical feature (i.e. min/max depth &amp; run).</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Calculate angle for each valid peak/valley and valley/peak using depth and run info.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><heading id="h0019"><i>Final Measurements</i></heading><p id="p0057" num="0057"><ul><li>* Calculate average depths and angles.</li><li>* Determine maximum depth and angle.</li><li>* Count number of valid mechanical features.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0020"><u>Parameters for system configuration:</u></heading><p id="p0058" num="0058"><ul><li>Interval for moving average (number of points)</li><li>Linear resolution in mils (encoder resolution)</li><li>CE minimum rise in mils (must be &gt; to be valid CE)</li><li>CE maximum rise in mils (must be &lt; to be valid CE)</li><li>CE minimum run in mils (must be &gt; to be valid CE)</li><li>CE maximum run in mils (must be &lt; to be valid CE)</li><li>ME minimum rise in mils (must be &gt; to be valid ME)</li><li>ME maximum rise in mils (must be &lt; to be valid ME)</li><li>ME minimum run in mils (must be &gt; to be valid ME)</li><li>ME maximum run in mils (must be &lt; to be valid ME)</li><li>Number of profile measurements to average</li><li>Minimum number of valid CE features (fewer features = no CE)</li><li>Minimum number of valid ME feature (fewer features = no ME)</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980676" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Verfahren zur Herstellung eines geprägten texturierten Artikels, umfassend:
