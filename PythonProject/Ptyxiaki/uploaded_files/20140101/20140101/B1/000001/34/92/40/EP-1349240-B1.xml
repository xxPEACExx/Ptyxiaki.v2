insulator. Each contact has a contact portion protruding outward from the main surface of the insulator, and a spring portion elastically supporting the contact portion so as to be movable toward the inside of the insulator. In <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2000036349A"><text>JP-A-2000-36349</text></patcit>, for example, the contact portion has a spoon-like curved shape.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Following the movement along the main surface of the insulator, the connection object is brought into pressure contact with the contact portions of the contacts. When the connection object is set in a prescribed position on the main surface of the insulator, each contact portion is pushed by the connection object so as to be moved toward the inside of the insulator. When the connection object is removed from the prescribed position on the main surface of the insulator, each contact portion is pushed by the spring portion so as to be moved toward the outside of the insulator.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Upon moving along the main surface of the insulator, the connection object slides on the contact portions of the contacts. As a result, every time the connection object is set or removed, each contact portion receives an undesired<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> external force in a direction along the main surface of the insulator. There is a possibility of deformation of the contact due to this undesired external force. When the contact deforms, the contact portion is displaced from a normal position over the main surface of the insulator, thereby to cause occurrence of connection failure with the connection object.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For preventing the displacement of the contact portion due to the undesired external force, the contact should be made of a relatively thick material and large in size. In this case, however, the reduction in size or thickness of the connector is restrained.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP1341266A2"><text>EP 1 341 266 A2</text></patcit> discloses a connector for use in connecting a connection object which is movable in a first direction, said connector comprising: an insulator having a main surface for receiving thereon said connection object, said main surface spreading in said first direction and a second direction perpendicular to said first direction; and a conductive contact retained by said insulator, said contact comprising: a contact portion protruding outward from the main surface of said insulator in a third direction perpendicular to said first and second directions; a spring portion elastically supporting said contact portion so as to be movable toward the inside of said insulator in said third direction; an extended portion extending from said contact portion into the inside of said insulator in a fourth direction crossing said first and third directions in a plane spreading in said first and third directions, said insulator has an engaging portion and said contact portion has a pair of broadened portions engaging said engaging portion; and said broadened portions each protrude from said contact portion in said first direction.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Another connector is known from <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US20010049231A1"><text>US 2001/0049231 A1</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is the object of the present invention to provide a connector which has a less possibility of deformation of a contact upon setting or removing a connection object.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">This object is achieved by the connector having the features of claim 1.

The card 41 is moved in a first direction A1 upon connection or disconnection.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The shown connector comprises an insulator 11 having an approximately rectangular parallelepiped shape, and a plurality of conductive contacts 31 retained by the insulator 11. The insulator 11 has a main surface 13 formed at a center portion thereof in a longitudinal direction, i.e. a second direction A2. The main surface 13 spreads in the first and second directions A1 and A2.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The insulator 11 is formed at both end surfaces thereof in the second direction A2, with a plurality of groove portions 15 arranged in the first direction A1. The number of the groove portions 15 is three on each end side of the insulator 11 in the second direction A2. Each groove portion 15 is open to the main surface 13. In a surface of the insulator 11 on the side opposite to the main surface 13 are formed opening portions 19 respectively communicating with the groove portions 15.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The groove portions 15 are defined by a plurality of wall portions 21 of the insulator 11 each spreading in the second direction A2 and a third direction A3. Each wall portion 21 has a height from the side of a mounting surface 17 of the insulator to a level approximately the same as the main surface 13. On the side of the mounting surface 17 of the insulator 11 are formed retaining portions 23 each protruding inward in the groove portion 15 from the corresponding wall portions 21 for retaining the contact 31. Each wall portion 21 is formed with a guide surface 21a.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The number of the contacts 31 is six in total, which are received in the groove portions 15, respectively. On a surface confronting the main surface 13, the card 41 has contact portions 43 for contacting the contacts 31, respectively.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> When the card 41 is set in a prescribed position on the main surface 13, the contact portions 43 are brought into contact with the contacts 31 so that the card 41 is connected to the connector. An operation of setting the card 41 in the prescribed position on the main surface 13 or an operation of removing the card 41 from the prescribed position is carried out by moving the card 41 along the main surface 13 or in parallel with the main surface 13 in the first direction A1.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Referring also to <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">Figs. 5 to 7</figref>, the contact 31 will be described.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The contact 31 comprises a retained portion 33 which is press-fitted into the retaining portion 23 of the insulator 11 so as to be retained thereby, a spring portion (a portion shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref> as having an approximately U-shape laid on its side) 35 extending from one end of the retained portion 33 and curved in a clip shape so as to be received in the groove portion 15, a contact portion 37 extending from an extended end of the spring portion 35 so as to elastically protrude outward from the main surface 13 of the insulator 11, and a terminal portion 39 extending from the other end of the retained portion 33 so as to protrude outward from the end surface of the insulator 11 in the second direction A2.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As best seen from <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref>, the contact portion 37 is formed so as to describe an approximately circular arc in a plane spreading in the second and third directions A2 and A3. On both sides of the contact portion 37 in the first direction A1 is formed a pair of extended or inviting portions 37a extend into the groove portion 15. One of the inviting portions 37a extends in a fourth direction crossing the first and third directions A1 and A3 in a particular plane spreading in the first and third directions A1 and A3. Another of the inviting portions 37a extends in a fifth direction crossing the first and third directions A1 and A3 and the fourth direction in the particular plane. A boundary portion between the contact portion 37 and each inviting portion 37a is formed as a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> gently curved surface.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Further, each inviting portion 37a is formed with a guided portion 37b spreading in the second and third directions A2 and A3. The guided portion 37b confronts the guide surface 21a of the wall portion 21 with a slight gap therebetween.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">When the mounting surface 17 of the insulator 11 is mounted on a board such as a printed circuit board (not shown), the terminal portion 39 of each contact 31 is connected by soldering to a conductive portion (not shown) provided on the board.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">At a portion, relatively near the contact portion 37, of the spring portion 35, a pair of broadened portions 35a are formed each broadened in the first direction A1. This is equivalent to a structure wherein projections are formed at both lateral ends of the spring portion 35 in a width direction thereof. On the other hand, the insulator 11 is formed with a pair of flat engaging portions 11a corresponding to each groove portion 15. Each of the engaging portions 11a is formed in a cut-out shape so as to engage the corresponding broadened portion 35a. Since the broadened portions 35a engage the engaging portions 11a in the state of the spring portion 35 being biased in advance, a preload is applied to the spring portion 35 of the contact 31.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The contact 31 can be produced by applying press blanking to a conductive plate, and then applying bending thereto.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the state where the card 41 is not set on the main surface 13, the contact portion 37 of each contact 31 together with the inviting portions 37a protrude upward from the main surface 13 of the insulator 11. When the card 41 is moved along the main surface 13 of the insulator 11 in the first direction A1 for setting it in the prescribed position on the main surface 13, the card 41 contacts the inviting portion 37a and the contact portion 37 of each contact 31 and slides along the surfaces thereof. As a result, the contact 31 receives an<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> undesired external force in the first direction A1. However, since the guided portion 37b abuts with the guide surface 21a so as to slide in the third direction A3, deformation of each contact 31 due to such an undesired external force is prevented.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Consequently, the card 41 is set in the prescribed position on the main surface 13 while pressing the contact portions 37 of the respective contacts 31 into the corresponding groove portions 15 of the insulator 11. In this manner, the contact portions 43 of the card 41 are brought into contact with the contact portions 37 of the contacts 31 in one-to-one correspondence. In this event, each contact portion 37 is put in pressure contact with the corresponding contact portion 43 owing to an urging force of the spring portion 35.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">When removing the card 41 from the prescribed position, the card 41 also slides on the inviting portion 37a and the contact portion 37 of each contact 31. However, like in case of setting the card 41 as described above, the guided portion 37b abuts with the guide surface 21a so as to slide in the third direction A3, so that deformation of the contact 31 due to the undesired external force is prevented.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As described above, since there is provided the structure for preventing the deformation of each contact 31 that would be otherwise caused by the sliding movement of the card 41, no problem is raised in view of strength even if the contact 31 is made of a relatively thin material and small in size. Therefore, the reduction in size or thickness of the connector can be easily achieved.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A portion in the neighborhood of the contact portion 37 of the contact 31 is approximately T-shaped in a plan view. Accordingly, upon setting or removing the card 41, a displacement amount of the apex, in the third direction A3, of the contact portion 37 and a displacement amount of the tip, in the second direction A2, of the contact portion 37 become approximately equal to each other. Therefore, the increase in thickness of the connector can be<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> avoided that would be otherwise necessitated by the fact that displacement amounts of the contact 31 partially differ.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The preload given to the spring portion 35 in advance corresponds to a displacement amount δ of the contact portion 37 upon attaching the contact 31 to the insulator 11. Since the pair of broadened portions 35a engage the pair of engaging portions 11a, respectively, the preload is received by the insulator 11 at two points in a dispersed manner. Namely, assuming that the preload is F, the insulator 11 is applied with dispersed loads each being F/2. Therefore, a possibility of deformation of the insulator 11 due to the preload is small.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0005">Figs. 8 and 9</figref>, the whole structure of a connector according to a second preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described. The same or like portions are assigned the same reference symbols, thereby to omit explanation thereof.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In this connector, as clear from <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 8</figref>, a contact portion 37 of a contact 31 is formed as a substantial end portion in the second direction A2. In the contact 31, a preload is applied to a spring portion 35 by engaging a portion between the spring portion 35 and the contact portion 37 with an upper wall portion 21a of the insulator 11.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">According to this arrangement, both the insulator 11 and the contact 31 can be simplified in structure.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0006">Figs. 10 and 11</figref>, the whole structure of a connector according to a third preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described.

Namely, the contact portion 37, the inviting portions 37a and the guided portions 37b cooperatively form a shape<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> obtained by cutting half of a tip portion of a general spoon. By adopting this shape, the setting of the card 41 relative to the connector can be carried out more smoothly.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0007">Figs. 12 and 13</figref>, the whole structure of a connector according to a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described. The same or like portions are assigned the same reference symbols, thereby to omit explanation thereof.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In this connector, an overhanging portion 37c is provided as an additional portion at the tip of a contact portion 37 of a contact 31. The overhanging portion 37c extends from the side of the apexes of inviting portions 37a toward the side of guided portions 37b. The overhanging portion 37c serves to prevent invasion of foreign matter into the inside of an insulator 11, i.e. into a groove portion 15.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">While the present invention has thus far been described in connection with a few embodiments thereof, it will readily be possible for those skilled in the art to put this invention into practice in various other manners. For example, the inviting portion 37a is provided on each side of the contact portion 37 in the foregoing description, but may be provided only on one side thereof. The number of the groove portions 15 is changed according to the number of the contacts 31, and thus is not limited to the foregoing number.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980688" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Stecker zum Gebrauch für eine Verbindung eines Verbindungsobjekts (41), das in einer ersten Richtung bewegbar ist, wobei der Stecker folgendes aufweist:
