A refrigerator is an apparatus that includes a food-storage chamber therein for storing foods for a long-term period in a fresh condition. The food-storage chamber is always maintained at a low temperature by a refrigerating cycle for keeping food fresh. The food-storage chamber is divided into a plurality of storage chambers having different characteristics from each other such that a user can choose a food-storage method in consideration of the type, individual characteristics and/or the expiration dates of the individual foods. A typical storage chamber may include a cooling chamber and a freezer portion.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The cooling chamber keeps a temperature at about 3°C-4°C for keeping food and vegetables fresh for a long time. The freezer keeps a temperature at a sub-zero temperature (below 0 °C) for keeping and storing meat and fish frozen for a long time and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> making and storing ice. The refrigerator has been modified for performing various additional functions besides a typical refrigerating function thereof, e.g., a user had to open a door and take out a water bottle kept in the cooling chamber to drink cold water kept in the cooling chamber hitherto. Accordingly, a refrigerator is often supplied with a water dispenser provided at an outside of the door for supplying cold water cooled by cool air of the cooling chamber and the user can therefore obtain a drink of cold water at the exterior of the refrigerator without having to open the door. Furthermore, a refrigerator incorporating a water purifying function added to the water dispenser is also being supplied.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Further, in a case of using ice for drinking and cooking purposes, the user had to typically open the door of the freezer and take ice out of an ice tray provided in the freezer. However, it is relatively inconvenient for the user to open the door, take out the ice tray and separate ice from the ice tray. In addition, when the door is opened, cool air in the freezer leaks out and the temperature of the freezer goes up. Accordingly, the compressor is forced to work harder and longer to maintain the proper freezer temperature while consuming more energy. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2869060A"><text>US-A-2869060</text></patcit> discloses an icemaker suitable for ice supply for a refrigerator, according to the first part of claim 1.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention overcomes the shortcomings associated with the background art and achieves other advantages not realized by the background art. Specifically, the present invention is directed to an ice supply system that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the background art.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">An object of the present invention is to provide an ice supply system for a refrigerator for supplying ice from an exterior of the refrigerator without having to open a door of the refrigerator.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide an ice supply system for a refrigerator having an improved structure for preventing water in the icemaker from overflowing to the outside of the icemaker by shaking or other movement of the refrigerator or freezer door.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">One or more of these and other objects are accomplished by an ice supply system of a refrigerator having a door, comprising an icemaker being provided within or next to the door of the refrigerator, the icemaker including an ice tray for receiving water; an ejector being provided adjacent to the ice tray; a motor for discharging ice in the ice tray by imparting a rotational motion to the ejector; a dropper having an inclined surface and being provided at an upper part of the ice tray for discharging ice stored within the ice tray via the ejector to the upper part of the ice tray and downward along the inclined surface of the dropper; and a overflow prevention device being provided on a side of the icemaker opposite from the dropper at an upper part of the ice tray for preventing water filled in the ice tray from overflowing out of the ice tray; a container being provided under the icemaker and having an open top and an outlet for discharging the ice; a transferring device being provided in the container and connected to a motor; and an ice chute being provided to communicate an ice dispenser provided at the door with the outlet of the container.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">One or more of these and other objects are further accomplished by an icemaker for an ice supply system for a refrigerator, comprising an ice tray for receiving water and making ice; an ejector being provided adjacent to and within the ice tray; a motor for discharging ice in the ice tray by imparting a rotational motion to the ejector; a dropper having an inclined surface and being provided at an upper part of the ice tray for discharging ice stored within the ice tray via the ejector to the upper part of the ice tray and downward along the inclined surface of the dropper; and a overflow prevention device being provided on a side of the icemaker opposite from the dropper at an upper part of the ice tray for preventing water filled in the ice tray from overflowing out of the ice tray.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The icemaker includes an ice tray for receiving water, an ejector, a dropper and an overflow prevention device. In this case, the ejector is provided adjacent to the ice tray and rotated by a motor for discharging the ice in the ice tray. The dropper is provided at an upper part of the ice tray and has an inclined surface for dropping the ice to a lower part thereof, wherein the ice is discharged to the top of the ice tray via the ejector. The overflow prevention device is provided at an upper outside portion of the ice tray for<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> preventing water filled in the ice tray from overflowing. The icemaker as aforementioned is provided at or within the door of the refrigerator.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The container includes an opened top and an outlet discharging the ice and provided at a lower part of the icemaker. The ice chute communicates the dispenser provided at the door with the outlet. The overflow prevention device includes a panel extending from the upper outside of the ice tray for a predetermined distance. In this case, the panel can be installed to the ice tray or separated from the ice tray. However, the panel and the ice tray are formed as a single body.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the present invention, the panel includes a concave surface facing an inside of the ice tray. In this case, it is desirable that the ice tray is formed in a semi-cylindrical shape, and the curved surface of the panel and the inner surface of the ice tray have the same curvature. It is desirable that a range of an angle between a lower end of the panel and an upper end of the panel is 30° to 60° when a central axis of the ice tray is at an angular point or apex.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the present invention, the panel can be longitudinally provided contrary to an above description. In this case, a height of the panel is 0.7 to 1.5 times of a radius of the ice tray. The dropper is provided to cover space between the upper part of the ice tray and a central axis of the ejector for preventing water from overflowing. The dropper is provided to the ice tray or separated from the ice tray. The dropper and the ice tray are formed as a single body.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the present invention, a side of the dropper adjacent to the central axis of the ejector includes an inclined surface or a convex surface for easily transferring the ice to a top surface of the dropper, wherein the ice is discharged upwardly from the ice tray. The dropper includes at least one groove provided on the upper surface of a top plate for leading the ice discharged to the upper part of the ice tray and dropped to the top surface of the top plate.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The dropper includes the top plate having an inclined top surface inclined to a side, thus a side of the top plate adjacent to the central axis of the ejector is higher than an opposite side thereof, and a rim extending downward from both sides of the top plate and<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> an opposite side of the side adjacent to the central axis of the ejector for surrounding an upper outside of the ice tray.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In the present invention, the dropper, in more detail includes the top plate provided at a location offset from the central axis of the ice tray to a top portion thereof for a predetermined distance. The dropper is provided at a location offset from the central axis of the ice tray to a top portion thereof for a predetermined distance.

The refrigerator includes a cooling chamber and a freezer, and a door 1 is provided in front of the refrigerator for opening and closing the cooling chamber and the freezer. An ice supply system is provided at the door 1 and the freezer. Hereinafter, referring to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">FIG. 1 to FIG. 4</figref>, a structure of the ice supply system is described in detail.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the ice supply system includes an icemaker 10 for producing ice, a container 20 for storing the ice produced from the icemaker 10, an ice chute 2 for supplying the ice stored in the container 20 to a dispenser (not illustrated) provided at the door 1. The icemaker 10 is provided in the cooling chamber of the refrigerator as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> and includes an ice tray 11, a water supplier 12, an ejector 14 and a motor 13.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The ice tray 11 has an open top as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> and the interior of the ice tray is formed in a semi-cylindrical form for storing water and ice. A plurality of ribs 11a are provided in the ice tray 11 for dividing the interior space into a plurality of sections. The plurality of ribs 11 a protrude from the inner surface of the ice tray 11 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>. The ribs 11a help the ice tray 11 produce a plurality of small pieces of ice.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The water supplier 12 is provided at a side of the ice tray 11 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> for supplying water to the ice tray 11. A bracket 15 is provided to secure the icemaker 10 to the freezer as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>. The ejector 14 includes a shaft 14a and a plurality of fins 14b. The shaft 14a as a central axis of the ejector 14 is placed to cross the center along the longitudinal direction at an upper inside of the ice tray 11. The plurality of fins 14b are extended in a radial direction on an outer circumferential surface of the shaft 14a. It is desirable that the plurality of fins 14b are provided at a common interval along the longitudinal direction of the shaft 14a. Particularly, each of the plurality of fins is placed in each section provided in the ice tray 11 by the ribs 11a.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The motor 13 is provided at a point of an outer circumferential surface of the ice tray 11 to be pivotably connected to the shaft. Accordingly, when the shaft 14a is rotated via the motor 13, the plurality of fins 14b are rotated together. Each of the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> plurality of fins 14b pushes the ice in the ice tray 11 and drops to a lower part of the icemaker 10. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, a plurality of droppers are provided in front of the ice tray 11, i.e., at an upper end of an opposite side of a side where the bracket is provided.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Each of the droppers 16 is extended from a front upper part of the ice tray 11 to a point near the shaft 14a. In this case, a small gap exists between each of the droppers 16 and the plurality of fins 14b pass through the gap when the shaft 14a rotates. The ice in the ice tray 11 is pushed by the plurality of fins 14b, separated from the ice tray 11 and dropped on the droppers 16 after being completely separated. The ice dropped on the droppers 16 are dropped again to the lower part of the icemaker 10 to be stored in the container 20 provided at the lower part of the icemaker 10. Accordingly, an upper surface of the dropper 16 extends to drop the ice separated from the ice tray 11 to the lower part of the dropper. Therefore, it is desirable that a side of the dropper 16 adjacent to the shaft 14a slopes toward one side and thus the side of the dropper 16 near the shaft 14a is arranged at a higher position than a front side of the ice tray 11.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The present inventors have determined that a structure is needed for preventing ice separated from the ice tray 11 from dropping to a rear side of the ice tray 11. For this, it is desirable that a rear end of the ice tray 11 is provided higher than the shaft 14a as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. Then, ice separated from the ice tray 11 is moved to the rear side of the ice tray 11 by the plurality of fins 14b, is smoothly lead to the front side of the ice tray 11 and is then dropped to the upper surface of the dropper 16.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">A heater 17 is provided at a lower surface of the ice tray 11 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>. The heater 17 heats a surface of the ice tray 11 for a short time and slightly melts the ice on the surface of the ice tray 11. Accordingly, ice is easily separated when the shaft 14a and the plurality of fins 14b rotate. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, a sensing arm 18 is provided in the icemaker 10 for estimating an amount of ice stored in the container 20. The sensing arm 18 estimates the amount of ice stored in the container 20 by being controlled by a controller (not illustrated) and moving up and down. For example, the sensing arm 18 periodically descends, e.g., a descending amount of the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> sensing arm 18 is relatively large when a small amount of ice is stored in the container 20. On the other hand, the sensing arm 18 bumps into the ice sooner and the corresponding descending amount is smaller when a large amount of ice is stored in the container 20. Accordingly, the controller estimates the amount of ice in the ice container 20 by sensing the descending amount of the sensing arm 18.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The container 20 is also provided at the lower part of the icemaker 10 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">FIG. 1 to FIG. 3</figref> and has an open top for receiving and storing the ice dropped from the icemaker 10. On a surface, i.e., a floor of the container 20, an outlet 21 is provided for discharging the ice to the lower part as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>. According to the present invention, a transferring device 22 is provided in the container 20 for transferring the ice stored in the container 20 to a side where the outlet 21 is provided. The transferring device 22, for example, is formed in a zigzag or spiral shaped form and is provided to extend across an inside of the container 20. The transferring device 22 is connected to the motor 23 and transfers the ice stored in the container 20 to the side where the outlet 21 is provided.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">A structure for crushing ice can also be provided in the present invention. A crusher 30 is provided at a side of the outlet 21 in the container 20 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>. The crusher 30 includes a housing 31, a shaft 32, a supporter 33 and a blade 34. The housing 31 is provided on the outlet 21 in the container 20 and a surface, i.e., a side corresponding to the transferring device 22 is formed in an opened form. The supporter 33 is provided to support the shaft 32 in the housing 31 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>. The shaft 32 is provided to pass through the supporter 33 and is rotated together with the housing 31 at a predetermined place.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The blade 34 is coupled with the shaft 32 and crushes the ice transferred by the transferring device 22 rotating with the shaft 32. At least one or more blades 34 are provided, and it is desirable that the blades 34 are provided at both sides around the supporter 33 when a plurality of the blades 34 are provided. The outlet 21 provided in the container is automatically opened or closed according to a user's choice. For this, an ice discharger 40 is provided at the outlet 21. The ice discharger 40 includes an actuator 41 and a shutter 42 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>. The shutter 42 is formed as a plate to be able to<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> open the outlet 21. The actuator 41 is connected to the shutter 42 by a lever (not illustrated). In this case, for example, a solenoid type actuator is employed as the actuator 41. In the ice discharger 40 as described above, the actuator 41 is operated according to a control signal of the controller and the shutter 42 controls an amount of the opening and closing of the outlet 21 moving in accordance with the actuator 41.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The ice chute 2 is provided at the bottom of and next to the container, i.e., at a lower part of the outlet 21 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. The ice chute 2 is provided to pass through the door 1 and the ice discharged from the outlet 21 is lead to the outside of the door 1. Although it is not illustrated, an ice dispenser is provided at an end of the ice chute 2. The ice dispenser connects with the ice chute from the outside of the door 1 and supplies a predetermined amount of ice to a user when the user wants to use the ice.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">An operation of the ice supply system of the refrigerator will be described. First, when the controller (not illustrated) determines that the amount of ice in the container 20 is not enough by an operation of the sensing arm 18, water is supplied to the water supplier 12 of the icemaker 10. The water supplied to the water supplier 12 is filled in the spaces between the ribs 11a of the ice tray 11 and frozen by the cold air of the freezer. A plurality of pieces of ice in a regular, uniform size are produced via the ribs 11a in the ice tray 11. When a predetermined time period passes and the ice is produced, the heater 17 is operated for a short period of time to loosen the ice within the ice tray 11. Accordingly, an exterior of the ice tray 11 is slightly heated and each piece of ice separates from the ice tray 11 as the exterior of each piece of ice is slightly melted.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The motor 13 starts to operate and the shaft 14a and the plurality of fins 14b are then rotated together. The plurality of fins 14b push the ice between the ribs 11a in a circumferential direction of the ice tray 11 and the ice is completely separated from the ice tray 11 via the plurality of fins 14b, is dropped onto the dropper 16 and is subsequently dropped to the lower part of the icemaker 10. The ice dropped to the lower part of the icemaker 10 is stored in the container 20.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">When a predetermined amount of the ice is filled in the container 20 from an above repeated process, the sensing arm 18 detects the amount of the ice and the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> controller stops producing ice. Of course, when it is determined via the sensing arm 18 that the ice is not enough, the process is repeated to continue producing the ice and the produced ice is stored in the container 20.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Meanwhile, a user manipulates the control panel provided on an outer surface of the door 10 in a state that the container 20 is filled with the ice, the user is supplied with crushed ice or uncrushed ice in a large size through the ice dispenser. Hereinafter, the process will be described.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">When the user manipulates the control panel to select a function for supplying the ice, the motor 23 rotates and transfers a large piece of ice stored in the container 20 to the crusher 30. The large piece of ice transferred to the crusher 30 is crushed into smaller pieces of ice. Meanwhile, when the crushed ice is supplied through the ice dispenser, the shutter 42 slightly opens the outlet 21. The outlet 21 is provided at the lower part of the crusher 30 and the crushed ice is discharged through the outlet 21. The crushed ice passes through the ice chute 2 and supplied to the user through the ice dispenser.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">When the user manipulates the control panel to select a function for supplying a large piece of uncrushed ice, the shutter 42 completely opens the outlet 21. When the motor 23 operates and the transferring device 22 rotates, the large pieces of ice stored in the container 20 are transferred to the crusher 30. At this time, the large pieces of uncrushed ice are discharged through the outlet 21 before reaching the crusher 30, pass through the ice chute 2 and are supplied to the user through the ice dispenser.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Using the refrigerator with the ice supply system, the user is selectively supplied with crushed ice and uncrushed ice. However, the present inventors have determined that the ice supply system has a few disadvantages described in greater detail hereinafter with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">According to an embodiment described in reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">FIG.1 to FIG. 4</figref> which does not belong to the invention, the icemaker 10 and the container 20 are provided at the cooling chamber in the refrigerator. Therefore, there is a problem that a space of the refrigerator is not effectively used such that the icemaker 10 and the container 20 take up a lot of space thereof. In order to overcome this problem, the icemaker 10 and the container 20 may be provided in or at the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> door 1. However, in this case, a second problem can occur. Specifically, if water is supplied to the ice tray 11 of the icemaker 10 for producing ice when the door 1 is simultaneously opened, the water in the ice tray 11 is often heavily shaken by inertia and the swinging moment of the door 1. Accordingly, water can overflow when the door 1 is opened and closed. Therefore, the present inventors have created an ice supply system with an improved structure for preventing water from overflowing when the door is opened or closed as aforementioned. An improved structure for an ice maker of the present invention will be described in greater detail hereinafter.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, the ice supply system with the improved structure according to the present invention includes an icemaker 100, a container provided at a lower part of the icemaker 100 and installed at the door 1 and an ice chute 300 for communicating the container 200 with the dispenser (not illustrated) and supplying ice stored in the container 20 to the dispenser. The ice supply system with an improved structure is provided at the door 1 and has an advantage of utilizing the space in the cooling chamber of the refrigerator.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In order to user the icemaker installed at the door 1 as mentioned above, water stored in the icemaker 100 needs to be prevented from overflowing by a swinging action of the door 1. The ice supply system with an improved structure according to the present invention includes an overflow prevention device and a dropper with an improved structure for preventing water from overflowing. The overflow prevention device and the dropper are provided at an upper part of the ice tray in positions facing each other for preventing water from overflowing to an outside of the ice tray when the door 1 is opened or closed and water is shaken. The structure of the icemaker 100 will be described in greater detail hereinafter with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">As a reference, for convenience in describing, a side of the dropper is hereinafter named as a front side of the ice tray and a side of the overflow prevention device is named as a rear side of the ice tray.

Referring to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, a dropper 160a in the icemaker 100 according to the first embodiment is slightly different from the example described in reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>. The overflow prevention device includes a panel 110a provided at an upper part of the icemaker at an opposite side of the dropper 160a. Therefore, the panel 110a and the dropper 160a in the icemaker 100 according to the first embodiment prevent water in the ice tray 11 from overflowing by a shaking action thereof.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6 and 7</figref>, the panel 110a is extended upward from an upper rear side of the ice tray 11 for a predetermined length. In this case, a side of the panel 110a facing an inside of the ice tray 11 includes a concave face. When the panel 110a has a concave face, water slopping in the ice tray 11 from an inner side to the panel 110a is naturally lead to the inner side thereof. When the ice in the ice tray 11 is discharged to an upper part of the ice tray 11 via an ejector 14, the ice is lead to an upper surface of the dropper 160a.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6 and FIG. 7</figref>, the ice tray 11 is formed in a semi-cylindrical shape having an open top. Accordingly, it is desirable that a curved surface of the panel 110a and the inside of the ice tray 11 include the same curvature in the first embodiment. In this case, water slopping in the ice tray 11 from an inner side to the panel 110a is<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> naturally lead to the inner side thereof along the inside of the ice tray 11 and the curved surface of the panel 110a. When the ejector 14 discharges the ice, the ice is easily transformed along the inside of the ice tray 11 and the curved surface of the panel 110a.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Meanwhile, the panel 110a includes a length for preventing water from overflowing from the ice tray 11. However, when the curved surface of the panel 110a and the inside of the ice tray 11 have the same curvature, a cross section of the panel 110a includes an arc form as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> and it is easy to describe the length of the panel 110a by an angle α. Since the radius of the ice tray 11 is already determined and thus the length of the ice tray 11 is calculated when a central axis of the ice tray 11 is at an angular apex and an angle between a lower end and an upper end of the panel 110a is determined. A range of the angle α between the lower end and the upper end of the panel 110a is proposed to be between 30° to 60°. This is a value obtained from a plurality of experiments. As a reference, <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a case on the assumption that the shat 14a of the ejector 14 is provided on the central axis of the ice tray 11.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">The panel 110a and the ice tray 11 can be formed as a single body or separately. When the panel 110a and the ice tray 11 are formed as a single body, there is a difficulty in forming the panel 110a and the ice tray 11 as a single body using a metallic pattern. On the other hand, when the panel 110a is formed as a separate body, it is easy to form the panel 110a and the ice tray 11 separately using a metallic pattern.

When the second gear<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> assembly is provided, a spring 190 is further provided at the top of the cover 180 for connecting the cover 180 with the door as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 14A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0016">FIG. 14B</figref>. In the case, where the fifth gear 450 is not engaged with the sixth gear 460 by the incised part 465, the cover 180 is inversely rotated by its own weight to close the top of the ice tray 11. Waterproofing of the tray 11 is improved by the spring 190 adhering the cover 180 to the dropper 160c.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">When the second gear assembly is provided, the motor rotating in the first direction and the second direction is further provided. In this case, the fin 14b discharges the ice, rotates until it contacts the dropper 160c and inversely rotates until it reaches the first position. Accordingly, improved waterproofing is expected in this case since the aforementioned slot for rib 14b slot is no longer necessary.</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">The present invention having the structure described above has the following advantages. First, when the overflow prevention device including the panel is provided, water in the icemaker is prevented from overflowing to the rear of the icemaker by shaking generated when the door is opened or closed. Second, if the panel provided as the overflow prevention device has a curved surface, water sliding back and forth within the ice tray from side to side is lead to the inside thereof.</p><p id="p0114" num="0114">In addition, if the panel provided in the overflow prevention device is longitudinally provided, the ice tray and the panel are formed as a single body. If the dropper is provided, water is prevented from overflowing to the front of the ice tray when the door is opened or closed. If the cover is provided as the overflow prevention device, water is prevented from being flowed to the outside of the ice tray because the cover covers the open top of the ice tray when the door is opened or closed. Further, if the gear assembly is provided, the cover with a simple structure automatically opens or closes the ice tray.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980004" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Eisversorgungssystem einer Kühl/Gefrier-Vorrichtung mit einer Tür(1), wobei das System aufweist:
