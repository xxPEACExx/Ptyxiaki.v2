The invention further relates to a gas turbine combustor with a pilot nozzle that improves flame stabilization by using the circulation of the combustion gas arising from combustion in the gas turbine combustor.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002"><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref> shows a cross section of a pilot nozzle 83 of a conventional gas turbine combustor. The pilot nozzle 83 is a dual type that injects two types of fuels, namely, fuel oil 81 and fuel gas 82. The fuel oil 81 flows along the longitudinal axis ("oil-flow channel") of the pilot nozzle 83 and is diffusion-injected from the tip of the pilot nozzle 83. On the other hand, the fuel gas 82 flows through a plurality of fuel-flow channels 84 and is diffusion-injected obliquely forward relative to the pilot nozzle 83. The fuel-flow channels 84 are laid longitudinally at, say, eight locations along the outer circumferential periphery of the pilot nozzle 83. Peripherally to the pilot nozzle 83 flows in spirals the pilot air that has passed through the pilot swirler 85, the swirling air then in a mixture with the fuel<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> gas producing a spurt of pilot flame.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The conventional pilot nozzle 83 has a drawback that the fuel consumption is rather high, and there is a demand for curbing the fuel consumption. The combustion of fuel oil from the main nozzle constitutes the main combustion in the combustion chamber, because of which the curbing of the use of fuel oil injected from the main nozzle is in no sense appropriate. On the other hand, the flame of fuel gas 82 injected from the pilot nozzle 83 is functionally meant to just aid in the ignition of fuel oil injected from the main nozzle. It is this very function of fuel gas 82 that renders it possible for fuel consumption to be curbed without impairing the role of the pilot nozzle 83, if and only if flame stabilization can be improved nonetheless.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP0728989A"><text>EP-A-0728989</text></patcit> discloses a gas turbine engine which has a pilot burner located or nested inside a central bore of a main burner. In the pilot burner fuel flows through a supply passage to an annular gallery and then through passages to a further gallery so that the fuel is emitted from the head through a circular array of apertures near its outer circumference and is then immediately deflected across the burner face by a deflector lip provided on a sleeve. After deflection by the lip the fuel meets a curtain or annular column of high pressure air emitted rearwardly and divergently from a circular groove in the burner face so that mixing of the pilot fuel and air begins due to the turbulence associated with the air and the cross flow of the fuel with respect to it.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP1087178A"><text>EP-A-1087178</text></patcit> describes a pre-mixing chamber for gas turbines which is formed by a casing which in turn is connected to a downstream converging portion which faces the combustion chamber of the gas turbine.

In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref>, pilot air flows downstream surrounding a pilot nozzle 1. A fuel-flow channel 2 is disposed inside the pilot nozzle 1. The fuel-flow channel 2 is parallel to the axis of the pilot nozzle 1 and bent outward at the tip 3.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The pilot nozzle 1 diffusion-injects fuel gas obliquely forward to form flame 4. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1B</figref> shows a view from the direction of an arrow A. As is clear from <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1B</figref>, the fuel gas injection port outlet has the cylindrical flow dividing body 5 installed in the center. The combustion gas that accompanies the combustion of fuel gas circulates in whirls in the direction of the arrows 6 at the outlet of the fuel gas injection port, the circulation being induced by the flow of fuel gas that jets out as if to avoid the flow dividing body 5. This stabilizes the flame 4 at the root of the flame and prevents the flame being blown off in a swift flow of air from upstream.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1C</figref> shows a case in which instead of the cylindrical flow dividing body 5 a flow dividing body 7 having a disk shape at the center is fitted to the outlet of the fuel gas injection port. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1D</figref> shows a view from the direction of an arrow D. As is clear from <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1D</figref>, the disk in the center of the flow dividing body 7 is supported on four sides by a ring fitted to the fuel gas injection port outlet.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> Because of this, fuel gas flows as if to avoid the centrally set disk and the combustion gas that accompanies a fuel gas combustion at the injection port outlet begins to circulate in the direction of the arrows 8. The flow dividing body 7 may well come in an elliptically cylindrical or prismatic shape also. Provision of the flow dividing body 7 in any shape thus improves the stability of the flame that occurs at the pilot nozzle. The flame stability thus improved is a substantial contribution to fuel economy.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the first example, the fuel gas injected from the pilot nozzle reacts with air to form a flame, around which then forms combustion gas accompanying the combustion. As this combustion gas circulates around the fuel injection port outlet, namely the portion where the root of pilot flame occurs, the pilot flame gets stabilized since the flame is protected by the circulating gas from being blown off in a rapid stream of pilot air from upstream.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref> shows a cross-section of a portion of a pilot nozzle 11 of the gas turbine combustor according to a second example. The pilot air that surrounds the pilot nozzle 11 and a fuel-flow'channel 12 are the same as the pilot nozzle 1 and the fuel-flow channel 2 in the first embodiment, so they are not explained but omitted. The pilot nozzle 11 has a cavity 14 provided on the downstream<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> side of the fuel gas injection port 13, a downstream side, that is, relative to the flow of pilot air. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2B</figref> shows a view from the direction of an arrow C. As is clear from <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2B</figref>, the cavity 14 is formed of a hollow partly provided on the downstream side of the fuel gas injection port 13.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Combustion gas arises around a flame at the pilot nozzle. In the presence of the cavity 14 near the root of the flame, the combustion gas flows into, and circulates in, the cavity 14 in the direction of the arrow 15. The whirls that the circulation produces stabilize the root of the flame and help prevent the flame from being blown off in a stream of air from upstream. The cavity 14 is easily worked by cutting or by electric discharge machining. The cavity, therefore, may not necessarily limit itself to the shape, size, or depth illustrated but may well choose any forms or dimensions that may facilitate the circulation of combustion gas. As the flame stability is improved, so also is fuel economy since the combustion of fuel oil from the main nozzle can be aided with a smaller input of fuel gas than in the conventional practices.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3A</figref> shows a cross-section of'a portion of a pilot nozzle 21 of the gas turbine combustor according to a third example. <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3B</figref> shows a view from the direction of an arrow D. The pilot nozzle 21 is characterized such that the bore Dm of a fuel-flow channel<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> 22, at the fuel gas injection port outlet 23, has been expanded in a counter boring fashion. When the fuel-flow channel bore is drastically expanded at the injection port outlet 23, the combustion gas that accompanies the combustion of fuel gas circulates'in the directions of the arrows 24. The whirls that the circulation produces surround the flame root and prevent the flame from being blown off in a stream of air from upstream. In expanding the channel bore, a choice is made of sizes or depths suitable enough to facilitate the circulation of combustion gas.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Such a structure related to the fuel-flow channel bore not only facilitates the working or machining involved. It also makes easy the formation of whirls in which combustion gas circulates. The structure further precludes the chance of pilot air blowing direct onto the root of the flame. This improves the flame stability of a diffusive flame 25 arising at the pilot nozzle 21. As the flame stability improves, so also does fuel oil economy.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4A</figref> shows a cross-section of a portion of a pilot nozzle 31 of the gas turbine combustor according to a first embodiment of this invention. <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4B</figref> shows a view from the direction of an arrow E. The pilot nozzle 31 according to the fourth embodiment is characterized in that it has a U-shaped wall 32 provided in a way such that an injection port 33 is thereby surrounded to head off the pilot air blowing<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> from upstream. The U-shaped wall 32 not simply heads off the air current from upstream of the pilot nozzle 31, it also helps whirls to arise inside the wall as combustion gas circulates in the direction of the arrow 34. Thus structured, the pilot nozzle mounted with the U-shaped wall also'forms whirls of combustion gas and improves the flame' stability of the diffusive flame arising at the pilot nozzle 31. As the flame stability improves, so also does fuel oil economy.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5A</figref> shows a cross-section of a portion of a pilot nozzle 41 of the gas turbine combustor according to a second embodiment of this invention. <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5B</figref> shows a view from the direction of an arrow F. The pilot nozzle 41 according to the second embodiment is characterized in that 'a cylindrical body 43 that protrudes so as to surround an injection port 42 is provided. This cylindrical body 43 heads off the pilot air that flows from upstream of the pilot nozzle 41 and forms whirls 44 of combustion gas inside the cylindrical body. That end of the cylindrical body 43 which is spaced afar downstream from the outlet of an injection port 42 may selectively be turned back inward in the shape 45. The purpose is to allow whirls to circulate more stably and to evade the impacts of entrained air. The cylindrical body 43 may also be installed on its flank with an air inlet 46 to supply air in a suitable amount and in a suitable<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> direction.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the same manner as the first through third examples and first embodiment of this invention, it is possible in the second embodiment to form whirls of combustion gas and to improve the flame stability of the diffusive flame that arises at the pilot nozzle. As the flame stability improves, so also does fuel oil economy.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> shows a cross-section of a portion of a pilot nozzle 51 of the gas turbine combustor according to a third embodiment of this invention. The pilot nozzle 51 according to the third embodiment is shaped so that a mixture of air and the combustion gas that accompanies fuel gas combustion does circulate. This pilot nozzle has an inclined plane 53 provided to hold off from the outlet of an injection port 52 the air flowing from upstream of the outlet of the injection port 52, relative to the flow of pilot air. At the outlet of the injection port 52, the pilot nozzle 51 has a pocket 54 provided, internal to the inclined plane 53, to allow the combustion gas to circulate.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Pilot air flows in the direction of from the rear end to the leading end of the pilot nozzle 51. When, relative to the flow of pilot air, there exists the inclined plane 53 extending from upstream of the outlet of the injection port 52 down to the outlet of the injection port 52, the air flows in the direction increasingly away from the outlet<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> of the injection port 52. This precludes the chance of the pilot air blowing off the flame that forms at the outlet of the injection port 52.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A provision of the pocket 54 at the outlet of the injection port 52, internal to the inclined plane 53, makes a combustion gas at the injection port outlet circulate in the pocket in the direction of the arrow 55 to stabilize the flame. The inclined plane 53 may not necessarily be flat but may moderately be curved. Desirably, the angle of inclination "a" of the inclined curve 53 and the angle of formation "b" of the pocket may be suitably chosen so as to allow combustion gas to circulate efficiently.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the same manner as the first through third examples and first and second embodiments of this invention, it is possible in the third embodiment to form whirls of combustion gas and to improve the flame stability of the diffusive flame that arises at the pilot nozzle. As the flame stability improves, so also does fuel oil economy.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> shows a cross-dimension of a portion of a pilot nozzle 61 of the gas turbine combustor according to a fourth embodiment of this invention. The pilot nozzle 61 according to the fourth embodiment is characterized in that it internally comprises a fuel-flow channel 62 that runs from a fuel gas supply source down in parallel with the axis of the pilot nozzle. The fuel-flow channel 62 is bent inward<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> at the leading end, in the direction of the axial center of the pilot nozzle.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The fuel-flow channel 62 that runs parallel to the pilot nozzle axis 63 is bent inward at the leading end, fuel gas is accordingly injected inward in the direction of the axial center 63 of the pilot nozzle to produce a flame 64. The high temperature gas that the flame 64-induced combustion produces circulates (see 65) outward from inside the combustor. When the flame 64 is built to match the flow direction of the high temperature circulating gas, then the flame can be stabilized that much easier.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Desirably, the fuel-flow channel 62 should be directed not only inward in the direction of the pilot nozzle's axial center 63 but also outward in the direction of the pilot nozzle circumference, in order that the direction of fuel gas injection relative to the circulating gas be optimized. An inward angle α and outward angle θ should be set appropriately. The leading end of the fuel-flow channel 62 may not necessarily be inflected as illustrated but may well be turned inward at an optimum curvature.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the same manner as the first through third examples and embodiments of this invention, this inward directed structure of the leading end of the fuel-flow channel according to the fourth embodiment improves the flame stability of the diffusive flame arising from the pilot<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> nozzle, the rate of improvement being substantially higher than in the case of injecting fuel gas on the circumferential side of the pilot nozzle, the side where the temperature is relatively low. This also improves flame stability and as the flame stability improves, so also does fuel oil economy.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">According to the fourth embodiment, the flow channel, up to and including the leading end, is laid in parallel with the pilot nozzle axis, the flow channel is bent inward at the leading end in the direction of the axial center of the pilot nozzle. Because of this, fuel gas is injected in the direction of the axial center of the pilot nozzle to produce a pilot flame. Near this flame, a high temperature gas produced consequent upon the combustion triggered by a flame from the main nozzle circulates outwardly from inside the combustor. When, considering this, a pilot flame is produced not so much on the pilot nozzle's circumferential side where temperature is relatively low as in the direction' of the circulating gas flow induced by the flame from the mainnozzle, where temperature is relatively high, it becomes easy for the pilot flame to get stabilized. Desirably, as well as directing the flow channel inward perpendicularly in the direction of the axial center of the nozzle axis, the same channel may well be directed outward in the direction of the nozzle circumference so as to optimize the direction<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> of gas injection relative to the circulating gas flowing outward.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">According to the pilot nozzle of the gas turbine combustor of this invention, it becomes possible to improve the flame stability of the flame that arises at the pilot nozzle. As the flame stability improves, so also does fuel oil economy.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980709" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Eine Gasturbinenbrennkammer mit einer Hauptdüse zum Einspritzen von Brennstofföl und mit einer Pilotdüse (31), wobei die Pilotdüse (31) aufweist:
