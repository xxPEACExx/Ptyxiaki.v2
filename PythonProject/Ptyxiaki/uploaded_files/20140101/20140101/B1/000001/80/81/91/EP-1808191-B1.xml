load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for proliferating lymphocytes which comprises bringing a body fluid into contact with a porous material and cultivating the lymphocytes out of the body fluid after contacting with said material. Furthermore, it relates to a method for preparing a pharmaceutical composition and the use of activated carbon or high-molecular compound in producing a porous material or body fluid treatment according to the present invention.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In recent years, attention has been focused on activated autologous lymphocyte therapy, which comprises taking immunocompetent cells (lymphocytes in particular) in blood out of the body, culturing them for stimulation/activation and for proliferation and again returning them into the body to thereby prevent the advance of cancer. This technique produces little side effects and makes it possible to maintain the quality of life (QOL) at high levels even during treatment and, therefore, is becoming more and more popular in the field of cancer treatment as a fourth choice of cancer therapy next to the three major cancer treatment methods, namely surgical therapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The technique is already in actual use as one of tailor-made highly advanced medical<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> treatment methods in university hospitals, cancer centers and specialized clinics and, expectedly, it will be used still more widely. This technique generally comprises collecting a portion of the blood of a patient, separating a lymphocyte fraction by density gradient centrifugation, adding the autologous plasma to a medium for exclusive use and cultivating the lymphocytes. Generally, the number of lymphocytes arrives at about 100 times the number of lymphocytes in the primary culture in a week. It has become known, however, that there are some such cancer patients that lymphocytes derived therefrom can hardly proliferate in the presence of autologous plasma but can proliferate in the presence of the plasma derived from another person (resulting from blood donation). Cancer cells produce cellular immunity inhibiting factors, for example such cytokines as transforming growth factor beta (hereinafter abbreviated as TGF-β), interleukin 4 (hereinafter abbreviated as IL4), interleukin 6 (hereinafter abbreviated as IL6) and interleukin 10 (hereinafter abbreviated as IL10) as well as prostaglandin E2 (hereinafter abbreviated as PGE2). Thus, the possibility is suggested that such factors might inhibit the proliferation of lymphocytes. However, the concentrations of these factors in the blood of cancer patients are almost the same as those in persons in normal health, although their local concentrations in cancer foci are high. Further, when such factors commercially available as reagents are dissolved in plasma at high concentrations and the influences thereof on lymphocyte proliferation are examined, little inhibition is observed. Such and other findings suggest that there is an unknown mechanism other than the involvement of such factors.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As a matter of fact, an adsorbent for adsorptively removing immunosuppressive acidic proteins (IAPs) (Patent Document 1), an adsorbent for adsorptively removing interleukins in body fluids (Patent Document 2) and an adsorbent capable of adsorbing TGF-β in body fluids (Patent Document 3), among others, have so far been disclosed. However, all of them<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> are limited in scope to the adsorptive removal of cytokines and there is no report about an adsorbent capable of improving the proliferative activity of lymphocytes. In recent years, the number of patients having activated lymphocyte therapy has been increasing year by year with the marked advance of such therapy and, on the other hand, the number of patients relying on blood donation because of poor lymphocyte proliferation has also been increasing. In the case of blood donation, it is necessary to secure non-autologous plasma in conformity with patient's therapeutic cycle. Further, there are a number of problems to be taken up from the safety viewpoint, for example the risk of infection; therefore, it is desired that a method for overcoming the lymphocyte proliferation inhibition in lymphocyte culture by a simple procedure without losing other useful substances be developed. Furthermore, in cancer patients as well whose lymphocyte can proliferate in the presence of autologous body fluids, it is expected that further improvements in proliferation rate and in cytokine producing activity, for instance, be achieved when the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation in lymphocyte culture is broken down. Currently, however, neither adsorbent, nor porous body, nor device nor treatment method is available for such purposes. Further, adsorbents prepared by causing a material capable of adsorbing cytokines and like immunosuppressive proteins to bind to a water-insoluble carrier have been disclosed (Patent Document 4 to 6). However, the effect of those adsorbents depends on an affinity between an amine residue and such immunosuppressive proteins as cytokines. Therefore, those adsorbents require the presence of an amine residue.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">At present, a treatment is eagerly anticipated which will promote the proliferation of those lymphocytes which are in a poorly proliferative condition in lymphocyte culture for the treatment of a disease against which a therapy comprising returning activated lymphocytes again into the body, typically activated autologous lymphocyte therapy, is therapeutically<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> effective.

a method for treating a disease against which returning extracorporeally activated mammalian lymphocytes into the body is therapeutically effective; and<br/>
a use of activated carbon or a high-molecular compound having an angle of contact with water within the range of 40° to 98° in producing a porous material for body fluid treatment to promote the lymphocyte proliferation in lymphocyte culture. The present invention provides a method for proliferating lymphocytes as claimed in claims 1-4, a method for producing a pharmaceutical composition as claimed in claim 5 and the use of activated carbon or a high-molecular compound in producing a porous material for use in the methods of claims 1 to 4 as claimed in claim 6.</p><heading id="h0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">First, the porous material of the invention is described.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The porous material of the invention is a porous material for use in body fluid treatment for promoting the lymphocyte proliferation in lymphocyte culture which contains a high-molecular compound having an angle of contact with water within the range of 40° to 98°.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the practice of the invention, the angle of contact with water can be determined by preparing a smooth film specimen constituted of the high-molecular compound, which is the main constituent of the porous material, forming a liquid drop on the film in a horizontal state using a microinjector and measuring the contact angle at room temperature. When the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> porous material is soluble in an organic solvent, the contact angle can also be measured after dissolving the porous material and preparing a cast film specimen on a flat sheet using the resulting solution. For details of the measurement method, reference can be made, for example, to "<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>Shin-Jikken Kagaku Koza (Lectures in Experimental Chemistry, New Series) 18: Kaimen to Koroido (Interface and Colloid)" (First Edition, published October 20, Showa 52 (1977) by Maruzen Co., Ltd.</text></nplcit>). Thus, a flat sheet specimen having a mirror-finish level of smoothness is placed horizontally so that the atmosphere surrounding the same may be filled with the saturated vapor of the liquid to be subjected to measurement, and a liquid drop is formed thereon using a microinjector. The size of the liquid drop is such that the contact diameter is about 3 mm or smaller. The contact angle can be determined by measuring the angle formed upon allowing the liquid drop to advance toward the solid surface (at the time when after the liquid is allowed to develop and spread on the specimen, the liquid drop becomes stable at a certain size) using a reading microscope (having a magnification of about 20) equipped with a goniometer. The visibility of the image becomes very good when the lens barrel is inclined by 1 to 2 degrees downward from the horizontal. The drop is illuminated from the front with light transmitted through an opalescent glass or with parallel beams of light transmitted through a heat ray-absorbing glass.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The contact angle data reported herein were measured by the method described later in the example section.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The high-molecular compound having an angle of contact with water within the range of 40° to 98° includes as typical examples, but is not limited to, synthetic high-molecular compounds such as nylon 6, nylon 6,6, nylon 11, polyethylene, poly(vinylidene chloride), poly(vinyl chloride), poly(vinyl acetate), polystyrene, styrene-divinylbenzene copolymers, poly(trifluoroethylene), poly(chlorotrifluoroethylene), poly(ethylene terephthalate), polypropylene, polyacrylic<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> esters (e.g. poly(methyl acrylate)), polymethacrylic esters (e.g. poly(methyl methacrylate)), crosslinked polyacrylates and crosslinked polyamides as well as cellulose and like water-insoluble ones.

The invention is useful in that it provides a porous material for relieving the lymphocyte proliferation inhibition in lymphocyte culture using a target body fluid in activated autologous lymphocyte therapy, for instance, according to which a disease is treated or the progress of a disease is inhibited by taking immunocompetent cells (lymphocytes in particular) in blood out of the body, culturing them for stimulation/activation and for proliferation and again returning them into the body, as well as a method for proliferating lymphocytes which utilizes the above-mentioned porous material.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56979623" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Verfahren zur Proliferation von Lymphocyten,<br/>
