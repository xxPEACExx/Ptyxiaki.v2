load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a terahertz electromagnetic wave radiation element which receives two coherent light waves, mixes them, and radiates a terahertz electromagnetic wave corresponding to the difference frequency thereof, and to a method of manufacturing the same.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A two-dimensional electron system is coherently polarized and vibrationally excited by means of an optical phonon or photon corresponding to inter-sub-band energy. This vibrational quantum is called two-dimensional electron plasmon. At a typical two-dimensional electron density (10<sup>11</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>), the two-dimensional electron plasmon is of a wavelength range of micron to submicron, and the basic mode frequency reaches the terahertz band. Therefore, the two-dimensional electron plasmon has a capability of serving as a mechanism for realizing functions of electromagnetic wave oscillation, electromagnetic wave detection, frequency mixing, frequency multiplication, etc. in the terahertz band.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Studies on the physical properties of the two-dimensional electron plasmon were started in the early 1970's. Studies on application to terahertz devices were started in the 1990's; the history is still short, and practical elements have not yet been developed.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">M. Dyakonov and M. Shur proposed a terahertz band application of two-dimensional electron plasmon in a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) structure (see Non-Patent Document 1). Since electron density, which determines the plasmon resonance frequency, can be controlled by means of gate bias, a frequency-variable characteristic which is of practical importance can be realized. The boundary conditions of the source and drain can be made asymmetric by means of a difference in bias dependency between the gate-source capacitance and the gate-drain capacitance. A radiation mode electromagnetic wave can be taken out at the drain open end. An odd-order harmonic component can be taken out from the drain end, and an even-order harmonic component can be taken out from the vicinity of the center of the channel. Therefore, when the density of two-dimensional electrons is modulated by the frequency difference terahertz component of photoconductive electrons generated through interband excitation by two light wave photons, plasmon resonance in the terahertz band can be induced (see Non-Patent Documents 2 and 3). This two-dimensional electron plasmon resonance wave is of a non-radiation mode, and cannot<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> be radiated to the outside. However, through provision of a metal grating or antenna structure in the vicinity of the two-dimensional electron plasmon, the terahertz-band two-dimensional electron plasmon vibration of the non-radiation mode can be converted to a radiation mode electromagnetic wave (see Non-Patent Documents 3 and 4). Thus, a terahertz-band photo mixer utilizing the two-dimensional electron plasmon can be realized.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">When a photo mixer is configured, the following two points are important.
<ol><li>(1) The efficiency of conversion from light waves to two-dimensional electron plasmon resonance.</li><li>(2) The efficiency of conversion from two-dimensional electron plasmon resonance to radiation electromagnetic waves. Of these, the efficiency of conversion from two-dimensional electron plasmon resonance to radiation electromagnetic waves mentioned in (2) above, which is the object of consideration in the present invention, will be described from the viewpoint of progress in conventional techniques.</li></ol></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A grating coupler has been introduced as a mode conversion mechanism for converting a two-dimensional electron plasmon resonance wave of the non-radiation mode to a radiation mode electromagnetic wave.

They asserted that the grating structure formed by means of two-dimensional electron density modulation functions as a photo coupler which efficiently absorbs far-infrared light, and the plasma resonance frequency can be controlled by means of two-dimensional electron density modulation.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In Non-Patent Document 4, S. A. Mikhailov explains electromagnetic-wave propagation characteristics by making use of the structural parameters of this grating structure, and physical property parameters of the material, including density of two-dimensional electrons, electron density at the grating portion, drift speed of electrons, and scattering relaxation time. He also showed that when the plasma frequency determined as a result of the density of two-dimensional electrons being periodically modulated by the grating becomes equal to the plasma frequency of the grating itself; if the degree of scattering of electrons is low, the transmission coefficient of electromagnetic waves exceeds 1 in a range in the vicinity of and lower than the plasma frequency, and an amplification gain can be obtained. As a specific measure, there was proposed to introduce, in place of a metal grating, a quantum wire whose conductivity is as<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> low as that of the two-dimensional electron plasmon.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">As described in Non-Patent Document 6, X. G. Peralta, <i>et. al</i>. formed two two-dimensional electron layers, periodically modulated the density of two-dimensional electrons of the upper layer by means of a single-grating-type gate, and observed the characteristic of optical response of the two-dimensional electron layers to radiation of terahertz electromagnetic waves. They showed that the resonance property which influences the optical response characteristic at the plasma frequency determined as a result of subjection to periodical density modulation is enhanced through provision of two two-dimensional electron layers.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Accordingly a terahertz electromagnetic wave radiation element is known which receives two coherent light waves, mixes then, and radiates a terahertz electromagnetic wave corresponding to the difference frequency thereof, the element comprising: a semiinsulating semiconductor bulk layer, a two-dimensional electron layer, a source electrode electrically connected to one side of the two-dimensional electron layer, and a drain electrode electrically connected to another side of the two-dimensional electron layer opposite to the source electrode.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As described later the efficiency of conversion from Plasmon resonance to terahertz electromagnetic wave radiation is low.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Another example of instruction of a grating structure for mode conversion is introduction of a spiral antenna structure which was proposed by V.

As shown in the drawing, a semiconductor heterojunction structure is formed on a substrate that constitutes a semiinsulating bulk layer. The semiconductor heterojunction structure is composed of a wide-band-gap buffer layer, a narrow-band-gap channel layer formed of an intrinsic semiconductor, and a wide-band-gap electron supply layer (carrier supply layer) in which a donor is doped two-dimensionally. The semiconductor heterojunction structure can be formed on the semiinsulating bulk layer through epitaxial growth with an accuracy on the nanometer level, by means of a technique of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) or metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE), which have been<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> practically used for mass production of compound transistors.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The buffer layer, the channel layer, and the electron supply layer cooperate to confine electrons two-dimensionally at the channel-side boundary between the channel layer and the electron supply layer to thereby form a two-dimensional electron layer. A strongly doped n-type semiconductor epitaxial layer is deposited on the electron supply layer as an ohmic layer. Metal electrodes are further formed at opposite end portions of the channel through film formation, whereby the metal electrodes and the channel layer are ohmic-connected, and thus source and drain electrodes are formed. Meanwhile, the ohmic layer above the channel is removed through recess etching, and a gate electrode is formed. The process up to this point is identical with a process typically used for manufacture of HEMT elements.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The gate electrode is etched into a comb-like shape, teeth in odd positions are connected together at the outside of the channel, and teeth in even positions are connected together at the outside of the channel, thereby forming two gate electrode gratings (for facilitating description, they will be referred to as "gate gratings A and B") assuming a nested double grating structure. By means of maintaining the gate gratings A and B at different bias potentials, the electron density of the two-dimensional electron layer immediately below the gate gratings can be modulated at the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> cycle of the gate gratings.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The double grating gate is desirably formed of a semi-metal having low conductivity, such as molybdenum. This is because the plasma frequency of the double grating gate can be made close to that of the two-dimensional electron layer, whereby the radiation efficiency of terahertz electromagnetic waves can be increased. Further, reducing the thickness of the gate electrode to a possible extent (to be equal to or less than the distance between the gate electrode and the two-dimensional electron layer) is important for improving emissivity.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In a case where the double-grating-type gate electrode is formed through, for example, a process of etching a second two-dimensional electron layer layered on the two-dimensional electron layer within the semiconductor heterojunction structure, the thickness of the electrode can be reduced to the maximum degree, and the conductivity of the electrode can be reduced to the same level as that of the two-dimensional electron layer. Therefore, the plasma frequency of the double-grating-type gate can be made close to that of the two-dimensional electron layer, whereby the radiation efficiency can be improved. In addition, since the conductivity of the second two-dimensional electron layer can be controlled by the gate bias potential, the plasma frequency of the double-grating-type gate can be variably<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> controlled. Accordingly, the radiation efficiency can be improved further in accordance with the frequency of electromagnetic waves to be radiated.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">After the element body is fabricated in the manner as described above, the semiinsulating bulk layer (substrate) is selectively etched or polished from the reverse face, and a clad material having a low dielectric constant is charged into (to fill) a resultant space. This clad material covers not only the left and right sides shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, but also the near and far sides in the drawing, so as to cover the periphery of the semiinsulating bulk layer. In a case where the side surfaces of the semiinsulating bulk layer are covered with a clad layer which is lower in dielectric constant than the semiinsulating bulk layer, the degree of confinement of electromagnetic waves within a vertical resonator increases, and the radiation loss can be reduced, whereby the conversion efficiency can be improved further.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the final step, a transparent metal such as ITO (indium tin oxide) is formed on the lower surface of the semiinsulating bulk layer through film forming. The transparent metal is transparent to light ranging from visible light to near-infrared light, and has a conductivity comparable to those of metals and therefore exhibits a reflection property to terahertz electromagnetic waves. Thus, it is possible to form a transparent metal mirror through<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> which light wave input passes and which functions as a mirror for terahertz electromagnetic waves.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Next, operation of a terahertz electromagnetic wave radiation element completed as described above will be described. Two linearly polarized coherent light waves (in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the direction of the electric field vector is shown by E), the frequencies of which are close to each other with a difference of the terahertz order, are caused to enter from the lower surface of the transparent metal mirror as seed light. In <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the wave number vectors of the two light waves are represented by k1 and k2, respectively, and their frequencies are represented by f0 and f0+Δf, respectively. Optically excited electrons can be generated through use of two light waves whose photon energies are greater than the band gap energy of an electron traveling layer which constitutes a two-dimensional plasmon but smaller than the band gap energies of the other semiconductor epitaxial layers and the semiconductor substrate. The optically excited electrons are accelerated by means of the gradient of the conduction band potential itself, and are injected into a two-dimensional plasmon region with the difference frequency component Δf. The two-dimensional plasmon is excited by the difference frequency component Δf of the optically excited electrons. Thus, in the two-dimensional electron region which is discretized to correspond to the double gate grating, plasmon resonance is excited by the difference frequency<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> component Δf. Plasmon resonance in a single two-dimensional electron region serves as an excitation source, which is coherently excited in the two-dimensional plane at the discrete cycle. This cyclic structure itself achieves the conversion to the radiation electromagnetic wave mode. However, it is known that, in the vicinity of the plasma frequency determined from the periodicity and electron density of the cyclic two-dimensional electron layer, the transmission/reflection characteristics of this two-dimensional electron layer have poles, many of which cause a decrease in transmissivity.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Meanwhile, since the two-dimensional electron layer has a reflection property, for radiation electromagnetic waves, a resonator is formed in the vertical direction between the two-dimensional electron layer and the transparent metal mirror newly provided. When the frequency of a radiation electromagnetic wave matches the standing wave condition of the resonator; i.e., when the resonator length coincides with (2n+1)/4 (where n is an integer) times the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave (in the terahertz band) to be radiated, the reflection component of the electromagnetic wave is superimposed on the electromagnetic wave component within the resonator. Since the conduction band of the two-dimensional plasmon is split to sub-bands, the reflected terahertz electromagnetic wave having reached the plasmon region can directly excite the two-dimensional plasmon through inter-sub-band<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> absorption. This leads to further excitation of plasma resonance, and causes positive feedback of plasma resonance → electromagnetic wave radiation.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Since the resonator length of the vertical resonator formed between the two-dimensional electron layer and the transparent metal mirror is fixed by the thickness of the semiinsulating semiconductor bulk layer, the resonance frequency is fixed within a frequency range in which the dielectric constant is constant. However, since the reflectance of the two-dimensional electron layer is not sufficiently high, the Q value of the resonator (determined by the reflectance of the transparent electrode mirror and the reflectance of the two-dimensional electron layer) is not high. Therefore, the effect of intensifying radiation electromagnetic waves can be obtained in a relatively wide range in the vicinity of the plasma frequency.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Due to the presence of the double-grating-type gate electrode, the plasma frequency is specified, because the double-grating-type gate electrode itself has cyclic electrode regions having high conductivity. When this plasma frequency becomes approximately equal to the plasma frequency of the two-dimensional electron layer, in a band in the vicinity of and lower than the plasma frequency, the energy of electromagnetic wave passing through this region is amplified upon receipt of energy from the two-dimensional<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> electron plasmon (the theory of S.

Therefore, the electron<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> densities in the quantum wires can be controlled so as to control their conductivities (proportional to the electron densities).

In a case where the gate length is set to the order of submicron and the electron density is set to about 10<sup>12</sup>cm<sup>-2</sup> in the semiconductor heterojunction material system, the plasma resonance frequency reaches the terahertz band. In the case of a photo mixer, when the frequency difference between two light waves with which the photo mixer is irradiated is set to the plasma resonance frequency, plasma resonance can be excited in the difference frequency terahertz band. This serves as a source of vibration. In this state, plasma resonance is individually excited in discrete regions immediately below individual gratings A. Notably, if only a single region is provided, electromagnetic wave radiation does not occur due to the plasma resonance, because the wavelength of plasma resonance waves is on the order of the gate length (submicron), and is considerably smaller than the<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> wavelength (several tens of microns) of terahertz electromagnetic waves which propagate in the air.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Since the gratings A and B are provided alternately and repeatedly, plasma resonance occurs in the discrete regions. By virtue of this cyclic structure; in other words, a grating-like structure in which the electron density is modulated with the cycle of the gate grating, the electron plasma is also resonated at a wavelength corresponding to that cycle. In this case, plasma resonance waves in the discrete regions couple together, and produce a synchronized large vibration as a whole. When this region is wide enough such that the size of the region becomes approximately equal to the wavelength of electromagnetic waves which propagate in the air, electromagnetic wave radiation occurs in the direction perpendicular to this plasma vibration. That is, the plasma vibration of non-radiation mode is converted to radiation-mode electromagnetic waves. The plasma frequency fp determined by this cyclic structure is determined by an equation fp = vp/λ where vp represents a phase velocity depending on the electron density, provided that the above-mentioned cycle or period (the distance of a pair of the gratings A and B) is set to n times the wavelength X, where n is an integer. The plasma frequency in the region immediately below the grating A naturally differs from that in the region immediately below the grating B. By means of setting the plasma frequency in the region immediately below<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> the grating A to fall within the terahertz band and setting the plasma frequency in the region immediately below the grating B to greatly shift from the terahertz band, the plasma resonance immediately below the grating A serves as a seed, and radiation of an electromagnetic wave of that frequency can be attained.
