Further, a portable device adapted to process said method is provided and a system comprising a plurality of networks and at least one portable device are also provided.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Mobile and wireless computing has evolved beyond the ability to wirelessly connect users to read and browse the web anywhere and anytime. Current trends involve exploiting local services, peers and services in local and foreign networks with unknown infrastructures. For example a mobile or portable device should be able to use a printer in a new network or a PDA should be able to use a faster web cache service available in a new network. With the advent of location-based services and peer-to-peer computing, service discovery may become a crucial part of middleware for an anywhere and anytime computing model adopted by mobile and pervasive computing networks.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As the computing trends in wireless and mobile networks move more towards distributed computing, acquiring knowledge about available services poses great challenges due to the mobility of devices and the dynamic nature of the environment.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Service discovery may generally be defined as the process of discovering the network location of software entities/agents that can provide access to network resources such as devices, data, and services. There are a number of service discovery protocols that are intended for local or personal area networks, i.e. SDP within Bluetooth, Sun's Java RMI based JINI, Microsoft's SSDP, as well as IETF's standardized SLP.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a framework for building and deploying distributed applications in local area networks. UPnP protocols: SOAP, GENA and SSDP, are layered on top of HTTP and the Transmission Control Protocol/Unreliable Datagram Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/CTDP/IP) network protocol suite. By providing a set of defined network protocols, UPnP allows devices to build their own APIs that implement these protocols in whatever language or platform they choose. The Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) enables devices to announce their presence to the network as well as discover other available devices and services. SSDP uses the UDP to send unicast and multicast queries. Once a device or service has been discovered, the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to retrieve the complete device and service descriptions.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Local networks are often private, or the public connectivity is in someway limited (perhaps by a firewall or other security mechanisms). When a portable device visits such a local network (using Bluetooth, 802.11, UWB or other short range network technology) the previous network state, such as the IP address of the mobile host, ARP table, service discovery cache, HTTP cache, etc, must be discarded and reset. This is not particularly difficult, but it does take time. Replenishing the service discovery cache can be particularly time consuming. If the mobile terminal re-visits a local network, it would be useful to preserve and reuse the previous network state, especially the service discovery cache.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Various caching strategies may be applied to distinguish useful service records from service records that have become stale. Replacement algorithms can take into account various properties, such as age, availability, and storage address of the cached data.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO03092313A1"><text>WO 03/092313 A1</text></patcit> relates to a method involving searching for an available frequency in the order of a search frequency list.

Said cache is being used for storing multiple network caches. Each network cache contains data associated with a specific network. In a first operation a detecting of an existence of at least one active network out of a plurality of networks is provided, wherein said portable device is allowed to communicate with said at least one active network. Next, a determining of a network identity of said at least one active network follows. Finally, an updating of said network related data content on the basis of said network identity is done and afterwards storing of said updated network related data content in said cache is performed if said network identity is unknown to said portable device. Otherwise, i.e. if said network identity is known to said portable device due to previous usage for instance, a visitation counter associated with said network identity is incremented in particular by one. The visitation counter is comprised by said network related data content.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to an embodiment of the present invention, connecting to said at least one active network is provided by using said stored network related data content by said portable device. Thus, the device is able to connect faster to an active network, because it may use data which is already available in the network cache. Hence, processes like handshaking or inquiry procedures between device and active network are avoided. The term network cache describes the set of cached network data which is associated with a certain network. The set of cached network data may be managed according to various network protocol rules and also by means of the method in accordance with the present invention. The cache of network caches comprises several entries and each entry corresponds to a network cache.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to another embodiment of the present invention, said updating is based on a replacement algorithm in particular on a Least Frequently Used (LFU) replacement algorithm. According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, each time said portable device connects to a certain network (i.e. the at least one active network for instance) out of said plurality of networks said visitation counter associated with said certain network is incremented, especially in case the network has been already visited previous in time. When a new network cache must be added to the cache of caches and there is insufficient space, the least frequently used network cache is replaced with the new network cache.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The "least frequently used" (LFU) algorithm in accordance with the present invention is different from the "least recently used" algorithm. The LFU algorithm counts (and ages) the number of times a mobile terminal connects to a network - not the number of packets sent via the network. This means that the network cache entry visitation counter will only be incremented by one when the associated network is visited, even if the visited network is used for several hours.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to another embodiment of the present invention, the LFU algorithm may be enhanced using a sliding visitation window. A visitation window is the number of times a network has been visited during a pre-defined period of time. The length of a period can be configured. A fixed number of visitation windows are associated with each network identity. The number of visitation windows can also be configured. Each time a mobile terminal attaches to a network, the visitation count of the current window associated with that network is incremented. The current visitation count of a network is the sum of all the visits in all of its visitation windows. When the current period ends, the oldest period is deleted.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to another embodiment of the present invention, an alternative to sliding windows is to maintain a list of every visit to every network in the network cache. When a new network cache needs to replace an old network cache, the list of visits is used to identify the least frequently visited network. When the least frequently used network cache is evicted from the cache of caches, then all of its visitations are also evicted.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to another embodiment of the present invention, said visitation counter is incremented until a certain threshold is reached. Once the threshold has been reached the counter is no longer incremented.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to another embodiment of the present invention, said determining of said network identity is performed by using of information from a DHCP server. The DHCP server delivers information such as the address of the network's IP gateway or if there is no gateway, the IP address of the DHCP server itself that can be used to identify the network cache.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to another embodiment of the present invention, said determining of<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> said network identity is performed by using of information corresponding to an IP router's MAC address or if no router is available, the MAC address of a Network Access Point (NAP) obtained using standard protocols other than DHCP. Thus, an additional alternative for determining the network identity and location, respectively, is provided. The network identity may be obtained even if a DHCP service is deactivated.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to another embodiment of the present invention, said network related data is stored in the cache according to said network identity of a network. Hence, a CPU is able to correctly control the cache, comprising network related data, on the basis of the network identity.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to another aspect of the present invention, a computer program product is provided, which comprises program code sections stored on a machine-readable medium for carrying out the operations of the method according to any aforementioned embodiment of the invention, when the computer program product is run on a processor-based device, a computer, a terminal, a network device, a mobile terminal, or a mobile communication enabled terminal.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to another aspect of the present invention, a computer program product is provided, comprising program code sections stored on a machine-readable medium for carrying out the operations of the aforementioned method according to an embodiment of the present invention, when the computer program product is run on a processor-based device, a computer, a terminal, a network device, a mobile terminal, or a mobile communication enabled terminal.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In particular, the operations comprises a detecting of an existence of at least one active network out of a plurality of networks is provided, wherein said portable device is allowed to communicate with said at least one active network.

The portable device is traveling through an area wherein a plurality of active networks is located. Said portable device is adapted to connect to an active network by means of a wireless data interface, but also a wired communication is imaginable within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The main idea is for a mobile terminal or portable device, respectively to contain a list or a cache of network caches. Each network cache is associated with a network the user has visited in the past. The contents of a network cache are populated by the protocols that operate while a terminal is connected to a particular network. These protocols include, but are not limited to: ARP, RARP, DHCP, AUTO-IP, HTTP, SLP, LDAP, and SSDP. Said protocols are needed for a proper communication between the device and other devices and services on the active network.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Each portable device in which the method in accordance with the present invention is executed comprises a cache memory or cache and among others a central processing unit (CPU). The CPU is adapted to mainly control all device operation. The cache used for network caches is a "meta-cache" and a meta-cache replacement algorithm is used to control the contents of the meta-cache.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Caching of distributed state on a per network basis may be useful for many applications, but it should be of particular use for protocols such as service discovery protocols that use caches to improve performance and do not require strong accuracy guarantees. Protocols such as UPnP's SSDP may need to transfer large files in order to discover what devices and services are available on a local<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> network. The ability to cache the SSDP descriptions of previously discovered devices and services may greatly improve its performance and responsiveness. In the present exemplary embodiment of the invention, SSDP may be used to populate each network cache of said portable device. Other protocols are usable as well within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Usually, network or discovery caches are intended to improve performance. The proposed cache of network caches may trade memory for speed - the speed improvement is most likely to occur when a mobile user revisits a network and reuses the previously cached network data already stored in the portable device.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In an operation S100, the operational sequence starts. In accordance with the aforementioned description of the inventive concept, a detecting of an active network is provided in an operation S110. This means that a portable device, for instance detects an active network in its environment and a low level transmission of data starts, which allows the portable device to detect the nature, type etc. of the present network.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In the next operation S200, the network identity of at least one detected and active network is provided. The operation of determining the network identity is exactly described in the flowchart with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2</figref>. If no network identity is determined, corresponding to the NO branch of the operation S200, the operational sequence may be restarted or alternatively an error handling mechanism may be started, for instance. If a network identity is detected, according to the YES branch, a following operation S400 will be provided. Said operation S400 provides the updating and activation of a network cache in the portable device.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">If no further processing is carried out the method comes to an end at operation S411 and may be restarted in an operation S 100 which corresponds to a new<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> iteration operation.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a flow chart of a network identity determining algorithm. After a portable device detects an active network, it is necessary to determine its network identity.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In an operation S200 the operational sequence starts.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">First, the portable device attempts to contact a DHCP server using the standard DHCP discover protocol which is represented by the conditional operation S210.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">If a DHCP server is available, corresponding to the YES branch of the conditional operation S210, then it is asked for the address of its default router. If a default router is available, YES branch of operation S220, its address is used as the network identity for this network as shown in the operational step S222. If no default router is available, corresponding to the NO branch of the operation S220, then the address of the DHCP server is used as the network identity, with reference to the operation S221.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">After the operations S221 or S222 were processed the operational sequence comes to an end in an operation S260.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">If there is NO DHCP server available which is depicted with reference to the NO branch of said operation S210, then an attempt is made to find a router using the standard IPv4 and IPv6 router discovery protocols, S230. If a router is found, YES branch of the conditional operation S230, then its address for the Network Identity may be used. Said use is depicted with reference to an operation S232.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">If NO router is found corresponding to the NO branch of the operation S230, then the portable device should determine if it is connected to the currently active<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> network via a NAP (<u>N</u>etwork <u>A</u>ccess <u>P</u>oint), as shown in an operation S231. If a NAP exists, according to the YES branch of operation S231, its MAC address should be used as the Network Identity, S233.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">If no NAP can be found as shown with reference to the NO branch of the conditional operation S231, then the portable device cannot determine the network identity of the currently active network and the process terminates in an operation S250.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">fig. 3</figref> the principle of an algorithm for managing the cache of network caches, in accordance with the present invention, is shown.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Though many replacement algorithms are possible, in accordance with the present invention a "least frequently used" replacement algorithm with sliding windows is introduced. A visitation window is the number of times a network has been visited during a certain period of time. Once a network cache has been activated (whether a new network cache is created or a previous cache is reused), network protocols such as SSDP, ARP and HTTP can use and modify it.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The operational sequence is started in an operation S400. When a portable device connects to a network, after it successfully determines the network's identity, it checks if the current window period has elapsed corresponding to an operation S410. If the period has elapsed, all visitation counts associated with that window are deleted which is represented by the operation S420 in accordance with the YES branch of S410. Thereby a new visitation count is created for each network cache and it is set to zero corresponding to an initialization step.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">After the window period has been checked, then the network identity of the newly visited network is compared to the cached identities in the cache of network caches. This is depicted with reference to the conditional operation<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> S415.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">If the currently visited network identity is not new, i.e., it matches the network identity of a network already in the cache of network caches, then the No branch of S415 is selected and operation S417 follows. If, the currently visited network identity is new, i.e., it does not match the network identity of a network already in the cache of network caches, then the YES branch of S415 is taken and the conditional operation S428 follows. If there is enough space for a new network cache, then no replacement is needed and the NO branch is selected and the new network cache is created, S440. The newly created network cache is then selected for further processing. If there is not enough memory space, the YES branch will be selected and a network cache will have to be chosen so that it can be deleted to make space for the new network cache, S425.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">With reference to the YES branch of the conditional operation S428 the (LFU) network cache replacement algorithm in accordance with the present invention is provided. Each network cache has a list of visitation counts, one per visitation period, associated with it. The number of times a network has been visited is calculated by totaling all the visitation counts of all the periods associated with that network cache. The network cache with the smallest number of visits is deleted, S425, a new network cache is created, S440, and the newly created network cache is selected for further processing.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The visitation count of the selected network is incremented and its cache is activated, as shown in operations S417 and S430, respectively. Once the network cache is activated it can be used by other protocols such as SSDP, ARP, and HTTP.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">fig. 4</figref>, the portable device 1 shall be realized on the basis of a processor-based electronic device which comprises typically a CPU 10,<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> Input/Output unit 20, and storage component 30.

The cache comprises contents relating each network visited by the mobile device 1. For each previously visited network the cache 50 stores the network data in the modules NC 1 to NC n, wherein n is a limited value defining the number of already visited networks. As aforementioned, the memory space in the cache 50 is limited, thus a cache refreshment module 51 is<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> needed to ensure the consistency of the content within cache block 50. The cache refreshment module 51 may be directly connected with the CPU or further a clock to ensure a synchronous refreshment of the cache content.
