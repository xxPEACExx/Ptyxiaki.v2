In addition, in a laminated metalized film, slits provided at the center in the width direction of metalized deposition electrodes and extending in the longitudinal direction of dielectric films do not overlap with each other. Accordingly, since fuses do not overlap with each other, the fuses are apt to emit heat and their non-uniformity in operation is little.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a metalized film according to the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2A</figref> is a plan view of the metalized film shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2B</figref> is a sectional view of the metalized film shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2A</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3A</figref> is a perspective plan view showing a configuration of a metalized film capacitor using the metalized film shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3B</figref> is a sectional view of a main portion of the metalized film capacitor shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3A</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3C</figref> is a sectional view of the metalized film capacitor shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3A</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3D</figref> is a sectional view of a main portion of a metalized film capacitor according to another embodiment of the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> is a plan view of a fuse according to the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref> is a plan view of a fuse according to the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6A</figref> is a perspective plan view showing a configuration of a conventional metalized film capacitor.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6B</figref> is a sectional view of the metalized film capacitor shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6A</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 7A</figref> is a perspective plan view showing a configuration of another conventional metalized film capacitor.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 7B</figref> is a sectional view of the metalized film capacitor shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 7A</figref>.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b>REFERENCE MARKS IN THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013"><ul><li>1: FIRST DIELECTRIC FILM</li><li>1A, 1B: SECOND DIELECTRIC FILM</li><li>2: FIRST HIGH RESISTANCE PORTION</li><li>2A: SECOND HIGH RESISTANCE PORTION</li><li>3: FIRST LOW RESISTANCE PORTION</li><li>3A: SECOND LOW RESISTANCE PORTION</li><li>4: FIRST FUSE</li><li>4A: SECOND FUSE</li><li>4B, 4C: FUSE ANGLED PORTION</li><li>4D: FLAT PORTION</li><li>5: FIRST BAND-SHAPED PORTION (INSULATION MARGIN)</li><li>5A: SECOND BAND-SHAPED PORTION (INSULATION MARGIN)<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></li><li>6B: FIRST SLIT</li><li>6A: SECOND SLIT</li><li>6C: THIRD SLIT</li><li>6X: FOURTH SLIT</li><li>6E: FIFTH SLIT</li><li>6D: SIXTH SLIT</li><li>6F: SEVENTH SLIT</li><li>6Y: EIGHTH SLIT</li><li>6G: WIDTH OF FIRST SLIT</li><li>7, 7A: MICROSCOPIC BLOCK</li><li>8: METALIZED CONTACT</li><li>11A, 11B: DIELECTRIC FILM</li><li>12A, 12B, 12C, 12D: HIGH RESISTANCE PORTION</li><li>13A, 13B: LOW RESISTANCE PORTION</li><li>14: FUSE</li><li>15A, 15B: BAND-SHAPED PORTION (INSULATION MARGIN)</li><li>16B: FIRST SLIT</li><li>16A: SECOND SLIT</li><li>16C: THIRD SLIT</li><li>17: MICROSCOPIC BLOCK</li></ul></p><heading id="h0006"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a metalized film according to the invention, <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2A</figref> is a plan view of the metalized film shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1, and Fig. 2B</figref> is a sectional view taken along line A-A' of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2A</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3A</figref> is a transparent plan view of a metalized film capacitor on which the metalized film shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1 to 2B</figref> is laminated. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3B</figref> is a sectional view taken along line<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> B-B' of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3A.

After further winding these films 1 and 1A, metal is thermal- sprayed on both sides of films 1 and 1A, metalized contact 8 as external electrode drawing portions connected to low resistance portions 3 and 3A, respectively, are formed to complete a metalized film capacitor, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3C</figref>. Metalized contacts 8 are insulated from each other.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the above configuration, films 1 and 1A are laminated so that slits 6B and 6E do not overlap with each other. Accordingly, even if a great deal of heat is generated when large current flows, operability of fuses 4 as the self-security mechanism becomes stable without having an effect on heat on fuses 4.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">For slits 6A in high resistance portion 2, fuses 4 are provided only in microscopic blocks 7 at the side of band-shaped portion 5. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2A</figref>, two fuses 4 are connected to one microscopic block 7 constructed by three slits 6A, 6B and 6C. Therefore, current flowing through fuses 4 connected to one microscopic block 7 increases, and operability of fuses 4 near the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> central portion in the width direction of films 1 and 1A where heat is generated at the maximum is enhanced. Since the divided electrodes are provided in the form of a lattice, a withstand voltage increases and reduction of capacitance is suppressed. These effects are equally applied to high resistance portion 2A.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Although slits 6B and 6E do not overlap with each other, it is preferable that a distance between them falls within 10% of the width of film 1. This suppresses capacitance from being reduced due to reduction of an effective electrode area.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In this embodiment, metal is deposited on only one surface of each of films 1 and 1A. Alternatively, metal is deposited on both surfaces of film 1, high resistance portions 2 and 2A and low resistance portions 3 and 3A are provided in both surfaces, and then film 1 is laminated on second dielectric film 1B on which metal is not deposited. This makes it possible to reduce a distance between high resistance portions 2 and 2A and increase capacitance of the capacitor. It is possible to make the film capacitor smaller by using a thin film as dielectric film 1B.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the conventional film capacitors, in many cases, a thick dielectric film is used as measures against heat. On the contrary, in this embodiment, films 1 and 1A may be thin. Accordingly, a potential gradient can be increased depending on the thickness of film 1, and particularly, it is possible to use the film capacitor of this embodiment for vehicle inverter smoothing capacitors under high temperature use environments.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Next, shapes of slits 6B, 6E, 6D, 6F, 6Y, 6A, 6X and 6C are described. <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> is a plan view of fuse 4 (indicated by a dashed line) provided between slits 6B in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3A</figref>.

Angled portion 4C having the round shape makes it possible to reduce operation variety of fuse 4 without concentrating heat transferred from film 1 on the angled portion. Thus, it is preferable to make angled portion 4C of fuse 4 round.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In this case, it is more preferable that flat portion 4D of fuse 4 other than angled portion 4C has a length not shorter than a half of a width 6G of slit 6B.

The distance between fuses 4 and 4A in the central portion of film width direction when two films 1 and 1A are paired is set to be 3 mm.

It is believed that sample 2 generates more heat since fuses 14 overlap with each other in the central portion in the film width direction. Sample 3 is provided with fuses 14 in the width direction of high resistance portion 12C and at the side of electrode drawing portion. It is believed that much heat is generated from fuses 14 at the side of electrode drawing portion, which promotes increase of temperature of the capacitor.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The primary reason why samples 1 and 2 increase less in temperature than sample 3 is that current flowing through fuses on a current path is small. As heat is proportional to about the square of current, the biggest factor of suppressing heat is to flow current through fuses a little. In this way, by suppressing heat, the capacitor is improved in its heat resistance and can be used in a high temperature range, for example, in the field of automobile.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Next, a voltage step-up test at 100°C and 110°C is carried out to confirm safety in a high temperature range by flowing ripple current of 20 Arms.
