It is the source of the contact information for phone calls, text messages, faxes, instant messages and emails. A challenge in the mobile phone market is inserting, updating, and maintaining contact information stored in the phonebook. Currently, one must manually enter phone numbers into one's mobile phone. This takes time, is often difficult with such small buttons and screens on phones, and is prone to errors with manual data entry. Often, the result is that many individuals do not enter contact information in their mobile phonebooks.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In addition, these problems restrict the user from adding alternate phone numbers (e.g. business phone, home phone, and fax) associated with a contact, even though today's phonebooks can support multiple numbers. With the growth of more sophisticated phones (e.g. Smart Phones, IP phones, and Internet capable phones) there is also a need to store email addresses and Instant Message (IM) addresses of contacts. Entering email and IM addresses, however, can be even more problematic than entering phone numbers.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Another problem for users today is the inability to control the distribution of contact information to others. For example, one might provide a mobile phone number or business telephone number to another person but not want to provide their home telephone number. Thus, users continue to face many problems in using and benefiting from the capabilities of a device phonebook.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2003236769A"><text>US 2003/236769</text></patcit> discloses a method and a system for storing contact information in the memory of a first electronic device, which is capable of communicating via a communication network, with at least one second electronic device.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>Summary of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided an application module according to claim 7.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a server according to claim 18.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided an information management system according to claim 19.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Examples of the invention provide systems, methods, and device enhancements to automatically insert, exchange and update a caller's contact information into a user's phonebook. The phonebook can reside on either the UICC card (Subscriber Interface Module ("SIM"), USIM, Mega SIM, any other smart card or an integrated chip), on<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the mobile device or on a remote server, for example. The automatic insert and/or automatic exchange mechanism is triggered when a call is made between two people on mobile phones or other devices. Upon call completion, a caller is asked if the caller wants to send updated information to a call recipient. If yes, the information is automatically sent to the recipient, based upon the permission settings provided by the sender, or caller. The recipient has the option of receiving the new information at his or her device. Thus, an exemplary implementation of the invention comprises an information management system having a first user device having at least one of a Subscriber Identity Module, a UMTS Subscriber Identity Module, a smart card or an embedded chip, a second user device configured to interface with the first user device over a wireless network, and an application module configured to enable the first user device to retrieve information associated with the second user device over the wireless network upon a communication between the first user device and the second user device.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Implementations of the invention can include one or more of the following features.

In this case, for example, the (U)SIM application module 2090 becomes a phone dependant software application rather than a UICC card application.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The (U)SIM application modules 2090, 2091 and the UICC card phonebooks 2033, 2083 of the first user phone 2010 and the second user phone 2050 can be combined such that both are deployed as a single software program. The UICC cards 2030 and 2080 can also be a different type of information storage and execution medium such as a communication chip or a variation of a UICC or Smart Card. The UICC cards 2030 and 2080 can also be another integrated smart card or chip within a phone. The UICC phonebooks 2033, 2083 may be replaced with another type of file or software program to manage the contact entries and other personalized items.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The (U)SIM application module 2090 is saved on the UICC card 2030. The module 2090 listens for phone call related events, sends requests to the other phones, receives caller information, and inserts contact information into the UICC phonebook 2033 or on the phone itself. Additional features can include: software activation, personal information update,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> default access level setting, phonebook backup and restore. The application module 2090 is compatible with 2G and 3G specifications, specifically: 3GPP TS 31.111 (Release 6) "USIM Application Toolkit (USAT)", 3GPP TS 31.102 (Release 6) "Characteristics of the USIM application", ETSI TS 102.241 (Release 6) "UICC API for Java Card". The Mobile Network can also be any future mobile, fixed line, or any other combination of network. The application module 2090 can further support the following phonebook file types, for example: ADN, ANR, EMAIL, SNE, etc. The module 2090 can also support basic phonebook structure: PBR type 'A8' ('A9' or 'AA' type extended phonebooks are optional). The application module 2090 can communicate directly via GPRS, SMS, MMS, or TCP/IP. The UICC Card Requirements are, for example, Java Card 2.1.1/2.2.1. Basic functionality requires approximately 18K storage on the UICC card. Other card requirements and storage capacity are possible and envisioned. Further, although functionality is discussed with respect to the first user phone 2010, similar functionality is available and installed on the second user phone 2050.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Referring also to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG 3</figref>, the application module 2090 is built on the SIM Tool Kit (STK) Framework 2032, which communicates to the first user phone 2010 through the Event Communication Module 2014. The STK framework 2032 registers with the following events of the first user phone 2010: a call control event 3010, a call disconnected event 3020, a call connected event 3030, a menu selection event 3040, an SMS PP data download event 3050, and a terminal profile download event 3060. The SIM Tool Kit (STK) framework 2032 sends proactive commands to the first user phone 2010. For example, the framework 2032 sends a command for providing local information 3070, select items 3080, display texts 3090, send SMS 3100, refresh 3110, more time 3120, and get input 3130. A setup event list 3150 and a setup menu 3160 are proactive commands issued through the STK Framework 2032. A proactive handler 3170 is used as a data container, e.g., for storage of data.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Referring also to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, a method of initiating the (U)SIM application module 2090 over the mobile phone 2010 and the UICC card 2030, is now described. The (U)SIM application module 2090 can be inserted into the User 1 UICC card 2030 by the mobile operator or by the UICC manufacturer, for example. The UICC cards may be purchased with the (U)SIM application module 2090 preinstalled to the UICC card 2030 by the UICC card manufacturer, to the RAM of the card. The first user inserts the UICC card 2030 in the mobile phone 2010 and the (U)SIM application module 2090 is powered automatically to determine if the application module 2090 is set to a "Disable" state, stage 5010. If the applet<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> is not set to "Disable", then the application module 2090 configures itself based on the Terminal Profile Download Event 3060, at stage 5020 (see <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 5B</figref> and related description).</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Referring also to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5A</figref>, the application module 2090 handles the Terminal Profile Download Event 5010. The terminal profile download event 5010 lists the events the phone supports. If some of the SIM Toolkit events/commands are not supported by the handset, the (U)SIM application module 2090 operates differently in order to compensate for the phone's short-comings, at stage 5130. When the minimum handset requirements are not met, the (U)SIM application module 2090 deactivates and removes itself from the SIM Toolkit menu, stage 5180. At stage 5140, if the application module 2090 is in operational mode, the application downloads the MyProfile Data File 2035. At stage 5160, prior to the operation of the (U)SIM application module 2090, the first user initiates setup of the application to enable sending and receiving contact information with others, stage 5160. The (U)SIM application module 2090 requests that User 1 activates the application through a setup process, stage 5170 (see <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 5C</figref> and accompanying description for the setup process). At the conclusion of, or uopn interruption of or at the temporary break from the setup Profile Process, stage 5170, the activity ends, stage 5190.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Referring also to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG 5B</figref>, the application module 2090 is configured according to the capabilities of the phone 2010, 2050. At stage 5210, the application module 2090 sets to an "Idle" status. At stage 5225, the application module 2090 collects the TAC (Part of IMEI number) from the phone 2010. At stage 5230, the application module 2090 gathers a handset mode from the Operation Mode File 2034. At stage 5235, the application module 2090 reads the User 1 Configuration File 2039. At stage 5240, the default language is set if UCS2 is supported within the UICC card 2030. At stage 5245, the Abbreviated Dialing Number (ADN) File (SIM phonebook 2033) is tested. At stages 5260, 5265, 5270, the (U)SIM application module 2090 registers the operation level of the application. The application module 2090 can operate in two different modes: SR (Send and Receive) or RS (Receive Then Send). The embodiments of this invention describe the fully featured SR Mode. RS Mode is a subset of the fully functional SR Mode. The applet reaches stage 5290, and the application configuration is completed based on the terminal profile of the phone 2010.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Referring also to <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 5C</figref>, a user sets up the MyProfile File 2035 on the UICC card 2030. Activation can also be done at the point of sale or OTA network 2001 remotely by the mobile operator through a remote configuration process. If the (U)SIM application module 2090 is pre-installed, turning on the phone or ending a call after the first incoming or outgoing call may also activate the (U)SIM application module 2090.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG 5C</figref>, the applet activation process through a manual operation by a user is described. When the (U)SIM application module 2090 executes, User 1 is prompted to initiate the applet at stage 5310 by entering the contact information with the following dialog box, for example: "Set up your profile once, and exchange it with friends after phone call" using the STK Display Text Proactive Command 3090. At stage 5320, User 1 is asked to enter each contact data in a sequential manner. The standard fields of contact information include fields for a mobile phone number, office phone number, and a home phone number. Other fields of data such as email and Instant Messenger address may be entered after the initial set up process. User 1 is asked to enter a name for the contact, and a mobile number for the contact. User 1 is also asked to enter a work number and a home number. The numbers are formatted, and User 1 is redirected to stage 5320 for a next entry. The contact data is stored by the STK using a Get Input Proactive Command 3140 within the user 1 MyProfile 2035.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Referring also to <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG 5D</figref>, the User 1 application module 2090 checks if the entered contact phone numbers are in the correct International Format. Each time User 1 is asked to enter a phone number (Mobile, Work and Home), the (U)SIM application module 2090 automatically validates whether the entered numbers matches international numbering format (such as +15088368810), stage 5410. If the formatting is correct, the process terminates at stage 5490. If the formatting is incorrect, the application module 2090 appends the International Direct Dialing (IDD) and the National Direct Dialing (NDD) code to the numbers. The confirmation is displayed to the user using the Display Text Proactive Command 3090. Once the confirmation is displayed, the process is terminated, at stage 5490.

The users have the option of changing these designations at any time by accessing the application module 2090 through the SIM Tool Kit<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> 2032 and 2082 menu within the UICC card. The application module updates the MyProfile Data File 2035 for User 1 and MyProfile Data File 2085 for User 2 (see <figref idrefs="f0020 f0021 f0022 f0023 f0024 f0025">FIG. 8</figref> and accompanying description, Manual Applet Navigation).</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Referring also to <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG 6A</figref>, the User 1 application module 2090 communicates, packages the information, and sends the User 1 contact information to User 2. The contact information management system 2000 can be used over a mobile network. User 1 places a call with the User 1 phone 2010 to the User 2 phone 2050 via the mobile operator. The (U)SIM application module 2090 of the User 1 UICC card 2030 is initiated when the "Call Control Event" is triggered within the phone 2010.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Referring also to <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG 6B</figref>, the User 1 application module 2090 checks the User 2 operations mode data file 2084 to see if the application module 2090 is in "active" mode, stage 6100. If the applet module 2090 is in the "Idle" state, the module does not do anything and remains in the "Idle" state. If the applet is in the "Active" state, the module 2090 retrieves the phone number of the User 2 phone 2050 from the Call Control Event 3010. The U(SIM) application module 2090 detects the number type, stage 6120. If the number is a listed national mobile number, then it sets the applet state as a "Call Control Happened", stage 6140. If the dialed number is a "non-mobile" number, then the application module 2090 sets its state as "Idle", stage 6150. After successfully retrieving the User 2 Phone Number, the applet completes this process, at stage 6190. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0009 f0010 f0011 f0012 f0013 f0014 f0015 f0016 f0017">FIG. 6</figref>, the call connected event 3030 triggers the application module 2090.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 6C</figref>, after the Call Connected Event 3030 is triggered, the application module 2090 checks at stage 6210 if the applet state is in "Call Controlled Happened" state. If the applet state is different, then the applet terminates itself at stage 6290. If the applet is in the correct state, then the application module 2090 checks if this is an outgoing call, at stage 6220. If this is not an outgoing call, then the applet state fails and the applet terminates itself at stage 6290. If this is an outgoing call, then at stage 6230, the module 2090 remains in "Call Control Happened" state and continues its function.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">When the User 1 hangs up the phone 2010, the call disconnected event 3020 triggers the User 1 application module 2090.

If the User 1 MyProfile Data File 2035 is complete and valid, the User 1 application module 2090 performs a Roaming Detection (see <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 6G</figref> and associated description). At stage 6430, if the roaming restriction applies, the application goes to stage 6490. If there are no roaming restrictions in place, at stage 6440, the User 1 application module 2090 accesses the User 1 LND Counter Data File 2037 and checks if the Last Number Dialed (LND) threshold value has been reached. At stage 6440, if the LND Counter threshold value has not been reached, the application goes to stage 6490. If the LND Counter threshold value has been reached, the User 1 application module 2090 triggers a question to Display Control Module 2017: " Send My Profile". The User 1 has four options: "Personal", "Business", "Both", "Do not Send' and "Settings". If User 1 selects the "Do not Send" option, the application module 2090 does not prompt any other questions. If User 1 selects "Settings", the User 1 is directed to the Settings screen to make modifications to MyProfile or to Disable/Enable the Send and Add Features. If the User 1 selects one of the other options ("Personal", "Business", "Both"), then at stage 6460, the User 1 application module 2090 increments the LND counter value for the dialed phone number and, at stage 6470, saves the new value within the User 1 LND Counter Data File 2037. The User 1 application module 2090 creates a "Send MyProfile' SMS (see <figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 6F</figref> and associated description). In order to let User 1 be aware that application module 2090 exchanges contact information using SMS, the first time User 1 chooses to send his contact information, User 1 is notified by the following message: "You are going to send SMS, are you sure you want to continue?" This notification is made once, and if User 1 either accepts or rejects sending SMS the first time this notification is made, this message will not be displayed for subsequent Sends.

At stage 6620, if the current Mobile Country Code (MMC) matches the User 1's Mobile Country Code, the roaming restriction does not apply. At stage 6620, if the current Mobile Country Code (MMC) does not match User 1's Mobile Country Code, then, at stage 6630, the User 1 application module 2090 checks the number dialed with the International Country Code. If the number was dialed with the international country code, the roaming restriction does not apply. If the International Country Code is not dialed, at stage 6630, then roaming restrictions apply, and the application goes to stage 6440 in <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG 6E</figref>.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Referring also to <figref idrefs="f0016">FIG. 6H</figref>, the User 1 application module 2090 checks the LND counter value for each user. The LND counter value check feature is an enhancement to the static Event Counter. The number of times User 1 is prompted to send an update to other users is reduced. The value check process 6440 is based on the frequency in which each number is called (i.e. some numbers are called 10 times a day, and others are called 10 times in a month) so that User 1 is asked to resend his contact information after an appropriate number of calls - instead of a fixed number of calls. At stage 6710, the User 1 application module 2090 locates the new dialed number from the LND Counter Data File 2037. If the dialed number is not in the list, the number is added to the list.

The Send Update action can be triggered by an outgoing call or by an incoming User 1 application module 2090 SMS communication, for example. The User 1 application module 2090 performs the Send process, e.g., in <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 6E</figref>. The system and the methods used for "Update" is substantially the same as the "Send" process. The frequency of the "Send Update?" query is controlled by the User 1 LND Counter Data File 2037. Each LND Counter Data is tied to the phone call destination number or SMS origination phone number. In order to prevent repetitive send requests for frequent callers, the User 1 LND Counter Data File 2037 tracks the number of outgoing calls for each unique destination address. The send query is asked after the User 1 LND Counter Data, for a given destination address, reaches the Base Threshold Value. User 1 may change information in the MyProfile Data File 2035 and the counters reset process is triggered. A change to Personal information (Name, Mobile or Home number) resets the LND counters for all the contacts who have previously received Personal information. A change to Business information (Name, Mobile or Work number) resets the LND counters for the contacts who have previously received Business information. A change to both Personal and Business information resets all the counters. Once the counter for a given contact is reset, a subsequent call to this contact triggers contact information exchange.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The "Receive Update" function is configured to allow the User 2 application module 2091 to receive a SMS message that contains the caller's contact information with the updated information.
