The known arrangement is used to detect nuclear magnetic resonance spectra from an object subjected to a magnetic resonance excitation. For this purpose in the known arrangement the generator comprises a receiving coil which is arranged to generate the informative signal by picking up a free induction decay signal generated in the object at Larmor frequency. In order to transmit the informative signal from the first location also indicated as the first electrical site, notably the measurement site, to the second location also indicated as the second electrical site, notably a data analysis site, the known arrangement comprises a wiring cable whereto a suitable amplifier is connected for amplification of the informative signal.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It is a disadvantage of the known arrangement that the electrical field generated by the radio-frequency operatable receiver coil induces radio-frequency currents in the wiring, which may be hazardously increased due to the fact that the wiring and the surrounding medium can form a resonant circuit. The thus induced currents induce not only parasitic disturbances of suitable accessory devices, but may lead to a substantial heating of the wiring and the surrounding medium, which is unacceptable, especially when such arrangement are conceived to be applied in-vivo. It is noted that in principle an imaging session comprises two phases: "transmit" and "receive". In the transmit phase all receivers<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> are detuned and normally do not produce hazardous signal. The wiring, on the contrary, being a conductor constitutes a receiver in which hazardous currents are induced and may be amplified by a cable resonance.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The US-patent application <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20040056103A"><text>US2004/0056103</text></patcit> discloses an arrangement for conducting a signal, comprising a capacitively coupled signal transmission line for transmitting an informative signal of a first frequency between a first end of and a second end of said line, a signal generating circuit arranged at the first end of the capacitively coupled signal transmission line for generating the informative signal (e.g. an MR signal), and an amplifier arranged in an electrical connection with the signal generating unit for amplifying the informative signal. the capacitively coupled signal transmission line comprises a plurality of portions coupled in series by capacitive elements in the form of capacitors for transmitting the amplified informative signal between said first end and said second end. The document also discloses a further signal generating unit in the form of a hf generator for generating a further signal conceived to be transmitted via said capacitively coupled transmission line in a direction from the second end to the first end for the supply of energy for improvement of visibility of the tip of the catheter during mri using the Overhauser phenomenon, the frequency of the further signal being higher than the frequency of the informative signal and the transmission line being arranged to have a passband for the further signal.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is an object of the invention to provide an arrangement which is substantially compatible to a radio-frequency environment, notably the magnetic resonance imaging environment.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">To this end in the arrangement according to the invention is provided as defined in the independent Claim 1.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The technical measure of the invention is based on the insight that by subdividing a continuous wiring line into a plurality of portions comprising elements with capacitive electrical properties, hazardous common mode radio-frequency resonances, notably at Larmor frequency are avoided. The capacitively coupled transmission line is designed to have a substantial impedance of respective capacitive couplers for common mode. This also results in an attenuation for the informative signal, which is generated at the first electrical site. To compensate for the attenuation of the informative signal the arrangement according to the invention comprises the amplifier, preferably located in the thus formed electrical circuit nearby the first electrical site. It is noted that the capacitively coupled transmission line is known per se from <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2004090914A1"><text>WO 2004/090914 A1</text></patcit><b>.</b> The disadvantage of the known capacitively coupled transmission line is in the fact that the informative signal is substantially attenuated while passing through the known capacitively coupled transmission line, leading to a poor signal/noise ratio of the informative signal at the second electrical site.

Thus, the informative signal is advantageously converted to<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> another frequency with a lower attenuation in the wiring.

Examples of suitable parametric amplifiers based on nonlinear properties of components comprise, for example, electric capacitance of the varactor diode or a capacitor with non-linear permittivity. The arrangement 10 according to the invention is suited for transmitting an informative signal S1, generated by suitable signal generator 1 at a first electrical site 7a to a second electrical site 7b. The first electrical site 7a is electrically connected to the second electrical site 7b by means of a capacitively coupled transmission line 5a, 5b. In order to enable such capacitively coupled transmission line distributed or lumped capacitors 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d can be used. The arrangement is connectable to an accessory device 6, which may comprise a spectrometer, a further signal generator, tuning means, etc. The further signal S2 is conceived to be generated by the accessory device 6 and to be transported via the capacitively coupled transmission line 5a, 5b in a direction from the second electrical site 7b to the first electrical site 7a. The further signal S2 can be used for feeding the amplifier 2, or for carrying the signal S1.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The present embodiment will describe the arrangement according to the invention based on a varactor diode 2. It is noted that the principle of the varactor diode is known per se in the art, whereby for all elements thereof standard technology may be used. The principle of the amplification by parametric amplifier can be explained as follows: the capacitance C of a capacitor is determined by the charge Q and the voltage V: C = Q/V. If the charge is kept constant and the capacity 2a is decreased, the voltage increases. This can be understood as amplification of the voltage V. The change of the capacitance 2a can be obtained by using a voltage dependent capacitor 2b. Parametric amplifiers are low noise amplifiers and their power amplification is limited to about 20 dB, which is directly related to a ratio of a frequency of the further signal S2 and the informative signal S1 and the power of the further signal S2. Additionally, the arrangement 10 may comprise a bias setting device 3. The further signal S2 is preferably selected in the order of about ten times of the frequency of the informative signal S 1. Preferably, the portions of the capacitively coupled transmission line 5a, 5b are selected to be short compared with the wavelength.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Preferably, the arrangement 10 according to the invention is accommodated in a magnetic resonance compatible device, notably a catheter 7 used for MR-tracking, MR-measuring, or for conducting a therapeutic handling under MR supervision. Thus, the first electrical site 7a is located in the distal portion of the catheter (the tip), whereas the second electrical site is located at the proximal portion of the catheter 7b, which are separated by an imaginative line 9. In order to generate the informative signal S1 representative of a suitable MR measurement, the catheter 7 comprises a resonant circuit 1, comprising a receive coil and a resonance capacitor 2a. The varactor diode 2b, connected in parallel to the resonance capacitor 2a serves for necessary amplification of the informative signal S1. The bias point of the diode 2b can be adjusted with short RF pulses rectified by a suitable additional diode or the varactor diode itself and smoothed by an optional capacitor. This option advantageously enables a suitable tuning of the resonant frequency of the receive coil.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> presents a schematic view of an arrangement with an amplifier fed by the further RF signal. The arrangement 20 comprises a conventional linear amplifier 22. The informative alternating signal S1 is generated by the signal generator 21, and is amplified by the linear amplifier 22. The linear amplifier 22 is fed by the further signal S2, which is provided by a high frequency generator 28, located at or beyond the second electrical site. The further signal is fed by the capacitively coupled transmission line 25 via the rectifier 23 to the linear amplifier 22. The duplexers 24 and 26 are used to separate or to join the different RF signals as required. Optionally an accessory device 29 is used in the arrangement 10 for carrying out a suitable data analysis.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> presents a schematic view of an arrangement with a mixer fed by the further RF signal.

The amplifier of the arrangement 30 comprises a device, for example a transistor array, that can be directly driven by the RF signal of the magnitude of usual supply voltage/currents levels of the high frequency signal generator 38. The gain of such amplification device 32 is a function of the momentary drive level. The result of the amplification will also comprise a mixing of frequency or frequency translation function providing sum or difference frequencies between the informative signal S 1 and the further signal S2. The diplexers 33 and 36 are preferably designed to split or to combine different signal components in the required way. The amplified mixed or translated informative signal S 1 is preferably supplied to the spectrometer 39 for data analysis.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> presents a schematic view of a first embodiment of the magnetic resonance compatible device according to the invention.

The informative signal is amplified by suitable amplification means (not shown) in accordance with the principles described in the foregoing. The amplified signal is transmitted to the second electrical site 42b, where it is being analyzed by suitable per se known data analysis means 41.
