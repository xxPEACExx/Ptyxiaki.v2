for striking a staple formed in a C-shape to sheets (sheets of paper to be bound), and a movable clincher engaged with a staple leg penetrated to a back face side of the sheets for folding to bend a staple leg along the back face of the sheets.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Background Art:</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">According to an electric stapler for striking a staple to sheets to bundle to bind a plurality of the sheets by the staple, the staple in a C-shape including a pair of leg portions is struck to the sheets by a strike mechanism, and the pair of staple legs penetrated to a back face side of the sheets are folded to bend along the back face of the sheets by a clincher mechanism. According to a certain kind of an electric stapler, a clincher mechanism is constituted by a pair of movable cl inchers provided pivotably to be opposed to respective stapler legs penetrated to a back face side of sheets. The staple is bound by finishing to penetrate almost all portions of the staple<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> legs of the staple struck out from the strike mechanism portion and thereafter operating to pivot the movable clincher to be engaged with the staple legs to thereby bend the staple legs.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The pair of movable clinchers are provided to be respectively axially supported pivotably between two clincher guide plates aligned in a front and rear direction to be opposed to a position of striking out the staple. A clinch face to be engaged with the staple leg is arranged in correspondence with a position of the staple leg penetrated to the back face side of the sheets. By operating to pivot the movable clincher around the fulcrum shaft, the clinch face is engaged with the staple leg to bend the staple leg along the back face of the sheet. In order to operate to pivot the movable clincher, there is provided a drive link a center portion of which is pivotably supported by a frame, and the movable clincher is pivoted by operating to pivot a front end portion of the drive link in an up and down direction by engaging a rear portion of the drive link with a drive cam driven to rotate by an electric motor for driving the stapler and engaging a front end portion of the drive link with a portion of the movable clincher.</p><heading id="h0003">(Refer to, for example, JP-A-10-128683)</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">The movable clincher is operated to pivot by the drive link in a range of an operating stroke thereof, and is operated to pivot to press to form the staple leg to be brought into close contact with the sheets along the back face of the sheets<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> by engaging the clinch face of the movable clincher with the staple leg. According to a mechanism for operating the movable clincher of the kind, the movable clincher is operated to pivot by the drive link swung by the drive cam, and an amount of the operating stroke of the drive link and an amount of the operating stroke of the movable clincher are made to coincide with each other. Therefore, when the amount of the pivoting stroke of the front end portion of the drive link is varied or the range of the operating stroke is shifted by accumulating dimensional tolerances of parts of the drive link, the drive cam and the like, the operating stroke of the clincher operated by the drive link is varied, and a clinch load on the staple leg by the movable clincher is varied.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">When the clinch load of the movable clincher operated by the drive link is varied by varying the amount of operating the drive link, an amount of pressing the staple leg by the clinch face becomes excessively small and clinching is carried out in a state of floating the staple leg from the back face of the sheets, or the amount of pressing the staple leg by the clinch face becomes excessively large and the needle is detached from the clincher, or in a case of thin sheet, the sheets are broken. Further, when the movable clincher is excessively protruded, there is a case in which the sheets cannot be moved in carrying the sheets by jamming the sheets to the movable clincher and therefore, according to a staple<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> of a certain other kind, a portion of the movable clincher is brought into contact with the frame, and a final operating portion of the clincher is restricted. However, according to such a mechanism, a large load is produced at the motor or the like by varying an amount of operating a drive link by tolerances of parts or the like.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6719181B2"><text>US-B2-6 719 181</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO03015993A"><text>WO 03/015993 A</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP0995561A"><text>EP-A-0 995 561</text></patcit> disclose a stapler according to the preamble of claim 1.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>Disclosure of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">While the invention is defined in the independent claim 1, further aspects of the invention are set forth in the dependent claims, the drawings and the following description.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">One or more embodiments of the invention provide a stapler including a mechanism of operating a movable clincher for maintaining a clinching shape of a staple leg by the movable clincher in a stable state by maintaining a clinch load of the movable clincher by a pertinent load.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention, there is provided a stapler in which a mechanism of driving a movable clincher of the stapler is constituted by including a strike mechanism portion for striking out a staple formed in a C-shape to a sheet, a pair of movable clinchers including clinch faces capable of being engaged with staple legs of the staple struck out from the strike mechanism portion to be penetrated through the sheet, and a drive link operated by a drive mechanism of driving the stapler by operating the movable clinchers, the staple legs are folded to bend along a face of the sheet by the movable clinchers driven by way of the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> drive link, characterized in that there is provided an operating frame a rear end side of which is pivotably held by a clincher frame for supporting the movable clinchers and the drive link by way of a fulcrum shaft, the movable clinchers are operated by pivoting the operating frame centering on the fulcrum shaft by engaging an operating plate formed on a front end side of the operating frame with the movable clinchers, the movable clinchers are operated by way of the operating frame pivoted by operating the drive link by engaging the drive link with the operating frame, further, the fulcrum shaft of the operating frame is pivotably supported by the clincher frame, and the fulcrum shaft is arranged at an end portion of a pivoting range by a load urged by a spring compatible with a clinch load.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention, the clincher frame is provided with the operating frame the rear end side of which is pivotably held by the clincher frame by way of the fulcrum shaft, the movable clincher is operated by pivoting the operating frame centering on the fulcrum shaft by engaging the operating plate formed at the front end side of the operating frame with the movable clincher, the movable clincher is operated by way of the operating frame pivoted by operating the drive link by engaging the drive link with the operating frame, further, the fulcrum shaft of the operating frame is pivotably supported by the clincher frame, the fulcrum shaft is arranged at the end portion in the pivoting range<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> by the load urged by the spring compatible with the clinch load and therefore, when operated to exert the predetermined clinch load to the staple leg by the movable clincher in the state of bending the staple leg by engaging the clincher face of the movable clincher operated by way of the operating frame with the staple leg, the side of the operating frame is pivoted by an urge force by the fulcrum spring, thereby, the clinch load equal to or larger than the predetermined load is prevented from being operated to the movable clincher by way of the drive link.

Further, a front end portion of the operating frame 10 is formed with the operating plate 19 arranged at inside of the opening 18, and the operating plate 19 is engaged<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> with a portion of the movable clincher 9 at inside of the opening 18 of the guide plate 11.

Further, the drive shaft 17 of the drive link 15 is set to be engaged with the upper end edge of the side wall 10a between the fulcrum shaft 12 and the operating plate 19. An operating load in the lower direction transmitted to the operating frame 10 by way of the drive shaft 17 by operating the drive link 15 is operated to the operating plate 19 and the fulcrum shaft 12 by being divided to a load for operating the movable clincher 9 by way of the operating plate 19 and a load of pressing the fulcrum shaft 12 to the lower side by a lever ratio.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">A side of the fulcrum shaft 12 is urged by a spring in the upper direction by the fulcrum spring 14, a spring load of the fulcrum spring 14 is set such that the fulcrum shaft 12 of the operating frame 10 is operated in the lower direction against the urge force of the fulcrum spring 14 when the movable clincher 9 operated by the operating plate 19 is exerted with a predetermined clinch load. Therefore, until the clinch load of the movable clincher 9 becomes a predetermined magnitude, the movable clincher 9 operates the operating plate 19 in the lower direction by pivoting the operating frame 10 centering on the fulcrum shaft 12 by a press force in the lower direction of the drive shaft 17. When the load of operating the movable clincher 9 is increased to exceed the predetermined clinch load, by operating the fulcrum shaft 12 of the operating frame 10 in the lower direction against the spring force of the fulcrum spring 14, the load of operating the movable clincher 9 by the drive shaft 17 is escaped.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">An explanation will be given of a state of operating the movable clincher driving mechanism according to the embodiment as follows. Before operating the clincher mechanism portion 7, since the drive link 15 is not operated, also the drive shaft 17 is not operated and therefore, as shown by <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig.7</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig.8</figref>, the fulcrum shaft 12 penetrating the rear end portion of the operating frame 10 is arranged at an upper end position<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> of the elongated hole 13 by the urge force of the fulcrum spring 14. Further, the operating frame 10 is arranged at a position pivoted in the clockwise direction centering on the fulcrum shaft 12 by an operating mechanism, not illustrated, thereby, the operating plate 19 formed integrally with the front end of the operating frame 10 is arranged on an upper side of inside of the opening 18 of the guide plate 11, and the operating plate 19 and the movable clincher 9 are not engaged. Therefore, the respective clinch faces 9a of the pair of movable clinchers 9 are pivoted to positions arranged in a state of being remote from each other.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">After striking the staple legs to be penetrated through the sheet to the respective clinch faces 9a of the pair of movable clinchers 9 arranged at the positions remote from each other as mentioned above, when the drive shaft 17 is operated by way of the drive link 15, the drive shaft 17 driven in the lower direction as indicated by an arrow mark A in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig.9</figref> is engaged with the upper end edge of the side wall 10a of the operating frame 10 to pivot the operating frame 10 in a direction of an arrow mark B centering on the fulcrum shaft 12. Thereby, the operating plate 19 formed at the front end of the operating frame 10 is operated from the upper side to the lower side at inside of the opening 18 of the guide plate 11, the pair of movable clinchers 9 are engaged with the operating plate 19 operated at inside of the opening 18 to operate to pivot<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> the movable clinchers 9, and the clinch faces 9a formed at movable clinchers 9 are engaged with the staple legs to bend the staple legs along the upper face of the sheet to thereby bind the staple.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In clinching the staple by the movable clinchers 9, a clinched shape of the staple legs can be constituted by a staple shape by bending the staple legs along the upper face of the sheet by engaging the clinch faces 9a of the movable clinchers 9 with the staple legs penetrated through the sheet and pressing the staple legs to the face of the sheet by the clinch faces 9a by a predetermined clinch load. By setting the spring load of the fulcrum spring 14 for urging the fulcrum shaft 12 of the operating frame 10 for operating the movable clinchers 9 in the upper direction to a load compatible with the clinch load, as shown by <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 11</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 12</figref>, when the movable clincher 9 is operated to the predetermined clinch load by the operating plate 19 formed at the front end of the operating frame 10, by further operating the drive shaft 17 in the arrow mark A direction, the side of the fulcrum shaft 12 of the operating frame 10 is pivoted in a direction of an arrow mark C against the spring load of the fulcrum spring 14, and a load exceeding the predetermined clinch load operated to the movable clinchers 9 by way of the drive link 15 is prevented from being operated.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">According to the movable clincher drive mechanism of the<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> embodiment, the fulcrum shaft 12 for pivotably supporting the operating frame 10 for operating the movable clinchers 9 is constituted by being urged by the fulcrum springs 14 of the load compatible with the clinch load of the movable clinchers, the movable clinchers 9 are operated by the drive link 15 by way of the operating frame 10 and therefore, even when the operating stroke of the drive link 15 is increased by variations in tolerances of parts or the like, after operating the clinch load of the movable clinchers 9 operated by way of the drive link 15 to the predetermined load, by moving the fulcrum shaft 12 of the operating frame 10 operated by the drive link 15 against the urge force of the fulcrum springs 14, extra load transmitted to the side of the movable clinchers 9 by way of the drive link 15 is absorbed by the fulcrum springs 14 and therefore, the staple legs are not pressed more than necessary by the clinch faces 9a by the variations in the tolerances of parts or the like, the staple legs are not clinched in a state of being floated from the face of the sheet by making a press amount insufficient.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Further, as shown by <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig.8</figref>, a projected portion 20 is formed at the guide frame 11 and the operating plate 19 for operating the movable clincher 9 is constituted to be brought into contact with the projected portion 20, even when it is prevented that the clinch face 9a of the movable clincher 9 is excessively extruded from the face of the table 6 and the<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> sheet is caught by the movable clincher 9 when the sheet is carried, the side of the fulcrum shaft of the operating frame 10 can be pivoted even when the operating plate 19 is engaged with the projected portion 20 to hamper from being operated in the lower direction and therefore, thereby, it can be prevented that the electric motor is locked or brought into an overload state by hampering the drive link 15 from being pivoted.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Further, although an explanation has been given by the operating frame 10, even when a shape thereof is not necessarily constituted by the frame shape but by a C-shape which is not coupled with the side of the fulcrum shaft 12, there may be constructed a constitution in correspondence with a portion of receiving the drive shaft 17 and a portion of the operating plate 19 for pressing the movable clincher 9 and the elongated hole 13 arranged with the fulcrum shaft 12.<br/>
