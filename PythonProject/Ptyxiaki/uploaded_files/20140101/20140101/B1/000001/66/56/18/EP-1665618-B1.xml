mxw-id="PDES63957450" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to a network of devices which communicate with each other via radio frequency.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A network of devices can be created by arranging a group of devices which can communicate with each other via radio frequency (RF) means to transmit data between the devices. Provided that each of the devices is within the range of the maximum communications range of each device, each device can effectively communicate with each other device in the network.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In many such networks, the devices may all be transceivers, ie are each capable of both transmitting and receiving. For the purpose of transferring an item of data, one device acts predominantly as a transmitter while other devices act predominantly as receivers.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The present invention is to be used in a "point to multipoint" system as opposed to a "point to point" system in which communications occur between only two devices at a time. In a point to multipoint communication system, communications occur between one device and two or more of the other devices in the network simultaneously.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A reliable "point to multipoint" communication system allows the creation of a shared network variable. This is a variable which is known to all of the devices in the network. For example, if one device wants to change the value of the shared network variable, it must transmit a request and be guaranteed that all devices receive and process the updated variable simultaneously. If the update cannot be<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> made simultaneously, or not all other devices in the network receive the update, then the network does not have a shared network variable.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Shared network variables allow the creation of a network which has no central controller. All of the essential data about the operation and control of the network is known by each device in the network simultaneously. The data can be updated by any device in the network at any time and all other devices are guaranteed to update their data accordingly. This allows the control of devices within the network to be simplified, more flexible, and less costly when compared with networks having a central controller.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A single communication action between each of the devices is herein referred to as a Transaction. A Transaction occurs between a device (transceiver/transmitter) which transmits data to one or more transceiver/receivers of the data. The Transaction also includes data sent from the transceiver/receivers to the transceiver/transmitter as well as to each other of the transceiver/receiver devices in the network. In this context, a device which for a given Transaction, transmits the data to be shared throughout the network is referred to as a "transceiver/transmitter" while a device which receives that data within the Transaction, is returned to as a transceiver/receiver. It will be understood that within the same Transaction, a given transceiver/receiver may also transmit an acknowledge signal. In the next Transaction, the transceiver/receiver may become the transceiver/transmitter. When transmitting to more than one transceiver/receiver simultaneously (also known as a broadcast or multicast), it is important to know that all transceiver/receivers have successfully received the data. If even one transceiver/receiver has not successfully received the data (for example because of a bit error causing data corruption in one transceiver/receiver), then all other transceiver/receivers must be informed that not all of the other transceiver/receivers have successfully received the data.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Such networks can also optionally use a transmission system with dominant and inferior bits. This means that if there is a conflict, and two devices simultaneously transmit a dominant and inferior bit, then when monitoring the communication medium, each device will see the transmission of the dominant bit. The device transmitting the inferior bit knows that there has been a conflict and can take whatever action is appropriate. For example, this may mean the cessation of all further transmissions.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In conventional point to point communication protocols, a general procedure is to have each device transmit an acknowledge statement some time after receipt of the data. This has the drawback that the transmitting device must know exactly the number of receiving devices within the network, and how to contact each of them. The reliable transfer of the same piece of data to multiple receiving devices requires many transmissions of the same data, and a corresponding wait for each transmission to be acknowledged. The repetitive transmission of the same data to many recipients wastes the available bandwidth of the communication medium. This approach also requires the transmitter to obtain and store data about exactly which receiving devices are to accept a given transmission. This approach allows the creation of a shared network variable, at the expense of unnecessary complexity and poor use of the available bandwidth of the communication medium.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Alternatively a point to multipoint transmission can be used to transfer data to many recipients simultaneously, without any acknowledgment being returned. This renders the data transfer unreliable, and the transmitter will not be able to determine whether all of the receiving devices have successfully received the data. Unreliable transfer of data means that a shared network variable cannot be created.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In such systems it is also necessary to be able to accurately determine a time or point in a data transmission where the type of data changes (for example a change from a control data transmission timeslot to an acknowledge timeslot).<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Many well-known communication protocols are asynchronous and character based. The best example is the widely used serial RS/EIA-232 port.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Such protocols can be used, with difficulty, to transmit varying and fixed time portions. However, it is important that the asynchronous interface component (referred to as a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter, or UART) have well characterised timing and delay characteristics, and that those characteristics remain invariant. For example, any variation (for whatever reason) to the inter-character gap time would be catastrophic, because it would mean that different devices would fix different times for the same critical point. There would not be a common time reference for the start of the fixed time slots.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Character based protocols should be able to carry any information item that fits into the designated character size. This conflicts with the need to have some means of signalling important points in the transmission, especially the end of the variable portion. This conflict arises because in the character based protocol, some of the characters need to take on a special meaning in order to signal the important point. This means that the special character cannot be used for data. The combined disadvantages of the asynchronous character-based protocol make it very difficult to use when a fixed time relationship is to be maintained between a variable and fixed time portion.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">An alternative is to consider the protocol as a stream of bits, organised into characters by grouping (in other words, overlaying the character structure back over the bit stream). Each character can be inspected to see if it is significant or not. When a data item is to be transmitted which looks the same as a significant character, extra bits can be inserted to change it. The receiving device recognises the patterns of extra bits, and removes them, restoring the original character. By performing the recognition of the special characters at the correct point in the decoding path, both data and special characters can be separated. This is known as a bit-stuffing, and is<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> widely used in protocols like HDLC. Bit-stuffing however, can be complicated and processing intensive.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO0178426A"><text>WO 01/78426</text></patcit> (Proxim Inc) is directed at improved asymmetric data traffic throughput in CSMA/CA networks. It is directed to increasing throughput in wireless LANs where the interaction between the lower layer Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol and the upper layer (TCP) protocol has a serious impact on the data rate especially in the peak scenario". In such a system a first device sends a TCP packet to a second device that then sends back an acknowledgement (ACK) to the first device. However whilst the TCP ACK message is small, the overhead associated with contending for the medium and then wrapping the TCP ACK message through the MAC layer is large. The proposed solution is to append the TCP ACK to the lower level MAC acknowledgement message, so that the second device sends a MAC ACK and a TCP ACK to the first device in the same transmission. Use of this system can substantially increase throughput, since messages can be more rapidly acknowledged, and TCP ACK messages are removed from the contention process enabling the use of smaller contention windows. However Proxim Inc directed solely to positively acknowledging communication between two devices (and more specifically to increasing the time taken for this process); and does not generalise to point to multipoint systems nor does it consider the problem of keeping all devices in the network informed of the state of the network.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5050175A"><text>US 5050175 (Tuch et al</text></patcit>) is directed to a wireless information transmission system in which a plurality of stations transmit and receive message packets via a distribution system which is used to retransmit messages send by a single station to all other stations in the network. Tuch is directed at the problem message capture in such a system which may occur if two stations transmit at the same time. In such a case the weaker signal is masked, or captured by the stronger signal and so is not received by the distribution system. To address this Tuch teaches the use of a system in which<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> frames have three fixed time slots. The first time slot is for use <i>solely</i> by the distribution system for either transmitting synchronisation packets (heartbeat packets), retransmitting a packet sent by a station in the previous frame to all stations in the network, or a collision acknowledge packet (CAKT) in the case that a collision was detected by a station. The second time slot is for use by stations in the network for transmitting data. The third time slot is for use by stations in the network for transmitting a collision reporting code (CDT) if the station detected a collision by comparing the transmission made in the <i>second time slot of the previous frame,</i> with the retransmitted packeted in <i>the first time slot of the current frame.</i> Upon the distribution system receiving a CDT the distribution system transmits a collision acknowledge in the first time slot of the next frame (ie in the second frame <i>after</i> the frame in which the collision occurred). There is thus a considerable lag between a collision occurring, and all stations being notified of a collision occurring. Further this system relies on the distribution system always transmitting a message (heartbeat, data, or CAKT) in the first time slot of the each frame.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">It is an object of the present invention to provide a system and protocol for improving the communications between devices in an RF point to multipoint communications system.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for use in a wireless network of transceiver devices, the method including:

Nodes 1, 2 and 3 are transceiving devices and may act as transmitters and/or receivers in a given communication Transaction. The network 10 may communicate with other networks 20, via gateway 11.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The protocol design of the present invention is based on the ISO seven layer model and some terminology is common with that used by ISO. The protocol used in the present invention is connectionless, meaning that once a single data transfer has<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> taken place, there is no expectation of additional related data transfers either before or after.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The protocol model of the preferred embodiment is based on the ISO seven layer model and is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>. For applications distributed over two nodes, each protocol layer has a virtual connection to the equivalent layer in the other node. As can be seen, each layer takes data provided by the layer above, treats it as a data unit and adds its own protocol control information (PCI) field. At each layer, the protocol data unit (PDU) is either the data, or a package provided by the next higher layer. The name of the PDU is prefixed by the layer to which it applies (For example, SPDU is a session PDU).</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The physical layer relates to the mechanical and electrical network interface in the ISO system. In the system of the present invention, the physical layer refers to the hardware and firmware elements used to transmit and receive bits over the communication medium.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In the ISO system, the link layer is used for data link control (for example, framing, data transparency, error control). In the present invention, the link layer is used to break bytes up into bits, bit stuffing (if required), framing, collision detection, prioritisation, error detection, positive/negative acknowledge generation, checking and retransmission.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The network layer in the ISO system is used for networking routing, addressing, call set-up and clearing while in the present invention, the network layer is used for network routing, addressing, Transaction set-up and clear.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In the ISO system, the transport layer is used for end to end message transfer, connection management, error control, fragmentation and flow control.

If two devices simultaneously transmit a dominant and an inferior bit, then receivers and transmitters (monitoring their own transmissions)will detect only the dominant bit.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Media access is obtained by a transmitter first monitoring the media, and if no existing transmission is detected, the transmitter will try to claim media access by transmitting a preamble stream. This preamble starts with at least one detectable bit. The claim for media access defines the start of a Transaction. A Transaction consists of all data transfer, acknowledgement and repeating of data. All nodes in a network<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> must monitor the media continually and if they detect a Transaction occurring they will defer any attempt to claim media access until the completion of the current Transaction.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Transactions are asynchronous, that is, they can occur at any time and the time difference from the start of one Transaction to the next does not have to be an integral number of bit periods.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In this application, a Transaction is specifically defined as a continuous period of time broken up into several sub-time slots containing different types of data. A Transaction will begin with a preamble for a set period of time, followed by the specific data which is to be transmitted from a transceiver/transmitter (transmitting transceiver device) to two or more transceiver/receivers (receiving transceiver devices). The timeslot during which the data is transmitted is variable in length, and includes a portion used as a frame check sequence. Following the data transmission is a repeat timeslot tag (details of which will not be described as they are not relevant to the present invention) followed by a timeslot during which positive acknowledgement can be transmitted by the transceiver/receivers, followed by a timeslot during which negative acknowledgement is transmitted by the transceiver/receivers. The structure of this frame is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">As described above, a Transaction is asynchronous and can start at any time. However, once started, the Transaction has a time-based structure. Special markers in the Transaction are used to show the beginning and end of the data portion. This will be discussed in more detail later. The time slots during which positive and negative acknowledgement are transmitted, are fixed in time. By coding and redundancy of data encoded into these timeslots, a positive acknowledgement by one or more transceiver/receivers and a negative acknowledgement by one or more transceiver/receivers can be conveyed. All of the devices involved in the Transaction see both of the acknowledgment timeslots.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Once data transmitted by the transceiver /transmitter (for example node 1 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>) is received successfully by the transceiver/receivers (nodes 2 and 3), nodes 2 and 3 will acknowledge successful receipt.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">If data from a Transaction is received with error by a transceiver/receiver, then that transceiver/receiver will transmit a negative acknowledge.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Transceiver/receivers wishing to positively acknowledge, will transmit a special code during the positive acknowledge timeslot and during the negative acknowledge timeslot will either receive (if dominant bit transmission is not used) or transmit inferior bits (if dominant / inferior bits are used).</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Similarly, transceiver/receivers wishing to negatively acknowledge will either transmit inferior bits (if dominant / inferior bits are used) or receive (if dominant bit transmission is not used) during the positive acknowledge timeslot and transmit a special code during the negative acknowledge timeslot.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The fact that the devices monitor the timeslots during which they are not transmitting, ensures that by the end of two timeslots each device has detected either positive acknowledges, negative acknowledges or both and can therefore determine the overall acknowledge state of the network.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">For example, the transceiver/receiver which transmits a positive acknowledge will be able to detect some other transceiver/receiver which transmits a negative acknowledge. For the case where dominant bits are used, this is because the transceiver/receiver positive acknowledging will attempt to transmit inferior bits during the negative acknowledge timeslot but will detect dominant bits due to the other transceiver/receiver which is simultaneously transmitting an appropriate code during the negative acknowledge timeslot. For the case where dominant bits are not used, the transceiver/receiver positive acknowledging will receive during the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> negative acknowledge timeslot and detect any bits due to the other transceiver /receiver which is transmitting an appropriate code during the negative acknowledge timeslot. The reverse case applies for the transceiver/receiver transmitting a negative acknowledge.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">At the end of the Transaction, all devices do not know how many positive or negative acknowledges there were, all they have to know is that there were some positive and some negative.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">If there were any negative acknowledges at all during the Transaction, then all of the transceiver/receivers know this, and can discard the data received. Similarly, the transceiver/transmitter knows this and can attempt to re-run the Transaction.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The generation of a positive acknowledge will be as follows. Upon receiving data, a node will generate a positive acknowledge only when:
<ul><li>the data timeslot has been checked against its embedded frame check sequence and found to be valid; and</li><li>any addressing information present in the data timeslot matches an addressing information used by the device.</li></ul></p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Each device transceiver generally contains at least two different types of address, as follows:
<ul><li>A Unit Address, allowing the device to be uniquely addressed in isolation; and</li><li>A Multicast address, allowing those devices in a network to be addressed simultaneously for the purpose of updating shared network variables.</li></ul></p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In addition, devices can also optionally contain:
<ul><li>A Network Address, allowing physical devices to be grouped by the logical network to which they are allocated.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Other variations are possible, but these three address types are used as the basis for other more sophisticated addressing schemes.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Use of the positive acknowledge is useful as it provides an additional certainty to the functioning of the network. If for example, the transceiver/transmitter does not receive a positive acknowledge, from any device, and then does not receive a negative acknowledge from any device, there is no certainty that any device received the transmission.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">It will be appreciated however, that the positive acknowledge is not essential to the broadest aspect of the present invention. Furthermore, the positive acknowledge could appear after the negative acknowledge.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">The processes involved in generation of a negative acknowledge are as follows. A receiving device (transceiver/receiver) will generate a negative acknowledge only if the data timeslot is determined to be corrupted, by checking the received data using the embedded frame check sequence.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Where a device determines data timeslot corruption, there is no point further examining any fields inside the data timeslot.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Acceptance of the data transmitted by the transceiver/transmitter is only made by the transceiver/receivers if the condition for generation of a positive acknowledge are met and if no other transceiver/receiver has generated a negative acknowledge. This ensures that all transceiver/receivers receive a given message only once. For point-multipoint messages, this may mean that a message is discarded by a transceiver/receiver, even if it appears valid and was positively acknowledged.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In practice, it is beneficial to construct all devices in the network in the same way. This means that each device (generally referred to as a "transceiver"), whether it acts<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> as a transceiver/transmitter or transceiver/receiver, will be constructed in the same way and can be separately enabled to perform the desired function. This provides significant savings in the complexity and cost of manufacture since only one type of device need be designed and manufactured.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">The preferred implementation of the transceiver device 100 uses a radio receiver, a radio transmitter, and a microprocessor. These first two items can optionally be combined as a transmitter/receiver 120, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref>, which shows device 100 including microprocessor 110 and transmitter/receiver 120. Transmitter/receiver 120 transmits and receives data via antenna 130.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">It will be appreciated that use of a microprocessor is not mandatory. For example the protocol could be implemented in a dedicated integrated circuit, a programmable logic device or a programmable gate array.

Each country has regulations that determine factors including allowable frequencies, transmit power levels and bandwidth.<br/>
Transmitter/receivers suitable for use in some countries may be illegal in other countries.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> -->For products with a broad sales appeal in a range of countries, it is possible that several different transmitter/receivers will need to be selected, appropriate to each country.</li><li>b.

In the communication protocol of the present invention, the time to switch between receive and transmit is important, because the protocol includes a set of fixed time slots. Depending on the overall transaction being performed, a time slot may need to be received or transmitted.<br/>
The time to switching between receive and transmit constitutes an overhead (dead time). Large switching times have the effect of wasting bandwidth.</li><li>d. Interface type.<br/>
