Included in NCHRP Report 350 are recommendations for run-down deceleration rates for vehicles to be used in designing crash attenuators that meet NCHRP Report 350's test levels 2, 3 and 4.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">To meet the criteria specified in NCHRP Report 350, most crash attenuators that are deployed today along roadways to redirect or stop vehicles that have left the roadway use various structural arrangements in which the barrier compresses and/or collapses in response to the vehicle impacting the barrier. Some of these crash attenuators also include supplemental braking systems that produce a constant retarding force to slow down crashing vehicles, despite variations in the mass and/or velocity of the vehicle impacting the barrier.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The guidelines in NCHRP Report 350 for crash testing require a maximum vehicle occupant impact speed which is the speed of the occupant striking the interior surface of the vehicle, of 12 meters/second, with a preferred speed of 9 meters/second. Typically, constant braking force crash attenuators will stop a smaller mass vehicle in a distance of around 2.4 meter (8 feet). This is because most constant braking force crash attenuators need to exert an increased braking force that will allow larger mass vehicles, such as pickup trucks, to be stopped in a distance of around 5.2 meter (17 feet).<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4844213A"><text>US4844213</text></patcit> discloses an energy absorption system using progressive collapses through plastic deformation of compression members. One drawback with the embodiments as disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US4844213A"><text>US4844213</text></patcit> is that the energy absorption system acts with the same force no matter which force that impacts the energy absorption system.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention is an improved crash attenuator according to clalim 1 that uses a cable and cylinder braking arrangement to control the rate at which a vehicle impacting the crash attenuator is decelerated to a safe stop. In particular, the crash attenuator of the present invention uses a cable and cylinder arrangement that exerts a resistive force that varies over distance to control a crashing vehicle's run-down deceleration and occupant impact speed in accordance with the requirements of NCHRP Report 350. Thus, the crash attenuator of the present invention provides a ride-down travel distance for smaller mass vehicles in which such vehicles, during a high speed impact, are able to travel 3 meter (10 feet) or more before completely stopping.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The crash attenuator of the present invention also includes an elongated guardrail-like structure comprised of a front impact section and a plurality of trailing mobile sections with overlapping side panel sections that telescope down as the crash attenuator is compressed in response to being struck by a vehicle. The front impact section is rotatably mounted on at least one guiderail attached to the ground, while the mobile sections are slidably mounted on the at least one guiderail. It should be noted, however, that two or more guiderails are preferably used with the crash attenuator of the present invention.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Positioned preferably between two guiderails on the ground is the cable and cylinder arrangement. The cable and cylinder arrangement includes preferably a steel wire rope cable that is attached to a sled that is part of the attenuator's front impact section by means of an open spelter socket attached to the sled. From the open spelter socket, the cable is pulled through an open backed tube that is affixed to the front base of the crash attenuator. At the rear of the attenuator is a shock-arresting hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder with a first stack of static sheaves positioned near the back end of the cylinder and a second stack of static sheaves on the end of the cylinder's protruding piston rod. All of the sheaves are pinned and rotationally stationary during<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> impact of the crash attenuator by a vehicle. The cable is looped several times around the static sheaves located at the rear of the cylinder and at the end of the cylinder's piston rod. Thereafter, the cable is terminated to a threaded adjustable eyebolt that is attached to a plate welded to the side of one of the base rails.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">When a crashing vehicle impacts the front section of the crash attenuator, the front section is caused to translate backwards on the guiderails towards the multiple mobile sections located behind the front section. As the front section translates backwards, the rear-most portion of a sled acting as its support frame comes into contact with the support frame supporting the panels of the mobile section just behind the front section. This mobile section's support frame, in turn, comes into contact with the support frame supporting the panels of the next mobile section, and so on.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As the sled and support frames translate backwards, the cable attached to the sled is caused to frictionally slide around the sheaves and compress or extend the cylinder's piston rod into or out of the cylinder. The sheaves located at the end of the piston rod are also attached to a movable plate so that the sheaves move longitudinally as the cylinder's piston rod is compressed into or extended out of the cylinder by the cable as it slides around the sheaves in response to the front section of the crash attenuator being impacted by a vehicle. This results in a restraining force being exerted on the sled to control its backward movement. The restraining force exerted by the cable on the sled is controlled by the cylinder, which is metered using internal orifices to give a vehicle impacting the attenuator a controlled ride-down based on the vehicle's kinetic energy. Initially, a minimum restraining force is applied to the front section to decelerate the crashing vehicle until the point of occupant impact with the interior surface of the vehicle, after which an increased resistance, but steady deceleration force, is maintained. Thus, the present invention uses a cable and cylinder arrangement with a varying restraining force to control the rate at which a crashing vehicle is decelerated to safely stop the vehicle. Accelerating the mass of the frames during collision also contributes to the stopping force. Therefore, the total<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> stopping force is a combination of friction, the resistance exerted by the shock arresting cylinder and the acceleration of structural masses in response to the velocity of the colliding vehicle upon impact and crush factors in the body and frame of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The crash attenuator of the present invention also includes a variety of transition arrangements to provide a smooth continuation from the crash attenuator to a fixed barrier of varying shape and design. The structure of the transition unit varies according to the type of fixed barrier that the crash attenuator is connected to.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The cable and cylinder arrangement used in the crash attenuator of the present invention can be used with or in other structural arrangements that are designed to bear impacts by vehicles and other moving objects. The alternative embodiments of the cable and cylinder arrangement with such alternative structural arrangements would include the cable, the cylinder and sheaves used in the cable and cylinder arrangement of the crash attenuator of the present invention.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></b></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a side elevational view of the crash attenuator of the present invention in its fully-extended position.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is a plan view of the crash attenuator of the present invention in its fully-extended position.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3a</figref> is an enlarged partial side elevational view of the front section of the crash attenuator of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 3b</figref> is an enlarged partial plan view of the front section of the crash attenuator of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 4a</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional, front elevational view, taken along line 4a-4a of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, of the mobile sheaves used with the crash attenuator of the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 4b</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional front elevational view, taken along line 4b-4b of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, of the stationary sheaves used with the crash attenuator of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 5</figref> is a cross-sectional side elevational view of the crash attenuator shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 6a</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional side elevational view of the front section of the crash attenuator shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 5</figref>.

When front section 12 begins to move backwards after being struck by a vehicle, cable 41 in combination with cylinder 44 exerts a force that resists the movement of section 12 and sled 18 backwards. The resistive force exerted by cable 41 is controlled by shock-arresting cylinder 44. Cylinder 44 is metered with internal orifices (not shown) running longitudinally within cylinder 44. The orifices in cylinder 44 allow a hydraulic or pneumatic fluid from a first, inner compartment (also not shown) within piston 44 escape to a second, outer jacket compartment (also not shown) of cylinder 44. The orifices control the amount of fluid that can move from the inner compartment to the outer compartment at any given time. As piston rod 47 moves past various orifices within cylinder 44, those orifices become unavailable for fluid movement, resulting in an energy-dependent resistance to a compressing force being exerted on piston rod 47 of cylinder 44 by cable 41 as it is pulled around the pair of multiple sheaves 45 and 46 in response to being pulled backwards by sled 18 of front section 12. The size and spacing of the orifices within cylinder 44 are preferably designed to steadily decrease the amount of fluid that can move from the inner compartment to the outer compartment of cylinder 44 at any given time in coordination with the decrease in velocity of impacting vehicle 50 over a predefined distance so that vehicle 50 experiences a substantially constant rate of deceleration to thereby provide a steady ride-down in velocity for vehicle 50. Also, this arrangement increases or decreases resistance, depending on whether the impacting vehicle has a higher or lower velocity, respectively, than cylinder 44 is designed to readily handle, allowing extended ridedown distances for both slower velocity vehicles (due to decreased resistance) and higher velocity vehicles (due to increased resistance).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Cylinder 44's control of the resisting force exerted on sled 18 by cable 41 results in attenuator 10 providing a controlled ride-down of any vehicle 50 impacting attenuator 10 that is based on the kinetic energy of vehicle 50 as it impacts attenuator 10.

As vehicle 50 slows down, less fluid needs to pass from the inner compartment to the outer compartment of cylinder 44 to maintain a steady reduction in the velocity of vehicle 50. The result is a steady deceleration of vehicle 50 with a substantially constant g-force being exerted on the occupants of vehicle 50 as it slows down.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">It should be noted that the fluid compartments of cylinder 44 can be of alternative designs, wherein the first and second compartments, which are inner and outer compartments in the embodiment described above, are side by side or top and bottom, by way of alternative examples.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">It should also be noted that the design and operation of cylinder 44 and piston rod 47 can be reversed, wherein piston rod 47's rest position is to be initially within cylinder 44, rather than initially extended from cylinder 44.

It should be noted that where cable 41 is formed from a material that produces less friction when cable 41 is pulled around open backed tube 42 and multiple sheaves 45 and 46 a smaller amount of the kinetic energy of a vehicle striking crash attenuator 10 will be dissipated from friction.

Level 2 units of the crash attenuator would typically be shorter than Level 3 units, since the length needed to stop a slower moving vehicle of a given mass upon impact is shorter than the same vehicle moving at a higher velocity upon impact. Similarly, an attenuator designed for Level 4 would be longer since the length needed to stop a faster moving vehicle of the same mass is longer.
