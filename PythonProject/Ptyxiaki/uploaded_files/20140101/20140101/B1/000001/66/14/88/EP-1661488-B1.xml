load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to a brush bristle material mainly made of polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) and offering excellent properties to trap and release cosmetics and medicaments, and a cosmetic brush or toothbrush using the same.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">More specifically, the present invention relates to a brush bristle material comprising a monofilament made of PTT and having a tapered surface at the tip of the brush hair where irregularities of 1 to 20 µm are formed at intervals of 5 to 50 µm, and a cosmetic brush or toothbrush using the same.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Synthetic fiber brushes with a tapered end are already known (Patent Literature 1 indicated below), and a number of improvement technologies have been presented to date. Examples include: a multi-step alkali processing performed after a bundle of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers is dipped in a 20 weight-percent sodium hydroxide solution by around 10 mm, neutralized and then washed in order to create a sharp tip (Patent Literature 2); a tapered hair material made by spinning PTT and PET or PBT (polybutylene terephthalate) together, and then dipping the obtained monofilament hair material in a sodium hydroxide solution to have one end tapered and provide moisture absorption property, elasticity and flexibility (Patent Literature 3); and a brush bristle material made of a PET monofilament having a multi-lobed irregular cross-section, wherein one end of the hair is sharpened using a sodium hydroxide solution (Patent Literature 4). However, none of these technologies offered satisfactory properties in terms of trapping and releasing of cosmetics. Also, the hydrolysis time required for PTT is three times the time required for PBT, or even longer. Because of this difficulty to hydrolyze, PTT requires a higher cost to form into a tapered shape, even when sodium hydroxide solution is used, and has therefore been considered uneconomical.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As mentioned above, brush bristle materials comprising PET or PBT monofilaments with one longitudinal end tapered via alkali processing offer flexible tips and are replacing animal hairs as brush materials.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, because these monofilaments have their surface smoothened by alkali processing, they offer lower powder-cosmetic trapping property compared with animal hairs having scaled surface.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Meanwhile, natural animal hairs are becoming more and more difficult to obtain as the world is growing more conscious of environmental protection issues. Accordingly, use of hair materials made of synthetic fibers is expected to grow further. However, it is difficult for these synthetic fibers to become primary materials for cosmetic brushes unless the aforementioned problems are resolved.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Addition of crimps to brush bristle materials is a known technology. An example of such technology is found in Patent Literature 5 (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2003225123A"><text>2003-225123</text></patcit>). This technology proposes crimps having a thickness of 5 to 30 times the thickness of the fiber and a height of 1.2 times or less the thickness of the fiber. If crimps become larger, the shape recoverability of the brush bristle material after application and removal of external forces drops, thereby affecting the brush function.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">[Patent Literature 1] Japanese Patent Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JPSHO49047618B"><text>Sho 49-047618</text></patcit></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">[Patent Literature 2] Japanese Patent Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JPSHO51116298B"><text>Sho 51-116298</text></patcit></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">[Patent Literature 3] Japanese Patent Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2004141504A"><text>2004-141504</text></patcit></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">[Patent Literature 4] Japanese Patent Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2002058538A"><text>2002-058538</text></patcit></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">[Patent Literature 5] Japanese Patent Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP2003225123A"><text>2003-225123</text></patcit></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Patent Literature 6 <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="EP1275758A"><text>EP 1275758</text></patcit> recites the preamble of claim 1.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As mentioned above, brush bristle materials made of synthetic fibers and having flexibility and liquid trapping property equivalent to those of natural animal hairs are being sought.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">To address this need, an object of the present invention is to provide a brush bristle material, especially a hair material for cosmetic brushes or toothbrushes, which is made of PIT and has a tapered surface with irregularities equivalent to those of natural animal hairs and thus effectively traps powder cosmetics and medicaments.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In an aspect, the present invention was achieved by forming a tapered shape on one end of a monofilament made of synthetic fiber, and providing fine irregularities on the tapered surface to allow powder cosmetic material to be held in the concaved parts, in order to obtain a brush bristle material made of synthetic fiber that offers properties equivalent to those of natural brush bristle materials.

Further, in an embodiment, the irregularities may be formed in a part of the tapered surface. Further, the size of irregularities, 1-20 µm, are intended to mean a majority size range in an embodiment or an average or median size range in another embodiment.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The brush bristle material according to an embodiment of the present invention has a tapered section at its tip in the longitudinal direction by hydrolyzing the tip of a PTT monofilament by alkali with amine catalyst, and fine irregularities of 1 to 20 µm are formed on the tapered surface as a result of partial promotion of hydrolysis.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The obtained brush bristle material has flexibility equivalent to that of natural animal hairs, offers excellent powder trapping and releasing properties, and is therefore most effectively used on cosmetic brushes and toothbrushes.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The brush bristle material according to an embodiment of the present invention provides favorable trapping property particularly for powder cosmetics and other powders.

However, the present invention is not limited to the preferred embodiments.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As mentioned above, alkali processing has been know as a way to taper polyester monofilaments such as those made of PET, PBT, etc. Compared to other polyesters such as PET and PBT, PTT is slower to hydrolyze under alkali and is therefore considered not suitable for tapering. Hydrolysis of PTT progresses gradually as the alkali processing temperature rises. However, PTT dissolves under severe conditions, which makes it difficult to adjust the tapering conditions.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Crimps with fine irregularities could not be formed easily at the tip of a PET or PBT monofilament, because conventional hair materials made of PET and PBT hydrolyze quickly and are hard and brittle and therefore easily break or sever at the concaved parts of the irregularities.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In any attempt to form crimps with irregularities at the tapered tip of a PET or PBT monofilament, the size shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> (magnification: x90) was the finest that could be obtained. The fine irregularities conforming to an embodiment of the present invention and fit for the proposed applications of an embodiment of the present invention could not be formed without breaking or severing the monofilament (this is why it has been impossible to take enlarged photographs of conventional hair materials made of PET and PBT at the same magnification as the photograph shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>). Also, conventional hair materials made of PET and PBT are hard and therefore often allow cosmetic powders to scatter. In an aspect, the present invention also resolved this problem.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The basic principle of the present invention in an embodiment is to alkali-process PTT, the base material, at high temperature using amine catalyst, thereby accelerating hydrolysis partially to form a tapered shape, while allowing irregularities of 1 to 20 µm to form on the tapered surface. The intervals of fine irregularities thus formed at the tapered<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> section vary depending on the amounts of amine catalyst and emulsifier added. Through adjustments, irregularities can be provided over the entire surface at intervals of 5 to 20 µm.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In other words, in an embodiment, the present invention enables formation of irregularities of 1 to 20 µm at intervals of around 5 to 50 µm on the surface of a tapered section by utilizing the rubber-like elasticity of flexible PTT material, as shown in the electron micrograph given in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> (magnification: x500). A brush made with the obtained brush bristle material can resolve the problem of scattering cosmetic powder.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">According to an embodiment of the present invention, PTT is alkali-processed in the same manner as in the conventional technologies. However, in an embodiment, the present invention uses an alkali processing solution comprising sodium hydroxide, hydrolysis accelerator catalyst, penetrant and olygomer solubilizer. A section of around 10 to 20 mm on one end or both ends in the longitudinal direction of a bundle of PTT monofilaments having a length of approx. 20 to 80 mm is dipped in this solution and processed for one to two hours at 110 to 130°C to obtain an intended brush bristle material having fine irregularities of 1 to 20 µm at intervals of 5 to 50 µm over the surface of the tapered section.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">It is also appropriate to add, after the aforementioned alkali processing, a post treatment using a heated aqueous solution of benzyl ammonium chloride compound and naphthoquinone compound to enhance the antibacterial property of the resulting hair material.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">When the shape recovery ratio from a 20% elongated state was compared among materials used to produce brush bristle materials according to an embodiment of the present invention, PET exhibited a shape recovery ratio of 29%, while PTT had a very high shape recovery ratio of 88%. The modulus of elasticity of PET was 97 cN/Dtex, while that of PTT was 23 cN/Dtex.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">According to an embodiment of the present invention, since PTT material offers excellent flexibility, and also due to the tapering process of PTT as mentioned above, the brush hair made of PTT does not irritate the skin unlike conventional brush hairs made of PET and PBT. Indeed, PTT is flexible, has excellent touch, and offers high shape recoverability and excellent coatability of cosmetics.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The brush bristle material according to an embodiment of the present invention offers a better powder trapping property for medicaments and cosmetics than squirrel hair, which has been rated as offering the best powder trapping property among all brush bristle materials. This is attributable to the many irregularities formed on the material. The brush bristle material according to an embodiment of the present invention offers much better flexibility and touch compared with conventional PET and PBT.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As shown by the electron micrographs given in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>, the powder-cosmetic trapping property of the brush bristle material according to an embodiment of the present invention is notably higher than the trapping property of squirrel hair, which has been rated as offering the best powder trapping property among all brush bristle materials, or the trapping property of fiber made of PBT belonging to the same polyester group.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">According to an embodiment of the present invention, when a PTT monofilament is alkali-processed by applying amine catalyst at high temperature, hydrolysis is partially accelerated and irregularities of 1 to 20 µm are formed on the tapered surface of the monofilament. The intervals of the resulting fine irregularities vary depending on the amounts of amine catalyst and emulsifier added. Through adjustment, these irregularities can be provided over the entire surface of the monofilament's tapered section at intervals of 5 to 20 µm. These fine irregularities enhance the trapping property for cosmetic powders and medicaments comprising finer grains.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Meanwhile, adding crimps to synthetic fiber monofilaments used for brush bristle materials is a known technique. In general, crimped brush bristle materials had a crimp length of 5 to 30 times the thickness of the monofilament and a crimp height of 1.2 times or less the thickness of the monofilament. If larger crimps were formed, the shape recoverability of the brush bristle material after application and removal of external forces dropped, thereby affecting the brush function.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">On the other hand, the brush bristle material according to an embodiment of the present invention has a crimp length of 40 to 50 times the thickness of the monofilament and a crimp height of 3 to 6 times the thickness of the monofilament. Formation of fine irregularities despite such a large crimp size becomes possible because of the excellent shape recoverability achieved by the rubber-like elasticity of PTT that<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> comprises the new brush bristle material. It has been revealed that adding crimps of the above shape would increase the void ratio between adjacent brush hairs and increase the amount of powder cosmetic material trapped between the hairs, thereby allowing the cosmetic material to be applied more effectively.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the heated gear method or hot roll method can be used to easily form on a PTT monofilament comprising the brush bristle material a series of crimps having lengths and heights appropriate for the thickness of the monofilament.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">If brush hairs are straight over their entire length, less amounts of powder cosmetic material or other intended substance are held between adjacent brush hairs. By adding crimps with a length of 40 to 50 times the thickness of the monofilament, or around one to three crimps per 2 cm, in the longitudinal direction, the trapping amount of cosmetic material can be increased over the levels achieved with brush hairs having irregularities only.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">However, adding more than three crimps per 2 cm reduces the resilience and firmness of brush hairs. A brush having such floppy hairs is difficult to use.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">According to an embodiment of the present invention, fine irregularities are formed on the entire tapered surface by alkali-processing PTT with amine catalyst at a high temperature of approx. 120°C. It is difficult to achieve such irregularities with PET or PBT.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The amine catalyst for alkali hydrolysis used in the processing of brush bristle material according to an embodiment of the present invention may be ethyl benzalkonium chloride, lauryl dimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, cetyl dimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, dodecyl dibenzyldimethyl ammonium chloride, ethylamine, isopropylamine, triethylamine, ethanolamine, pyrrole or pyridin.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">According to an embodiment of the present invention, it is not necessary for all brush hairs comprising a cosmetic brush or toothbrush to have crimps. For example, only 50 to 70% of all hairs can have crimps. The thickness of PTT monofilament may be 60 to 200 decitex, or more preferably 70 to 120 decitex. However, monofilaments of different finenesses can be obtained under different alkali processing conditions. In this case,<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> monofilaments of different finenesses can be mixed during the production process of brush bristle materials.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">As for the PTT fiber usable in the present invention, general-purpose monofilaments of 70 to 200 decitex (PTT fiber manufactured by Solotex) can be used. Since cosmetic brushes require antiseptic property, it is appropriate to use monofilaments that have been processed by a heated aqueous solution of benzyl ammonium chloride compound and naphthoquinone compound.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The benzyl ammonium chloride compound used in this process is ethyl benzalkonium chloride, lauryl dimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, cetyl dimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride or dodecyl benzyl dimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride. As for the naphthoquinone compound, 1,4-naphthoquinone, 2-hydroxy-3-chloronaphthoquinone, 2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone, 2-alkoxy-3-chloronaphthoquinone, naphtho[2,3D]thiazole-4,9-dione or 2-alkyl-2,3-thiazole-4,9-dione can be used.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">When processing PTT fiber using a heated aqueous solution of the two compounds specified above, it is appropriate to add a carrier agent such as benzoic acid or parahydroxy methyl benzoate. To enhance the adsorption of benzyl ammonium chloride compound and naphthoquinone compound in heated water, it is effective to use a coupling agent such as γ-glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane or γ-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">During the aforementioned processing using a heated aqueous solution, by affixing onto the surface of the hair material one or two or more selected from phospholipid polymer, sericin and chitosan, brush functions can be added such as improved moisture absorption effect, flexibility and strength. This treatment also adds antistatic property, compliance to the skin and smooth touch, thus enhancing the safety of the brush on the skin.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">One characteristic of the present invention in an embodiment is that no binder is used to affix the above components onto the PTT hair material, by using hot-water absorption method instead.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Examples of the present invention are explained using drawings.
