Field of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a compound for promoting regeneration and differentiation of neural stem cells.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>2. The Prior Arts</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Neural stem cells (NSCs) are characterized as undifferentiated cells that have the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into other neural cells such as neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. NSCs can renew and differentiate in the presence of stimulating factors under <i>in vitro</i> cultural conditions. These differentiated cells play important roles during the development of central nervous system in mammals and also in the function of the fully developed nervous system in animals. NSCs can be isolated from the cortex of the brain of many mammals (such as mice, rats, pigs and humans) during their development before maturation. The NSCs in the central nervous system of humans are similar to those of rodents.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">NSCs in mammals are present in mature organs as well as in the developing central nervous system. At the moment, one can also isolate neural stem cells from the embryonic brain of mammals; however, little is known on the mechanism of regulating endogenous neural stem cells.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The best method of treating a neurodegenerative disease is to restore and regenerate damaged or lost neural cells. Treatments in progress include replacing damaged cells through NSCs transplantation or activating endogenous NSCs in dormancy to "self-renew".</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Although scientists have some knowledge of using NSCs to restore damaged neural cells, they need to find a way to effectively control them as they grow and differentiate into function-defined cells. Previous reports indicate that NSCs could propagate in a medium supplemented with growth factors such as basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF), Epithelial Growth Factor (EGF), etc. It is also known that in the presence<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> of these growth factors in a serum-free medium, NSCs grown in suspension have the propensity to aggregate and form so-called "neurospheres". In addition, if these growth factors are removed and subsequently replaced with proper amount of known mitogenic factors, growth factors other than bFGF and EGF, or other neurotrophic factors, NSCs would most likely be stimulated into differentiation. The majority of the differentiated cells would be astrocytes (&gt;90%), and only a few of them are neurons (&lt;10%).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Many neurotrophic factors have been discovered in the past: Glial-derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF), Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), Neurotrophin-3 (NT3), Neurotrophin-4 (NT4), Platelet-derived Growth Factor (PDGF), and so on. Although these neurotrophic factors have been proven to promote the survival of neural cells, their clinical applications are limited. One reason is that their large molecular size prohibits them from passing the blood brain barrier (BBB).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">If small molecular compounds could be found with the capability to activate endogenous NSCs, promote their growth and maintain their specificity, or even promote their differentiation into function able neurons, effective treatment or prevention of neurodegenerative diseases might become feasible. Through the effect of these compounds the success rate of NSCs transplantation into subjects may be improved.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Compounds A to F and H have already been disclosed as antioxydants (in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20030055103A"><text>US 2003/0055103</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2004113318A"><text>WO 2004/113318</text></patcit>, <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Chen C-N et al in Journal of naturel products (2003) 66: 503-506</text></nplcit> and in <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Evidence-based complementary and alternative Medicine (2004) 1: 175-185</text></nplcit>.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">To overcome the shortcomings of the prior art, the primary objective of the present invention is to provide a compound for promoting the growth of cortical neurons and NSCs, which has a small molecular size capable of passing blood brain barrier and reaching the brain more easily than large neurotrophic factors, to increase the survival rate of neural cells.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Another objective of the present invention is to provide a compound for promoting the differentiation of NSCs into neurons with specific functions.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">To approach the above objectives, the present description provides a prenylflavanone compound represented by a general formula as (I) shown below:

This makes the compound of the present invention novel and desirable supplements to the growth media used in neurological studies.</li><li>(2) The compound of the present invention can affect the growth of NSCs and produce thicker and longer neurites with more branches than bFGF or EGF can. This may play important roles in regenerating damaged or lost cells in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, Lou Gehrig's, etc., and demyelinating or dysmyelinaing disorders such as multiple sclerosis. The compound of the present invention can be used individually or in combination with other compounds for such purposes.</li><li>(3) The compound of the present invention, while proliferating NSCs, can form neurospheres more effectively than bFGF or EGF and maintain the spheres in live condition for at least 30 days <i>in vitro,</i> making the compound of the present invention preferable to known growth factors for growth media. Furthermore, the neurospheres can be induced to differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Besides improving the viability of NSCs before and after transplantation, the compound of the present invention would also be useful for transforming these cells into function able cells.</li><li>(4) The compound of the present invention can induce the neural stem cells to form mainly neuronal stem cells and further differentiate mostly into neurons amounting to a level previously unobtainable: previous arts obtain only 20-30% whereas the compound of the invention can reach over 60% neurons (data not shown). Also, the compound of the present invention can be used in combination with one of the known growth factors such as bFGF to increase the proliferation of neural stem cells such that large numbers of neuronal stem cells can be produced for cell therapies in neurodegenerative diseases. Alternatively, by conventional techniques, this invention may produce, harvest, and purify large numbers of "naked" neural stem cells to be used in cell transplantation.</li></ol><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">With different functions and characteristics from the large protein molecules used in prior arts (such as EGF, bFGF, GDNF, BDNF, NGF, NT3, NT4, PDGF and so on), the compound of the invention can be used as supplements for <i>in vitro</i> culture of NSCs and cortical neurons.
