In the past, naturally produced diamond has been used in industrial applications, but since natural diamond has a quiet-variable quality, more and more manmade diamond is being used an industrial setting. Diamond single crystals today are synthesized industrially under high temperature and pressure (several thousand degrees centigrade, and several tens of thousands of atmospheres). Super-high-pressure vessels that can with stand such high temperatures and pressures are extremely expensive, and there is a limit to their size, which imposes a limit to how large a single crystal can be synthesized by high-temperature, high-pressure methods. Ib-type diamond which contains nitrogen (N) as an impurity and is yellow in color has been synthesized by high-temperature, high-pressure methods and marketed in a diameter of about 1 cm,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> but this approximate size is thought to be the limit. IIa-type diamond which contains few impurities and is colorless and transparent can be mass-produced industrially in a size of only about a few millimeters.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Meanwhile, another method that has been established as a diamond synthesis method alongside the high-temperature, high-pressure method is vapor phase synthesis. With this method, diamond with a relatively large surface area of from a few centimeters up to 10 cm, or even larger, can be manufactured artificially, but the product is usually a polycrystalline film. However, of the many applications of diamond, when the product is used for semiconductor substrates, optical components, or ultra-precision tools that require particularly smooth surfaces, it is necessary to use single crystal diamond. In view of this, methods for obtaining single crystal diamond by epitaxial growth by vapor phase synthesis have been studied in the past.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Epitaxial growth is generally broken down into homoepitaxial growth in which the substance to be grown is grown on a substrate of the same type, and heteroepitaxial growth in which the substance is growth on a different type of substrate. With heteroepitaxial growth, there have been reports dealing with cubic boron nitride (cBN), silicon carbide (SiC), silicon (Si), nickel, cobalt, and so forth (see Patent Documents 1 to 3 listed below), but since single crystals with good film quality cannot be obtained by heteroepitaxial growth, synthesis of single crystals by homoepitaxial growth is considered more effective. With homoepitaxial growth, it is possible to obtain large IIa diamond single crystals that are greater than IIa diamond obtained by a high-temperature, high-pressure method, by epitaxially growing high-purity diamond from the vapor phase on an Ib diamond substrate produced by high-temperature, high-pressure synthesis. It has also<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> been reported that diamond having just small angle boundaries can be obtained by using a plurality of diamond substrates all oriented in the same crystal orientation, or using diamond particles and growing integrated diamond over these (see Patent Document 4).<br/>

the concentration of nitrogen atoms, silicon atoms, and hydrogen atoms is given as the number of atoms per carbon atom.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">It was found that a diamond substrate such as this is obtained by a manufacturing method comprising, a step of readying a single crystal diamond substrate produced by vapor phase synthesis as a seed substrate, and a step of etching away one main surface thereof by reactive ion etching (hereinafter referred to as RIE) and then growing a new single crystal diamond layer on the main surface by vapor phase synthesis, and preferably also comprising a step of separating the single crystal diamond substrate used as the seed substrate from the single crystal diamond layer newly grown by vapor phase synthesis. It was also found that this diamond substrate can be obtained by a manufacturing method including a step of etching away at least 50 nm of the side surfaces of the seed substrate prior to the step of etching away the main surface by reactive ion etching.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The inventors conducted diligent research into the characteristics of single crystal diamond when used as a semiconductor device substrate and the characteristics when used as an optical component, in which they focused on crystal strain. As a result, they discovered that having the phase<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> difference produced when mutually perpendicular linearly polarized light beams pass through a sample (single crystal diamond) fall within a certain range in an evaluation method utilizing birefringent light is important in terms of maintaining good characteristics as a semiconductor device substrate and good characteristics as an optical component. Specifically, this range is such that the maximum phase difference per 100 µm of thickness is from 10 to 50 nm over the entire sample.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">This phase difference is zero in a completely optically symmetric crystal with no strain whatsoever. Actual crystals, however, usually have some strain, sometimes more and sometimes less. The strain in a crystal can be quantified by evaluating this phase difference in a transparent crystal. It was found that this phase difference can vary even though the rocking curve half-width in a (400) plane falls within a range of 10 to 80 seconds. To find the cause of this, the inventors first turned their attention to impurities contained in the crystal. Specifically, it was found that the above-mentioned phase difference can be achieved when the nitrogen and silicon concentrations are within the ranges of 0.01 to 100 ppm and 0.01 to 1000 ppm, respectively. It was also discovered that optical strain can be reduced over the entire crystal if the spin density obtained by electron spin resonance is not more than 1 × 10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup> at room temperature within a g value range of at least 2.002 and less than 2.0028; if a seed substrate grown by vapor phase synthesis, rather than a natural single crystal substrate or one produced by high-temperature, high-pressure synthesis, is used as the seed substrate; if one main surface of the crystal is etched away by reactive ion etching and then a new single crystal diamond layer is grown on that main surface by vapor phase synthesis; and if a step is included in which at least 50 nm of the side surfaces is etched away prior to the step of etching away the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> main surface by reactive ion etching.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">When the present invention is used as a material for a semiconductor device substrate or an optical component, its thickness is preferably from 100 to 1500 µm. The greater the diameter, the better, but 4 mm or larger is sufficient size for device development.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As to the method for manufacturing this substrate, vapor phase synthesis is of course preferable for producing the seed substrate, and it is also preferable to include a step of separating the newly grown single crystal layer from the seed substrate by slicing with a laser beam having a wavelength of 360 nm or less. This contributes greatly to reducing cost because it minimizes machining loss as compared to a method in which the diamond is separated by slicing with a laser whose wavelength is over 360 nm, not to mention a method in which the seed substrate is cut off by grinding or the like.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">It was found that strain can be reduced by using a seed substrate produced by vapor phase synthesis as compared to one produced by a high-temperature, high=pressure method. The reason for this is that with a diamond single crystal obtained by growing a diamond layer by vapor phase synthesis over a diamond seed substrate obtained by high-temperature, high-pressure synthesis, the differences between the two synthesis methods result in differences in the distribution and amounts of impurities, and the defect introduction mechanism, so even though they are both single crystals, they have slightly different properties, such as their coefficients of thermal expansion, and as a result strain accumulates. It was found that when a diamond substrate produced by vapor phase synthesis is used as a seed substrate, and a diamond layer is grown over this seed substrate by vapor phase synthesis, even if the above-mentioned strain remains in this seed substrate, the strain will not readily be introduced into the single crystal substrate that is newly grown.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Furthermore, it was found that removing one main surface of the single crystal diamond substrate that serves as the seed by reactive ion etching, and then growing a new single crystal diamond layer by vapor phase synthesis is very effective at reducing strain.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Specifically, it is preferable to grow a single crystal after etching away at least 0.5 µm and less than 400 µm of a main surface of a mechanically polished seed substrate by RIE prior to the growth of the single crystal. A seed substrate with no work-affected layer may be readied to suppress the occurrence of strain during the vapor phase growth of the single crystal diamond, but a work-affected layer, because of how it is produced, is difficult to remove from the surface of a seed substrate by mechanical polishing. There is a variety of known processes for the non-mechanical working of diamond in addition to the above-mentioned RIE, such as microwave plasma etching, ECR plasma etching, and ion beam etching. With these non-mechanical working processes other than RIE, it is difficult to solve all problems at the same time, such as the formation of a damage layer during etching, surface roughness after working, or problems in the working rate and working surface area of the seed substrate. With RIE, just the work-affected layer of the seed substrate can be removed, without damage, quickly, and with good flatness. After this, the vapor phase growth of a single crystal will yield a large diamond single crystal substrate with no strain and with high quality.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The RIE of the present invention can be carried out by a known method. Such methods can be broadly classified into methods that involve the use of a capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) in which a high-frequency power source is connected to electrodes disposed across from each other in a vacuum vessel, and methods that involve the use of an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) in which a high-frequency<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> power source is connected to a coil disposed so as to surround a vacuum vessel. There are also methods that are a combination of the above two, and any of these methods can be used in the present invention.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">A mixed gas of oxygen and a fluorocarbon is preferably used as the etching gas, and the etching pressure is preferably at least 1.33 Pa and no more than 13.3 Pa. Using the above type of gas and gas pressure allows just the work-affected layer to be removed quickly and with good flatness.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The etching thickness of the seed substrate in the present invention may be at least 0.5 µm and less than 400 µm, and is preferably at least 5 µm and less than 50 µm, and even more preferably at least 10 µm and less than 30 µm. The less the etching thickness, the shorter the working time, and the better the flatness of the surface is maintained. The thickness of the work-affected layer of the seed substrate depends on the type and conditions of polishing used. For most of the layer the thickness is less than 0.5 µm, but there are rare instances when a depth of about 10 µm may be reached in places, and the characteristics as a semiconductor may suffer in the regions grown from these portions. Conversely, if the etching depth is greater, not only will etching take longer, but the surface roughness caused by etching may expand. A decrease in crystallinity due to surface roughness is sometimes seen in subsequent single crystal growth.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The side surfaces of the seed substrate in the present invention are preferably etched away, by the same RIE, in an amount of at least 50 nm, and preferably at least 0.15 µm. In particular, when the side surf aces are mechanically polished in the same way as the main surface, the etching is preferably to at least 0.5 µm. This allows strain to be reduced in the regions grown laterally from the side surfaces, particularly when expansion growth in the lateral direction has occurred<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> during the thick-film growth of the single crystal. One method for the RIE of the side surfaces is to etch simultaneously from the side surfaces in the course of the RIE of the seed substrate main surface, but standing the substrate on end and etching just the side surfaces is a more efficient method because the etching thickness can be controlled independently.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The etching of the side surfaces is preferably performed ahead of the etching of the main surface. Specifically, side surface etching requires that the substrate be stood on end and the main surface covered, but the main surface can be damaged during covering, etc. This damage can also be removed by the etching of the main surface performed in the present invention. The main surface of the seed substrate used here is preferably (100) or approximately (100).</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The vapor phase synthesis method used in the present invention to grow the diamond single crystal may be hot filament CVD, plasma CVD, plasma jet, combustion flame, laser CVD, or another known method.
