The present invention also relates to a decorative material whose surface strength such as abrasion resistance is imparted by an ionizing radiation curing resin layer, and also, whose surface is delustered by delustering silica.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Decorative sheets using paper and resin sheet, or decorative materials such as decorative material in the form of plate, in which the above-mentioned decorative sheet is adhered to an adhered base material, are used in various uses such as construction interior and exterior materials. These decorative sheets and decorative materials, in general, are often required to have surface strength such as scratch resistance and the like. For the above-mentioned reasons, for example, (1) ones, in which a curing resin layer of two-component curing resin, ionizing radiation curing resin, or the like is formed as an even thickness resin coated membrane (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> (JP-A) No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP53064289A"><text>53-64289</text></patcit>), is conventionally used for the surface of the decorative sheet. Comparing to two-component urethane resins and the like, such ionizing radiation curing resin has various advantages such as: excellent in productivity because instant curing is possible; solvent drying is not necessary and can be piled up; and further as result, relief printing in a pattern is possible.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Further, a decorative sheet, whose curing resin layer of the surface is formed into a convex-concave pattern, is proposed in the purpose of a convex-concave surface design, improving abrasion resistance or the like. For example, (2) a decorative sheet 20 having a configuration shown in cross-sectional view in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, that on a pattern printed layer 22 provided on a base material 21, coating film layer 23 of an urethane based resin ink is provided on the entire surface, and further thereon, a convex-concave pattern 24 formed by the relief printing of the urethane base resin ink is provided (<patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP8100397A"><text>JP-A No. 8-100397</text></patcit>). Or (3) a decorative sheet 20 having a configuration shown in cross-sectional view in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5</figref>, that on a pattern printed layer 22 provided on a base material 21, coating film layer 23 of an urethane based resin ink is provided on the entire surface, a convex-concave pattern 24 formed by the relief printing of the urethane base resin ink is provided thereon, and further on the entire surface of the convex-concave pattern24, an overcoat layer 25 of a curing resin is provided(<patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP8244193A"><text>JP-A No. 8-244193</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">On the other hand, various design expression is possible in forming of surface resin layers such as curing resin layer,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> using a doctor blade and a gravure plate (gravure coating, gravure printing), by adjusting a cell volume in order to make variation in thickness of the resin layer, or by forming in a pattern.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the above-mentioned gravure coating or gravure printing, doctor streak may occur in long time operation. The doctor streak occurs when a tip of the doctor blade is chipped off, a groove shaped damage (doctor damage) occurs across the tip, so that the ink of this part is not scraped off sufficiently, because the doctor blade is not worn evenly in its width direction. Such doctor streak can be avoided if the doctor blade is changed earlier, or can be improved by using a steel doctor coated with ceramic (hereinafter, referred to as "ceramic doctor" for short) as the doctor blade instead of a conventional steel doctor blade.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The improvement of the doctor streak is attempted also in an aspect of compositions of the ink or coating liquid. For example, compositions containing an inorganic pigment (special light calcium carbonate) having rosette crystal (<patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP5051549A"><text>JP-A No. 5-51549</text></patcit>), containing an amine salt of N-benzoyl amino alkane acid in an aqueous ink (<patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP6220385A"><text>JP-ANo. 6-220385</text></patcit>), or containing spherical filler such as a polycarbonate based resin and the like (<patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP11277685A"><text>JP-A No. 11-277685</text></patcit> (paragraph 0013)) are proposed.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, particularly when the ink or coating liquid contain delustering agent such as delustering silica, the doctor streak is likely to occur. The delustering silica is used when a delustered surface (including a low-luster surface in addition to a delustered surface, as it is named) is required, for example, when luster on a surface of a decorative material is not wanted.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> Therefore, the resin layer on the surface is formed as a luster adjusting resin layer in which the delustering agent is added (Japanese Patent No.<patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="JP2856862B"><text>2856862</text></patcit>). Though there are various types of delustering agent, the delustering silica is most common in view of high delustering effect and low cost.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the decorative sheet such as above-mentioned (1), in which a curing resin layer of an even thickness is formed by coating on the entire surface, abrasion resistance is improved by the curing resin layer. However, a problem of grain depression is likely to occur. The grain depression is a phenomenon that underlying roughness is visible. The phenomenon may be caused by undulations in the surface of the base material to which the decorative sheet is adhered, such as may be caused by a groove or the like, which stands out on the surface of the decorative sheet when the decorative sheet is adhered to an adhered base material such as wooden substrate, such as a lauan plywood, a particle board and the like, to form a decorative material. Particularly, the problem occurs when the decorative sheet is in a form of a decorative paper, a coated paper or the like, and the base material sheet is thin like a paper.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It was found that, in the decorative sheet provided with a convex-concave pattern by relief printing as the above-mentioned (2) and (3), as well as the expression of the three-dimensional design, the grain depression can be made not visible by the convex-concave pattern, and further, scratch resistance can also be obtained. However, on the lower side of the convex-concave pattern 24 of the decorative sheet of (2),<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the coating film layer 23, of the curing resin, as same as the convex-concave pattern is provided. On the upper side of the convex-concave pattern 24 of the decorative sheet (3), the overcoat layer 25, of the curing resin, as same as the convex-concave pattern is provided. Therefore, the coating process of the coating film layer or the overcoat layer is necessary in addition to the relief printing of the convex-concave pattern so that high cost in processing and high material cost are inevitable.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the viewpoint of the cost, a configuration of base material 21/pattern printed layer 22/convex-concave pattern 24, omitting the coating film layer or the overcoat layer, can be presented. However, with such configuration, sufficient property cannot be obtained in applications in which scratch resistance or contamination resistance is required. This is because, even though contamination resistance can be imparted to a convex part "a" of the convex-concave pattern 24 by forming the convex-concave pattern with curing resin, the lower layer of the convex-concave pattern, such as the pattern printed layer 22 or base material sheet 21, is bared in a concave part "b" of the convex-concave pattern in the relief printing. Therefore, contamination resistance of the decorative sheet is deteriorated as a whole, due to the poor contamination resistance of the lower layer (refer to <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">On the other hand, when the delustering silica is added in order to adjust the luster of the surface, there is a problem that the doctor streak tends to occur. The tendency is apparent<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> particularly when the curing resin layer on the surface is formed of the ionizing radiation curing resin, especially with no solvent. Further, in case of using the ionizing radiation curing resin by itself, the surface thereof tends to have a strong luster and it is difficult to weaken the luster. Therefore, the delustering agent must be added in the applications in which the strong luster is not wanted, so that improvement of the doctor streak and making the manufacturing easier are inevitable problems.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A reason that the addition of the delustering agent, when the resin is the ionizing radiation curing resin, has tendency to lead to the doctor streak is as follows. When a two-component curing type urethane resin and the like is diluted with a solvent and used, a lift up effect, wherein the delustering agent float up to the surface in volume shrinking of the coating film due to drying of the solvent, will contribute to the delustering. However, when no solvent is used, an adding amount or a particle diameter of the delustering agent is needed to be increased since there is no lift up effect. Moreover, when no solvent is used, a leveling effect after the coating is low so that the doctor streak tends to remain, being another reason. Although the doctor streak is improved by the use of the ceramic doctor, a difference by adding the delustering silica still remains.</p><heading id="h0003">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">An object of the present invention is to realize a configuration of decorative sheet, particularly a decorative<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> paper and the like, or a decorative plate in which it is adhered, that is: a grain depression is not visible; excellent in scratch resistance, also in contamination resistance; and three-dimensional design can be expressed, at low cost.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Another object of the present invention is to improve the doctor streak in the above-mentioned decorative sheet, even when the delustering silica is added to adjust the luster of the surface.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Still other object of the present invention is to improve the doctor streak, in addition to the surface strength such as abrasion resistance, in decorative material provided with a luster adjusting resin layer of the ionizing radiation curing resin, in which the luster of the surface is weakened by the delustering silica.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">For solving the above-mentioned problems, the decorative material of the present invention has a configuration that a luster adjusting resin layer, which is formed of a cross-linked cured material of an ionizing radiation curing resin composition containing a delustering silica, is provided on a base material, and the luster adjusting resin layer further contains either one or both of a magnesium hydroxide and a magnesium carbonate, as a filler.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">With such configuration, even when the luster adjusting resin layer contains the delustering silica as the delustering agent, the doctor streak when the luster adjusting resin layer is formed (by a gravure coating or gravure printing by using a doctor blade and a gravure plate) can be improved.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Moreover, the decorative material of the present invention has a configuration, further in the above-mentioned configuration, that the luster adjusting resin layer is formed partially, in a pattern, to form a convex-concave surface design of the luster adjusting resin layer.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">With such configuration, design expression of a highly sophisticated design is possible by the convex-concave surface design.

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the decorative material of the present invention comprises at least a base material 1 and a luster adjusting resin layer 2, formed thereon, which is formed of a cross-linked cured material of an ionizing radiation curing resin containing delustering silica, and the luster adjusting resin layer 2 further contains either of both of magnesium hydroxide and magnesium carbonate, in addition to the delustering silica.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Hereinafter, the respective components of the decorative material will be explained.</p><heading id="h0008">[Luster adjusting resin layer]</heading><p id="p0033" num="0033">At first, the luster adjusting resin layer 2 is a layer for providing surface physical properties such as abrasion<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> resistance to the decorative material surface and for adjusting the surface luster of the decorative material to lower the luster or to deluster the surface. The luster adjusting resin layer 2 is formed as a cross-linked cured material of an ionizing radiation curing resin composition containing at least an ionizing radiation curing resin, delustering silica, and further, magnesium hydroxide and/or magnesium carbonate. By containing the magnesium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, or both of them as indispensable fillers, in addition to the delustering silica, improves doctor streak generation even though the delustering silica is contained therein.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As the delustering silica, conventionally known silica for delustering may be used properly depending on the uses. The doctor streaks are lessened more if the delustering silica particle diameter is smaller. However the delustering effect is also decreased. On the other hand, the delustering effect is increased more if the thickness of the luster adjusting resin layer is thinner, for the same particle diameter. Accordingly, the particle diameter of the delustering silica may be selected properly in consideration of the required thickness of the luster adjusting resin layer and the required delustering degree.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">For example, when the thickness of the luster adjusting resin layer (if the thickness is even, a high surface strength such as abrasion resistance can be obtained, and in the case of forming the layer in a pattern, sophisticated convex-concave surface designs can be obtained by relief printing) is 10 to 15 µm, in order to obtain the delustering effect, it is preferable<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> to select delustering silica with an average particle diameter of 8 µm or larger. On the other hand, the maximum of the average particle diameter is about 15 µm in consideration of the doctor streak formation or the delustering effect. Consequently, in general, the particle diameter of the delustering silica is preferably about 8 to 15 µm. If it is smaller than the above range, sufficient delustering effect cannot be obtained, and if it is larger than the range, doctor streaks are more likely to be formed (even if magnesium hydroxide and magnesium carbonate are also contained in the layer).</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The doctor streaks are less likely to be formed as the adding amount of the delustering silica is smaller. However the delustering effect is also deteriorated. Therefore, in general, the adding amount is preferably about 5 to 20 parts by mass, more preferably about 10 to 20 parts by mass, to 100 parts by mass of the resin component. If it is less than the above range, sufficient delustering effect cannot be obtained, and if it exceeds the range, doctor streaks are more likely to be formed (even in the case of the layer containing magnesium hydroxide or the like).</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Magnesium hydroxide and magnesium carbonate (hereinafter, they may be named generally as magnesium compound) to be contained as fillers: have refractive indexes close to that of a resin; are able to assure the transparency of the luster adjusting resin layer; and also give good doctor streak improving effect among various kinds of fillers which have soft hardness to the doctor blades (Morse hardness 4 or 3 or lower). For example, in the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> case of talc as soft as Morse hardness 1, doctor streak improving effect cannot be obtained. And even in the case of aluminum hydroxide having similar hardness of Morse hardness 3, doctor streak improving effect cannot be obtained.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Although the particle shape of these magnesium compounds subjected to the tests is amorphous, and thus, is not spherical as described above (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="JP11277685A"><text>11-277685</text></patcit>), the doctor streak improving effect is obtained.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">As compared with magnesium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate is weaker in coloring contamination (coloring contamination resistance). For contamination resistance and ease of coloring and dyeing, magnesium hydroxide is preferable. Also, magnesium hydroxide and magnesium carbonate may be used independently or in combination with each other. Additionally, magnesium carbonate to be added as the filler in this embodiment is so-called magnesium carbonate and more accurately, it is basic magnesium carbonate.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The adding amount of the above magnesium compounds is 1 to 15 parts by mass, more preferably 1 to 10 parts by mass, to 100 parts by mass of the resin component. If it is less than the range, the sufficient improving effect cannot be obtained, and if it exceeds the range, the doctor streak improving effect is deteriorated. Additionally, the delustering effect of these magnesium compounds themselves (as compared with the delustering silica) is low. If they are added in a high content so as to obtain the delustering effect only by these magnesium compounds without the delustering silica, for example 40 parts by mass<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> of magnesium hydroxide is added, the doctor streaks are worsened more than those in the case of using the delustering silica alone.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The particle diameter of the above magnesium compounds is preferably 10 µm or less at maximum as the average particle diameter in terms of the doctor streak improvement.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">As described, use of magnesium hydroxide and magnesium carbonate in combination with delustering silica improves the doctor streaks which are likely to be generated due to the use of delustering silica, when the luster adjusting resin layer is formed by a gravure coating or gravure printing method using a doctor blade and a gravure plate. Although the effect can be obtained by using a conventional doctor blade made of steel, as the doctor blade, a ceramic doctor is preferable in terms of the durability and less doctor streak formation.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">When the luster adjusting resin layer is formed by the gravure coating or gravure printing method using a doctor blade and a gravure plate, even if ionizing radiation curing resin composition is used without a solvent as a material for the luster adjusting resin layer, the improving effect can be achieved. Therefore, since the luster adjusting resin layer is easily formed to be thick, when the layer is formed on the entire face, the coating impression can be obtained easily. Moreover, when the layer is formed partially, the convex-concave surface design due to the existence and absence of the luster adjusting resin layer, formed partially in a pattern, can be expressed. In the latter case, it is formed by the relief printing. If the relief printing is carried out by screen printing, the thickness of<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> the formed part becomes even. Meanwhile by using a gravure plate, the thickness of the formed part can be changed by cell volume variation of the plate, and thus, the convex-concave surface design with higher designing expression is made possible. Additionally, in the case of the gravure coating (printing) on the entire surface, the thickness of the luster adjusting resin layer may be changed by cell volume variation, and in such a case, gradation expression of an image is made possible by coloring the luster adjusting resin layer.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As the ionizing radiation curing resin to be used for the ionizing radiation curing resin composition, conventionally known resins may be used properly depending on the uses.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">As the ionizing radiation curing resin, specifically, compositions curable by ionizing radiation, which is obtained by mixing prepolymers (including so-called oligomers) and/or monomers having radical polymerizable unsaturated bonds or cationic polymerizable functional groups in molecules, are used preferably. The ionizing radiation means electromagnetic waves or charged particles having energy sufficient for inducing cross-linking and curing of molecules. And generally, an ultraviolet (UV) or electron beam (EB) is used.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Specifically, the above-mentioned prepolymer or monomer formed of compounds comprising, in molecules, radical polymerizable unsaturated groups such as (meth) acryloyl groups and (meth)acryloyloxy groups, and cationic polymerizable functional groups such as epoxy groups. Such prepolymers or monomers may be used alone or a plurality of types of these may<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> be used in a combination. The (meth)acryloyl group means, for example, acryloyl group or methacryloyl group. As the ionizing radiation curing resin, polyene/thiol based prepolymers containing polyenes and polythiols in combination are also used preferably.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Examples for the prepolymers having the radical polymerizable unsaturated groups in molecules are polyester (meth)acrylate, urethane (meth)acrylate, epoxy (meth)acrylate, melamine (meth)acrylate, triazine (meth)acrylate, silicone (meth) acrylate and the like. Generally, those having a molecular weight about 250 to 100,000 are used.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Examples usable as the monomers having the radical polymerizable unsaturated groups in molecules are: mono-functional monomers such as methyl (meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate, phenoxyethyl (meth)acrylate and the like; and polyfunctional monomers such as diethylene glycol (meth) acrylate, propylene glycol di (meth) acrylate, hexanediol (meth)acrylate, trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate, trimethylolpropane ethylene oxide tri(meth)acrylate, pentaerythritol tetra(meth)acrylate, dipentaerythritol tetra (meth) acrylate, dipentaerythritol penta (meth) acrylate, dipentaerythritol hexa(meth)acrylate and the like.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Examples of the prepolymers having cationic polymerizable functional groups in molecules are prepolymers of: epoxy based resins such as bisphenol type epoxy resin, novolak type epoxy resin and the like; and vinyl ether based resins such as aliphatic based vinyl ethers, aromatic based vinyl ethers and the like.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Examples of the thiols are polythiols such as trimethylolpropane trithioglycolate, pentaerythritol tetrathioglycolate and the like. Also, for examples of polyenes, ones obtained by adding allylalcohol to both terminals of polyurethanes formed of diols and diisocyanates.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In the case of cross-linking and curing by UV or visible light rays, a photo-polymerization initiator is added to ionizing radiation curing resin. In the case of the resins having radical polymerizable unsaturated groups, as the photo-polymerization initiator, acetophenones, benzophenones, thioxanthones, benzoin, benzoin methyl ethers may be used alone or in form of mixtures. In the case of the resins havingcationicpolymerizable functional groups, as the photo-polymerization initiator, aromatic diazonium salts, aromatic sulfonium salts, aromatic iodonium salts, metallocene compounds, and benzoinsulfonic acid esters may be used alone or in form of mixtures.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The adding amount of these photo-polymerization initiators is about 0.1 to 10 parts by mass, to 100 parts by mass of the ionizing radiation curing resin.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">With respect to a beam source of the ionizing radiation, as a UV source, an ultrahigh pressure mercury lamp, a high pressure mercury lamp, a low pressure mercury lamp, a carbon arc lamp, a black light type fluorescent lamp, a metal halide lamp and the like may be used. Generally, the wavelength of UV rays is mainly in a wavelength band of 190 to 380 nm.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">As an electron beam source, a variety of electron accelerators such as Cockcroft-Walton type, Van de Graaff type,<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> resonance transformer type, insulating core transformer type, and linear type, dynamitron type, and high frequency type may be used. Those having electron beams with energy of 100 to 1, 000 keV, preferably 100 to 300 keV are used. The radiation dose of the electron beam is generally about 20 to 150 kGy.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The luster adjusting resin layer of this embodiment is formed with ionizing radiation curing resin composition containing the above ionizing radiation curing resin, at least delustering silica, and further, as fillers, magnesium hydroxide and/or magnesium carbonate. For physical property adjustment, properly as necessary, the ionizing radiation curing resin composition may further contain: a thermoplastic resin such as vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer, vinyl acetate resin, acrylic resin, and cellulose based resin; and other known additives, for example, a dispersion stabilizer, a precipitation inhibitor, a coloring agent, a lubricant, an antistatic agent, and the like.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In addition, when the luster adjusting resin layer has a decorative layer beneath it, the layer is generally made transparent (including semi-transparent or transparent with a color) so as to make the decorative layer visible. However an opaque layer (colored or un-colored) may be formed in some cases.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">With respect to the ionizing radiation curing resin composition, it is preferable to use the composition without a solvent since there is no need to dry or carry out post treatment for a solvent and it is free from a problem of remaining solvent. However for physical property adjustment, a solvent may be added.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> From the above viewpoint, it is preferable to suppress the amount of the solvent as much as possible and it is preferably 20 parts by mass or less, to 100 parts by mass of the resin component. The doctor streak improving effect in this embodiment can be more effective when the solvent content is so low as to be in the above range.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The luster adjusting resin layer is formed with the above mentioned ionizing radiation curing resin composition, preferably with a non-solvent composition, by using a doctor blade and a gravure plate. When the layer is formed partially or the layer is formed on the entire surface with thickness variation, gravure printing is employed. And the layer is formed on the entire surface with an even thickness, gravure coating is employed.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The thickness of the luster adjusting resin layer is not particularly limited and may be a proper thickness depending on the required physical properties such as surface strength and designs (coating impression, transparent feeling, and convex-concave surface designs). However, it is about 5 to 50 µm and generally about 10 to 30 µm. In the case of the luster adjusting resin layer using the ionizing radiation curing resin, it is advantageous that the thickness is easily made thicker, and from this viewpoint, the thickness is 10 µm or thicker. Further, with such a thick thickness, the doctor streak improving effect of this embodiment becomes more efficient.</p><heading id="h0009">[Base material]</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --><p id="p0060" num="0060">Next, as the base material 1, various base materials conventionally known as base materials for the decorative material may be used depending on uses without any particular limitation on shapes, material and other properties of the base materials.

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3C and Fig. 3D</figref>, it is formed as the convex patterns 2 at least a part of a non-printed part, preferably the entire surface, is covered with the ink of the printed part flowed from a printed part "c" to a non-printed part "d". The ink is flowed so that the printed part, which is convex to the non-printed part, will remain, and that the printedpart and the non-printedpart are not flattened and without height variation. No need to say, the ink of the cross-link curing resin is cross-linked and cured to be a cross-linked cured<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> material on the decorative sheet.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">In contrast to the convex-concave patterns 24 by simple relief printing as explained in the paragraph of Background Art, in the convex pattern 2 of the present invention, the lower layer beneath the convex pattern 2 (in the case of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3A</figref>, the decorative layer 3) is covered, even in the concave "b" in between convexes "a", by the ink flowed from the convex parts. The above-mentioned convex parts "a" are derived from the printed parts "c" and the concave parts "b" are derived from the non-printed parts "d". Therefore, to the printed parts "c" which are the parts where the ink is transferred from a printing plate, after the ink transfer, the ink in the printed parts "c" is fluidized and spread even to the non-printed parts "d" so that at least a part of the non-printed part is covered with the ink. However, if the entire surface including the printed parts and the non-printed parts becomes a flat surface and the convex-concave of the printing is eliminated by flowing the ink to the non-printed parts, the surface will merely be a coating film with an even thickness, being useless. Accordingly, the ink is flowed to the extent that the convex shapes of the printed parts will remain to form the convex pattern. Of course, although the convex shapes of the printed parts remain, the shape of the convex in the printed parts does not remain in the same cross sectional shape as immediately after printing. Since the ink covering the printed parts is decreased by the amount corresponding to the amount of the ink fluidized from the printed parts to the non-printed parts, the height of the convex shape in the printed parts is<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> lowered to that extent, and the hill shape of the convex part becomes less pronounced. However, the convex shape itself basically remains in the printed parts.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">In the convex pattern, the concave part deriving from the non-printed part is covered with the ink flowed from the printed parts. Concerning an extent of the coverage, it is acceptable that at least a part of the non-printed part is covered, since contamination resistance improving effect can be obtained correspondingly. No need to say, it is more preferable that a wider area is completely covered. It is most preferable that the entire surface of the non-printed part is completely covered.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">In terms of the apparent complete cover, after overprinting solid pattern twice for the entire surface (colors) by gravure printing of the same cross-link curing resin ink, there is a means of forming the convex pattern by printing a convex pattern, thereby constituting the part which is not covered with the same cross-link curing resin. However by such means, it requires increased number of processes and results in high cost. Accordingly, in terms of prevention of process increase and increasing the cost, it is preferable to form the convex patterns by (color) printing once to form a single layer with the convex pattern of the continuous convex parts and the concave parts.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">In such a manner, to flow the ink to the non-printed parts to the extent that the convex shape of the printed parts remains, it is preferable that the ink transfer amount to the printed parts (the height of the printed parts and the area ratio of them) and the ink fluidity (the viscosity and the thixotropic<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> property) are adjusted properly.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">If the ink transfer amount to the printed parts is made high, the non-printed parts are easily covered with the ink from the printed parts. The ink transfer amount may be adjusted by the plate depth in the case of gravure printing. If the ink transfer amount is adjusted to be 4 g/m<sup>2</sup> or more, on the basis of the dry coating amount, good results can easily obtained, although it depends on the conditions.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">On the other hand, if the viscosity is too high, the non-printed parts cannot be covered sufficiently with the ink from the printed parts, and on the contrary, if it is too low, the convex shape of the printed parts cannot be retained.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">Also, if the thixotropic property is extremely high, the ink is not at all or scarcely flowed to the non-printed parts from the printed parts. Accordingly, in this case, the non-printed parts cannot be covered with the ink from the printed parts sufficiently. On the other hand, if the thixotropic property is extremely low, the ink is smoothly flowed to the non-printed parts from the printed parts, and the surface is leveled to be flat or almost flat. Accordingly, in this case, a coating film with an even thickness for the entire surface is formed. Therefore, the thixotropic property of the ink is adjusted to be correct, neither too high nor too low. However, the degree of the preferable thixotropic property depends on the pattern shape (the thickness, the ink transfer amount, the width and the like) of the printed parts and the patterns in the non-printed parts. If the non-printed parts are wider, the<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> flow of the ink to the non-printed parts from the printed parts has to reach a wide range (long distance), and therefore, the thixotropic property is better to be low.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">However, since preferable viscosity and thixotropic property depend on the plan pattern shape and the height of the convex pattern to be formed, they cannot be generalized. For example, the preferable viscosity and thixotropic property will change depending on the desired convex-concave surface design impression, pattern shape of the convex patterns according to it, the surface delustering design impression required for the convex patterns themselves, existence and the adding amount of a delustering agent, ink-permeability of the lower layer of the convex patterns and its extent, and required scratch resistance and contamination resistance. Therefore, specifically, in consideration of these properties, the ink composition is assigned, and by observing the ink flow extent on the surface with a microscope, conditions leading to good contamination resistance may be found.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">Specific examples for viscosity and thixotropic property are given below. According to measurement by an E type rotary viscometer, (apparent) viscosity is about 500 to 1,000 mPa·s (rotation speed 50 rpm; temperature at 35°C). With respect to the thixotropic property, the thixotropic index value (TI value) is around 1.5. The thixotropic index value (TI value) is as the ratio of the viscosity at the rotation speed of 5 rpm to the viscosity at the rotation speed of 50 rpm. The viscosity measuring temperature corresponds to the actual temperature of<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> the ink at the time of printing, and the actual temperature at the time of printing maybe adjustedproperlyby cooling or heating. The temperature is not limited to the above temperature.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">The convex-concave pattern by conventional relief printing is formed concerning not to deteriorate the height of the convex part by maintaining the relief shape of the convex part, formed as the printed part, as far as possible. Therefore, in the case of the conventional relief printing, the thixotropic property is better to be as high as possible. On the other hand, the present invention is based on a different concept from that of the conventional relief printing. Unlike the conventional relief printing, ink is intentionally flowed in order to form the convex pattern. That is thoroughly out of the idea of conventional relief printing, and thus, the present pattern is accomplished based on the finding of advantageous effects in the field which are out of the conceptual range of the conventional relief printing.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">The viscosity and thixotropic property of the ink can be adjusted properly by: binder resin (cross-link curing resin) of the ink; inorganic fillers such as a fine powder silica as a thixotropic agent; inorganic fillers such as silica, alumina, kaolin, and calcium carbonate; organic fillers such as resin beads; use or not of a diluting solvent; their adding amounts; and the temperature at the time of ink printing (and until the ink is cured). It is also effective to add two types of fillers with different average particle diameter at the time of addition of the filler. Specifically: fine particle silica powder with<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> an average particle diameter of nm order is used in combination with a delustering silica powder with an average particle diameter around 5 to 20 µm; or a filler with a smaller average particle diameter is used in combination with a filler with a larger average particle diameter. Also, paying attention to the particle size distribution other than the average particle diameter, proper flow ability may be obtained.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">In plan view of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, a plan view shape of one example of the convex patterns 2 is shown. The convex pattern, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, is a pattern composed of a large number of winding lines. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> shows the patterns (printed parts are black parts) on a printing plate for forming the convex patterns by printing, and is a magnified drawing of an area of 5.25 cm length by 3.5 cm width (quadruple).</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">The plan view shape of the convex pattern is not particularly limited and may be formed depending on the uses. However, it is preferable to prevent a pattern, wherein the non-printed part is extremely wide as compared with the printed part that the printed parts are located in far apart to each other. That is because there is a limitation of the flow of the ink so that the non-printed parts may not be covered with the ink from the printed parts.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">The plan view shape of the convex patterns may be a regular shape in addition to the random shape as exemplified in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. For example, it may be corrugated shape, hair line shape and the like. The convex patterns in the plan view may be as lines, a continuous printed part which extends to the entire<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> surface of the decorative sheet or the decorative plate, in addition to a plurality of respectively independent parts with limited area as exemplified in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. They can be designed depending on the design expression.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">The random shape is preferable from a viewpoint that the strength unevenness of the scratch resistance due to the convex pattern is not imparted, and that visually uneven impression is given to the convex patterns to result in visually even impression.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">As described in the above, the convex pattern 2 is formed preferably by a printing method. As the printing method, for example, known printing methods such as gravure printing and screen printing, by which ink can be applied thickly, may be employedproperly. Above all,the gravure printingispreferable since a decorative sheet can easily and continuously be produced as a continuous belt-like product.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">The specific size of the convex patterns may depend on the required scratch resistance and the convex-concave design expression. Generally, the height of the convex patterns (the height difference of the highest summit of the convex part and the lowest bottom of the concave part) is about 5 to 50 µm and the distance between the summits of the neighboring convex parts with a concave part in between may be about 0.2 to 2 mm, to obtain good scratch resistance.</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">To cover the non-printed parts by flowed ink, it is preferable to adjust the area ratio of the printed parts and the non-printed parts, in addition to the adjustment of the<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> fluidity of the ink. To do so, the width (or the area) of the pattern of the drawing part (printed part) in the printing plate for forming the convex pattern by printing may be varied by adjusting printing plate manufacturing conditions. When the printed part is relatively narrow and pattern density is low, so that the non-printed part is difficult to be covered, the pattern density should be increased so as to make the non-printed parts easy to be covered.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">When the non-printed parts are covered with the flowed ink, the permeability of the ink in the printed surface may affect the flow in some cases. For example, when the base material is a penetrable base material such as paper and the ink-permeability of the printed surface is high, a part of the ink may be penetrated into the printed surface, resulting in insufficient flow of the ink to the non-printed parts. In such a case, to suppress the ink-permeability in the printed surface, it is effective to use impregnated paper with decreased penetrability by previous impregnation with resin. Alternatively, when penetrable paper is used as it is for the base material sheet, it is also effective to form a sealer layer by resin coating.</p><p id="p0105" num="0105">As the cross-link curing resin for forming the convex patterns 2, curing resins, such as ionizing radiation curing resin and thermosetting resin, which can be cured by cross-linking may be used. By forming the convex pattern using a cross-linked cured materials obtained by cross-linking and curing such curing resins gives excellent scratch resistance. Among them, the<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> ionizing radiation curing resin is preferable since the scratch resistance and contamination resistance can reliably be improved.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">As the specific ionizing radiation curing resin, compositions obtained by properly mixing prepolymers (including so-called oligomers) and/or monomers having radical polymerizable unsaturated bonds or cationic polymerizable functional groups in the molecules, which are able to cross-link andcurebyionizingradiation, arepreferablyused.

The aluminum hydroxide particles which are harder than the resin further improve the scratch resistance.</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">In the present invention, a delustering agent such as the delustering silica is added to adjust the luster, when the convex<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> pattern is formed by gravure printing using a doctor blade and a gravure plate, to suppress the doctor streak generation, and the resin further comprises either or bothofmagnesiumhydroxide or magnesium carbonate as the filler. It is also possible to use silica, whose surface is treated with a fatty acid based wax, as the delustering silica in combination with magnesium hydroxide and/or magnesium carbonate. Especially, it is more effective when the ionizing radiation curing resin is used for the cross-link curing resin, particularly in the case of using the resin without a solvent.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111">In addition to the addition of the delustering silica, by adding specific filler such as magnesium hydroxide, occurrence of the doctor streak at the time of gravure printing is improved, although the delustering silica is added.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">In this case, as the delustering silica, conventionally known silica for delustering may be used properly depending on the uses. The doctor streaks are less apparent if the delustering silica particle diameter is small. However the delustering effect is also decreased. On the other hand, the delustering effect is increased if the thickness of the luster adjusting resin layer is thinner, for even the same particle diameter. Accordingly, the particle diameter of the delustering silica may be selected properly in consideration of the required thickness of the convex patterns and the required delustering degree.</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">For example, when the thickness of the convex patterns is 10 to 15 µm, in order to obtain the delustering effect, it<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> is preferable to select delustering silica with an average particle diameter of 8 µm or larger. On the other hand, the maximum of the average particle diameter is about 15 µm, in consideration of the doctor streak formation and the delustering effect. Consequently, in general, the particle diameter of the delustering silica is preferably about 8 to 15 µm. If it is smaller than the above range, sufficient delustering effect is not obtained, and if it is larger than the range, doctor streaks are easily formed (even if magnesium hydroxide or the like is used in combination with the delustering silica, or the delustering silica whose surface is treated with fatty acid based wax is used).</p><p id="p0114" num="0114">The doctor streaks are less likely to be formed as the adding amount of the delustering silica is smaller. However the delustering effect is also deteriorated. Therefore, in general, the adding amount is about 5 to 20 parts by mass, more preferably 10 to 20 parts by mass, to 100 parts by mass of the resin component. If it is less than the above range, sufficient delustering effect cannot be obtained, and if it exceeds the range, doctor streaks are easily formed (even if magnesium hydroxide or the like is used in combination with the delustering silica, or the delustering silica whose surface is treated with fatty acid based wax is used).</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">Magnesium hydroxide to be added as the filler, in combination with the delustering silica, has a refractive index close to that of a resin, imparts the transparency to the resin layer of the convex patterns, and also, gives good doctor streak<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> improving effect among various fillers having soft hardness (Morse hardness 4 or 3 or lower) to the doctor blade. For example, doctor streak improving effect is also observed with the aluminum hydroxide having hardness similar to Morse hardness 3.

However, there is a characteristic that the contamination resistance of the resin layer itself of the convex pattern is deteriorated. Accordingly, when the contamination resistance of the convex pattern is required, magnesium hydroxide is more preferable. When the contamination resistance of the convex pattern is not so much required, magnesium carbonate may be used.</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">Although the particle shape of magnesium hydroxide (similar in the case of magnesium carbonate) subjected to evaluating tests was amorphous, and thus, the shape was not spherical as described above (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="JP11277685A"><text>11-277685</text></patcit>), the doctor streak improving effect was obtained.</p><p id="p0118" num="0118">The adding amount of specific filler such as magnesium hydroxide is properly adjusted depending on the ink physical property and the delustering degree.

If it is less than the above range, sufficient improving effect cannot be obtained, and if it exceeds the above range, the doctor streak improving effect is deteriorated. Additionally, the delustering effect of magnesium hydroxide or the like itself (as compared with the delustering silica) is low. If magnesium hydroxide is added in a high content so as to obtain the delustering effect by magnesium hydroxide alone without the delustering silica, for example 40 parts by mass of magnesium hydroxide is added, the doctor streaks are worsened adversely more than those in the case of using the delustering silica alone.</p><p id="p0119" num="0119">The particle diameter of the above magnesium hydroxide is preferably to be 10 µm or less as the average particle diameter, at maximum, in terms of the doctor streak improvement.</p><p id="p0120" num="0120">Also, by using the silica, whose surface is treated with a fatty acid based wax, as the delustering silica, the doctor streak generation suppression effect is improved although the delustering silica is added.
