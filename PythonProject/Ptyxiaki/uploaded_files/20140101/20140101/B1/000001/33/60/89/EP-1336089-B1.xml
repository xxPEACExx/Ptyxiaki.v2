mxw-id="PDES63957735" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an optical detection system.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">The accurate determination of chemical and biological parameters has always been of central importance in science. Recently, however, a real need for rapid, on-line measurements at low concentrations has developed within such fields as chemical production, DNA analysis, drug discovery, pharmaceutical screening, medical diagnostics and environmental analysis [1].</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In such fields, the analytes, whether small organic molecules or much larger biopolymers, are usually present as minor components. As a result, the discrimination of analytes from other components, which tend to interfere with the analyte detection, is usually the critical step in any analysis.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Chemical sensors have been developed which enable a direct analysis, transducing molecular information of a particular analyte into electronic information. Such sensors provide information in real time and at the exclusion of all other components. The analysis can be refined by incorporating a separation step prior to transduction, which separation lessens the selectivity requirements in detection and improves sensitivity.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Total (chemical) analysis systems (TASs) have been developed which provide all of the stages of a complete analysis in an integrated and automated manner. These stages include sampling, pre-treatment, chemical reactions, analytical separations, analyte detection, product isolation and data analysis. Such TASs have enabled enhancements in on-line analysis, but have a number of significant drawbacks. These include slow sample transport, high reagent consumption, and the need to fabricate interfaces between each of the system components.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">More recently, miniaturised total (chemical) analysis systems (µ-TASs) have been developed [2] which exhibit improved analytical performance by virtue of the reduced size. Typically, a µ-TAS is a microfabricated device which is fabricated using<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> conventional micromachining technologies, for example, photolithography, etching, thin-film deposition and bonding, where channels, reactors, filters, injectors and detectors are created on planar glass, silicon or polymeric substrates. Enhancements in performance have been shown experimentally and theoretically [3]. Notably, miniaturisation of flow manifolds leads to reduced reagent consumption, greater separation efficiencies and reduced analysis times.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In µ-TASs, for example, in capillary electrophoresis (CE) chips, injection volumes typically range between 10<sup>-14</sup> and 10<sup>-10</sup> dm<sup>3</sup>. At a diagnostically relevant target concentration of 1 nanomolar, these volumes include only from about 10 to 10<sup>4</sup> detectable molecules. High-sensitivity detection is thus a pre-requisite for performing microanalysis.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">To date, small volume detection in analytical systems has generally involved optical measurements. This is primarily because most planar chip devices are fabricated from glassy materials which are transparent in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The two most common techniques for optical detection are absorption and fluorescence.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Absorption techniques present a number of problems as the small volumes employed are not readily reconciled with the requirement for sufficiently long optical pathlengths. Solutions to the pathlength problem have been proposed [5-6]. However, any sensitivity gains are normally at the expense of component resolution, particularly when applied to detection in electrophoretic or chromatographic devices.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Fluorescence techniques have generally proved superior to absorption techniques. For example, laser-induced fluorescence measurements are capable of routinely detecting as few as 10<sup>5</sup> molecules, and recent developments in ultra-high sensitivity fluorescence detection have allowed single molecule detection on planar chip systems. However, whilst fluorescence techniques are inherently sensitive, these techniques suffer from a number of limitations in terms of cost, portability and applicability.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Alternative techniques have been developed which allow for the detection of non-fluorescent molecules. These techniques include electrochemiluminescence [7], indirect fluorescence [8], and electrochemical and refractive index variation techniques [1, 9]. In addition, capillary electrophoresis microchips have been successfully coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry (MS) [10].</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO0005166A"><text>WO 00/05166</text></patcit> discloses a micro-analysis system comprising a micro-tube, for example a microcuvette, formed on a silicon wafer, a light source (an LED or a LASER) and a detector. The micro-analysis system may comprise an array of microcuvettes.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Although these techniques separately provide for improvements in miniaturisation, cost and applicability, no single technique provides a miniaturised, high sensitivity detection system at low cost. A detection system possessing these characteristics, although not essential for laboratory-based analysis, is a pre-requisite for developing portable µ-TASs capable of high-sensitivity measurements in point-of-care and in-the-field applications. Typical applications include environmental monitoring, clinical and medical diagnostics, industrial process control and forensic analysis.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">It is thus an aim of the present invention to provide a microfabricated detection system which is of high sensitivity and has low detection limits.

Simple calculations as set out in the attached Appendix indicate that analyte concentrations of down to at least 10<sup>-8</sup> mol dm<sup>-3</sup> should be readily detectable, with lower detection limits being attainable with the use of low-noise techniques, such as phase-sensitive detection.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The detection system also advantageously enables detection simultaneously and independently at a large number of closely-spaced locations along a flow path. Such multi-point detection at points spaced at typically less than 500 µm provides the spatial resolution for particularly useful analysis. Such resolution is not possible using conventional detectors, such as photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), as the sheer physical size of those detectors renders those detectors unsuitable for on-plane detection.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Furthermore, the detection system advantageously requires only minuscule amounts of sample, is rapid in action, non-invasive, selective and highly efficient, and has a low unit cost. The present invention finds particular application in the general<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> clinical/biological fields by virtue of the ability to perform standard analyses in a superior fashion to conventional instrumentation, offering dramatically reduced analysis times and allowing rapid point-of-care diagnosis.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described hereinbelow by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:

Also, owing to the layer-by-layer fabrication of the light-emitting diodes 8a-j and the photocells 10a-j, the detection system can be integrated with existing microfabricated systems.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The operation of each of the light-emitting diodes 8a-j is such that, when a sufficiently high potential difference is applied thereacross, electrons and holes are injected from the respective ones of the anode and cathode layers 14, 16 and re-combine in the semiconductor layer 12 to form excitons, which excitons subsequently relax to the ground state with the emission of photons. The operation of each of the photocells 10a-j is essentially the converse of that of the light-emitting diodes 8a-j, where the absorption of photons by the semiconductor layer 12 creates excitons which subsequently dissociate to form unbound electrons and holes; with the separated charges drifting under the influence of the internal electric field towards the respective ones of the anode and cathode layers 14, 16 and to an external circuit.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0058" num="0058">In one configuration for fluorescent analysis, when a fluorescent analyte, such as a chromophore, passes through the channel 4, the fluorescent analyte absorbs photons emitted by the respective light-emitting diodes 8a-j and subsequently re-emits fluorescence photons, which fluorescence photons are detected by the respective photocells 10a-j.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In another configuration for phosphorescent analysis, when a phosphorescent analyte passes through the channel 4, the phosphorescent analyte absorbs photons emitted by the respective light-emitting diodes 8a-j and subsequently re-emits phosphorescence photons, which phosphorescence photons are detected by the respective photocells 10a-j.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">In a further configuration for absorption analysis, where a sufficiently large optical path length is provided between the light-emitting diodes 8a-j and the photocells 10a-j of each of the detectors 6a-j, when an absorptive analyte passes through the channel 4, the absorptive analyte absorps photons emitted by the respective light-emitting diodes 8a-j, which absorption is detected as a reduction in the transmission of photons from the respective light-emitting diodes 8a-j as detected by the respective photocells 10a-j.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In one mode of analysis, the analyte concentrations are measured at each of the detectors 6a-j simultaneously.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In another mode of analysis, a Shah Convolution Fourier Transform (SCOFT) detection is utilised [15]. In SCOFT, the emission intensities from moving analyte plugs are measured by the detectors 6a-j at uniformly spaced locations along the channel 4. Since, in most separation techniques, for example, capillary electrophoresis and highpressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), analyte plugs move at constant speed, the emission intensities at each detector 6a-j can be summed electronically to yield a time-dependent signal of fixed frequency. The frequency of the signal is determined uniquely by the mobility of the analyte and thus may be used as a means of analyte<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> identification. For multi-component systems, additional components will be present in the frequency domain, again at locations determined uniquely by the mobilities.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">In a further mode of analysis, the emission intensity is measured at each of the detectors 6a-j independently, and wavelet analysis, which ensures near-optimal localisation in real and reciprocal space [16], is employed to process the data. In this way, and unlike SCOFT detection, spatial information is preserved, increasing the information content and allowing the determination of variations in, for example, electrophoretic mobility with distance.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Finally, it will be understood that the present invention has been described in its preferred embodiment and can be modified in many different ways without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">In one modification, the light-emitting diodes 8a-j can each be included in a microcavity to provide excitation sources having improved spectral properties. Organic semiconductors, in particular semiconducting polymers, typically have broad emission properties, while, for the purposes of optical detection, a narrow excitation source is desirable. By including each of the light-emitting diodes 8a-j in a microcavity of appropriate optical pathlength, the excitation light from each of the light-emitting diodes 8a-j has enhanced mono-chromaticity. Such cavities may be fabricated by the alternate thermal deposition of materials with sharply differing refractive indices to form simple low-cost Bragg reflectors [14].</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">In another modification, where appropriate, notch filters can be provided directly in front of each of the photocells 10a-j selectively to filter out photons transmitted directly from the light-emitting diodes 8a-j, which excitation photons would otherwise mask the less-intense fluorescence or phosphorescence photons.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">In a further modification, phase-sensitive lock-in techniques can be employed to discriminate between excitation photons transmitted directly from the light-emitting<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> diodes 8a-j and the less-intense emission photons from a phosphorescent analyte. With this configuration, the use of filters, for example, notch filters, is optional.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">In a yet further modification, each of the detectors 6a-j includes a plurality, in this embodiment three, of adjacent photocells 10a-j having semiconductor layers 12 formed of materials with well-separated absorption spectra. The differential response of the plurality of photocells 10a-j allows a 'colour', or, more accurately, a two-dimensional co-ordinate in colour space (as defined by the Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage [17]), to be assigned to the emitting analyte, providing a simple and effective means of identification. This planar detection arrangement can be contrasted with conventional optical spectrometers, where a diffraction/reflection grating or prism is normally used to disperse the light which would then be scanned over a fixed point-detector or imaged onto an array of detectors to extract spectral information.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">In a still further modification, the light-emitting diodes 8a-j with appropriate heat sinking are operated under relatively low duty-cycle pulsed operation, which pulsed operation allows the development of high instantaneous brightnesses, typically brightnesses of the order of 10<sup>7</sup> cd/m<sup>2</sup> [18]. The high instantaneous changes in the photoluminescence, together with the use of low-noise phase-sensitive detection techniques, for example, lock-in amplification, enable optical detection at particularly low concentrations. In a preferred embodiment the light-emitting diodes 8a-j are driven by a square-wave voltage source. In this regard, it is expected that the enclosure of the light-emitting diodes 8a-j in microcavities, together with the use of pulsed driving voltages, will provide for the fabrication of microarrays of closely-spaced laser diodes.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><heading id="h0001"><b>References</b></heading><p id="p0070" num="0070"><ul><li>1. <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>S.
