load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0002">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a system for charging a battery provided in a biped walking robot.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Related Art .</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">As a system for charging a battery provided in a mobile body, there has been proposed a charging system (refer to, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2001341085A"><text>2001-341085</text></patcit>) for charging a battery of an unmanned carrier vehicle. According to the battery charging system, an unmanned carrier vehicle that runs by detecting a guideline laid along a track is moved to a place where an external power unit is installed. Then, a power receiving coupler provided in the unmanned carrier vehicle is connected to a power feeding coupler provided in the external power unit, thereby supplying power to the unmanned carrier vehicle through a power feeding coupler and a power receiving coupler to charge the battery of the unmanned carrier vehicle.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Further, as a system for charging a mobile robot provided with an imaging device to perform autonomic walking on the basis of imaging data, there has been proposed a charging system (refer to, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2001125641A"><text>2001-125641</text></patcit>)<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> for charging a battery at a charging station. According to the charging system, a charging station for charging a battery is installed, and when the battery charge amount of a mobile robot decreases to a predetermined level or less, the mobile robot recognizes the position of the charging station on the basis of imaging data and moves to the charging station so as to charge the battery at the charging station.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As described above, when charging an unmanned carrier vehicle, turning off the power of the unmanned carrier vehicle presents no problem, because the unmanned carrier vehicle is maintained in a stationary state. In the case of a biped walking robot, however, if its power is turned off, then the position retaining operations of the motors of joints are disabled, making it difficult to maintain a standing posture thereof. Furthermore, a biped walking robot is frequently used in a human activity area, so that it is preferred that no spark discharge or noises occur when connecting or disconnecting a power receiving connector and a power feeding connector when charging is carried out.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a charging system capable of charging a battery of a biped walking robot while stabilizing the posture of the biped walking robot and restraining the occurrence of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> spark discharge or noises.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">To this end, according to the present invention, there is provided a charging system for charging a battery installed on a biped walking robot, including a seating and retaining device on which the biped walking robot can sit and which retains the biped walking robot at a seated posture, a power feeding connector to be connected to a power receiving connector provided in the biped walking robot when the biped walking robot sits on the seating and retaining device, a connection detector for detecting whether the power receiving connector and the power feeding connector are in a connected state, a charging power source for supplying charging current to the battery, and a charging controller for charging the battery by supplying charging current to the battery from the charging power source through the power feeding connector and the power receiving connector when the connection detector detects that the power receiving connector and the power feeding connector are in the connected state.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Such a charging system is already known from document <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2001179663B"><text>JP 2001179663</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">With this arrangement, when the biped walking robot sits onto the seating and retaining device, the power receiving connector of the biped walking robot is connected to the power feeding connector and the biped walking robot is maintained at a seated posture. This makes it possible to quickly charge the biped walking robot in a state wherein the power of the biped walking robot is turned off or the power supply to a joint motor<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> is interrupted to reduce power consumption. The charging controller supplies charging current to the battery from the charging power source when the connection detector detects that the power receiving connector of the biped walking robot and the power feeding connector are in the connected state. Hence, it is possible to restrain the supply of charging current from the charging power source from being begun before the connection between the power receiving connector and the power feeding connector is completed, thereby restraining spark discharge or noises from occurring at the contact between the power feeding connector and the power receiving connector. Thus, it is possible to prevent people nearby from feeling insecure or equipment nearby from malfunctioning due to noises.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the invention, the power feeding connector comprises a first charging terminal for outputting charging current and the power receiving connector includes a second charging terminal that is brought into conduction with the first charging terminal and the power feeding connector comprises a first detecting terminal for detecting whether the power receiving connector and the power feeding connector are in the connected state and the power receiving connector comprises a second detecting terminal that is brought into conduction with the first detecting terminal when the power receiving connector is connected with the power feeding connector.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> The connection detector detects that the power feeding connector and the power receiving connector are in the connected state when the first detecting terminal and the second detecting terminal are brought into conduction.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">This enables the connection detector to detect that the power feeding connector and the power receiving connector are in the connected state when the first charging terminal and the second charging terminal are securely in conduction by detecting that the power feeding connector and the power receiving connector are in the connected state when the first detecting terminal and the second detecting terminal are in conduction.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the course of the power feeding connector and the power receiving connector shifting from a connected state to a disconnected state, the first detecting terminal and the second detecting terminal are changed over to a non-conduction<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> state, and then the first charging terminal and the second charging terminal are changed over to the non-conduction state. The charging system further includes a capacitor connected across output terminals of the charging power source, and a discharger for discharging charges from the capacitor, wherein, when the state detected by the connection detecting means is switched from the state wherein the power feeding connector and the power receiving connector are in connection to a state wherein the power feeding connector and the power receiving connector are not in connection, the charging controller stops output of charging current by the charging power source and discharges the charges from the capacitor by the discharger.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to this arrangement, the first charging terminal and the second charging terminal are still in conduction at the point when the state in which the connection detector detects that the power feeding connector and the power receiving connector are in connection is switched to the state wherein the connection detector does not detect that the power feeding connector and the power receiving connector are in connection. Hence, stopping the charging current output by the charging power source and discharging the charges from the capacitor by the discharger at this point makes it possible to reduce the charges of the capacitor before the first charging terminal and the second charging terminal<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> are switched from the conduction state to the non-conduction state. This in turn makes it possible to restrain the occurrence of spark discharge or noises caused by sudden cutoff of charging current of the charges of the capacitor when the first charging terminal and the second charging terminal are switched from the conduction state to the non-conduction state.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Preferably, the power receiving connector has, at its front, a shutter that closes an opening of the power receiving connector in a state wherein the power receiving connector has been disconnected from the power feeding connector, while the shutter is released to expose the opening as the power feeding connector comes in contact with the power receiving connector when fitted to the power feeding connector.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">With this arrangement, when the power receiving connector has been disengaged from the power feeding connector, the opening of the power receiving connector is closed by the shutter. This allows the power receiving connector to be always protected except when charging the biped walking robot.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Preferably, the power receiving connector has a tapered recession whose inclined surfaces gradually approach each other toward a terminal from the opening, and the power feeding connector has a projection shaped to match the tapered shape of the power receiving connector.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">With this arrangement, inserting the projection of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the power feeding connector into the recession of the power receiving connector causes the power receiving connector to move toward the power feeding connector, the inner peripheral surface of the recession of the power receiving connector being guided to the outer peripheral surface of the projection of the power feeding connector. This permits easy positioning of the power receiving connector and the power feeding connector when connecting these two connectors.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Preferably, the first charging terminal and the first detecting terminal are pin-type terminals provided in parallel to each other, the second charging terminal is a socket-type terminal into which the first charging terminal is inserted when the power receiving connector and the power feeding connector are connected, the second detecting terminal is a socket-type terminal into which the first detecting terminal is inserted when the power receiving connector and the power feeding connector are connected, and the length of insertion of the first charging terminal into the second charging terminal is set to be greater than the length of insertion of the first detecting terminal into the second detecting terminal when the power receiving connector and the power feeding connector are connected.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">With this arrangement, the length of insertion of the first charging terminal into the second charging terminal is set to be greater than the length of insertion of the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> first detecting terminal into the second detecting terminal when the power receiving connector and the power feeding connector are connected. Hence, when the power receiving connector is connected to the power feeding connector, the first charging terminal of the power feeding connector is first inserted into the second charging terminal of the power receiving connector, and then the first detecting terminal of the power feeding connector is inserted into the second detecting terminal of the power receiving connector. This makes it possible to achieve a configuration that brings the first charging terminal and the second charging terminal into conduction, and then brings the first detecting terminal and the second detecting terminal into conduction in the process of the power feeding connector and the power receiving connector shifting from a disconnected state to a connected state.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Similarly, when the power receiving connector is detached from the power feeding connector, the second detecting terminal of the power receiving connector is first disengaged from the first detecting terminal of the power feeding connector, and then the second charging terminal of the power receiving connector is disengaged from the first charging terminal of the power feeding connector. This makes it possible to achieve a configuration in which the first detecting terminal and the second detecting terminal are brought into a non-conduction<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> state, and then the first charging terminal and the second charging terminal are brought into the non-conduction state in the process of the power feeding connector and the power receiving connector shifting from a connected state to a disconnected state.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0020" num="0020"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1A and 1B</figref> are explanatory diagrams showing how charging is performed by a charging system of a biped walking robot in accordance with the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2A, 2B and 2C</figref> are configuration diagrams showing a power receiving connector provided in the biped walking robot and a power feeding connector provided in a charger;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3A, 3B and 3C</figref> are configuration diagrams showing a terminal assembly of the power receiving connector provided in the biped walking robot and a terminal assembly of the power feeding connector provided in the charger;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a circuit configuration diagram of a charging unit provided in the charger;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> is a timing chart of a connection detector provided in the charging unit;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> is a flowchart of the processing for starting charging; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> is a flowchart of the processing for ending the charging.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><heading id="h0006">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">An embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">Fig. 1 through Fig. 7</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1A and 1B</figref> are explanatory diagrams showing how charging is performed by a charging system of a biped walking robot in accordance with the present invention, <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2A, 2B and 2C</figref> are configuration diagrams showing a power receiving connector provided in the biped walking robot and a power feeding connector provided in a charger, <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3A, 3B and 3C</figref> are configuration diagrams showing a terminal assembly of the power receiving connector provided in the biped walking robot and a terminal assembly of the power feeding connector provided in the charger, <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a circuit configuration diagram of a charging unit provided in the charger, <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> is a timing chart of a connection detector provided in the charging unit, <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> is a flowchart of the processing for starting charging, and <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> is a flowchart of the processing for ending the charging.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref>, the charging system of a biped walking robot is adapted to charge a battery 11 provided in a biped walking robot 10 by a charger 1. The charger 1 is shaped like a chair, and has a seating and retaining unit 2 that holds the thighs and the back of the body of the biped walking robot 10 so as to maintain the biped walking robot 10 at a seated posture when the biped walking robot 2 sits down thereon, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1B</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> The charger 1 includes a power feeding connector 3 that fits to a power receiving connector 12 provided in the biped walking robot 10 and a charging unit 4 that supplies charging current to the biped walking robot 10 through the intermediary of the power feeding connector 3 and the power receiving connector 12.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Thus, charging the battery 11 by holding the biped walking robot 10 at the seated posture obviates the need for continuing power feed to a joint motor between a body 13 and a thigh 14, a joint motor between a thigh 14 and a crus 15, and a joint motor between the crus 15 and a foot 16 in order to maintain the posture. Hence, the battery 11 can be promptly charged while interrupting the power supplied to the above joint motors.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The biped walking robot 10 has a visual sensor (not shown) and recognizes the distance to the position of the charger 1 from imaging data obtained by the visual sensor when charging of the battery 11 has become necessary. Then, the biped walking robot 10 calculates the number of steps required to move to the position of the charger 1, and starts walking toward the charger 1. Thereafter, the biped walking robot 10 stops once immediately before the charger 1 and gives a half turn before it sits onto the seating and retaining unit 2.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref>, a recession 20 of the power receiving connector 12 provided in the biped walking robot 10 has a tapered configuration 24 whose side surfaces<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> gradually approach to each other as they extends from an opening 21 toward a terminal assembly 23 with a terminal 22 disposed thereon. Shutters 25a and 25b for closing the opening 21 are provided at the front of the opening 21. Meanwhile, the power feeding connector 3 provided in the charger 1 has a terminal 30 which is to be inserted into the terminal 22 of the power receiving connector 12 and which has a projection 31 having its shape matched to the tapered configuration 24 of the recession 20 of the power receiving connector 12.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The shutters 25a and 25b close the opening 21 to block dust when the power receiving connector 12 and the power feeding connector 3 are in a disengaged state, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref>. If the power receiving connector 12 comes in contact with the power feeding connector 3 when the biped walking robot 10 sits onto the charger 1, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2B</figref>, then the shutters 25a and 25b open toward the recession 20 to allow the power feeding connector 3 to be inserted into the recession 20.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2C</figref>, the terminal 30 of the power feeding connector 3 is inserted into the terminal 22 of the power receiving connector 12 to complete the engagement between the power feeding connector 3 and the power receiving connector 12. In this case, as the power feeding connector 3 is inserted into the power receiving connector 12, the side surfaces of the projection 31 of the power feeding connector 3 are guided by the tapered<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> configuration 24 of the inner peripheral wall of the recession 20 of the power receiving connector 12, permitting easy positioning of the terminals of the power feeding connector 3 and the power receiving connector 12, respectively.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3A</figref>, the power receiving connector 12 has ten socket-type terminals 22a to 22j, and the power feeding connector 3 has ten pin-type terminals 30a to 30j keyed to the above socket-type terminals 22a to 22j. The charging terminals 30a and 30j of the power feeding connector 3 for supplying charging current are formed to be longer than signal terminals 30b to 30i for transmitting signals.
