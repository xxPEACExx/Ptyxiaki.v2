id="h0001">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Chromatography involves physically separating constituents of a sample in a carrier fluid and measuring the separation. In gas chromatography (GC) the carrier is a gas or at least a supercritical fluid which acts similarly in the system. In liquid chromatography (LC) the carrier is a liquid. In either case a pulse of the sample is injected into a steady flow of the carrier, and the constituents are adsorbed or absorbed and desorbed by a stationary phase material in a column. At the end of the column the individual components are more or less separated in time. Monitoring the column effluent with a suitable detector provides a pattern of retention times which, by calibration or comparison with known samples, indicates the constituents of the sample qualitatively and quantitatively. The main components of such a system are the column, an injector with a mixing chamber for introducing the sample into the carrier, a detector at the outlet end of the column, fluid controls, and a computer for processing and displaying the output of the detector. The display is generally in the form of retention times. In GC an oven generally is used to elevate temperature to maintain the sample in a volatile state, and to improve the discrimination of constituents.

An operator selects operating parameters, such as temperature and pressure, or may vary these parameters during a run, according to judgment. Thus uses of these systems for evaluating samples is dependent on the skills of the operators, and it has been difficult to compare results of different systems, columns and operators.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">When a chromatographic method is developed it is often desirable to transfer it to the same system at a later time, the same system with a different column, or another system. The task is made more complicated by other factors including different calibrations of temperatures and pressures, and different oven geometries resulting in different temperature gradients. Differing characteristics of columns include length, internal diameter, phase thickness and phase chemistry, and these characteristics are difficult to determine with precision without destroying the column. These variations in systems, particularly columns, cause the retention times to change for different systems and the same system at different times, even switching the order of some peaks.

Each system includes carrier means for passing a fluid carrier through the column, injection means for injecting a pulse of sample into the carrier to effect a mixture passing through the column subject to characteristic retention times for constituents of the sample, detector means receptive of the mixture for effecting signals representative of the retention times, and processing means receptive of the signals for presenting corresponding retention indicators. Each system has system parameters and operating parameters, the operating parameters comprising a first parameter having selectable first programming and a second parameter having selectable second programming, each programming being with respect to time. The retention times are related to the system parameters and the operating parameters by a mathematical function having function parameters including thermodynamic constants associated with interactions of the constituents with the column.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In preferred embodiments, the system is a gas chromatographic system with a gas carrier, the first parameter is column temperature and the second parameter is inlet pressure of the carrier to the column. Also, preferably, the retention indicators are retention times, and the system parameters include column dimensions.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The primary system is operated with a standard sample, a selected primary second program (e.g. pressure) for the second parameter, and a plurality of selected primary first programs (e.g.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> temperature) for the first parameter, so as to generate corresponding primary retention indicators (e.g. times). The primary retention indicators and the first programs are fitted to the function, with the second program, so as to determine thermodynamic constants whereby the function is representative of a virtual chromatographic system. The thermodynamic constants are stored for future application with the target chromatographic system.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A target chromatographic system is initially operated with the standard sample, substantially the primary second program, and a plurality of secondary first programs, so as to generate corresponding secondary retention indicators. Effective system parameters (e.g. column dimensions) are established for the target chromatographic system, by assumption, earlier measurement or a technique according to an aspect of the invention (explained below). A secondary second program then is determined for which, with the effective system parameters, the function yields substantially the primary retention indicators for the primary first programs.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In an actual operation, the target chromatographic system is operated with a application sample, the secondary second program and a selected first program, so as to generate at least one corresponding test retention indicator. By use of such secondary program, each test retention indicator is standardized to the virtual chromatographic system.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The function relating retention times to the parameters such as temperature and pressure are based preferably on theoretical relationships of a chromatographic system. As such a function generally is complex, special techniques may be required for its application, particularly in the determination of an effective column dimension and a secondary second (pressure) program. In an aspect of the invention, a method and a means are provided for determining values for one or more specified parameters for a chromatographic system. There are system parameters (e.g. column dimensions) and operating parameters (e.g. temperature and<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> pressure) related to retention times by a mathematical function having function parameters including these parameters as well as others such as thermodynamic constants related to interactions of the sample with a stationary phase in the column. The function parameters have predetermined or assumed values except for the specified parameters. A specified parameter may be column inlet pressure, or column length.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The system (e.g. target system) is operated so as to generate retention indicators. An initial data base is provided, defining ranges of potential values of the specified parameter or parameters. Theoretical retention indicators are computed with the function for the potential values and the predetermined or assumed values, differences are computed between the theoretical retention indicators and the secondary retention indicators, and the differences are searched for a minimum therein, such that the minimum establishes an effective value for each specified parameter.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In another aspect a method and a means are provided to determine column temperature of the target chromatographic system relative to that of the primary chromatographic system. A temperature standard is provided comprising a calibration compound having temperature dependent retention time, and a plurality of homolog standards having a homolog relationship between corresponding retention indicators and retention times. The primary chromatographic system is operated with the temperature standard, a selected primary pressure program and a plurality of selected calibration temperatures so as to generate a primary set of retention times for each calibration temperature, each primary set comprising homolog retention times for the homolog standards and a compound retention time for the calibration compound. The homolog relationship and the primary set of retention times are first utilized for each calibration temperature to determine calibration constants for a temperature relationship relating retention indicator for the calibration compound to column temperature for the primary system. The target chromatographic system is operated with the temperature standard and a measured<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> column temperature so as to generate a test set of retention times, the test set comprising test retention times for the homolog standards, and a test retention time for the calibration compound. The homolog relationship and the test set of retention times are secondly utilized to determine a secondary retention indicator for the calibration compound. The temperature relationship is applied with the calibration constants and the secondary retention indicator to determine a calibrated temperature corresponding to the measured temperature.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In a further aspect a method and a means are provided for validating a target gas chromatographic system having a calibrated temperature relationship between its column temperature and the column temperature for a primary gas chromatographic system. A validation standard is provided comprising selected validation constituents and a plurality of homolog standards having a homolog relationship between corresponding retention indicators and retention times. The primary chromatographic system is operated with the validation standard, a selected primary pressure program, and a primary validation temperature for the column, so as to generate primary validation retention times for the validation constituents and homolog retention times for the homolog standards. The target chromatographic system is operated with the validation standard, substantially the primary pressure program, and the measured column temperature so as to generate secondary validation retention times for the validation constituents and test retention times for the homolog standards. The homolog retention times are utilized to determine primary homolog parameters for the homolog relationship, and the test retention times are utilized to determine secondary homolog parameters for the homolog relationship. The homolog relationship, the primary homolog parameters and the primary validation retention times are utilized to effect preliminary retention indicators. The homolog relationship, the secondary homolog parameters and the secondary validation retention times are utilized to effect secondary validation retention indicators. The preliminary retention indicators are adjusted with the temperature relationship to a<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> calibrated temperature corresponding to the secondary validation temperature so as to effect primary validation retention indicators. Differences between corresponding primary validation retention indicators and secondary validation retention indicators are calculated, and it is determined whether the differences are less than a predetermined limit corresponding to whether the target chromatographic system is valid.</p><heading id="h0003">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIG. 1</b></figref> is a schematic drawing of a chromatographic system incorporating the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIG. 2</b></figref> is a longitudinal section of a portion of a chromatographic column used in the system of <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIG. 1</b></figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003"><b>FIG. 3A</b></figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004"><b>FIG. 3B</b></figref> are a flow chart of a method and a means for carrying out an embodiment of the invention for standardization of a system of <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIG. 1</b></figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIG. 4</b></figref> is an illustration of a series of peaks representing chromatographic retention times of constituents such as from a sample utilized with the system of <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIG. 1</b></figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005"><b>FIG. 5</b></figref> is a flow chart of a method and a means for applying a function in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004"><b>FIG. 3</b></figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006"><b>FIG. 6</b></figref> is a flow chart of an additional method and an additional means for applying the function in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004"><b>FIG. 3</b></figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007"><b>FIG. 7</b></figref> is a flow chart of a method and a means for calibrating temperature of the column of the system of <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIG. 1</b></figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008"><b>FIG. 8</b></figref> is a flow chart of a method and a means for validating the system of <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIG. 1</b></figref>.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><heading id="h0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">The invention is utilized in an otherwise conventional or other desired gas chromatographic (GC) system such as described in the aforementioned <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US5545252A"><text>U.S. patent No. 5,545,252 ("Hinshaw 1</text></patcit>") and <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US734689A"><text>U.S. patent application serial No. 08/734,689 ("Hinshaw 2"</text></patcit>), each being of the present assignee and incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.

In the column <b>18</b> (<figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIG. 2</b></figref>) a stationary phase of a suitable substance on the tube wall adsorbs from the carrier gas <b>21</b> and then desorbs the chemical constituents of the sample.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Different constituents have different affinities for the stationary phase and thereby exit the column at different characteristic times, known as retention times, associated with different times for retention in the stationary phase. The velocity of the carrier gas ("mobile phase") contributes to the total retention time; the term "retention time" means the total time from injector to detector in the stationary and mobile phases. A detector <b>26</b> at the column outlet measures a physical property of the carrier and mixture, the magnitude of the property changing with each constituent passing through. Various types of detectors are used, such as hot wire, flame ionization, electron capture, thermionic and flame photometric.

A conventional simplex search program determines the average of the residuals for two proximate points that define a short line. The program flips the line over one of the points, redetermines the average and whether it has reduced; if not the line is flipped over to the other way. The procedure is repeated in search of lower residuals <b>129</b>. An advantageous modification to the simplex search shortens the point separations by a preset factor when the residual average is reduced, or lengthens the separations by such a factor when a residual average increases, for example by a factor of two in each case.

If the number of simplex cycles exceeds a limit <b>134</b> such as 500 cycles, a problem is assumed to exist and the program is terminated <b>136</b>.

In the case of pressure or some other parameters, there may be several minima from which the coarse search serves to select a lowest minimum before the simplex search.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In the case of a pressure program with ramping, the procedures are effected with a matrix of parameters associated with the program such as ramp rate and initial and final pressures (thus a 3-dimensional matrix). More broadly, the matrix has as many axes as variables being considered, e.g. one, two, three or more. Residuals are computed for all of the compatible combinations in the matrix. For the coarse search, the residuals are searched by computer program to find the low in the same manner as described above. For a simplex search with a two-axis matrix, three proximate points are used in place of two for the averaging of residuals, and a triangle is visualized in place of the short connecting line. In the search the triangle is flipped over one of its sides for recomputation of an average. For a three-axis matrix, a pyramid is visualized with similar flips over an edge.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">The plotting and searching technique may be used for broader purposes, for example for an operator of a chromatographic system to optimize selected operating parameters without necessarily being for the forgoing standardization to a virtual system. In the broader case, the system has operating parameters including selected parameters for optimization and remaining parameters, and operation of the chromatographic system is represented by a mathematical function having function parameters including the operating parameters. The primary chromatographic system is operated with a sample and selected values for the operating parameters so as to generate corresponding measured retention indicators. A data set or matrix is provided comprising potential values of the selected operating parameters over predetermined ranges of such parameters in predetermined increments, the data set representing combinations of such<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> parameters. Theoretical retention indicators are computed with the function for the combinations of such parameters and for the remaining parameters which are known or assumed for the purpose of the computation. Differences (residuals) between the measured retention indicators and the theoretical retention indicators are computed. The residuals are searched for a minimum in the differences, such that the minimum establishes optimized selected parameters. The system then is operated with the optimized parameters.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">It may be desirable for a plot of the retention times (actual and simulated) at each stage to be displayed on the monitor for operator viewing.
