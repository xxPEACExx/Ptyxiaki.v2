mxw-id="PDES63957710" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of magnetics, in particular to the use of magnetic force to attach one object to another whilst allowing movement of the objects relative to one another in a magnetically attached state.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">There are numerous situations and applications where it is desirable and/or necessary to secure or support one object to or on another object whilst allowing for freedom of translational or rotational movement of these objects relative to one another.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the field of material handling, for example, roller conveyors are used to transport sheet metal and other ferromagnetic work pieces from one location to another. Gravity forces are relied upon to ensure the work pieces remain on the conveyor rollers (some of which may be driven and others being idle rollers) as these are transported, and thus such conveyor systems will mostly have roller transport paths extending substantially in a common horizontal plane, unless additional, dedicated hold-down structures are employed in restraining the work pieces from lifting-off from where rollers are deployed along inclined travel path sections.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In overhead conveying applications in enclosed surroundings, eg large ware houses, it is known to install overhead rails to which are secured wheeled carriages from which in turn may be suspended crane head structures, grippers and similar attachment devices. Gravity force is relied upon to hold the grooved carriage wheels in engagement with and on top of the overhead guide rails, and side brackets provide additional security against lateral dislodgement from the rails.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the field of high-rise building construction, it is known to provide vertically extending rails which provide guidance for working platforms which are suspended for vertical movement from the top of the building in order to carry out maintenance work, such as window cleaning, etc. The platforms incorporate gripper mechanisms which form-fittingly engage over the rails to restrain horizontal movement (eg swaying) whilst held vertically movable along the rail.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the field of robotics, in particular such using remote controlled vehicles, it is known to incorporate into autonomous, wheeled platform or self-tracked vehicles, a multitude of different type of tools and implements by way of which specific tasks may be carried out remotely by an operator. For example, gripperarms can be deployed from such vehicles to recover samples in difficult to access or hostile environments. Whilst friction enhancing wheel and track coatings may be used to increase adherence of the vehicle to the surface in order to allow the vehicle to climb or descend along steep inclines, there are limits to the steepness of the travel path which such vehicle may safely master without tipping over or sliding in uncontrolled manner.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention was conceived having regard to applications such as those listed above, and in particular to one or more application environments where (a) ferromagnetic materials require conveying or transporting, (b) the incorporation of or presence of ferromagnetic structures would allow the use of magnets as a source of force to secure objects to one another in displaceable manner, (c) gravitational forces are absent to provide for force-locking engagement of a movable object onto a dedicated ferromagnetic material substrate or support surface, or (d) indeed the presence of gravitational forces would necessitate the erection of or provision of specialised support, guide or other retention structures or measures to enable a vehicle, either self-propelled or otherwise, to move along steeply inclined, vertical, and even inclined or horizontal overhanging (eg ceiling) surfaces having ferromagnetic properties. However, the below disclosed invention and its underlying principles may find broader applications, also replacing existing solutions currently not employing magnetic force to achieve object coupling.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In using particular permanent magnets to secure objects to one another, it is known that the magnetic attraction force is a function of the type and amount of active magnetic material employed, the geometry of the magnet's working face, air or other magnetic leakage paths in the magnetic flux circuit encompassing the active magnetic material and the body being subjected to the magnetic attraction force, the ferromagnetic material properties of the attracted body (ie its relative permeability and magnetic saturation limits), and the orientation of the Normal force vector between attracted objects relative to the gravity force vector. The<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> displacement force required will then be a function of the effective attraction force and the coefficient of friction defined between the surfaces of objects.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In other terms, the physical and geometrical factors, as well as the functional energetic elements of the closed (or loaded) magnetic circuit created between a first object (eg an object carrying a permanent magnet) and a second object (eg ferromagnetic sheet) will determine ultimately how strongly the objects are attracted to one another, and whether these objects can be displaced relative to one another whilst remaining attached to one another.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The stronger planar surfaces of objects are 'forced' together by a magnetic attraction force, the more difficult it is to displace them relative to one another whilst remaining attached to one another, by exerting a force perpendicular to the attracting force vector, for any given coefficient of friction which applies for the pairing of materials of the two objects. It is also recognised that magnetically attractive surfaces can have very large friction coefficients, and this knowledge has found expression in a wide range of technical solutions, such as magnetic clamps, magnetic lifters, magnetic chucks, etc, where ferromagnetic objects are to be firmly secured against displacement (assuming normal operational condition) at a suporting structure that incorporates magnetic active materials.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In seeking to enable magnetically coupled objects to move more easily relative to one another, so called magnetic wheels have been devised for selected industrial applications, eg self-propelled welding and inspection robots.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In its simplest incarnation, a magnetic wheel may be comprised of a solid disc of permanent magnetic material, eg a disc-shaped Neodymium-iron-Boron magnet, magnetised such that opposite axial end faces of the magnet have different polarity (here termed axially magnetised). One such disc each can be secured on opposite terminal ends of a non-magnetisable axle member, which in turn can be mounted to a vehicle chassis or frame, whereby the discs may engage with their peripheral surface on a magnetically attractive substrate surface and roll on such surface in a magnetically attached state, compare for example <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6886651B"><text>US patent 6,886,651 (Slocum et al.</text></patcit>), column 12, lines 44 following. Each disc (or wheel) will generate an at least partially closed loop magnetic field extending into the substrate on which it rests, creating a strong attractive force between the disc and substrate.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Slocum also discloses a somewhat more elaborate yet simple magnetic wheel consisting of a disc-shaped, axially magnetised magnetic core element sandwiched between two magnetically attractive disc members (made of soft steel, permalloy or laminated structures comprising such magnetisable but otherwise magnetically passive materials) having a diameter that is somewhat larger than the magnet core so that only the disc members can come with their peripheral surfaces into contact with the magnetically attractive surface on which the wheel is to magnetically engage. The disc members thus represent pole extension pieces which concentrate the magnetic flux originating in the magnetic core element and provide a low reluctance path for such flux, thus improving the attractive force between each wheel unit and magnetically attractive support surface as compared to the wheel embodiment without pole extension discs.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Slocum's magnetic wheels are incorporated into self-propelled carriages that form part of a material transportation system wherein such carriages can travel along magnetically attractive surfaces that may include a ceiling, vertical and inclined walls.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5809099A"><text>US Patent 5,809,099</text></patcit> discloses a laser-guided underwater wall climbing robot for use in inspecting reactor pressure vessels, which robot includes a self-propelled vehicle supperstructure that incorporates four magnetic wheels used to provide the necessary attraction force to allow the vehicle to travel along the ferromagnetic inner surface of the reactor vessel. Each wheel consists of a ring-shaped permanent magnet supported on a non-magnetic axle shaft for rotation therewith, two steel discs of slightly larger diameter than the magnet being magnetically attached and secured to the opposite axial faces of the ring-magnet, ie the discs provide magnetised pole extension pieces as well as the peripheral engagement surface of the wheel unit, similar to the Slocum wheel described above.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5853655A"><text>US Patent 5,853,655</text></patcit> discribes a magnetic wheel guided carriage for automated welding and cutting of ferromagnetic substrates such as pipes, steel plates, wherein the magnetic wheels consist of a plurality (eg three) of axially magnetised ring-shaped magnets sandwiched between interleaving ring-shaped mild steel discs (eg five) of a diameter that is larger than that of the magnets. The stacked discs are mounted and secured against rotation on a stainless steel<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> sleeve which in turn will be received on an axle of the carriage. Again, each wheel unit has a plurality of N- and S-poles whose magnetic field extends into the ferromagnetic substrate thereby creating at each wheel a closed magnetic flux path securing the wheels to the substrate surface.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Other prior art patent documents are also known to deal with aspects and methodologies that seek to address specific shortcomings that 'basic' magnetic wheels may exhibit in certain application fields.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">So for example, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US3690393A"><text>US patent 3,690,393 (Guy</text></patcit>) would seem to aim to address the above mentioned problem that magnetically attractive surfaces can have very large friction coefficients which in certain applications can be detrimental. Guy describes a vehicle having a frame on which is mounted a prime mover (eg electric motor) which is coupled by suitable gearing to a live (or traction) axle to which a pair of wheel assemblies are secured in order to propel the vehicle. In one embodiment, one of the non-driven wheel assemblies consist of a plurality of axially polarised annular magnet discs secured to one another to form a cylindrical roller wheel whose outer (peripheral) surface is coated with a thin layer of a non-polarizable, anti-friction material, such as PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) which minimises drag on the wheel assembly as the vehicle frame is propelled.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Guy also describes an electromagnetic wheel assembly, in which a non-magnetic cylindrical shell encloses an electromagnetic coil about an inner core element mounted on the wheel's axle for rotation therewith. Magnetisable pole discs are arranged at the axial ends of the shell member, and electrical energy can be supplied to the magnet coil through wiper contacts secured to one of the pole discs. Upon energization of the electro-magnetic coil, the pole discs will be polarised with opposite polarities. The annular rims of the pole discs are again coated with a non-magnetisable, low-friction material for rolling contact with the magnetisable substrate surface on which the vehicle is intended to travel.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In contrast, <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US2694164A"><text>US Patent 2,694,164 (Geppelt</text></patcit>) discloses magnetic wheels of a type used in conjunction with welding and cutting torch carriages which are self-propelled over ferromagnetic surfaces. The magnetic wheel units consist of an axle sleeve of non magnetisable material received within an annular-cylindrical permanent magnet which is magnetized in its axial direction, two cylindrically cup shaped wheel members of soft steel material which have their annular flanges<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> extending towards each other and into clamped close engagement with opposite sides of a non-magnetic spacer disc that surrounds the magnet about the middle of its axial length. The axial end faces of the magnet abut against the respectively facing inner faces of the cup wheel members such as to allow magnetic flux transfer from the magnet into the wheels towards their peripheral surface, the spacer disc serving to ensure magnetic decoupling of the two wheels whereby these will assume opposite polaritries in accordance with the magnetic field generated by the permanent magnet of the wheel. Geppelt outlines that the decrease in wall thickness of the annular cup flanges towards the spacer disc (as compared to a prior art embodiment with uniform cup flange thickness) increases the attractive force that may be exerted between the magnetic wheel and the substrate to which it attaches.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In practical terms, and in light of the above description of prior art magnetic wheel constructs, a technical challenge still exists in devising methods and arrangements of magnetic flux transfer from a magnet, as a source of magnetic force to attach one object to another, through a wheel structure into a magnetically attractive body, to meet specified operational load carrying capacity or retention requirements.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In a more confined aspect, it would be desirable to provide a vehicle which uses magnetic energy to secure such vehicle onto a ferromagnetic substrate surface and in which the magnetic flux transfer mechanism will allow for greater flexibility with regards to magnetically coupling and decoupling of the vehicle from the substrate surface.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In another more confined aspect, it would be desirable to provide a magnetic support structure by means of which a ferromagnetic object may be transported between locations in a secured manner and wherein at the end of such transporting operation the object may be safely and easily disengaged from the support structure.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In another aspect, it would be desirable to provide a magnetic gripper appliance which may be actuated in order to secure an object thereto whilst allowing for freedom of movement of the object in order to conduct machining or other operations on the object.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The term 'ferromagnetic' as used herein is intended to cover not only metals and alloys but also composite materials which when subjected to an external magnetic field will become magnetised and subject to magnetisation forces.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Other aspects of the invention will become apparent below from the following description of preferred embodiments thereof.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0027" num="0027">In broad terms, the present invention can be defined as residing in a magnetic circuit that has (a) one or more permanent magnets as a source of magnetic flux, (b) at least two oppositely polarisable pole extension bodies associated with the magnetic flux source, the bodies being disc, wheel, roller or similarly shaped with an outer circumferential surface and held rotatable about respective axes of rotation, and (c) a ferromagnetic counter body which is arranged to cooperate with the pole extension bodies such as to provide an external flux path for the magnetic flux when in magnetic contact with the circumferential surface of the pole extension bodies, wherein the magnetic flux source is held stationary relative to the rotatable pole extension bodies.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Compared with what may be termed 'traditional' magnetic wheel circuits utilised in attaching one object to another, such as those described above, the present invention physically decouples the active magnetic source or component (eg switchable or conventional permanent magnets) from the disc-, roller- or wheel-like pole extension pieces, wherein the pole extension pieces remain free to rotate about their respective axes of rotation but the associated magnetic flux source remains stationary, ie it does not rotate with the pole extension pieces.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Preferably, physically decoupling will be accompanied by spatially separating the flux source from the rotatable pole extension pieces, eg by maintaining a small air gap between these components, see also below.

These components represent a basic unit that can be built upon, modified and incorporated in numerous applications of the invention as explained below.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The magnet 16 will be a high coercive, ie rare-earth magnet capable of inducing high magnetic flux densities across air gaps (mainly) through its axial end faces 16a, 16b, and generate a pulling force (magnetic attraction force) in a ferromagnetic body towards the axial end faces as outlined above.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The discs 12, 14 have a circumferential contact surface 13a and two axial faces 13b and 13c, and are made entirely of ferromagnetic soft steel.,.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The discs 12, 14 are respectively located opposite an axial end face 16a, 16b of magnet 16, keeping a fixed small air gap (not illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">fig 1</figref>), such that each disc provides an oppositely polarised pole extension for the respective N- and S-pole 20, 22 of the magnet 16. Furthermore, the discs 12, 14 are supported at not illustrated axle members about a common axis of rotation 18 to allow rotation thereof, ie the discs can be termed as freely spinning pole extension 'wheel' pieces which otherwise maintain a fixed spatial relationship to the dipole magnet 16, the axis of rotation being parallel or coinciding with the N-S magnetisation axis of the dipole.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Magnetic flux transfer from the magnet 16 to the discs 12, 14 will take place across the small air gaps between the facing sides 13b of the discs and the poles 20, 22 of the magnet 16. The gaps are intended to minimise friction loses at the interface between magnet 16 and pole pieces 12, 14, but could be replaced with magnetisable roller bearings that provide for direct physical contact between discs 12, 14 and the magnet's axial end faces and thus improved flux transfer between magnet and pole discs 12, 14.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">When the surface of a ferromagnetic substrate, eg steel sheet 24, is brought into contact with the peripheral surface 13a of both pole discs 12, 14 of the Magnetic Wheel Unit 10, a closed magnetic circuit will be created, wherein a closed magnetic flux loop will comprise a path internal to the magnet 16 and pole<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> extension discs 14, 16, and a path external to the unit 10 between the pole extension discs 14, 16 and the ferromagnetic substrate 24. That is, the external magnetic field extends within the substrate 24, and this is schematically illustrated at 26 in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig 1 a</figref>, and the entire closed loop flux path at 27 in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig 1b</figref>.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The Magnetic Wheel Unit 10 will be attracted and remain strongly secured to the substrate 24, despite the actual physical contact area between the discs 12, 14 and the steel sheet 24 being essentially confined to a line measuring the sum of the thicknesses (ie widths) of the disc 12, 14. The free-spinning nature of the disc wheels 12, 14 allows translational displacement of the unit 10 over the surface of the substrate 24 by applying but a very small force traverse to the magnetic attraction force which attaches the Wheel Unit 10 to the substrate 24. The small force requirement stems from the relatively low rolling resistance coefficient applicable to steel discs rolling on a steel substrate, which is magnitudes smaller than the static and the kinetic friction coefficients applicable to the same material-pair combination but where the pole wheels 12, 14 are kept in an immobilised state with respect to the magnet 16 and the surface on which such static wheels would otherwise glide.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">It would seem counterintuitive that despite the presence of air gaps between magnetic flux source 16 and rotatable pole discs 12, 14, and a very small contact area between pole piece discs 12, 14 and substrate 24, the Magnetic Wheel unit 10 will remain securely attached to the substrate. A prototype Magnetic wheel unit 10 embodying the principle illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">fig. 1</figref> with the permanent magnetic flux source being a rare earth NdFeB magnet having a 50mm x 40mm 'flux source area' (ie cross-section area of the magnetic flux source normal to the polarisation axis of the magnet) capable of delivery of 1.2 Tesla magnetic flux density, with two soft steel discs (having a magnetic flux density saturation level of around 2 Tesla) with a dimension of 25mm width x 90mm diameter and keeping an air gap towards the permanent magnet of approx 1 to 2 mm is able to attach to a ferromagnetic steel sheet of 35 mm thickness and carry a load equivalent to a 'breakaway force' of over 1200 Newton.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">As noted, the actual physical contact zone or area between substrate 24 and (rotatable) pole discs 12, 14 is very small (in theory a line, given that deformation, ie 'flattening' of the soft-steel discs under load is negligible).<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0050" num="0050">It has been noted that in the vicinity of the physical contact area there exist so called 'virtual pole areas', where noticeable flux transfer takes place across air, ie (a) from the peripheral surface of the pole discs either side of the contact zone towards the substrate surface and (b) from both faces of the disc near the contact zone and the substrate surface. In the present context, such air gaps do not represent and are not to be mistaken as unwanted leakage paths, rather the effective magnetic contact area between discs and substrate is enlarged, and the so called virtual poles provide an additional means of flux transfer (albeit at lower density values) from discs 12, 14 to substrate 24, thereby adding to the total pulling power available to secure the unit 10 onto the substrate 24 (or vice versa). These virtual pole area extensions are schematically illustrated at 30a, 30b and 31 a and 31 b in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1 b</figref> and in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 1c</figref>, and do contribute in maintaining a closed magnetic circuit of sufficient quality at the interface between substrate and Magnetic Wheel unit 10 for the exerted attraction force to remain high, as exemplified above.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 1 c</figref> illustrates a magnetic field line model with measured flux density values at two soft-steel 90mm diameter x 25mm thickness pole discs 12, 14 having a magnetic density saturation level of 2 Tesla, which are polarised with opposite polarities and which are held in air in spaced apart relationship on a magnetic substrate 24. It can be seen that on either side of the essentially linear contact zone 28 between pole wheels 12, 14 and substrate 24, a flux density of 2 Tesla will reduce drastically (ie the virtual pole extensions exhibit reduced flux densities), wherein at a linear distance of 10 mm the flux density is reduced to about 15% of the value at the physical contact area, and about 5% at a distance of 20 mm.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Flux transfer from the magnet 16 into the substrate 24 will thus be influenced - and limited - by (a) the shape and dimensions of the interface of the magnetic flux source (eg the flux delivery component in a switchable permanent magnet device or electromagnet) at the gap towards the pole discs, (b) 'magnetic leakage' at the air gap interfaces between the passive pole extension discs 12, 14 and magnetic flux source 16, (c) geometric and shape constraints of the discs which may not be able to 'support' (ie carry and deliver) the same flux density at the given field strength which the magnet 16 generates, (d) the nature of the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> virtual poles in so far as these cannot support the same flux density at the given field strength which the ferromagnetic material of the discs 12, 14 can, and (e) the total magnetic path length between flux source and ferromagnetic substrate, recalling that the magnetic pulling force by means of which any ferromagnetic body is attracted to a source of magnetic flux will vary mathematically with the square of magnetic flux density provided by the source and linearly with the contact area between the source and the attached body.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">For example, a magnetic wheel unit 10 using relatively larger diameter pole discs 12, 14 as those described above, eg 3-times, will have a longer total magnetic path (due to increased diameter of discs) and the magnetising force at the contact area will be lower then and the virtual pole areas will be smaller (and in extreme situations virtually non-existent).</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The actual size, shape and geometric extent of the virtual poles are not fixed but vary with the actual working and application conditions. Generally speaking, the larger the virtual pole zones can be made, the more magnetic flux transfer may take place in the vicinity of the disc-substrate interface. An important consideration is therefore the need to avoid or minimise magnetising force losses.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Consequently, in accordance with another aspect underlying the present invention, the pole wheels will be of such shape and dimensions to cater for (a) optimised flux transfer from the magnetic flux source into the rotatable pole wheels and (b) provide relatively larger area virtual poles thereby to enable optimised flux transfer also outside of the direct physical contact zone between pole discs and substrate surface, whilst (c) maintaining sufficient magnetic attraction force towards the substrate; an important point is to avoid, as far as practically possible, losses in magnetising force at each interface.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Having noted the difficulties regarding precise definition of the virtual pole zones, assuming an idealised air-gap leakage free magnetic flux path between magnet flux source (eg permanent magnet) and rotatable pole wheels, it is possible to match the size of the diameter-cross-sectional area of the wheel or roller poles as best as constructional possible to the size of the magnetic flux source area, ie the cross section of a pole in the dipole magnet perpendicular to its magnetisation axis. Such measure will produce an optimised, ie a higher magnetising force at the discs' working interface (ie air gap) with the substrate as<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> compared to cases where the geometric dimensions of the wheel or roller pole extensions are chosen arbitrarily or without regard to magnetic flux transfer considerations.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">For example, and all other parameters being equal, cup shaped wheels or rollers which are disposed to surround with their annular rim portion a determinable part of the respectively associated pole of the dipole magnet and maintain a small air gap between the wheel's internal disc face towards the axial end face of the dipole magnet, exhibit a larger total area for flux transfer into and out of such wheel than a simple planar disc-shaped wheel where the flux transfer area is confined to the surface area facing the axial end face of the dipole magnet. One could say cup shaped wheels can 'capture' a larger portion of the flux emanating from the magnet which, absent the annular rim portion of the cup which surrounds part of the magnetic flux source, would be lost as 'stray' flux, and use such additionally captured flux to generate a higher magnetic attraction force towards a ferromagnetic substrate than 'plain disc-shaped' pole extension.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The actual depth of the rim portion of the cup-shaped wheel or roller will depend on the nature of the magnetic flux source being employed, and in particular the magnetic flux 'output' member of the magnetic flux delivery device. In essence, the cup depth will represent a compromise between maximum flux transfer considerations (optimised where the annular rim portion depth is such as to extend and cover the whole length of the respective North/South pole of the magnet) and desired magnetising force (ie magnetic attraction force) which will be lower in the flux transfer optimised rim configuration. An empirically determined relative size of the annular rim with regards to its covering of the flux source is provided below in connection with a specific embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">To conserve the magnetising force of the high coercitivity flux source it is also desirable to minimise the volume of the passive ferromagnetic material pole extension wheels. Viewed only from a point of view of seeking to optimise flux transfer, a theoretical necessary volume maximum is given where the effective cross section of the flux source equals the diametrical cross-section of the wheel divided by any applicable flux compression/concentration factor (the latter is determined by material specific flux density carrying capacity and the flux source density output. For example, if a flux source can provide a magnetic flux density<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> of 1.2 Tesla and is able to generate a magnetising force sufficient to induce in mild steel a flux density of 2 Tesla, the compression factor is about 1.6). The practical maximum will be lower because of total magnetic path length and flux/wheel air gap losses.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Turning then to advantageous additional features that may be incorporated in different embodiments of the above described broad concepts.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In utilising a conventional, non-switchable magnet or preferably a switchable permanent magnet arrangement as the magnetic flux source, it will be appreciated that the magnetically active material may be encased or otherwise disposed to cooperate with other stationary pole pieces additional to the rotatable pole extension elements (ie wheels), in which case the flux will 'originate' in the active material and be made 'available' through the other stationary pole pieces that will be disposed in facing close proximity to the rotatable pole wheels. The specific shape of the stationary pole pieces will also influence flux transfer capabilities and have an effect on the maximum available magnetising force , as the poles do represent a 'load' for the magnetic field generated by the active magnetic material (ie the flux source)</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In preferred embodiments of the above described Magnetic wheel units 10, use is made of a switchable permanent magnet device disclosed in said <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="US7012495B"><text>US patent 7,012,495</text></patcit>, different types of which can be sourced from Magswitch Technology Worldwide Pty Ltd (Australia) or its subsidiaries.

The ferromagnetic (passive) two pole pieces of the housing are magnetically separated or isolated along two axially extending contact edges, wherein when the respective N- and S-poles of the stacked magnet discs are rotated into full alignment, the diameter separating the N- and S-poles of the magnet discs will extend between the contact edges of the housing, thereby causing one of the pole pieces to be polarised and provide a N-pole pole extension and the other a S-pole pole extension.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Such switchable dipole magnet unit may then constitute the magnetic flux source 16 in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig 1a</figref>, wherein flux transfer into the rotatable pole discs 12, 14 will take place from the magnet discs through the housing pole pieces and across the air gap between housing pole pieces and the pole wheels located in facing proximity to the two pole pieces of the housing, respectively. The wall thickness and exterior shape of the pole piece housing can be chosen to provide a flux source unit having a constant magnetic field or approx. constant magnetic flux about the periphery of the housing; and spatial orientation of the unit's housing with respect to the rotatable pole wheels can be determined as required. The specific choice of switchable permanent magnet unit can be made by reference to information available from Magswitch Technology Worldwide, depending on load carrying requirements.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">As noted above, it is conceivable to have the facing surfaces of the pole wheels and magnetic flux source unit coated with a low friction material and provide for the presence of soft steel roller bearings at the interfaces unit - pole wheel. In practical implementations it is however technically feasible to maintain very small air gap tolerances between the movable and stationary components whilst not significantly negatively affecting magnetic flux transfer across the air gap.

Coating may also include processes and use of substances aimed at increasing the overall hardness of the wheel or roller surface, eg Titanium Nitride to achieve more slipperiness (smooth surface) or higher friction (textured surface). Noise reducing coatings are equally conceivable, whereas coating films aimed at preventing extraneous matter adhering onto the wheel / roller peripheral surface are particularly advantageous in 'dirty' application fields such as steel sheet handling operations, use of magnetic wheel units in vehicles employed as remote controlled painting, brazing, welding and other applications.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">A device incorporating one or more magnetic wheel units of the type generically discussed above, can advantageously incorporate drive means, such as a motor, arranged for transferring torque into at least one of the wheel or roller (pole piece) members. The torque available at the wheel or roller members can then be used to impart propulsion to an object in contact with the wheels (eg metal sheet conveying), self-propel a vehicle incorporating the magnetic wheel unit(s), or where the torque transferred is a 'negative' torque aimed at reducing the rotational speed of the wheels where such are caused to rotate by an external force, slow down or brake an object that is in frictional contact with the wheels.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">The pole extension wheel members can be made advantageously from soft steel or other ferromagnetic passive materials. An advantageous wheel design may consist of a composite material consisting of a plastic material or rubber matrix in which is dispersed a considerable amount of ferromagnetic material powder for flux carrying purposes. Deformability of the pole extension wheel at its interface with the substrate on which its rests under magnetic load will enlarge the contact zone where flux transfer takes place directly between wheel member and substrate, also providing increased frictional engagement therewith.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">It will be appreciated, that the external peripheral surface of the pole piece wheels or rollers may be smooth, textured, corrugated or provided with other type of protrusions, eg cog wheel teeth.

For example, in a friction wheel gearbox and variable ratio drive arrangement incorporating one or more basic magnetic wheel units having smooth, non-corrugated pole wheels or rollers, the inherent slippage functionality which such provide when rolling on another smooth-surface object can be used to minimise overload conditions as torque transfer is reduced due to slippage.

Given that the magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic substrate is by magnitudes higher than that of the surrounding environment, be it air or another fluid like water, and assuming the substrate properties are such that no flux saturation takes place during flux transfer into the substrate, one would not observe any magnetic field outside the immediate vicinity of the contact area between pole wheels and substrate (refer above to virtual pole extension areas) and the closed magnetic circuit comprised of the pole wheels, substrate and magnetic flux source device.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">Magnetic wheel units 10 (or 10' or 10") can be embedded and embodied in a multitude of apparatus and devices for a variety of applications.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">Turning first again to <figref idrefs="f0003">fig 2a</figref>, it schematically illustrates one methodology of effecting torque transfer either into or from the pole wheels 12, 14 of unit 10, by means of a ferromagnetic roller bar 35 whose axis of rotation 36 along the axial length of the roller is positioned to extend parallel to the axis of rotation 18 of the pole wheel pair. The roller bar 35 has a smooth outer peripheral surface and is held by any suitable mechanism (not illustrated) such that it is in, or can be brought with its outer surface into and out of frictional abutment on the smooth peripheral surface 13a of both wheels 12, 14. This basic architecture can then be employed to effect torque transfer, either positive for propulsion purposes or negative for object braking purposes. For example, rotation of roller bar 35 as per arrow 37, eg by coupling the roller with the output shaft of an electro motor, will impart counter-orientated rotation to wheels 12, 14 as per arrow 38 which in turn will then either allow the entire unit 10 to move in translatory manner over a stationarily held substrate 24 as per arrows 39, or where the unit 10 is otherwise secured against movement, impart movement onto an otherwise unsecured substrate 24 as per arrows 40 in a direction opposite to 39.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">In using an appropriately dimensioned ferromagnetic roller bar 35, it is possible to 'utilise' part of the magnetic energy provided by the magnetic flux source 16 of unit 10 to maintain roller 35 in frictional and magnetic contact with<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> wheel members 12, 14 whilst the majority of the available magnetic flux is utilised to secure the unit 10 onto substrate 24. It will then also be appreciated that where the magnetic flux source 16 is a switchable permanent magnet device or an electromagnet, variable torque transfer may be effected, dependent on the amount of flux transferred into roller 35 (and substrate) through wheel pole members 12, 14, and the friction coefficient that then will be present between the abutting surfaces of wheels 12, 14 and roller 35. The architecture illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">fig 2a</figref> provides for an inherent torque slippage functionality which can reduce torque transfer between unit 10 and substrate 24 In conditions that may otherwise lead to an overload.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">A more specific application field for magnetic wheel units include roller conveyor systems in various forms like overhead sheet metal conveyors, one of which is schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">fig 3a</figref>.
