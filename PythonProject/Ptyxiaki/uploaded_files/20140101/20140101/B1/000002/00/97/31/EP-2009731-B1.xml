Therefore, it is possible to change the phase of an electromagnetic wave propagating in a transmission line, to change a cutoff frequency in case of a transmission line having cutoff characteristics, or to attenuate the electromagnetic wave propagating in the transmission line. When the variable part varies in dimension, the dimension in a voltage application direction, that is, the thickness in the voltage application direction primarily varies. The electrode is embedded in the dielectric part, and is formed to be thinner than the skin depth for the frequency of the electromagnetic wave propagating in the transmission line. Accordingly, even though the electrode is provided to be close to the variable part or embedded in the variable part, the electromagnetic wave propagating in the transmission line can transmit the electrode. For this reason, the electromagnetic wave can propagate without being cut off. Further, in a state where a transmission<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> loss due to the embedded of the electrode is suppressed, an electric field with large electric field strength can be applied to the variable part by the electrode, and thus it is possible to significantly change at least one of dielectric constant and dimension of the variable part. Even if a voltage to be supplied to the electrode in order to apply an electric field to the variable part is reduced, an electric field with large electric field strength is applied to the variable part. In addition, even if the line length of the transmission line is short, since an electric field with large electric field strength is applied to the variable part, a small and low-voltage operable dielectric waveguide device, such as a phase shifter, a high frequency switch, or an attenuator, can be achieved.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the dielectric waveguide device of the invention, it is preferable that the dielectric part includes second dielectric parts that are provided to sandwich the variable part therebetween and have a lower dielectric constant than the variable part,<br/>

When the dimension varies, the dimension in the voltage application direction, that is, the thickness in the voltage application direction primarily varies. The conductor part including the pair of electrodes surrounds the dielectric part to form the waveguide tube, and thus a transmission line having cutoff characteristics, that is, a cutoff frequency is formed by the conductor part and the dielectric part. In forming the waveguide tube, the conductor part may form the waveguide tube to be spaced at a predetermined distance around an axial line. Since the conductor part forming the waveguide tube includes the pair of electrodes,<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> it is not necessary to form an electrode separately from the waveguide tube, and thus ease of manufacturing can be realized. If the electrodes are included in the waveguide tube, even though the frequency of electromagnetic wave propagating the dielectric part is set to be near the cutoff frequency, an electric field to be applied to the variable part can be stably controlled, and thus stable operation near the cutoff frequency can be made. Accordingly, the frequency of electromagnetic wave propagating along the dielectric part can be set to be near the cutoff frequency, and a large phase change is obtained at a short line length near the cutoff frequency. Therefore, if the waveguide tube is used as a phase shifter, the phase shifter can be small in size. Further, by setting the frequency of electromagnetic wave propagating along the dielectric part to be near the cutoff frequency, the dimension of a section which is perpendicular to the propagation direction of the electromagnetic wave of the dielectric part is made small. In addition, since the interval between the pair of electrodes is small, a large electric field can be applied to the dielectric part at a low voltage.

If the manufacturing process of the phase shifter 30 is started, the process progresses from Step s1 to Step s2. In Step s2, a first dielectric film 32 made of a dielectric having a predetermined dielectric constant is laminated on a first surface 31a of a substrate 31, and then the process progresses to Step s3.

In Step s3, adjacent electrode films 33 in a lamination direction of the electrode films 33 are formed to<!-- EPO <DP n="72"> --> partially overlap each other. The electrode films 33 are made of a semiconductor material, such as silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), or gallium arsenide (GaAs), or a high-resistance material, such as tantalum nitride or a NiCr alloy.

In forming the electrode films 33, a metal mask having a rectangular through hole is used, and the electrode film 33 is formed at a portion corresponding to the through hole. Accordingly, a pattern can be formed simultaneously with the electrode film 33. After the electrode film 33 is formed, the second dielectric film 34 is formed to cover the electrode film 33 over the entire surface of the portion where the electrode film 33 is laminated, and the electrode film 33 is laminated on the second dielectric film 34 again. The electrode films 33 are individually formed to lean toward a first direction F1 or a second direction F2 in a predetermined direction F perpendicular to the lamination direction of the electrode films 33 and the second dielectric films 34 such that adjacent electrode films 33 in the lamination direction of the<!-- EPO <DP n="73"> --> electrode films 33 partially overlap each other. The electrode films 33 have the same size. Therefore, in forming adjacent electrode films 33, the electrode films 33 are formed by shifting the metal mask toward the first direction F1 or the second direction F2 of the predetermined direction F, such that a plurality of electrode films 33 can be formed to partially overlap each other in the lamination direction.

The third dielectric film 36 is made of the same material as the first dielectric film 32. For example, the third dielectric film 36 is made of glass, single crystal, ceramics, or resin. The first dielectric film 32 and the third dielectric film 36 have the same film thickness.

In Step s5, the first dielectric film 32, the laminate 35, and the third dielectric film 36 are etched. Thus, convex portions 37 shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4B</figref> are formed. Each of the convex portions 37 includes parts of the first dielectric<!-- EPO <DP n="74"> --> film 32, the laminate 35, and the third dielectric film 36. The convex portions 37 are formed such that the electrode films 33, which are formed to lean toward the first direction F1 of the predetermined direction F, are exposed from a first end face 38a among a pair of end faces 38a and 38b opposed to each other in the lamination directions of the electrode films 33 and the second dielectric films 32, and the electrode films 33, which are formed to lean toward the second direction F2 of the predetermined direction F, are exposed from the second end face 39b among a pair of end faces 38a and 38b. As for etching, a known etching method, such as chemical dry etching, reactive ion etching, or wet etching, may be used. The materials of the electrode film 33 and the second dielectric film 34 are selected such that the etching rate of the second dielectric film 34 is higher than that of the electrode film 33. Therefore, the end portions of the electrode films 33 can be exposed to the first and second end faces 38a and 38b of each of the convex portions 37. For example, a portion excluding a region indicated by a virtual line 39 shown in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">Figs. 4A to 4C</figref> is removed by etching. In this way, electrodes Ta are formed to be exposed to the end face in the first direction F1 while being not exposed to the end face in the second direction F2, and electrodes Tb are formed to be exposed to the end<!-- EPO <DP n="75"> --> face in the second direction F2 while being not exposed to the end face in the first direction F1 are formed.</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">Next, the process progresses to Step s6.

The first and second plate conductor parts 23a and 23b are formed by forming a conductive film to cover the convex portion 37 and removing the conductive film excluding the first and second end faces 38a and 38b by photolithography. If Step s6 is ended, the process progresses to Step s7, and the manufacturing process is ended. The first to third dielectric films 32, 34, and 36 and the electrode film 33 may be formed by a known thin film forming method, such as vapor deposition, sputtering, or CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition).</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">By this process, the phase shifter 30 can be achieved in which the even-numbered electrodes T and the odd-numbered electrodes T in the lamination direction of the electrode films 33 are connected to different plate conductor parts.

Here, Δβ/αmax is calculated on the conditions tanδ = 0.05 and σ = 9.52×10<sup>6</sup> S/m, and the operation voltage V is calculated on the conditions that electric field strength required for changing the relative dielectric constant εr from 800 to 760 is 17 kV/cm, and<!-- EPO <DP n="108"> --> the voltage is applied a long side direction (the thickness direction Z).

If f/fc is in a range of 1.03 &lt; f/fc &lt; 1.5, a large phase change can be given to the electromagnetic wave at a short line length, and a voltage to be applied to the first and second electrodes 4a and 4b can be suppressed to be low. Therefore, a small and low-voltage operable phase shifter can be achieved. Preferably, f/fc is in a range of 1.03 &lt; f/fc &lt; 1.2.

As a result, a lower-voltage operable phase shifter can be achieved.</p><p id="p0196" num="0196">In the phase shifter 130, the first and second electrodes 4a and 4b form a rectangular waveguide tube. The cutoff frequency fc is determined in accordance with the dielectric constant of the dielectric forming the dielectric part 2 and the length a of the long side from<!-- EPO <DP n="109"> --> among the inner dimensions of the waveguide tube. In this embodiment, the lengths a and b are set to be a = 0.08 mm and b = 0.04 mm, and thus the cutoff frequency fc when the relative dielectric constant is 760 is set to 68 GHz. That is, when the usable frequency f is 77 GHz, f/fc is 1.13. The electric field strength required for changing the relative dielectric constant εr of the dielectric forming the dielectric part 2 from 800 to 760 is 17 kV/cm. In order to obtain this electric field strength of 17 kV/cm, what is necessary is that a voltage of 136 V is applied between the first and second electrodes 4a and 4b. The amount of the phase change when the voltage is applied between the first and second electrodes 4a and 4b, and the dielectric constant of the dielectric part 2 is changed from 800 to 760 becomes 154°/mm. Therefore, a length required for obtaining the amount of the phase change of 360°, that is, a length c of the dielectric part 2 in the propagation direction X, to which an electric field is applied by the first and second electrodes 4a and 4b, is 2.3 mm.</p><p id="p0197" num="0197">As a comparative example, a coplanar waveguide type phase shifter is exemplified.

In this case, if a voltage of 136 V is applied, the relative dielectric constant of the BST is changed from 800 to 680, and the amount of the phase change with 77 GHz becomes 18°/mm.

Accordingly, it is not necessary to form an electrode separately from the waveguide tube, and thus ease of manufacturing is achieved. If the waveguide tube includes the first and second electrodes 4a and 4b, even though the frequency of the electromagnetic wave propagating along the dielectric part 2 is set to be near the cutoff frequency, the electric field to be applied to the dielectric part 2 can be stably controlled, and thus the phase shifter 130 can be stably operated near the cutoff frequency. Accordingly, the frequency of the electromagnetic wave propagating along the dielectric part<!-- EPO <DP n="111"> --> 2 can be set to be near the cutoff frequency, and a large phase change can be obtained at a short line length near the cutoff frequency. Therefore, the phase shifter 130 can be small in size. In addition, if the frequency of the electromagnetic wave propagating along the dielectric part 2 is set to be near the cutoff frequency, the sections of the dielectric part 2 perpendicular to the propagation direction of the electromagnetic wave are reduced in dimension. Therefore, the interval between the first and second electrodes 4a and 4b becomes small, and thus a large electric field can be applied to the dielectric part 2 at a low voltage. As a result, the phase shifter 130 that is small in size and can stably obtain a large phase change at a low voltage can be achieved.</p><p id="p0200" num="0200">When the cutoff frequency when a voltage is applied to the first and second electrodes 4a and 4b is fc, and the frequency of the electromagnetic wave propagating along the dielectric part is f, fc and f are set to satisfy the condition 1.03 &lt; f/fc &lt; 1.5. That is, since the phase shifter is used near the cutoff frequency at which the phase change is large, a large phase change is obtained at a short line length, and thus the phase shifter 130 can be small in size. In addition, the section of the dielectric part 2 in a direction<!-- EPO <DP n="112"> --> perpendicular to the propagation direction of the electromagnetic wave is reduced in dimension. For this reason, the first and second electrodes 4a and 4b can be disposed to be close to each other. Therefore, large electric field strength can be obtained at a low voltage, and thus the phase shifter 130 can be operated at a low voltage. If electromagnetic wave near the cutoff frequency, that is, electromagnetic wave of a frequency satisfying the condition 1.03 &lt; f/fc &lt; 1.5 is guided along the dielectric part 2, a transmission loss per unit length is increased, but a phase change per unit length is large, as compared with a case where electromagnetic wave of a frequency distant from the cutoff frequency, that is, electromagnetic wave satisfying the condition f/fc?1.5 is guided along the dielectric part 2.

Hereinafter, the "high frequency switch" is simply referred to as "switch". In such a switch, by applying a voltage to the first and second electrodes 24a and 24b, it is possible to change the cutoff frequency in the dielectric part 22.</p><p id="p0327" num="0327">The voltage application unit 19 applies an AC<!-- EPO <DP n="167"> --> voltage or a DC voltage of a frequency lower than the frequency of the propagating electromagnetic wave to the first and second electrodes 24a and 24b. If the voltage application unit 19 applies a voltage to the first and second electrodes 24a and 24b, the dielectric part 22 becomes small in dielectric constant, and accordingly, the cutoff frequency of the switch is increased. When the voltage application unit 19 does not apply a voltage to the first and second electrodes 24a and 24b, the switch is configured such that the cutoff frequency of the switch becomes lower than the frequency (usable frequency) of the propagating electromagnetic wave. The voltage application unit 19 can apply a voltage to the first and second electrodes 24a and 24b such that the cutoff frequency of the switch becomes equal to or more than the usable frequency. Therefore, the switch can be switched between a propagation state where the cutoff frequency becomes lower than the frequency of electromagnetic wave propagating along the dielectric part 22 by the voltage application unit 19, and a cutoff state where the cutoff frequency becomes higher than the frequency of electromagnetic wave propagating along the dielectric part 22 by the voltage application unit 19. In the embodiment of the invention, the usable frequency is constant, and accordingly the switching enables an ON/OFF operation.<!-- EPO <DP n="168"> --></p><p id="p0328" num="0328">The switch having the above configuration can be switched in accordance with an electric field applied to the dielectric part 22 between the propagation state where the cutoff frequency in the dielectric part 22 becomes lower than the frequency of electromagnetic wave propagating along the dielectric part 22, and the cutoff state where the cutoff frequency becomes higher than the frequency of electromagnetic wave. Therefore, by changing the voltage applied to the first and second electrodes 24a and 24b, the switch can be easily switched between the propagation state and the cutoff state. In an OFF state, the switch is set in the cutoff state, and accordingly a high ON/OFF ratio can be inherently obtained. In addition, since no mechanical driving portion is provided, a high frequency switch having excellent durability and high reliability can be implemented. With this configuration, a switch that can change the cutoff frequency at a low voltage can be achieved. With the connection structure, the high frequency signal of the LSE mode can be favorably extracted to the plane guide.

In addition, even though the line length of the dielectric part 22 is made short, a high ON/OFF ratio that enables the cutoff state to achieve the OFF state can be obtained.

In such an attenuator, the cutoff frequency in the dielectric part 22 is changed by applying a voltage to the first and second electrodes 24a and 24b, and thus propagation characteristics can be changed. By changing the propagation characteristics in the dielectric part 22 in accordance with the electric field applied to the dielectric part 22, the high frequency signal can be attenuated. With the connection structure, the high frequency signal of the LSE mode can be favorably extracted to the plane guide. Therefore, an attenuator that can be favorably mounted on a planar circuit board can be achieved. The attenuator is formed such that, similarly to the phase shifter, when the cutoff<!-- EPO <DP n="170"> --> frequency is fc and the usable frequency is f, the condition 1.03 &lt; f/fc &lt; 1.5, and preferably the condition 1.03 &lt; f/fc &lt; 1.2 is satisfied. In such an attenuator, even though a voltage to be applied to the first and second electrodes 24a and 24b is made to be small, an electric field with large electric field strength is applied to the variable part. In addition, since attenuation characteristics near the cutoff frequency are used, even though the line length of the transmission line is made short, electromagnetic wave can be sufficiently attenuated. Therefore, a small and low-voltage operable attenuator can be achieved.
