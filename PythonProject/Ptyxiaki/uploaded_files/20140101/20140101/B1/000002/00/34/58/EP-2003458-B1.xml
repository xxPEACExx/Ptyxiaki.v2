Field:</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for performing electromagnetic tests on components in an enclosed chamber.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>2. Background:</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Aircraft are occasionally struck by lightning when traveling near or through a thunderstorm. Because, until recently, most aircraft structure was aluminum, these strikes did little or no damage. With more aircraft structure being fabricated from composite material, the electromagnetic effects of lightning strikes have taken on greater significance. In particular, an electrical strike may cause arcing between different components in the aircraft. This type of arcing is undesirable because an arc may cause flammable vapors or liquids in the aircraft to ignite.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In designing an aircraft, the different designers and engineers take into account electromagnetic effects, such as lightning. For example, cables and equipment are protected from damaging surges or transients through techniques such as shielding, grounding, and the application of surge protection or suppression devices. As another example, fuel systems and other systems that carry flammable liquids or vapors are an area of concern because even a tiny spark or arc may be disastrous. Extreme precautions are taken to assure that currents caused by lightning strike cannot cause sparks in any portion of an aircraft's fuel system. All of the structural joints and fasteners are<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> designed to prevent sparks as lightning current passes from one section to another section of the aircraft. Other components such as access doors, fuel filler caps, and vents are designed to withstand lightning. All of the fuel lines that carry fuel into the engines are verified to be protected against lightning. Similar design concerns are made with respect to other systems that carry flammable fluids or vapors.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In verifying these designs, tests are performed on the various components to ensure that simulated lightning strikes do not cause arcing. These same concerns are also present in other environments in which high voltages or large electrical currents may occur.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Currently, testing is performed in a number of different ways. Electrical arcing may be determined to have occurred using photographic paper in a darkened chamber or by the ignition of a flammable mixture that has been introduced into an enclosed chamber. When using the ignition method, the particular component is placed into a chamber and the component is connected to an electrical source. A flammable gas mixture is introduced into the chamber and the electrical source is activated to simulate an electromagnetic event, such as a lightning strike. Should an ignition event be observed, it is assumed that arcing of sufficient energy to initiate the ignition has occurred.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Large chambers are currently used to test the many different possible components that go into an aircraft. Further, the existing testing systems require the test setup to be dismantled and reassembled between tests. These types of testing systems are time consuming and expensive because of the time and amount of gas required for each test. The individual setups for each test require a great deal of time and effort between each test and most test programs involve<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> many separate tests. Added up these multiple tests require a great deal of time to setup, disassemble, and reassemble. In addition, the large chamber volume requires additional gas mixture and the time required to fill the chamber multiple times.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4339708A"><text>US4339708</text></patcit> discloses a pair of opposed electrodes disposed on each of a plurality of electrically insulating specimens.

In one advantageous embodiment, the apparatus has a chamber, a door connected to the chamber, a gas supply system attached to the chamber, a plurality of electrical connectors attached to the chamber, a removable platform, and a specimen holding system. The chamber has an opening into an interior space located in the chamber. The door closes to seal the opening and prevents a flammable gaseous mixture in the interior space from leaking out of the interior space of the chamber. The gas supply system is configured for connection to the gas supply system to allow introduction of the flammable gaseous mixture into the interior space. The removable platform is moveable into and out of the interior space of the chamber through the opening. The specimen holding system located on the removable platform and is configured to hold a specimen and is electrically connected to the plurality of electrical connectors when the removable platform is placed into the chamber, wherein an electrical current travels through the specimen when the electrical current is supplied by an electrical current source that is connected to the plurality of electrical connectors.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In another advantageous embodiment, the apparatus has a chamber, an electrical interface in the chamber, a platform, a port, and a specimen mounting apparatus. The platform is moveable into and out of the chamber. The port allows introduction of a flammable gaseous mixture into the interior of the chamber. The specimen mounting apparatus is located on the platform to which the actual test specimen<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> may be attached. Inserting the platform into the chamber provides an electrical connection between the electrical interface and a specimen mounted on the mounting apparatus. An electrical current applied to the electrical interface travels from the electrical interface to the mounting apparatus and through the specimen.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In yet another advantageous embodiment, a method is used to test specimens. The method includes connecting a current source to an electrical interface in the test chamber, connecting a gas supply to a port in the test chamber, and mounting a specimen on a platform. The platform with the specimen is placed into the test chamber. The test chamber is sealed after placing the platform into the test chamber. A flammable gaseous mixture is introduced into the interior of the test chamber after sealing the test chamber. An electrical current is supplied from the current source to the electrical interface to simulate an electromagnetic effect on the specimen.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The features, functions, and advantages can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present invention or may be combined in yet other embodiments in which further details can be seen with reference to the following description and drawings.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The novel features believed characteristic of the invention are set forth in the appended claims.

In this particular example, test chamber <b>100</b> is an example of one implementation for an electromagnetic effects test chamber. Test chamber 100, in the different advantageous embodiments of the present invention, reduces the time required to perform testing of specimens.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Box <b>102</b> has footers <b>104, 106,</b> and <b>108</b> on bottom side <b>110</b> of box <b>102.</b> These footers are used to clamp or attach test chamber <b>100</b> to a structure, such as a table or a cart. Box <b>102</b> also contains windows <b>112, 114, 116,</b> and <b>118.</b> Window <b>112</b> is found on end <b>120</b> of box <b>102.</b> Windows <b>114</b> and 116 are found on side <b>122</b> of box <b>102.</b> Window <b>118</b> is found on top side <b>124</b> of box <b>102.</b> The windows may be replaced with blanking plates or camera mounts should the need to use the "Light on Film" technique arise. Box <b>102</b> also contains port <b>126</b> on side <b>122.</b> Port <b>126</b> provides a connection to introduce gas into the interior of box <b>102.</b> Windows also are present on the side opposite side <b>122,</b> which are not visible from this view.
