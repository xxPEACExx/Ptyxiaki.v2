load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an oil-in-water (O/W) emulsified composition and, in particular, to an O/W emulsified composition which contains an oil-soluble organic UV absorber and a silicone oil, and is excellent in formulation stability as well as feeling in use and suitable as a sunscreen cosmetic.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Recently, the effect of ultraviolet on the skin has become widely known recently, and users have become increasingly conscious of skin whitening. Thus, there is demand for a cosmetic which provides a higher UV protection ability and even a good feeling in use.<br/>
Due to the fact that an O/W emulsified composition can provide refreshing and light fresh feeling in use while it contains oils, such emulsified composition is widely used not only in cosmetics for basic skin care such as milky lotions and creams, but also in products such as foundations and sunscreen cosmetics.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In cosmetics, UV protection ability has been often provided by incorporating organic UV absorbers or inorganic UV scatterers such as fine particle titanium oxide and fine particle zinc oxide. However, when a high UV protection ability is tried to be provided over a wide range of UV-B to UV-A by incorporating a large amount of inorganic UV shielding powder such as fine particle titanium oxide and fine particle zinc oxide, the finish may become whitish, or frictional or powdery feeling may be caused.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In contrast, many organic UV absorbers are generally highly polar oils and do not cause the problems such as the whitish finish and frictional_or powdery feeling mentioned<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> above. However, they provide stickiness so much to deteriorate the refreshing feeling of O/W emulsified composition when the emulsified composition is applied to skin. In addition, the emulsion stability tends to decrease. For example, though octocrylene and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate achieve an excellent UV absorption, it has been difficult to obtain an O/W emulsified composition containing them with a high emulsion stability and a good feeling in use.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It is a common technique to incorporate a silicone oil in a cosmetic to decrease the stickiness. However, there has been a problem that the emulsion stability became significantly deteriorated when an O/W emulsified composition was prepared by mixing a highly polar oil such as an organic UV absorber with a silicone oil.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Also, when an oil-soluble solid component was used by being dissolved in an oil phase, there has been a problem that the polarity change of oil phase due to incorporation of a silicone oil causes precipitation of the solid component.<br/>
For example, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine is a highly excellent organic UV absorber because of its UV absorbing ability in a wide range of UV-A to UV-B. It is a crystalline solid at ordinary temperature and is generally used by being dissolved in a highly polar oil. However, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine sometimes precipitates owing to the incorporation of a silicone oil. Thus, it has been difficult to incorporate stably bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine in an O/W emulsified composition containing a silicone oil.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Patent Literature 1 describes an O/W hair cosmetic containing two oil phases as follows:
<ol><li>(1) an oil phase (hard oil phase) having the average particle size of 0.5 µm or less formed with a nonionic surfactant which is solid at ordinary temperature and has the Krafft point of 40 °C or more; and</li><li>(2) an oil phase (soft oil phase) having the average particle size of 0.5 to 100 µm formed with a surfactant and/or an alkyl-modified carboxyvinyl polymer.<br/>
However, even in such an O/W emulsified composition, it has been difficult to<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> incorporate stably the organic UV absorber as mentioned above and a silicone oil.</li></ol></p><heading id="h0003">PRIOR ART</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT LITERATURE</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">: Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2005089366A"><text>2005-89366</text></patcit> discloses an emulsified composition for hair comprising a first and a second oil phase, the first oil phase comprising a nonionic surfactant and the second oil phase comprising an alkyl-modified carboxyvinyl polymer. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2007122822A"><text>WO 2007/122822</text></patcit> discloses a a oil-in-water emulsion type sunscreen preparation comprising POE stearate.

They can also dissolve bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine well. Moreover, the use of octyl methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, and bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine in combination is particularly preferred because a higher UV protection ability can be achieved in a wide range of UV-A to UV-B.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Octocrylene (chemical name: 2-ethylhexyl 2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylate) is an UV absorber which is in an oil state at ordinary temperature, and commercially available products such as "Uvinul N539" (manufactured by BASF) and "Parsol 340" (manufactured by DSM Nutrition Japan K.K.) can be easily used.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The amount of octocrylene can be suitably set depending on purposes, within the range as claimed.

In addition, the solid component which has been dissolved in the first oil phase (such as bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine in Table 1) precipitates.

When the oil phases are emulsified at once with an alkyl-modified carboxyvinyl polymer, as shown in Test example 1-c, the emulsion particle size of the oil phase exceeds 700 nm, resulting in significantly deteriorated stability and feeling in use.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><heading id="h0025">EXAMPLE 2 Amount of Block Polymer</heading><p id="p0079" num="0079">O/W emulsified compositions were prepared in the same method with Test example 1-1, except for changing the amounts of the block polymer POE(20)POP(80)cetyl ether as an emulsifier for the first oil phase.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080"><tables id="tabl0002" num="0002"><table frame="all"><title>Table 2</title><tgroup cols="4"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="73mm"/><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="22mm"/><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="22mm"/><colspec colnum="4" colname="col4" colwidth="23mm"/><thead><row><entry align="center" valign="middle"><b>Components</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="middle"><b>Test Ex. 1-1</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="middle"><b>Test Ex. 2-a</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="middle"><b>Test Ex. 2-b</b></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry valign="middle"><b>POE(20)POP(8)cetyl ether</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">0.4</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">0.2</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">3.1</entry></row><row><entry valign="middle"><b>Average emulsion particle size of first oil phase</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">614nm</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">670nm</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">560nm</entry></row><row><entry valign="middle"><b>Feeling in use (stickiness during application)</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">○</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">○</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">×</entry></row><row><entry valign="middle"><b>Feeling in use (stickiness just after application)</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">○</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">○</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">○</entry></row><row><entry valign="middle"><b>Emulsion stability (50°C×1M)</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">○</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">Δ</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">○</entry></row><row><entry valign="middle"><b>Solubility stability (0°C×1M)</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">○</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">○</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">○</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p0081" num="0081">As shown in Table 2, when the amount of emulsifier for the first oil phase is too small, the emulsion stability tends to decrease.
