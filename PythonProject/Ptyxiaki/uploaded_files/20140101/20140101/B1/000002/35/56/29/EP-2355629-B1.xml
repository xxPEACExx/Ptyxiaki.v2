More particularly, the present invention reverses pin connections between backplanes to reduce crosstalk generated between pin connections in the backplanes.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Background of the Related Art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Electronic systems are often assembled from multiple printed circuit boards (PCBs). PCBs that contain electronic components are sometimes called "daughter cards." Often, electrical signals are routed from one daughter card to another through a PCB called a "backplane." A backplane includes conducting paths called "signal traces," or just "traces," etched onto the PCB using a conductive material, such as copper. Connectors are mounted on the backplane to make connections to the traces. The portion of a printed circuit board that allows a trace to be connected to a contact element in a connector or other electronic element is called a "signal launch," or just "launch." When connectors are used to mate daughter cards with the launches on a backplane, signal paths are established between the daughter cards via the signal traces on the backplane.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As electronic systems have become smaller, faster, and more complex, backplanes generally have been required to provide more signal traces without increasing in size, or while actually decreasing in size. As a result of the increased density of traces, electrical noise between signals has become more problematic. Electrical noise is usually considered<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> any undesirable electrical energy in an electronic system, including but not limited to reflections, electromagnetic interference, mode conversions, and unwanted coupling, such as crosstalk.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The trend toward smaller, faster, and more complex electronic systems has also required daughter cards, backplanes, and their connectors to carry more and faster data signals in a smaller space without degrading the characteristics of those signals. Daughter cards, backplanes, and their connectors can be made to carry more signals in less space by placing signal conductors closer together. A major difficulty with placing signal conductors closer together is that electrical noise between the signal conductors increases as the distance between signal conductors decreases and as the speed of the signals increases. In addition, as frequency content increases, there is a greater possibility of energy loss. Energy loss may be attributed to impedance discontinuities, mode conversion, leakage from imperfect shielding, or undesired coupling to other signal conductors, such as crosstalk.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Differential signals are signals represented by a pair of conducting paths, called a "differential signal pair." The voltage difference between the conductive paths represents the signal. In general, the two conducing paths of a differential signal pair are arranged to run near each other. If any other source of electrical noise is electromagnetically coupled to the differential signal pair, the effect on each conducting path of the pair should be similar. Because the signal on the differential signal pair is treated as the difference between the voltages on the two conducting paths of the pair, a common noise voltage that is coupled to both conducting paths in the differential signal pair does not affect the signal. That renders a differential signal pair less sensitive to crosstalk noise, as compared with a single-ended signal path. At high speeds, the available conducting paths may encounter crosstalk, impedance, and attenuation mismatch characteristics, and the signal transmission characteristics may degrade.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Crosstalk generally refers to electromagnetic interference that comes from an adjacent wire. Current that flows down one of the traces, referred to as the "aggressor line," couples into the adjacent trace, called the "victim line," and creates two different noise signals in the victim line. One of the noise signals, called "forward crosstalk" or "far end crosstalk," flows in the victim line in the same direction as the current flowing in the aggressor line. The other noise signal, called "backward crosstalk," flows in the victim line in the opposite or backward direction as the current flowing in the aggressor line.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(a)</figref>, a standard backplane connection system 100 is shown having a first connector 110, a second connector 120, and various trace pairs 130-140. The first connector 110 is connected to input trace pairs 130 and 132 on a first daughter card. Trace pairs 134 and 136 are provided on a backplane to connect the first connector 110 to the second connector 120. And, the second connector 120 is connected to output trace pairs 138 and 140 on a second daughter card. In a backplane environment, the input trace pairs 130 and 132 coming into the first connector 110 can be, for example, from a line card of a router or a processor card on the first daughter card, and the output trace pairs 138 and 140 going out from the second connector 120 can be, for example, to a fabric card or a switch card on the second daughter card.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The impact of crosstalk on the system 100 is exemplified in Figs. l(b)-(i). In the system 100 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(a)</figref>, the bottom trace pairs 130, 134, and 138 are the aggressor trace pairs and the top trace pairs 132, 136, and 140 are the victim trace pairs. After the signal on the aggressor trace pair 130 reaches the first connector 110, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(b)</figref>, noise in the form of crosstalk is created at the first connector 110, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(c)</figref>. That noise is generated inside the first connector 110 by coupling between the differential signal pairs.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Noise is also generated in the portion of the backplane that the first connector 110 is pressed into, which is called the "footprint" of the first connector 110. The footprints of the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> first and second connectors 110 and 120 each have mechanisms for mating the contact elements of the first and second connectors 110 and 120 to their respective launches in the backplane, such as surface-mount or compliant pin attachments. The vias created in the substrate of the backplane to make those attachments are comprised of cylinders extending through the thickness of the board. Those via cylinders can also couple to each other and generate noise. That effect is directly related to the thickness of the board, such that the thicker the board is, the more crosstalk that is generated. For a thick board, the crosstalk in the backplane can be greater than the crosstalk from the connector. Noise may be generated in a similar manner in the daughter card backplanes.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">There is no noise on the second connector 120 at this point, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(d)</figref>, so that the noise at the first connector 110 is the total noise for the system 100, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(e)</figref>. The noise from the first connector 110 continues at the output of the first connector 110 on the victim trace pair 136.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">When the signal reaches the second connector 120, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(f)</figref>, there is noise on the victim trace 136 from the first connector 110, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(g)</figref>, in addition to the noise that is generated at the second connector 120, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(h)</figref>. The noise generated in the second connector 120 is substantially the same as the noise generated in the first connector 110, i.e., noise from the coupling between pairs, the footprint attachments, and the via cylinder coupling. The noise on the victim trace pair 136 and the noise on the second connector 120 get combined inside the second connector 120. Thus, the total noise in the system 100, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(i)</figref>, is approximately double that at each connector 110 and 120, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1(g) and (h)</figref>, respectively.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">While it is possible to minimize those deleterious coupling effects by adding space between the victim and aggressor lines, that comes at the disadvantage of losing density in the backplane and the connector. Thus, as more and more signals are populated onto<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> backplanes and more and more signal conductors are provided in connectors, the problem with coupling becomes more probable and more problematic. Accordingly, there is a need for a system that reduces noise generated at the connector footprints and connectors of a connection system. Moreover, there is a need for a connection system that allows connectors that increase speed and density without degrading the electrical characteristics of the signals they route.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6350134B"><text>US6350134</text></patcit> discloses an electrical connector of controlled impedance which includes a housing on which are mounted consecutive signal transmission line pairs in consecutive reverse order, each signal transmission line pair being provided by a pair of signal contacts in one contact row opposing a ground contact in another contact row, and by having the consecutive signal transmission line pairs in reverse order, the signal contacts of each signal transmission line pair are arranged consecutively with an adjacent ground contact of another signal transmission line pair of reversed order, which minimizes cross talk between different pairs of signal contacts, and which provides maximized areas surrounding the signal contacts and the ground contacts for routing circuit paths.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US2009180266A"><text>US2009180266</text></patcit> discloses a connection system which has two connectors connected to each other by a plurality of differential signal pairs.

However, the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific terms so selected, and it is to be understood that each specific term includes all technical equivalents that operate in a similar manner to accomplish a similar purpose.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Turning to the drawings, <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> shows a backplane 200 having a first footprint 220 and a second footprint 230 in accordance with a non-limiting embodiment of the present invention. The first footprint 220 and the second footprint 230 each have a plurality of signal launches, shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> as an array of ten columns (A-J) each having four rows (1-4) of differential signal pairs. Each differential signal pair includes a launch that carries the positive "+" signal (P) of the differential signal pair and a launch that carries the negative "-" signal (N) of the differential signal pair. The launches between the differential signal pairs are ground connections, shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> as blacked-out launches. The ground connection is provided between each differential signal pair. The launches for each differential signal pair are located closer to each other than to neighboring differential signal pairs. That closeness permits better coupling within the differential signal pairs while reducing crosstalk from adjacent signal pairs.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The differential signal pair launches have corresponding differential signal trace pairs. Five differential signal trace pairs 210-218 are shown connecting the launches in row 2 of the first footprint 220 to corresponding launches in row 2 of the second footprint 230. Each differential signal pair 210-218 has a pair of corresponding signal traces 240-258. Although only differential signal trace pairs 210-218 are show for clarity, each differential signal pair in each row of the first footprint 220 may be connected to each corresponding differential signal pair in each corresponding row of the second footprint 230 in a substantially similar<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> manner. In addition, although the connections between the first and second footprints 220 and 230 are illustrated as implemented on a backplane 200, any suitable implementation can be made, such as on a midplane or a daughter card.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The first differential signal trace pair 210 includes traces 240 and 242 that extend between the first footprint 220 and the second footprint 230. The first trace 240 connects at the positive "+" launch found in row 2, column J of the first and second footprints 220 and 230, and the second trace 242 connects at the negative "-" launch found in row 2, column J of the first and second footprints 220 and 230. Thus, the first trace 240 connects from a positive "+" launch to a positive launch "+", or P-P, and the second trace 242 connects from a negative "-" launch to a negative launch "-", or N-N. That direct P to P and N to N mapping from one launch to another is the way connectors are conventionally connected to each other on a backplane and is generally referred to herein as a "straight connection."</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In the present invention, that straight connection is utilized for every other differential signal trace pair extending between the first and second footprints 220 and 230 of the backplane 200, such as for the third differential signal trace pair 213. However, every other differential signal trace pair 212, 214, 216, and 218 between the straight connections has a reverse connection, whereby the connections of its traces are reversed. For example, the differential signal trace pair 212 has two traces 244 and 246. The first trace 244 connects at the positive "+" launch found in row 2, column I of the first footprint 220, while the other end of the first trace 244 connects at the negative "-" launch in row 2, column I of the second footprint 230. And, the second trace 246 connects at the negative "-" launch in row 2, column I of the first footprint 220, while the other end of the second trace 246 connects at the positive "+" launch in row 2, column I of the second footprint 230. Thus, the first trace 244 connects from a positive "+" launch of the first footprint 220 to a negative "-" launch of the second footprint 230, or P-N, and the second trace 246 connects from a negative "-" launch of<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the first footprint 220 to positive launch "+" of the second footprint, or N-P. Connecting the launches in that reverse fashion is referred to herein generally as a "reverse connection." The connections of the traces are able to be reversed because the signal on each trace of the differential signal pairs is immaterial. It is the voltage difference on those pairs that is measured and not the signal on any one trace.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">A trace that has a straight connection has the same polarity at both ends because it extends from a launch of one polarity in the first footprint 220 to a launch in the second footprint 230 with the same polarity, i.e., P-P or N-N. By contrast, a trace that has a reverse connection has opposite polarity connections at its ends because it extends from a positive "+" launch in the first footprint 220 to a negative launch "-"in the second footprint 230, and vice versa, i.e., P-N and N-P. And, by using a reverse connection for every other differential signal trace pair on the backplane 200, the forward crosstalk pulse generated in a connector at the second footprint 230 is the opposite polarity to the crosstalk pulse generated in a connector at the first footprint 220. Accordingly, the crosstalk generated in the connector attached at the first footprint 220 is cancelled by the crosstalk generated in the connector attached at the second footprint 230.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(a)</figref>, a backplane connection system 300 is shown that incorporates the backplane of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. The system has a first connector 310, a second connector 320, and various differential signal trace pairs 210, 212, and 330-336. The first connector 310 is connected to input trace pairs 330 and 332 on a first daughter card. The second connector is connected to output trace pairs 334 and 336 on a second daughter card. And, because the system 300 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(a)</figref> employs the trace configuration of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, traces 210 and 212 are provided on the backplane 200 to connect the first connector 310 to the second connector 320, with trace pair 210 including traces 240 and 242 in a straight connection and trace pair 212 including traces 244 and 246 in a reverse connection. As with the system 100<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(a)</figref>, the bottom trace pairs 330, 212, and 334 are the aggressor trace pairs and the top trace pairs 332, 210, and 336 are the victim trace pairs.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Also as with <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, noise is created at the first connector 310, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3(b) and 3(c)</figref>, due to the crosstalk on the victim trace pair 332 from the aggressor trace pair 330. At that point, the signal has not reached the second connector 320, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(d)</figref>, so the total noise in the system 300 is due to the noise at the first connector 310, as shown <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(e)</figref>. Turning to <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(f)</figref>, the signal on the aggressor trace pair 212 has now reached the second connector 320. Since the aggressor trace pair 212 is reversed, the aggressor signal out from the first connector 310 has an inverse polarity with respect to the aggressor signal on the aggressor trace pair 330 into the first connector 310. In the illustrated example, the noise from the first connector 310 is positive, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(c)</figref>, and the noise from the second connector 320 is negative, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(h)</figref>.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The noise from the first connector 310 is present at the second connector 320, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(g)</figref>. In addition, the second connector 320 generates noise from the crosstalk on the aggressor trace 212 on the victim trace 210, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(h)</figref>. However, because the noise at the second connector 320 has an inverse polarity with respect to the noise that is present from the first connector 310, the noise from the second connector 320, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(h)</figref>, substantially cancels the noise from the first connector 310, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(g)</figref>, so that the total noise from the system 300 is substantially reduced, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(i)</figref>.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In practice, the total noise from the system 300 shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(a)</figref> is approximately ten percent (10%) of the total noise from the system 100 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(a)</figref>. Accordingly, if the total noise of a system 100 using only straight connections, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(i)</figref>, is 100 mV, then the total noise in a system 300 with alternating reverse connections, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(i)</figref>, is approximately 10 mV. And, although each trace pair (e.g., trace pair 213) will aggress the trace pairs on both sides of it (e.g., trace pairs 212 and 214), employing a reverse<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> connection for every other pair will offset the noise on both of those trace pairs (e.g., trace pair 210 will offset trace pair 212 and trace pair 213 will offset trace pair 214).</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">For the system 300 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(a)</figref>, it should be noted that reversing the connection of the aggressor trace pair 330 prior to the first connector 310 will not have the desired noise cancellation effect achieved by the reverse connection of trace pair 212. That is, if the aggressor pair 330 before the first connector 310 is reversed, and the victim trace pairs 332, 210, and 334 are all straight connections, the noise generated at the first and second connectors 310 and 320 will not cancel each other out because the noise will be the same polarity (i.e., negative) at each of the first and second connectors 310 and 320 so that the total noise will be a doubled negative value. Likewise, the reversal of the one or both of the trace pairs 334 and 336 after the second connector 320 will not operate to cancel the noise from the first connector 310.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">It should also be noted that the line length of the aggressor trace 212 should substantially match the line length of the victim trace 210 on the backplane 200 in order to attain maximum forward crosstalk cancellation. The tolerance between the lengths matching one another depends on the bit time or the width of the crosstalk pulse. For longer trace lengths, the losses in the trace widens the crosstalk pulse in time. And, because the crosstalk pulse has a larger time window, the tolerance to match the trace lengths between the victim pair and the aggressor pair is relaxed. On long traces, the noise pulse gets very wide in time. It is easier to align two very wide pulses with low amplitude than two narrow pulses with high amplitude.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">By way of example, for an aggressor trace length of about 13 inches, the matching trace length of the victim trace must be within about 1 inch, or from 12-14 inches in length. And, for a 10 gb signal, which has 100 picosecond bit time, the signals on the aggressor and victim lines must be within 25 picoseconds of each other. Otherwise, the noise on the first<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> and second connectors 310 and 320 might not fully align with one another and will not cancel each other.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(a)</figref>, the input trace pairs 330 and 332 connected to the first connector 310 need not be the same length as each other, and the output trace pairs 334 and 336 connected to the second connector 320 need not be the same length as each other. However, the victim trace pair 210 should be substantially the same length as the aggressor trace pair 212 between the first and second connectors 310 and 320. And, each of the traces 244 and 246 of the aggressor pair 212, as well as the traces 240 and 242 of the victim pair 210, should be approximately the same length. However, it should be noted that the traces of each pair, such as traces 245 and 247, need not be routed near each other and can be routed separate from one another. And, the traces of neighboring pairs need not be routed next to each other. Thus, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> for example, trace 244 cancels trace 242, even though those traces are routed apart from one another.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Although some crosstalk is generated between the traces on the backplane 200, that crosstalk is small compared to the amount of crosstalk that is generated at the connector footprints 220 and 230 and connectors 310 and 320, which is recognized at the vias in the backplane 200. Thus, it is not of particular importance that the traces themselves be physically close to one another, but the physical proximity of the vias to one another in the backplane 200 is of particular importance.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Returning to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the columns (A-J) are offset from one another in an alternating fashion to further reduce noise at the connector footprints 220 and 230. By offsetting the columns in that manner, the positive "+" launch in a succeeding column (e.g., column H, row 2) is moved further from the signal pair launches in the same row of the preceding column (e.g., column G, row 2) so that the signal pair launches in the preceding column couple primarily with the negative "-" launch in the same row of the succeeding column (e.g.,<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> column H, row 2). That coupling is illustrated by dashed lines in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. And, although the illustrated offset pattern places the positive launch "+" in the succeeding column (e.g., column H, row 2) closer to a negative launch "-" in the preceding row of the preceding column (e.g., column G, row 1), the resulting noise on the negative launch "-" in the preceding row and column causes less total noise in the system 300 than perfectly aligned signal pair launches. The resulting noise on the negative launch "-" of the preceding row and column can be further reduced by inserting a second ground connection between each signal pair launch to create more spacing between rows (not shown).</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Although offsetting the columns (A-J) of each footprint 220 and 230 of the backplane 200 reduce the noise aggressed on each signal pair launch by the other, that noise additively increases at each connection made in the system 300. Thus, the noise generated between the launches that connect the second connector 320 to the victim trace pair 210 and aggressor trace pair 212 in the backplane 200 is doubled when added to the noise generated between the launches that connect the second connector 320 to the victim trace pair 336 and aggressor trace pair 334 in the second daughter board. In the backplane 200, the P-N switching of traces cancels the noise generated between the vias in the first and second footprints 220 and 230.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">For example, the coupling between the signal pair launch in column G, row 2 and the negative "-" launch in column H, row 2 of the first footprint 220 is cancelled by the coupling between the signal pair launch in column G, row 2 and the negative "-" launch in column H, row 2 of the second footprint 230 because the polarity of the signal pair launch in column G, row 2 of the second footprint 230 is reverse that of the signal pair launch in column G, row 2 of the first footprint 220. That type of noise cancellation, however, is far more difficult for the noise generated between the vias in the backplane 200 and the vias in a daughter card<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> because those connections are not made with traces, but rather with densely configured connectors.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">As <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> illustrates, the backplane 200 may be connected to a daughter card 400 (representing either the first daughter card or second daughter card discussed above) using a right-angle connector 410. A plurality of first attachment mechanisms 420 extend through the vias of the launches in the backplane 200 and a plurality of second attachment mechanisms 440 extends through the vias of the launches in the daughter card 400. The first and second attachment mechanisms 420 and 440 may be formed as substantially any suitable electrical attachment type, such as surface-mount or compliant pin attachments. Although <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig, 4</figref> illustrates a right-angle connector wherein the daughter card 400 is perpendicular to the backplane 200, a straight connector may also be used wherein the daughter card 400 is parallel to the backplane 200.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">As <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> illustrates not according to the invention, there may be circumstances where noise in the backplane 200 compounds the noise in the daughter card 400. In <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, the pattern of launches in the connector footprint on the daughter card 400 (hereinafter "the DC Footprint") matches the pattern of launches on the first footprint 220 and/or second footprint 230 on the backplane 200 (hereinafter "the BP Footprint"). The lines extending between the DC Footprint and the DC Footprint represent signal conductors 720 (<figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>). And. as discussed above, the launches between the differential signal pairs are ground connections, shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> as blacked-out launches, that are provided between each differential signal pair to create spacing between each differential signal pair so the two launches in each differential signal pair are located closer to each other than to neighboring differential signal pairs, which permits better coupling within the differential signal pairs while reducing crosstalk from adjacent signal pairs.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As a result of the DC Footprint matching BP Footprint, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, the same coupling that occurs on the backplane 200 occurs on the daughter card 400. For example, the signal pair launches in column G, row 2 of the BP Footprint couple primarily with the closest signal launch (i.e. the negative "-" launch) in column H, row 2 of the BP Footprint. Similarly, the signal pair launches in column G, row 2 of the DC Footprint couple primarily with the negative "-" launch in column H, row 2 of the DC Footprint. Those couplings are illustrated by dashed lines in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>. There may also be some coupling (not shown) between the signal pair launches in column G, row 2 and the positive "+" launch in column H, row 3. The coupling that occurs at the BP Footprint is substantially the same as the coupling at the DC Footprint, and the two add together to substantially double the resulting noise in the system 300.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">To address that noise in the DC Footprint, the present invention provides P-N switching between the DC Footprint and the BP Footprint by reversing the pattern of the DC Footprint with respect to the BP Footprint. As <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> illustrates, the pattern of launches in the DC Footprint is offset in a reverse configuration from the pattern of launches in the BP Footprint. The signal pair launches in column G, row 2 of the BP Footprint couple primarily with the negative "-" launch in column H, row 2 of the BP Footprint. However, coupling between the signal pair launch in column G, row 2 of the DC Footprint is now with the positive "+" launch in column H, row 2 of the DC Footprint (rather than the negative "-" launch, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>). The polarity of the launch in column H, row 2 with which the signal pair launch in column G, row 2 is switched from a negative "-" launch in the BP Footprint to a positive "+" launch in the DC Footprint. Thus, the differential signal pair in the BP Footprint couples with a negative "-" launch, whereas the corresponding differential pair in the DC Footprint couples with a positive "+" launch. That P-N reversal acts to cancel (rather than add) the noise caused by the coupling between vias in those footprints. In<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> addition, the signal pair launch in column G, row 2 is closer to the negative "-" launch in column H, row 1 in the DC Footprint while the signal pair launch in column G, row 2 is closer to the positive "+" launch in column H, row 3 in the BP Footprint, which reduces the additive nature of any coupling with the positive "+" launch in column H, row 3 in the DC Footprint to any coupling with the positive "+" launch in the BP Footprint. The coupling described between the differential pair in column G, row 2 and the launches in column H, rows 2 and 3 is substantially similar to that in column G, rows 1, 3, and 4 and the respective launches in column H.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">To accommodate the reversed offset patterns on the BP Footprint and the DC Footprint, the connector 410 is formed with at least two different lead frames 700 and 710, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>. Each of the lead frames 700 and 710 includes a plurality of signal conductors 720. The signal conductors 720 of the first lead frame 700 are configured to connect the launches in column G of the BP Footprint to the corresponding launches in column G of the DC Footprint. And, the signal conductors 720 of the second lead frame 710 are configured to connect the launches in column H of the BP Footprint to the corresponding launches in column H of the DC Footprint. And, in the DC Footprint, the differential signal pair in column G, row 2 is now closest to the positive "+" launch in column H, row 2 (rather than the negative "-" launch, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>). Thus, by reversing the pattern of launches on the DC Footprint (rather than reversing the signal conductors 720 within the connector 410) in a similar manner to the traces on the backplane 200, the structure of each of the lead frames 700 and 710 can remain simple and compact.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>, each signal conductor 720 includes an attachment mechanism 440 at one end and a mating portion 730 at the other end.

Each lead frame 700 and 710 may be formed in an insulated with the attachment<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> mechanisms 440 and a mating portions 730 extending therefrom so as to form individual wafers 450 (<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>). Those wafers 450 may be configured to be ganged together in an alternating fashion between wafers 450 enclosing a first lead frame 700 and wafers enclosing a second lead frame 710 to match the reverse pattern of the BP Footprint and DC Footprint. The wafers 450 may be held together with a carrier strip (not shown) or other convenient mechanism and inserted into a molded housing 460 (<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>) mounted on the backplane 200.
