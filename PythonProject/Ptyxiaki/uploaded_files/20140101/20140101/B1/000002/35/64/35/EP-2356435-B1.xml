The piping used to form the pipelines is coated to prevent corrosion. In fact, the coating integrity of the buried pipes is crucial to the prevention of outside surface (i.e., outside diameter (OD)) corrosion.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A disbonded coating defeats the security provided by cathodic protection on the pipe. The cathodic protection currents can no longer flow out through the coating to the cover soil as intended. Disbonds that are not repaired can lead to moisture ingression between the coating and the outer surface of the pipe, which can eventually result in corrosion and/or stress-corrosion cracking of the pipe. For a detailed understanding the effects of disbonds in pipeline coatings the reader is directed to the article <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Crude Oil Pipeline Rupture, Pipeline Investigation Report P99H0021, Transportation Safety Board of Canada, March 2002</text></nplcit>.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Corroded surfaces and stress-corrosion cracking along the pipe are much more costly to repair than simply repairing an area of the pipe having a coating that is disbonded. As a result, early detection of pipeline coating disbonds is necessary to maintain the integrity of a pipeline.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The detection and characterization of disbonded and/or defective coating using EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) is well known. For example, the article entitled "<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Evaluation of Organic Coatings with Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy" by Loveday, et al., JCT Coatings Tech, October 2004, pp. 88-93</text></nplcit> describes the general application of EIS to coatings.

Displaying the data on Nyquist and Bode plots can reveal substantial information about the properties of the coating. Commercial software is available for fitting Nyquist-plot data to operator-selected equivalent circuits of the coating interface. The values of the resulting circuit components can reveal direct information on coating properties.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Application of EIS to pipeline coating inspection has been reported in an article entitled "<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="b"><text>The Study of Detection Technology and Instrument of Buried Pipeline Coating Defects", by Shijiu, et al., Proceedings of the 4th World Congress on Intelligent Control and<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> Automation, Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, 2001, pp.794-98</text></nplcit>.

In an article by <nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>Murphy, J. C., et al., entitled "Magnetic Field Measurement of Corrosion Processes", Journal of the Electrochemical Society, Vol. 135, No. 2, February 1988, pp. 310-313</text></nplcit>, it is disclosed that this problem of having to first excavate the pipes has been circumvented by the development of MEIS (Magnetically-detected Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy).</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">MEIS uses above-ground magnetometers to measure on-pipe current resulting from applying an AC voltage between the pipe and a remote ground-return electrode. A reference electrode is placed on the soil adjacent to the pipe. The actual pipe-to-soil voltage can be measured via this electrode independently of the effects of earthing resistance of the ground-return electrode.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The pipe-to-soil impedance of a segment of pipe can be determined by measuring the on-pipe current via a magnetometer sequentially positioned at two locations defining the ends of the segment, followed by calculating the differential net AC impedance of the segment. The pipe-to-reference electrode voltage is utilized along with the on-pipe current for these calculations. This procedure is described in the above-identified Murphy article which discloses: a) MEIS-measured Bode and Nyquist plots for each end of a pipe segment; and b) the resultant Bode and Nyquist plots for the segment itself. This procedure is also described in an article by<nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text> Srinivasan, R. et al., entitled "Corrosion Detection on Underground Gas<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> Pipeline by Magnetically Assisted AC Impedance", Materials Performance, vol. 30, no. 3, NACE, Houston, TX, 1991, pp. 14-18</text></nplcit>.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Standard EIS analysis techniques can be then be applied to the pipe-segment's impedance. The equivalent circuit of the segment's pipe-to-soil interface can be determined via conventional analysis of Bode and Nyquist plots of this impedance data. This analysis can utilize a Randles equivalent circuit or other equivalent circuit of the coating interface. The component values of the equivalent circuit can be analyzed to determine integrity of the coating, including degree of disbond or damage, as reported in the above mentioned articles by Kendig, et al. and Shijiu, et al.

GENERAL BACKGROUND OF MEIS APPARATUS</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">One configuration of a pipe coating inspection system includes a Pipe Scanner Subsystem and a Magnetically-detected Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (MEIS) Subsystem. This system can be used to periodically test for pipeline faults and coating disbonds.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The Pipe Scanner Subsystem is intended for rapid screening of pipelines. It has the potential to identify areas where injected current is exiting the pipe in an abnormal manner, indicating a possible compromised or unbonded coating.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The MEIS Subsystem can then be used to further characterize the suspect area. As further used herein, "MEIS" is an abbreviation for Magnetic Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. It is an extension of an EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) procedure, which characterizes corrosion by direct electrical contact with the corrosion site. In contrast to EIS, MEIS performs remote measurements using a magnetometer to detect current flow in the test object, e.g., section of pipe under test. MEIS characterizes the coating by multi-frequency analysis of the complex electrical impedance between the pipe and soil. The results can be plotted on a Nyquist plot to characterize disbonds, holidays and/or micro-cracks in the pipe coating.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Pipe scanning activity consists of data acquisition, namely, a field operator walking along the pipeline and recording on-pipe current. This can be augmented by also recording GPS location and time for each measurement point using a system data collector, and then analyzing this data with a Geographical Information System (GIS). For data acquisition, the operator can be equipped with a commercially available pipeline current mapper (PCM), a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, and a data collector, which includes specialized software suitable for this application.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Data can be uploaded from the data collector to a system computer for analysis. The system computer includes a pipeline data analysis program which can generate a graphical user interface (GUI) that exhibits the data on the display panel for inspection. However, the prior graphical user interfaces do not feature a combined display of a digitally-referenced map of the scanning area with data locations overlaid on the map, a pipeline current plot, and several lines of data in a spreadsheet format under the plot, wherein these displays are linked, so that the selected location is highlighted in all three views on the GUI. Accordingly, there is a need for a graphical user interface to enable a user to examine the pipeline current plot for<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> indications of coating anomalies, such that initial decisions on coating quality and locations for subsequent MEIS testing can be made based on identifying areas where the on-pipe current deviates from its normal rate of exponential decay with distance from the transmitter.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The results of the MEIS subsystem responses vary depending on the particular soil environments in which the pipes are buried. In order to enhance a field test operator's ability to comprehend the results of the testing plotted on a Nyquist plot, it is desirable to enable the test operator to simulate various coating conditions in a laboratory or bench environment prior to conducting the actual testing in the field. Therefore, there is a need for a bench test simulator for simulating various types of disbonds while in the laboratory. There is also a need for a field test simulator for simulating various types of disbonds while in the field.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">It has been observed that some pipes can carry substantial amounts of power line ground-return current. In some cases, the 60 Hz signal component in the magnetometer output can overdrive the MEIS system input, or can mask the much lower level of MEIS current.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">One solution includes stop-band filtering at 60 Hz. However, this technique is not highly practical for the MEIS subsystem because the filter will interfere with other MEIS test frequencies in proximity to 60 Hz. Another solution is digital signal processing such as a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), after which the offending signal components can be deleted. However, this requires an input dynamic range large enough to acquire a large 60 Hz interfering signal, while still having adequate resolution for the small MEIS signal. This is not practical with certain potentiostat circuitry used for MEIS. Therefore, there is a need for an improved method and apparatus to suppress the unwanted signal to overcome the disadvantages of the 60 Hz power line signals.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">It has been further observed that soils with subsurface saltwater can adversely alter the measurements of the MEIS subsystem in terms of both attenuation and phase shift between the injection point (End-1) and the next cathodic protection (CP) test point or pipe access point (End-2). This indicates that the voltage may obey a complex propagation constant similar to that which would be encountered on an electric transmission line. This also means that standard MEIS may be impractical in these types of soil conditions because the pipe voltage at the test segment location can not be inferred by measuring the voltage at remote CP test points or other pipe access points. Accordingly, there is a need to provide an alternative approach to estimate the voltage at the MEIS test segment location.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">The present invention relates an apparatus &amp; method for simulating electrical pipe-to soil impedance of a coated segment of a pipeline according to independent claim 1 and 5 respectively.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the present invention, a pipeline simulator is provided for simulating electrical pipe-to-soil impedance of a coated segment of a pipeline.

ability to estimate the condition of the pipe coating at selected locations of the pipe. The estimates can be provided using well-known MEIS techniques to measure the net complex impedance of the pipe-to-soil junction for a segment of pipe, such as described in the aforementioned Murphy and Srinivasan references. The impedance is measured over a range of frequencies, and the results can be plotted on graphical displays such as Nyquist or Bode plots. Alternatively, the complex admittance of the data (inverse of impedance) can be plotted. Analysis of the plots using long-established EIS methods can be used to potentially reveal the following coating properties: normal bonds, disbonds (with potential differentiation between air-filled, water-filled, and corrosion product in the disbond area), holidays and micro-cracking. Although the present invention is described herein as being used to estimate the condition of a pipeline coating, a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> present invention is also applicable to other buried metal structures having a coating that is subject to corrosion or deterioration caused by its environment.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a pipeline inspection system 100 includes a field condition monitor 102, a bench test simulator 104, and field test simulators 106. The simulators 104 and 106 can be used to calibrate and/or test the MEIS system in both the laboratory and the field. That is, the simulators 104 and 106 enable a test operator to set up parameters that are seen in the field and observe the results to improve actual detection of coating defects.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The field condition monitor 102 includes a pipe scanner subsystem 200 and a magnetic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (MEIS) subsystem 300 respectively illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>. The Pipe Scanner Subsystem 200 is used for rapid screening of pipelines, and has the potential to identify areas where current is exiting the pipe in an abnormal manner, indicating possible compromised or disbonded coating. The MEIS Subsystem 300 is used to further characterize the suspect area as, for example, a disbond (e.g., air filled or moisture filled disbond) a holiday or micro-cracking of the pipeline coating. The MEIS subsystem 300 characterizes the coating by multi-frequency analysis of the complex electrical impedance between the pipe and soil.</p><heading id="h0007">Pipe Scanner Subsystem</heading><p id="p0033" num="0033">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the Pipe Scanner Subsystem 200 includes a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver 202, a Pipeline Current Mapper (PCM) 204, a computerized data logger (collector) 206, and an optional computer device 208, such as a laptop computer or other computer device having a conventional display panel. The GPS receiver 202 and PCM<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> 204 are coupled to input ports of the data collector 206. The optional computer device 208 is coupled to a port of the data collector 206 for uploading of post-test data.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The GPS receiver 202 can be any well-known GPS system, such as a TRIMBLE GPS PATHFINDER™ manufactured by Trimble Navigation Limited of Sunnyvale, CA, USA. The PCM 204 can be any well-known pipeline current mapper, such as a PCMPLUS+ manufactured by Radiodetection Ltd, of Bristol, UK. The data collector 206 can be any well-known data collector, such as a RANGER data collector produced by TRIPOD DATA SYSTEMS of Corvallis OR, USA. It is noted that a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that other equipment manufacturers of the GPS receiver, pipeline current mapper and data collector can also be utilized to provide current and geographical measurements of the pipeline.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The data collector 206 can be a hand-held computer device with one or more input ports, allowing it to simultaneously connect to the PCM and the GPS systems, Alternatively, a combination hand-held computer with integral GPS features, such as the TRIMBLE GEOXT manufactured by Trimble Navigation Limited of Sunnyvale, CA, USA, can be utilized. In one embodiment, the data collector 206 includes a WINDOWS® type operating system, such as WINDOWS CE®, although such operating system is not considered limiting. The data collector 206 further includes a display panel, at least one output port, a control panel (e.g., keyboard and function buttons), and an application program (e.g., PIPESCAN) stored in memory thereof for collecting and displaying location information from the GPS receiver 202 and other data.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The pipeline current mapper 204 includes a transmitter 220, receiver 222 and a magnetometer 224 that are used for measuring injected on-pipe current from the buried pipeline. During pipe scanning operations, the pipe is electrically driven with the transmitter of the PCM system<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> 204. The transmitter 220 is temporarily connected in place of the nearest cathodic protection rectifier or can be connected between any cathodic protection test point on the pipe and a suitable ground-return electrode (e.g., ground rod). In one embodiment, all three test frequencies available in the commercial PCM can be utilized, which include 4Hz for on-pipe current and pipe depth readings; 8Hz which is used in conjunction with 4 Hz data for determining current direction; and a locator frequency which is used to find the pipe and to center the PCM over the pipe prior to taking readings. In one embodiment, the locator frequency can be selected at 512 Hz or 135 Hz. The pipe scanning activity is conducted using only two frequencies, preferably 4 Hz and 135 Hz, to maximize the allowable distance between the system and the transmitter.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The PCM receiver 222 is preferably a portable receiver used to both locate the buried pipeline and measure on-pipe current. The receiver 222 provides the operator with measurement of pipe depth, as well as strength and direction of the current injected by the system's transmitter. The receiver's internal magnetometers 224 detect all on-pipe current. When a PCM measurement is taken, the data collector 206 stores a unique identification (e.g., log) number associated with the current as measured in milliamps and dB, current direction, as well as depth of the pipeline (illustratively measured in centimeters). In this manner, as the field operator walks along the pipeline, the data collector 206 is used to save the PCM measurements at each test location.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">During the data analysis phase, the measured data can be uploaded from the data collector 206 to the system computer 208 via a serial or USB port for analysis.
