The invention also relates to a method for providing a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) functionality in a communications network between a first node and a second node. Further, the invention relates to an enhanced eNodeB of a Radio Access Network (RAN) of an Evolved Packet System (EPS) network, a program and a computer program product, the enhanced eNodeB providing a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) functionality in a communications network between a first node and a second node.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks are known to provide Ethernet connectivity or backhauling network signaling and traffic in Radio Access Networks (RAN). Traditionally, Ethernet connectivity services are provided by Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network operators to connect Ethernet networks located at different sites. The current model for providing Ethernet connectivity service is to use Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) technology, where Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) specific equipment is installed at the sites that should be connected. These remote devices are then connected via a wired connection to additional network operator equipment that implements a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network to provide a transparent Ethernet connectivity between the sites where the remote devices are installed.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks are also used to connect the eNodeB infrastructure of mobile network operators operating Evolved Packet Systems (EPS) or Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks. In this scheme, the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network provides a connection between the remote sites where the mobile network operator equipment is located and the central office site.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A drawback of known Evolved Packet System (EPS) infrastructure such as eNodeB systems is that no transparent Ethernet connectivity service can be provided via the Long Term Evolution (LTE) air interface. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2009115132A"><text>WO 2009/115132</text></patcit> discloses a system for providing MPLS functionality in a communications network. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US2003142643A"><text>US 2003/142643</text></patcit> discloses a system for applying a MPLS network established by multiple differentiated service domains in GPRS.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">An object of the present invention is to provide a system for realizing a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) functionality in a communications network between a first node and a second node via a wireless connection between a first wireless interface and a second wireless interface within the framework of a Radio Access Network (RAN) of an Evolved Packet System (EPS).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The object of the present invention is achieved by a system for providing a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) functionality in a communications network between a first node and a second node via a wireless connection between a first wireless interface and a second wireless interface, wherein the system comprises an enhanced eNodeB of a Radio Access Network (RAN) of an Evolved Packet System (EPS) network, the enhanced eNodeB providing the first wireless interface, and wherein the system comprises a user equipment connected to the second node, the user equipment providing the second wireless interface, wherein preferably the enhanced eNodeB is a Label Edge Router (LER) of a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) domain and wherein the user equipment is configured to encapsulate Ethernet data frames into LTE PDCP protocol data units.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is thereby advantageously possible to effectively deploy Ethernet connectivity services by means of enhanced eNodeB devices. The reach of Ethernet services provided by Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks can thereby be extended beyond the site where mobile network equipment is located, namely via the wireless radio interface until the remote site demanding Ethernet connectivity service. Historically, mobile (cellular) networks have not been used to provide Ethernet connectivity services due to a lack of bandwidth and quality of the air interface (resulting in a lack of guaranteed quality of service) and the incompatibility of the infrastructure operated by mobile operators with Ethernet connectivity services. The deployment of Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks (Evolved Packet Systems (EPS)) provides an infrastructure where the current bandwidth limitations for the delivery of Ethernet connectivity services are solved. Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks provide a network with bandwidth of many megabytes per second and also a set of Quality-of-Service (QoS) parameters that allow the provisioning of a wireless connection via the air interface to a remote site with the quality needed for Ethernet connectivity.

According to the present invention, a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) functionality is provided between the first node 13 and the second node 23 or - in other words - the first and second node 13, 23 are connected using a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network. Thereby, it is possible according to the present invention to<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> deliver an Ethernet connectivity service between the first and second node 13, 23 by enhancing the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network with a wireless connection. According to the present invention, this wireless connection is based on a standard technology or a Radio Access Network (RAN) of an Evolved Packet System (EPS). Very preferably, the wireless connection 3 is based on standard Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology. This means that the second node 23 is located in remote site and is connected wirelessly by means of an enhanced eNodeB of the Radio Access Network (RAN). The Radio Access Network (RAN) is assigned to reference numeral 30. An enhanced eNodeB 11 is assigned to reference numeral 11. The wireless connection 3 is realized between a first wireless interface 12 of the enhanced eNodeB 11 and a second wireless interface 22 of a specific device 21 which is hereinafter also called mobile station 21 or user equipment 21. The wirelessly connected remote site is hereinafter also called second network area and assigned to reference numeral 2.

This means that the enhanced eNodeB 11 extends the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network beyond the mobile station 21 reaching the second node 23 in the second network area 2. The enhanced eNodeB actively participates in the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network by managing Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) labels with other Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) nodes and by allocating Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) labels to connections of specific remote sites.

This means that the enhanced eNodeB 11 is (with respect to its Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network behavior or parameters) also controlled by the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) operator unit 15. The control of the wireless connection 3 of the enhanced eNodeB 11 is realized by an equipment of the Radio Access Network (RAN) 30, i.e. a mobile operator equipment assigned to reference numeral 31.

The mobile operator equipment 31 is located at a site of the mobile operator operating the Radio Access Network (RAN) 30 whereas the operator unit 15 located at the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network operator site.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">According to the present invention, it is possible that also the first node 13 is located in a remote site and connected wirelessly (by means of another wireless connection) but for the sake of simplicity, this case is not represented in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">According to the present invention, the enhanced eNodeB 11 uses a reserved Long Term Evolution (LTE) bearer assigned to be used for the communication with the user equipment 21 (or mobile station 21) via the wireless connection 3. A reserved Long Term Evolution (LTE) bearer is a Long Term Evolution (LTE) bearer that is not used by other eNodeB nodes 110 present in the Radio Access Network (RAN). Such an assigned bearer is preferably an exclusive Ethernet connectivity specific Long Term Evolution (LTE) bearer, i.e. only used for the transmission of data connected with the Ethernet connectivity service between the enhanced eNodeB 11 and the user equipment 21.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">According to the present invention, the user equipment 21 (or remote equipment 21) is connected via a wireless interface, e.g. a Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless interface, to the mobile operator's network infrastructure, i.e. to the enhanced eNodeB 11. The control plane of the remote equipment 21 is the same as for Long Term Evolution (LTE) connections / devices. A connection to the wireless operator infrastructure is established when the remote equipment 21 is turned on or restarted. According to the present invention, the user plane at the remote equipment 21 is able to encapsulate Ethernet frames into Long Term Evolution (LTE) PDCP protocol data units, and forward them over the air interfaces 12, 22 of the wireless connection 3, i.e. to the (Ethernet connectivity service) enhanced eNodeB via RLC (Radio Link Control), MAC (Medium Access Control) and PHY (Physical Layer) protocols. The forwarding of Ethernet frames is made via a communication channel established between the remode equipment 21 and the enhanced eNodeB 11 (base station according to the Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard). Data transfer via the radio or wireless interface 3 preferably follows the Long Term Evolution (LTE) Uu interface standard. The<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> protocol stack for the Long Term Evolution (LTE) control plane conforms to the protocol stacks defined by 3GPP.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Furthermore according to the present invention, the enhanced eNodeB 11 is enhanced (compared to a conventional eNodeB node 110 according to the 3GPP specified functionality and protocols for the eNodeB) by means of two sets of enhancements in order to allow the integration of Ethernet connectivity service enhanced eNodeB 11 within the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network. These enhancements can be implemented in the existing eNodeB, or by additional system deployed at the same site as the eNodeB. The first set of enhancements refers to the extension of a 3GPP conform eNodeB (not enhanced) to terminate the Long Term Evolution (LTE) bearers at the site of the eNodeB. Thereby, an enhance eNodeB 11 according to the present invention avoids that the traffic from a specific bearer received via the radio interface is forwarded to the core sites of the Radio Access Network (RAN) 30 for further processing. This can be achieved by extending the capability of a 3GPP conform eNodeB, or by deploying appropriate equipment at the same site as the eNodeB. In both cases, the node supporting the Ethernet connectivity service is called the (Ethernet connectivity service) enhanced eNodeB 11. The (Ethernet connectivity service) enhanced eNodeB 11 has the same interfaces as specified by 3GPP for the interfaces (called S1-MME) between an eNodeB and the Mobility Management Entity (MME), the same interfaces specified by 3GPP for the interfaces (called S11) between a Signalling Gateway (S-GW) and the Mobility Management Entity (MME), and also the same interface (called Gx) between the Packet Data Network Gateway (PDN-GW) and the Policy Charging Rule Function (PCRF). The second set of enhancements to the (Ethernet connectivity service) enhanced eNodeB 11 is in the area of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) support. These enhancements consist in support of protocols and mechanisms needed to implement Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks. The (Ethernet connectivity service) enhanced eNodeB 11 supports Internet Protocol (IP) routing protocols as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System Protocol), and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). The (Ethernet connectivity service) enhanced eNodeB can handle Label Distribution Protocols in order to participate in a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network acting as a Label Edge Router (LER). It assigns Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) labels to the Ethernet frames received via the communication channel established to the remote equipment 21 over the Long Term Evolution (LTE) air interface (or wireless connection 3). This second set of enhancements can be achieved by extending the capability of a 3GPP conform eNodeB, or by deploying appropriate equipment at the same site as the eNodeB.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0041" num="0041">According to the present invention, it is furthermore preferred that the Long Term Evolution (LTE) infrastructure of the Radio Access Network (RAN) is enhanced such that Ethernet connectivity services can be provided. Thereby, it is preferred according to the present invention that an (Ethernet connectivity service) specific Long Term Evolution (LTE) bearer is signaled to the remote equipment 21 (or user equipment 21) and to the (Ethernet connectivity service) enhanced eNodeB 11. This specific Long Term Evolution (LTE) bearer terminates the connection at the enhanced eNodeB 11 site and does not forward the encapsulated Ethernet frames to core sites of the Radio Access Network (RAN) 30. Other eNodeB 110 (not enhanced eNodeB 11) that do not support Ethernet connectivity services are preferably not able to establish this specific bearer.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The Home Subscriber Server (HSS) and Mobility Management Entity (MME) as well as the (Ethernet connectivity service) enhanced eNodeB 11 do not provide support for handover of such wireless connections 3 to other eNodeB nodes 110. If the remote equipment 21 intends to connect to another enhanced eNodeB, it needs to be disconnected from the enhanced eNodeB 11 and reconnected to a new enhanced eNodeB 11.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The Policy Charging Rule Function (PCRF) of the Radio Access Network (RAN) 30 provides the parameters to the (Ethernet connectivity service) enhanced eNodeB 11 that corresponds to the Ethernet connectivity service. These parameters define the priority of the Ethernet connectivity service, and the bandwidth to be allocated for the Ethernet connectivity service.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044"><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Figure 2</b></figref> shows schematically another representation of the connection between the first and second node 13, 23 via the wireless connection 3. The connection is preferably an Ethernet connection between the first and second node 13, 23. A Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) tunnel defines a path through the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network in the first network area 1. Between the first node 13 and the enhanced eNodeB 11, preferably an Ethernet connection 14 is established through the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network comprising network elements 16 and 17. In the second network area 2, an Ethernet connection 24 is established between the remote equipment 21 and the second node 23.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045"><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Figure 3</b></figref> shows schematically the protocol stack of the second node 23, the remote equipment 21, the enhanced eNodeB 11, the Label Edge Router (LER) 17 of the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network and the first node 13. Reference numeral 41 refers to the PHY layer, i.e. the physical layer of the OSI reference model. Reference numeral 42 refers to the MAC layer, i.e. the Medium Access Connection layer of the OSI reference model. Reference numeral 43 refers to the RLC layer, i.e. the Radio Link Control.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> Reference numeral 44 refers to the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) layer. Reference numeral 45 refers to the Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP). Reference numeral 46 refers to an Ethernet connection. It is clearly visible that both the first node 13 and the second node 23 provided with an Ethernet connectivity service via a transparent Ethernet connection between the remote equipment 21 and the Label Edge Router (LER) 17 of the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network via the wireless connection 3. Especially, there is no Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity between any of the involved parties or nodes, particularly not between the enhanced eNodeB 11 and the remote equipment 21 over the Long Term Evolution (LTE) radio connection. Thereby, it is advantageously possible to greatly reduce the overhead signalization and overhead protocol handling required when using such an Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56978219" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>System zur Bereitstellung
