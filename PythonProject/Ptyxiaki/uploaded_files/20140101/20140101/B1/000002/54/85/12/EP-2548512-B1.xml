elastography is known (for example, see Patent Literature 1). The ultrasonic elastography is a technology which makes use of the fact that cancer tissues or tumor tissues inside a body have different hardness depending on the disease progression or depending on the body nature. In this technology, while continually applying external compression to the screening location, the strain amount or the degree of elasticity of the body tissues at the screening location is measured using ultrasonic sound waves, and the measurement result is displayed in the form of cross-sectional images.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">Patent Literature 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2005122906A"><text>WO/2005/122906</text></patcit></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US2006079780A1"><text>US 2006/079780 A1</text></patcit> discloses an ultrasonic imaging apparatus capable of generating ultrasonic images including boundaries between different tissues and regions divided by the boundaries in which property of boundaries and the respective tissues can be distinctly identified.

configuration of an ultrasonic diagnosis apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention. An ultrasonic diagnosis apparatus 1 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is an apparatus for determining tissue characterizations of target specimens for diagnosis using ultrasonic sound waves.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The ultrasonic diagnosis apparatus 1 includes an ultrasonic probe 2 that outputs an ultrasonic pulse to the outside and receives an ultrasonic echo obtained by reflection on the outside; a transmitting-receiving unit 3 that transmits electrical signals to and receives electrical signals from the ultrasonic probe 2; a processing unit 4 that performs predetermined processing on electrical echo signals which are obtained by means of conversion of the ultrasonic echo; an image processing unit<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> 5 that generates image data corresponding to the electrical echo signals which are obtained by means of conversion of the ultrasonic echo; an input unit 6 that is configured with an interface such as a keyboard, a mouse, or a touch-sensitive panel, and that receives input of a variety of information; a display unit 7 that is configured with a liquid crystal display panel or an organic EL display panel, and that displays a variety of information including the images generated by the image processing unit 5; a memory unit 8 that is used to store a variety of information including the information related to tissue characterizations of known specimens; and a control unit 9 that controls the operations of the ultrasonic diagnosis apparatus 1.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The ultrasonic probe 2 converts electrical pulse signals that are received from the transmitting-receiving unit 3 into ultrasonic pulse (acoustic pulse signals), and includes a signal converting unit 21 for converting the ultrasonic echo that is obtained by reflection from an outside specimen into electrical echo signals. Meanwhile, the ultrasonic probe 2 can be configured to have an ultrasonic transducer performing scanning in a mechanical manner or can be configured to have a plurality of ultrasonic transducers performing scanning in an electronic manner.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The transmitting-receiving unit 3 is electrically connected to the ultrasonic probe 2. With that, the transmitting-receiving unit 3 transmits pulse signals to the ultrasonic probe 2 and receives echo signals representing reception signals from the ultrasonic probe 2. More particularly, based on a predetermined waveform and a predetermined transmission timing, the transmitting-receiving unit 3 generates pulse signals and transmits<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> those pulse signals to the ultrasonic probe 2.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The transmitting-receiving unit 3 includes a signal amplifying unit 31 for amplification of echo signals. With respect to echo signals that are used when the image processing unit 5 generates B-mode image data by converting the amplitude of the echo signals into luminance (hereinafter, referred to as "echo signals for B-mode images") and with respect to echo signals that are used by the processing unit 4 to perform processing (hereinafter, referred to as "echo signals for processing"), the signal amplifying unit 31 performs amplification with different gains. More particularly, with respect to the echo signals for B-mode images, the signal amplifying unit 31 performs sensitivity time control (STC) in which the gain is directly proportional to the reception depth of the echo signals. In contrast, with respect to the echo signals for processing, the signal amplifying unit 31 performs amplification with a constant gain irrespective of the reception depth. The signal amplifying unit 31 switches between performing amplification of echo signals for B-mode images and performing amplification of echo signals for processing in the units of frames or in the units of lines.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating a relationship between gains and reception depths of echo signals for B-mode images. Herein, with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, a reception depth z is calculated based on the elapsed time from the start of receiving ultrasonic sound waves. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, when the reception depth z is smaller than a threshold value z<sub>th</sub>, a gain β linearly increases from β<sub>0</sub> to β<sub>th</sub> accompanying the increase in the reception depth z. When the reception depth z is equal to or greater than the threshold value z<sub>th</sub>, the gain β remains constant at β<sub>th</sub>.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> The threshold value z<sub>th</sub> is a value at which most of the ultrasonic signals received from a specimen attenuate, and the noise becomes dominant. Meanwhile, more commonly, when the reception depth z is smaller than the threshold value z<sub>th</sub>, the gain β may monotonically increase accompanying the increase in the reception depth z.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram illustrating a relationship between gains and reception depths of echo signals for processing. With reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> too, in an identical manner to the case explained with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the reception depth z is calculated based on the elapsed time from the start of receiving ultrasonic sound waves. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, with respect to the echo signals for processing, the signal amplifying unit 31 performs amplification with a constant gain β<sub>1</sub> irrespective of the reception depth z.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The transmitting-receiving unit 3 performs operations such as filtering with respect to the echo signals amplified by the signal amplifying unit 31, performs A/D conversion of the echo signals to generate digital RF signals, and outputs those digital RF signals. Meanwhile, when the ultrasonic probe 2 is configured to have a plurality of ultrasonic transducers performing scanning in an electronic manner, the transmitting-receiving unit 3 is configured to include a multichannel circuit for performing beam synthesis corresponding to the ultrasonic transducers.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The processing unit 4 includes a frequency analyzing unit 41 that performs frequency analysis of echo signals by carrying out fast Fourier transformation (FFT) with respect to the digital RF signals that are output by the transmitting-receiving unit 3; includes a feature data extracting unit 42 performs attenuation correction and<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> approximation with respect to the frequency spectrum (power spectrum) calculated by the frequency analyzing unit 41 so that there is a decrease in the contribution of attenuation, which occurs due to the reception depth and the frequency of ultrasonic sound waves being propagated, and extracts feature data of a specimen; and includes a tissue characterization determining unit 43 that determines tissue characterization of a predetermined area of the specimen by referring to the feature data extracted by the feature data extracting unit 42.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The frequency analyzing unit 41 calculates a frequency spectrum with respect to each acoustic ray (line data) by performing FFT with respect to an FFT data group having a predetermined volume of data. Depending on the tissue characterization of a specimen, the frequency spectrum demonstrates a different tendency. That is because of the fact that a frequency spectrum has a correlation with the size, the density, and the acoustic impedance of the specimen that serves as a scatterer which scatters the ultrasonic sound waves.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The feature data extracting unit 42 further includes an approximating unit 421, which performs approximation with respect to the frequency spectrum calculated by the frequency analyzing unit 41 and calculates pre-correction feature data that is the feature data prior to performing attenuation correction; and includes an attenuation correcting unit 422, which extracts feature data by performing attenuation correction with respect to the pre-correction feature data obtained by approximation by the approximating unit 421.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The approximating unit 421 performs linear approximation with respect to the frequency spectrum by means of regression analysis so as to extract pre-correction<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> feature data that characterizes the approximated linear expression. More particularly, by means of regression analysis, the approximating unit 421 calculates a gradient a<sub>0</sub> and an intercept b<sub>0</sub> of the linear expression, as well as calculates the intensity at a specific frequency within the frequency band of the frequency spectrum as the pre-correction feature data. In the first embodiment, it is assumed that, at the central frequency f<sub>MID</sub>=(f<sub>LOw</sub>+f<sub>HIGH</sub>)/2, the approximating unit 421 calculates c<sub>0</sub>=a<sub>0</sub>f<sub>MID</sub>+b<sub>0</sub> as the intensity (Mid-band fit). However, that is only one example. Herein, the intensity indicates any one parameter of parameters such as voltage, power, acoustic pressure, and acoustic energy.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Of the three components of feature data, the gradient a<sub>0</sub> has a correlation with the size of the scatterer that scatters the ultrasonic sound waves. Generally, it is thought that larger the scatterer, smaller is the value of the gradient. The intercept b<sub>0</sub> has a correlation with the size of the scatterer, the difference in acoustic impedances, and the density (consistency) of the scatterer. More particularly, it is thought that larger the scatterer, greater is the value of the intercept b<sub>0</sub>; greater the acoustic impedance, greater is the value of the intercept b<sub>0</sub>; and greater the density (concentration) of the scatterer, greater is the value of the intercept b<sub>0</sub>. The intensity c<sub>0</sub> at the central frequency f<sub>MID</sub> (hereinafter, simply referred to as "intensity c<sub>0</sub>") is an indirect parameter derived from the gradient a<sub>0</sub> and the intercept b<sub>0</sub>, and represents the spectrum intensity at the center of the valid frequency band. Thus, it is thought that the intensity c<sub>0</sub> has a correlation not only with the size of the scatterer, the difference in acoustic impedances, and the density of the scatterer, but also with the luminosity<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> values of B-mode images to a certain extent. Meanwhile, the approximation polynomial calculated by the feature data extracting unit 42 is not limited to a linear expression. Alternatively, it is also possible to use an approximation polynomial of second-order or more.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The following explanation is given for the correction performed by the attenuation correcting unit 422. An attenuation amount A of ultrasonic sound waves can be expressed as: <maths id="math0001" num="(1)"><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">A</mi><mo>=</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">αzf</mi></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="141" he="9" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> where, α represents the attenuation rate, z represents the reception depth of ultrasonic sound waves, and f represents the frequency. As is clear from Equation (1), the attenuation amount A is proportional to the frequency f. Regarding a living body, the specific value of the attenuation rate α is in the range of 0 to 1.0 (dB/cm/MHz) and desirably is in the range of 0.3 to 0.7 (dB/cm/MHz), and is determined according to the organ to be observed. For example, if the organ to be observed is pancreas, then the attenuation rate α is set to 0.6 (dB/cm/MHz). Meanwhile, in the first embodiment, the configuration can also be such that the value of the attenuation rate α can be modified by an input from the input unit 6.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The attenuation correcting unit 422 corrects the pre-correction feature data (the gradient a<sub>0</sub>, the intercept b<sub>0</sub>, and the intensity c<sub>0</sub>), which has been calculated by the approximating unit 421, in the following manner: <maths id="math0002" num="(2)"><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">αz</mi></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="140" he="9" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> <maths id="math0003" num="(3)"><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">b</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">b</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math><img id="ib0003" file="imgb0003.tif" wi="140" he="9" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> <maths id="math0004" num="(4)"><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">0</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">αz</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">f</mi><mi>MID</mi></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mfenced separators=""><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">f</mi><mi>MID</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">b</mi></mfenced></math><img id="ib0004" file="imgb0004.tif" wi="141" he="9" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> As is clear from Equations (2) and (4) too, greater the reception depth of ultrasonic sound waves, greater is the<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> amount of correction during the correction performed by the attenuation correcting unit 422. Meanwhile, with reference to Equation (3), the correction related to the intercept indicates identical transformation. That is because of the fact that the intercept is a frequency component corresponding to the frequency 0 (Hz) and does not get attenuated.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The tissue characterization determining unit 43 calculates, for each set of feature data of the frequency spectrum extracted by the feature data extracting unit 42, the average and the standard deviation of that set of feature data. Then, by referring to the calculated averages and the calculated standard deviations as well as by referring to the averages and the standard deviations of the sets of feature data of the frequency spectrums of known specimens stored in the memory unit 8, the tissue characterization determining unit 43 determines the tissue characterization of a predetermined area of the specimen. Herein, "predetermined area" indicates an area (hereinafter, referred to as "area of concern") in the image that has been specified by the operator of the ultrasonic diagnosis apparatus 1 upon viewing the images generated by the image processing unit 5. Moreover, for example, "tissue characterization" indicates any one of a cancer, an endocrine tumor, a mucinous tumor, a normal tissue, and a vascular channel. If the specimen is pancreas, then chronic pancreatitis and autoimmune pancreatitis are also considered as tissue characterizations.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The average and the standard deviation of a set of feature data that are calculated by the tissue characterization determining unit 43 reflect the changes at a cellular level such as enlargement or anomaly of the nucleus or reflect the tissue-level changes such as<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> fibrotic growth in the interstitium or substitution of parenchymal tissues with fibers. Thus, depending on the tissue characterization, unique values of the average and the standard deviation are indicated. In consideration of that fact, using the average and the standard deviation of feature data, it becomes possible to correctly determine the tissue characterization of the predetermined area of the specimen.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The image processing unit 5 includes a B-mode image data generating unit 51 that generates B-mode image data from echo signals; and includes a determination-result-display image data generating unit 52 that refers to the data output by the B-mode image data generating unit 51 and by the processing unit 4, and generates determination-result-display image data for displaying the determination result of tissue characterization in the area of concern and for displaying information related to the determination result.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The B-mode image data generating unit 51 generates B-mode image data by performing signal processing on digital signals using a known technology such as bandpass filtering, logarithmic conversion, gain processing, or contrast processing, and by performing data thinning according to the data step width that is decided in accordance to the display range of images in the display unit 7.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The determination-result-display image data generating unit 52 refers to the B-mode image data generated by the B-mode image data generating unit 51, refers to the feature data extracted by the feature data extracting unit 42, and refers to the determination result of the tissue characterization determining unit 43; and generates determination-result-display image data that<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> contains the determination result of tissue characterization in the area of concern and contains a tissue characterization weighted image in which the tissue characterization is highlighted.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The memory unit 8 includes a known-specimen information storing unit 81 that is used to store information on known specimens; includes a gain information storing unit 82 that is used to store information on the gain that is referred to by the signal amplifying unit 31 during amplification; a window function storing unit 83 that is used to store a window function used during frequency analysis performed by the frequency analyzing unit 41; and includes a correction information storing unit 84 that is used to store correction information which is referred to by the attenuation correcting unit 422 while performing operations.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The known-specimen information storing unit 81 is used to store the feature data of frequency spectrums extracted for known specimens and the tissue characterizations of those known specimens in a corresponding manner. In addition, with respect to feature data of the frequency spectrum related to a known specimen; the average and the standard deviation calculated for each group, which is classified on the basis of the tissue characterization of that known specimen, as well as all feature data of that known specimen is stored in the known-specimen information storing unit 81. Herein, it is assumed that the feature data of a known specimen is extracted by performing an identical operation to that performed in the first embodiment. However, the feature data extracting operation for a known specimen need not be performed in the ultrasonic diagnosis apparatus 1. Meanwhile, it is desirable that the information on known<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> specimens stored in the known-specimen information storing unit 81 is reliable in nature regarding tissue characterizations. The gain information storing unit 82 is used to store the relationship between gains and reception depths illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2 and FIG. 3</figref>. The window function storing unit 83 is used to store at least one window function of the window functions such as Hamming, Hanning, and Blackman. The correction information storing unit 84 is used to store the information related to the conversion of Equations (2) to (4).</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Meanwhile, the memory unit 8 is put into practice with a ROM, which is used to store in advance operating programs of the ultrasonic diagnosis apparatus 1 according to the first embodiment and to store programs for running a predetermined OS; and with a RAM, which is used to store operating parameters and data of each operation.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In the ultrasonic diagnosis apparatus 1 having the abovementioned functional configuration, the constituent elements other than the ultrasonic probe 2 are put into practice with a computer that includes a CPU for performing processing and control.

With reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>, firstly, the ultrasonic diagnosis apparatus 1 makes a measurement of a new specimen using the ultrasonic probe 2 (Step S1).</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Then, the signal amplifying unit 31 receives echo signals from the ultrasonic probe 2 and performs amplification by classifying the received echo signals into echo signals for B-mode images and echo signals for processing (Step S2). Herein, the signal amplifying unit 31 performs amplification based on the relationship between gains and reception depths as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2 and FIG. 3</figref>. Meanwhile, the timing of performing amplification of echo signals for B-mode images and the timing of performing amplification of echo signals for processing can be switched in the units of frames or in the units of lines.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Subsequently, the B-mode image data generating unit 51 generates B-mode image data using the echo signals for B-mode images output by the transmitting-receiving unit 3 (Step S3).</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Then, the control unit 9 performs control so that the display unit 7 displays a B-mode image corresponding to the B-mode image data generated by the B-mode image data generating unit 51 (Step S4). <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a B-mode image displayed by the display unit 7. A B-mode image 100 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> is a grayscale image in which variables R (red), G (green), and B (blue), which are variables when the RGB color system is adopted as the color space, have identical values.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Subsequently, if settings for the area of concern are performed via the input unit 6 (Yes at Step S5), the frequency analyzing unit 41 performs frequency analysis by means of FFT and calculates a frequency spectrum (Step S6).<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> At Step S6, it is also possible to set the entire area of an image as the area of concern. Meanwhile, if settings for the area of concern are not yet performed (No at Step S5) but if an instruction to end operations is input via the input unit 6 (Yes at Step S7); then the ultrasonic diagnosis apparatus 1 ends the operations. In contrast, neither settings for the area of concern are performed (No at Step S5) nor an instruction to end operations is input via the input unit 6 (No at Step S7), then the system control returns to Step S5.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Herein, the operation performed by the frequency analyzing unit 41 (Step S6) is explained in detail with reference to a flowchart illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref>. Firstly, the frequency analyzing unit 41 sets an acoustic ray number L of the acoustic ray to be initially analyzed to an initial value L<sub>0</sub> (Step S21). The initial value L<sub>0</sub> can be assigned, for example, to the acoustic ray received at the start by the transmitting-receiving unit 3 or to the acoustic ray corresponding to the border position on any one of the left and right sides of the area of concern set via the input unit 6.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Then, the frequency analyzing unit 41 calculates the frequency spectrum of all of a plurality of data positions set on a single acoustic ray. Regarding that, firstly, the frequency analyzing unit 41 sets an initial value Z<sub>0</sub> of a data position Z (equivalent to reception depth) that is representative of a sequence of data groups (FFT data groups) obtained for the purpose of FFT (Step S22). <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram that schematically illustrates data arrangement of a single acoustic ray. In an acoustic ray LD illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref>, a white rectangle or a black rectangle represents a single set of data. The acoustic ray LD is discretized by time intervals corresponding to<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> the sampling frequency (such as 50 MHz) used during A/D conversion performed by the transmitting-receiving unit 3. In <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref>, it is illustrated that the first set of data on the acoustic ray LD is set as the initial value Z<sub>0</sub> of the data position Z. Meanwhile, <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> is only an example, and the position of the initial value Z<sub>0</sub> can be set in an arbitrary manner. For example, the data position Z corresponding to the position at the top edge of the area of concern can be set as the initial value Z<sub>0</sub>.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Then, the frequency analyzing unit 41 obtains the FFT data group at the data position Z (Step S23) and implements the window function, which is stored in the window function storing unit 83, to the FFT data group that has been obtained (Step S24). By implementing the window function to the FFT data group, it becomes possible to avoid discontinuity at the borders in the FFT data group. As a result, artifacts can be prevented from occurring.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Subsequently, the frequency analyzing unit 41 determines whether or not the FFT data group at the data position Z is a normal data group (Step S25). Herein, it is necessary that the number of sets of data in an FFT data group is in power-of-two. In the following explanation, it is assumed that the number of sets of data in the FFT data group is 2<sup>n</sup> (where n is a positive integer). When an FFT data group is normal, it means that the data position Z is the 2<sup>n-1</sup>-th position from the front of the FFT data group. In other words, when an FFT data group is normal, it means that there are 2<sup>n-1</sup>-1 (=N) number of sets of data prior to the data position Z, and there are 2<sup>n-1</sup> (=M) number of sets of data subsequent to the data position Z. In the example illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref>, FFT data groups F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, and F<sub>κ-1</sub> are normal data groups; while FFT data groups F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>κ</sub> are abnormal data groups. However, in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref>, it is assumed<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> that n=4 (N=7, M=8).</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">If the determination result of Step S25 indicates that the FFT data group at the data position Z is normal (Yes at Step S25), then the system control proceeds to Step S27 (described later).</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">If the determination result of Step S25 indicates that the FFT data group at the data position Z is not normal (No at Step S25), then the frequency analyzing unit 41 inserts zero data equivalent to the deficit and generates a normal FFT data group (Step S26). To the FFT data group that is determined to be not normal at Step S25, the window function is implemented prior to the addition of zero data. Hence, even if zero data is inserted, discontinuity in data does not occur. Once the operation at Step S26 is completed, the system control proceeds to Step S27.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">At Step S27, the frequency analyzing unit 41 performs FFT using the FFT data groups and obtains the frequency spectrum (Step S27). <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 9</figref> are diagrams illustrating examples of the frequency spectrum calculated by the frequency analyzing unit 41. In <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 9</figref>, the horizontal axis f represents the frequency and the vertical axis I represents the intensity. In frequency spectrum curves C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 9</figref>, respectively; a lower limit frequency f<sub>LOW</sub> and a high limit frequency f<sub>HIGH</sub> of the frequency spectrum are parameters determined on the basis of the frequency band of the ultrasonic probe 2 and the frequency band of the pulse signals transmitted by the transmitting-receiving unit 3. For example, f<sub>LOW</sub> is equal to 3 MHz and f<sub>HIGH</sub> is equal to 10 MHz. Meanwhile, regarding a straight line L<sub>1</sub> illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 8</figref> and a straight line L<sub>2</sub> illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 9</figref>, the explanation is given later while explaining the feature<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> data extracting operation. In the first embodiment, curve lines and straight lines are formed of sets of discreet points. The same is the case in other embodiments described later.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Subsequently, the frequency analyzing unit 41 adds a predetermined data step width D to the data position Z, and calculates the data position Z at the FFT data group to be analyzed next (Step S28). Herein, it is desirable that the data step width D is matched with the data step width used at the time when the B-mode image data generating unit 51 generates B-mode image data. However, when the object is to reduce the amount of operations in the frequency analyzing unit 41, it is also possible to set the data step width D to a larger value than the data step width used by the B-mode image data generating unit 51. In <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref>, it is illustrated that D=15.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Subsequently, the frequency analyzing unit 41 determines whether or not the data position Z is greater than a final data position Z<sub>max</sub> (Step S29). Herein, the final data position Z<sub>max</sub> can be set to the data length of the acoustic ray LD or to the data position corresponding to the lower edge of the area of concern. If the determination result indicates that the data position Z is greater than the final data position Z<sub>max</sub> (Yes at Step S29), then the frequency analyzing unit 41 increments the acoustic ray number L by 1 (Step S30). On the other hand, if the determination result indicates that the data position Z is equal to or smaller than the final data position Z<sub>max</sub> (No at Step S29), then the system control returns to Step S23. In this way, with respect to a single acoustic ray LD, the frequency analyzing unit 41 performs FFT for [{(Z<sub>max</sub>-Z<sub>0</sub>)/D}+1] (=K) number of FFT data groups. Herein, [X] represents the largest integer not exceeding X.<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --></p><p id="p0068" num="0068">If the acoustic number L that has been incremented at Step S30 is greater than a final acoustic number L<sub>max</sub> (Yes at Step S31), then the system control returns to the main routine illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>. On the other hand, if the acoustic number L that has been incremented at Step S30 is equal to or smaller than the final acoustic number L<sub>max</sub> (No at Step S31), then the system control returns to Step S22.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">In this way, the frequency analyzing unit 41 performs FFT for K number of times with respect to each of (L<sub>max</sub>-L<sub>0</sub>+1) number of acoustic rays. For example, the final acoustic ray number L<sub>max</sub> can be assigned to the final acoustic ray received by the transmitting-receiving unit 3 or to the acoustic ray corresponding to the border position on any one of the left and right sides of the area of concern.

For example, when the data sampling frequency is 50 MHz, the time interval for data sampling is 20 (nsec). If the velocity of sound is assumed to be 1530 (m/sec), then the spacing among data sampling is equal to 1530 (m/sex)x20 (nsec)/2=0.0153 (mm). If "k" is assumed to be the number of data steps from the first set of data of the acoustic ray LD up to the data position of the FFT data group to be processed, then the data position Z thereof is equal to 0.0153k (mm).

Firstly, the tissue characterization determining unit 43 sets a feature data space that is to be used while determining the tissue characterization (Step S41). In the first embodiment, among the gradient a, the intercept b, and the intensity c that are the three components of feature data; there are two independent parameters. Thus, a two-dimensional space can be set that has any two of the three components of feature data as the components. Alternatively, a one-dimensional space can also be set that has any one of the three components of feature data as the component. At Step S41, it is assumed that the feature data space to be set is determined in advance. However, alternatively, the operator can be allowed to set the desired feature data space using the input unit 6.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074"><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 12</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of the feature data space set by the tissue characterization determining unit 43. In the feature data space illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 12</figref>, the horizontal axis represents the intercept b and the vertical axis represents the intensity c. In <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 12</figref>, a point Sp represents the point (hereinafter, referred to as "specimen point Sp") that has the intercept b and the intensity c calculated regarding the target specimen for determination as the coordinates of the feature data space. Moreover, areas G<sub>µ</sub>, G<sub>ν</sub>, and G<sub>ρ</sub> illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 12</figref> represent groups in which known specimens stored in the known-specimen information storing unit 81 have tissue characterizations of µ, v, and p, respectively. In the<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> example illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 12</figref>, in the feature data space, the three groups G<sub>µ</sub>, G<sub>ν</sub>, and G<sub>ρ</sub> are present in mutually exclusive areas.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">In the first embodiment, even while obtaining the feature data of a known specimen; the tissue characterizations are classified and determined with the feature data, which is obtained by performing attenuation correction with respect to the pre-correction feature data of the frequency spectrum obtained by means of frequency analysis, serving as the index. Hence, it becomes possible to make distinction between mutually different tissue characterizations. Particularly, in the first embodiment, the feature data that has been subjected to attenuation correction is used. Therefore, as compared to the case of using the feature data that is extracted without performing attenuation correction, the area of each tissue characterization in the feature data space can be obtained in a more distinctly separated state.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Subsequent to Step S41, the tissue characterization determining unit 43 calculates distances d<sub>µ</sub> d<sub>ν</sub>, and d<sub>ρ</sub> from the specimen point Sp to points µ<sub>0</sub>, ν<sub>0</sub>, and ρ<sub>0</sub>, respectively, (hereinafter, these points are referred to as "known specimen average points"); where the points µ<sub>0</sub>, ν<sub>0</sub>, and ρ<sub>0</sub> have the average of the intercept b and the average of the intensity c of the frequency spectrum of the FFT data group included in the groups G<sub>µ</sub>, G G<sub>ν</sub>, and G<sub>ρ</sub>, respectively, as the coordinates in the feature data space (Step S42). Meanwhile, if the b-axis component and the c-axis component in the feature data space differ in scale by a large extent, it is desirable to appropriately perform weighting so that each distance contributes in a substantially equal manner.<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --></p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Then, based on the distances calculated at Step S42, the tissue characterization determining unit 43 determines the tissue characterizations of all specimen points including the specimen point Sp (Step S43). For example, in the case illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 12</figref>, since the distance d<sub>µ</sub> is the smallest, the tissue characterization determining unit 43 determines that <sub>µ</sub> is the tissue characterization of the specimen. Meanwhile, if the specimen point Sp is extremely separated from the known specimen average points µ<sub>0</sub>, ν<sub>0</sub>, and ρ<sub>0</sub>; then the determination result of tissue characterizations is low in terms of reliability even if the smallest values of the distances d<sub>µ</sub>, d<sub>ν</sub>, and d<sub>ρ</sub> are obtained. In that regard, when the distances d<sub>µ</sub>, d<sub>ν</sub>, and d<sub>ρ</sub> are greater than a predetermined threshold value, the tissue characterization determining unit 43 can be configured to output an error signal. Moreover, when that smallest value of the distances d<sub>µ</sub>, d<sub>ν</sub>, and d<sub>ρ</sub> is obtained for two or more times; the tissue characterization determining unit 43 can be configured to select all tissue characterizations corresponding to the smallest value or to select only one tissue characterization according to predetermined rules. In the latter case, for example, a method can be implemented in which a high-grade tissue characterization such as cancer is set to have a high priority. Meanwhile, alternatively, when that smallest value of the distances d<sub>µ</sub>, d d<sub>ν</sub>, and d<sub>ρ</sub> is obtained for two or more times; the tissue characterization determining unit 43 can be configured to output an error signal.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Then, the tissue characterization determining unit 43 outputs the distance calculation result obtained at Step S42 and the determination result obtained at Step S43<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> (Step S44).

The setting is so done that smaller the distance, greater is the probability belonging to each known specimen. For example, with λ=100(α<sup>-1</sup>+β<sup>-1</sup>+γ<sup>-1</sup>) (%), it can be defined that the probability belonging to a tissue characterization A is λ/α (%), the probability belonging to a tissue characterization B is λ/β (%), and the probability belonging to a tissue characterization C is λ/γ (%).</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">In the fourth embodiment, when the display unit 7 displays a determination result display image, the probability belonging to each tissue characterization is displayed in the information displaying portion.
