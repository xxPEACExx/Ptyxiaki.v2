For example, there may be difficulties with probing dense TSVs individually during wafer-sort and final test<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> processes. It is important to sort good dies from bad dies before moving onto the stacking and/or assembly stages which are relatively expensive processes. The problems associated with sorting of dies include: the inability to probe the integrity of floating TSVs on both thinned and un-thinned wafers due to missing connections; the limitation imposed the electrical tests that need to be carried out at by the requirement to handle very fragile thinned wafers during wafer-sort tests; and the limitation to static logic tests for continuity checks of the connections between tiers as it is not possible the test the quality of the contact.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In addition, it is important to detect misalignment of dies and/or wafers during the stacking process. As this forms the last step before the assembly of the stacked tiers in the final package, detecting a fault at this stage saves the expensive packaging costs. Moreover, it is necessary to detect faults that arise from long wiring between digital and analogue elements of the wafer. Most of the long tracks are prone to bridging errors which can be hard to detect via bridging tests, especially for the interfaces between analogue and digital modes. In such tests, the same track needs to be repeated for the return track to ensure that the signal has been received at its destination correctly. This adds a lot of cost as well as signal integrity issues in these mixed-mode systems.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Existing test structures have severe limitations, for example, the requirement for large silicon area to implement test circuits when used over a large number of TSVs; the need for special analogue process options; limitation to test TSVs that carry digital signals but also analogue signals; the inability to generate a meaningful test output signal that represents the integrity of TSVs; the limitation to characterisation exercises on dedicated test circuits (the difficulty of integration into standard equipment or products); the imposition of large loading that limits the performance of the tier-to-tier communication; the lack of calibration of the measurements for each TSV for setting reliable limits for<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> production tests, and the requirement for long test times over a large number of TSVs.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Summary</u><u>of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a fault mode test method that does not suffer from the problems mentioned above.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">It is another object of the present invention to provide a test circuit for carrying out the fault mode test method.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for performing at least one fault mode test on at least one of a plurality of through-silicon-via connections arranged on a substrate in an integrated circuit, the method comprising the steps of:-

As a calibration mode is used as part of the testing method, the circuit size required for the test circuit can be reduced, for example, in terms of the silicon resources.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In one embodiment, said at least one fault mode test comprises a leakage test between the selected through-silicon-via connection and the substrate.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In another embodiment, said at least one fault mode test comprises a short test between the selected through-silicon-via connection and at least one other through-silicon-via connection in close proximity to the selected through-silicon-via connection.

Moreover, there can be less area overhead as well as no performance degradation after the integration of monitor circuits. There is no need for special process options, for example, capacitance, resistance etc., where the testing circuit is based on field effect transistors (FETs) in a low cost process.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Run-time monitoring of TSVs allows access to reliability and/or aging faults during the application and allows for correction before the fault occurs. Additionally, an improvement in yield can be obtained by re-routing of signals once a fault is detected in a TSV.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">It is possible to integrate the method of the present invention anywhere in the die and does not need to be close to the actual TSV under test. This is particularly the case in DC-level current-mode operation, where there is no dependence on the RC values of wiring from TSVs to the monitoring circuit.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>Brief Description of the Drawings</u></b></heading><p id="p0029" num="0029">For a better understanding of the present invention, reference will now be made, by way of example only, to the accompanying drawings in which:-

The drawings described are only schematic and are non-limiting. In the drawings, the size of some of the elements may be exaggerated and not drawn on scale for illustrative purposes.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Boundary-scan technologies are widely used for testing the integrity of ICs. All the pins (TSVs and/or functional input/output (I/O) pads) that connect to electronic logic are linked together in a set known as the boundary scan chain. JTAG (Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) is the common name for the IEEE standard IEEE 1149.1, standard test access port and boundary-scan architecture) is used to manipulate the external interface of the scan chain to test for certain faults, the external interface being input and output connections to other chips. In addition, JTAG can also be used to manipulate internal interfaces to test combinational logic, the internal interface being connections to on-chip<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> registers etc. In both cases, testing is done with the IC after it has been mounted on the circuit board and sometimes whilst the board forms part of an operational system. When combined with BIST, the JTAG scan chain provides a solution for testing certain static faults. Control of scan chain is not limited to JTAG but it could also be done by another serial communication scheme.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Fault mode testing in accordance with the present invention can be implemented at any part of the assembly where fault screening would be performed, for example, in power ground configurations, wafer sort, thinning, redistribution layer (RDL) and stacking, as well as assembly. The test system is compact so that only uses minimum size switches are used in accordance with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, a wafer 100 is shown that has a plurality of TSV element located thereon arranged in an array, but only TSV elements 110 (TSV1) and 120 (TSVn) are shown for clarity. The wafer also has a power line 130 and a connection to ground 140 as shown. Also shown is a leakage connection for TSV-under-test and a short circuit between TSVs. In the latter case, when testing each TSV for the presence of a short with any other TSV, the relationship of the other TSV to the TSV-under-test is described as TSV-aggressor.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The testing arrangement in accordance with the present invention is compact as the size of the switches are minimised due to the CMOS technology used and there is no overhead in performance and power in a functional mode. For each wafer, two extra signals are required, one for connection to a clock (re-routed to the JTAG clock, TCK, not shown) and one for connection to a flip-flop (also not shown). The testing operation will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 2 to 5</figref> illustrate the various stages at which TSV testing can be carried out.
