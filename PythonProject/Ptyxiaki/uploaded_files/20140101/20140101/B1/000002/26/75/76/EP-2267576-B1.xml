Then, if after a predetermined time period it is determined that the interface card 200 is to be in the sleep mode (operation S306), the interface card 200 retrieves the sleep-mode instruction code from the non-volatile memory 230 and loads the code into the first volatile memory 218, removes the driving power<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> supplied by the power supplier 220 to the external circuit 240, e.g., the non-volatile memory 230 and the second volatile memory 232, and transfers control of the CPU 216 to the sleep-mode firmware in order to complete the transition into the sleep mode (operation S302).</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">However, if it is determined that the interface card 200 is not to be in the sleep mode (operation S306), the interface card 210 continues to operate normally in the active mode (operation S302).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>, operation of the interface card 200 in the sleep mode will now be described.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The sleep mode, as indicated above, is the operational mode where minimum power consumption is required and, as such, operations are confined to minimal processes, such as those that inform external devices that the interface card 200 is in standby in response to discovery packet data, such as broadcast packet data, multicast packet data or the like.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The transmitter-receiver 212 receives packet data provided from the external device connected to the network (operation S402) and outputs the packet data to the Ethernet controller 214.

The present invention does not limit the types of packet data that can be processed in the sleep mode, where such limitation is determined primarily by the size of the first volatile memory 218, the size of the code necessary to process any given packet data type, and the adopted standards defining acceptable behavior in a given operational mode.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">If it is determined that the packet data can be processed in the sleep mode, the CPU 216 operates a corresponding protocol module stored in the first volatile memory 218 and the protocol module analyzes the packet data to execute a corresponding procedure (operation S408). Further, if it is required to respond to the external device that provided the packet data, the CPU 216 generates respondent packet data and transmits a suitably formatted packet containing the response (operation S410).</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">However, if the packet data cannot be processed in the sleep mode, the CPU 216 executes the active mode converting module stored in the first volatile memory 218 to transition the interface card 210 from the sleep mode to the active mode (operation S412). For example, if the present invention is implemented in a network printer and the packet data from the external device is printing packet data, the CPU 216 transitions the interface card 210 into the active mode and processes the printing packet data to be printed. Accordingly, the driving power would be supplied to the non-volatile memory 230 and the second volatile memory 232 through the power supplier 220, the active mode code would then be loaded from the non-volatile memory 230 into the second volatile memory 232, and the control of the CPU 216 would be transferred to the active mode instructions. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the printing packet is maintained in the first volatile memory 218 throughout the transition into the active mode, at which time the active mode instructions stored in the second volatile memory 232 are executed to process the printing packet data.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 5A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">5B</figref> are block diagrams to illustrate operation of an exemplary network device, in particular, a network printer 500 embodying aspects of the present invention.

In the case where discovery packet data are in the set of packet data that can be processed in the sleep mode, the exemplary embodiment determines that it is possible to process the discovery packet data in the sleep mode, and the discovery protocol module is executed to process the discovery packet data. In accordance with the exemplary embodiment, the discovery protocol module generates respondent packet data to be transmitted through the network 510 to the host 502 so that the user thereat can operate the network printing apparatus 500 to print.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 5B</figref> illustrates operations to process the packet data if the host 504 transmits printing packet data to print in the sleep mode of the interface card 200 of the exemplary network printer 500.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">If the transmitter-receiver 212 of the interface card 200 receives the printing packet data, the packet analyzing module determines whether the packet data can be processed in the sleep mode. However, in this case, the printing packet data cannot<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> be processed in the sleep mode and the network printer 500 transitions from the sleep mode into the active mode, such as through the exemplary processes described above. Once in the active mode, the printer prints the received printing packet data.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">As described above, the present invention can reduce power consumption in a sleep mode over other interface cards of the prior art.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Further, the present invention can avoid spending unnecessary time to transition into an active mode and to load active mode instruction code whenever a packet must be processed, in that the invention allows some packet data to be processed in the sleep mode.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Although a few embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in these embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56978975" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Drucker, der Folgendes umfasst:
