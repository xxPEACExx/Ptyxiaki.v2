mxw-id="PDES63957164" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><u>Background of the Invention</u></heading><heading id="h0002"><u>Field of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to ocular surgical procedures involving implantable or injectable lenses into the eye of a recipient, and more specifically to systems and methods for determination or selection of a lens power for providing emmetropic vision or, if chosen, a specific ametropic vision to a pseudophakic eye.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Description of the Related Art</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Accurate determination of lens power is an important aspect in providing emmetropia, or a desired degree of ametropia, to a subject undergoing cataract surgery or other ophthalmic procedures in which the natural crystalline lens is replaced with or supplemented by implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL) into the eye. Measurements of the eye are typically made preoperatively and a lens power is selected based on correlations between the measured values and lens powers providing a desired refractive outcome.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Over the years a number of intraocular lens power calculation formulas have been developed, for example, as discussed in the book published by SLACK Incorporated entitled <u>Intraocular Lens Power Calculations</u>, by H. John Shammas. These power formulas may be broadly characterized into at least two categories: theoretical formulas, which are based on a geometric optic, two-lens vergence formula; and regression formulas, which are based on regression formulas obtained by fitting data from a large patient database to an equation relating lens power to one or more parameters thought to correlate with lens power. While there has been continued progress in the accuracy of intraocular lens power calculation formulas to obtain better refractive outcomes, undesirable refractive outcomes due to improper intraocular lens power calculations are still relatively common. Apart from the general desire for spectacle-free refractive outcomes, demands for<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> more accurate lens power calculation have also increased due to the introduction of multifocal lenses.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Many of the current formula algorithms were derived by optical back-calculation to agree with the refractive outcome. In this manner they may be confounded with errors in all parameters used in the calculation, and the oversimplification of thin-lens theory. An evaluation of the sources of errors in lens power calculations was recently published by one of the current co-inventors (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Sverker Norrby, "Sources of error in intraocular lens power calculation", Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery, Vol. 34, pp. 368-376, March 2008</text></nplcit>). In this paper, preoperative estimation of postoperative intraocular lens position was determined to be the largest contributor of error in the refractive outcome of cataract surgery, with an error contribution of 35%, relative to all error sources evaluated.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In most, if not all of the current formula algorithms, there are a number of ocular parameters that are used in deriving an appropriate lens power for implantation into the eye. These parameters include axial length (<i>AL</i>), corneal radius (CR) or power (<i>K</i>), and anterior chamber depth of the natural crystalline lens prior to surgery (<i>ACD</i><sub>pre</sub>). In general, one or more of these parameters are used to provide the preoperative estimation of postoperative intraocular lens position. The estimated postoperative lens position is then used in combination with one or more of these same parameters to provide an estimate of the correct lens power to provide a desired refractive outcome (typically emmetropia). However, as discussed in the previous paragraph, the use of this term in calculating postoperative lens position is a large error source in this process. In addition, some of these parameters may be unavailable at the time of evaluation. For example, in the case of a patient that has previously received a corneal refractive surgery, such as LASIK or PRK, the original corneal radius or power may no longer be available. It is the corneal radius prior to corneal refractive surgery that is correct to use in the power calculation formulas because they were developed for normal eyes on data pertaining to normal eyes. The corneal refractive surgery has changed the anatomic relations of ocular dimensions. Hence, the CR or <i>K</i> determined for corneas that have had corneal refractive surgery will give erroneous estimates of the IOL position.<br/>

In many cases the desired outcome will be emmetropia, for example, so that the eye into which the lens is located has a visual acuity for distant objects that is at least 20/20 based on a Snellen chart and/or has an Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) that is at least 0.15 or at least 0.20 at a spatial frequency of 50 line pairs per mm. The following disclosure will be primarily directed to embodiments of the invention as they apply to implantable intraocular lenses; such as defined in the appended claims however, it will be understood that it may be applied directly, or indirectly, to other types of ophthalmic lenses including, but not limited to, injectable lenses that may be formed by injection of a polymer fluid or gel into the eye which is subsequently cured or solidified (e.g., using a UV source), corneal implants, corneal surgical procedures such as LASIK or PRK, contact lenses, and other such devices. In some embodiments, various types of ophthalmic devices are combined, for example, an intraocular lens and a LASIK procedure may be used together to provide a predetermined visual outcome.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Embodiments of the invention may find particular use with multifocal or accommodating intraocular lenses, where a proper selection of lens power may be particular important for achieving a desired refractive outcome.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, which is a cross-sectional view of a phakic eye with the natural crystalline lens, an eye 10 comprises a retina 12 that receives light in the form of an image that is produced by the combination of the optical powers of a cornea 14 and a natural crystalline lens 16, both of which are generally disposed about an optical axis OA. As used herein, an "anterior direction" is in the direction generally toward the cornea 14, while a "posterior direction" is generally in the direction toward the retina 12.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The natural lens 16 is contained within a capsular bag 20, which is a thin membrane that completely encloses the natural lens 16 and is attached to a ciliary muscle 22 via zonules 24. An iris 26, disposed between the cornea 14 and the natural lens 16, provides a variable pupil that dilates under lower lighting conditions (scotopic vision) and constructs under brighter lighting conditions (photopic vision). The ciliary muscle 24, via the zonules 24, controls the shape and position of the natural lens 16, which allows the eye 10 to focus on both distant and near objects. Distant vision is provided when the ciliary muscle 22 is relaxed, wherein the zonules 24 pull the natural lens 16 so that the capsular bag 20 is generally flatter and has a longer focal length (lower optical power). Near vision is provided as the ciliary muscle contracts, thereby relaxing the zonules 24 and allowing the natural lens 16 to return to a more rounded, unstressed state that produces a shorter focal length (higher optical power).</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The optical performance of the eye 10 also depends on the spacing between the cornea 14 and the natural lens 16, sometimes referred to as the anterior chamber depth prior to an ocular surgical procedure, <i>ACD</i><sub>pre</sub>. As used herein, the "anterior chamber depth prior to surgery", "anterior chamber depth prior to an ocular surgical procedure", or "<i>ACD</i><sub>pre</sub>", is defined as a distance between an apex of a cornea and an apex of a natural crystalline lens of an eye, prior to a surgery to replace the natural crystalline lens 16 with an intraocular lens. In some situations or cases, <i>ACD</i><sub>pre</sub> may be defined or approximated as a distance between an apex of a cornea and an anterior surface of the iris 26.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Referring additionally to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, which is a cross-sectional view of a pseudophakic eye 10, the natural crystalline 16 lens has been replaced by an intraocular lens 100 according to an<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> embodiment of the present invention. The intraocular lens 100 comprises an optic 102 and haptics 104, the haptics 104 being generally configured to center the optic 102 within the capsular bag 20. Numerous configurations of haptics 104 relative to optic 102 are well know within the art and embodiments of the present invention may be applied to any of these.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In order to calculate, determine, or estimate the power of an intraocular lens 100 that is able to provide emmetropia or some other predetermined refractive outcome, various dimensions or measurements of the eye 10 are made prior to the surgical procedure. In addition to <i>ACD<sub>pre</sub>,</i> embodiments of the present invention also measure axial length <i>AL</i> of the eye 10, curvature of the cornea <i>CR,</i> is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Various formulations exist within the art that are used for calculation both of lens power and position of an intraocular lens after an ocular surgical procedure. These formulations generally comprise three steps:
<ol><li>1. Measure an eye.</li><li>2. Estimate the postoperative position of an intraocular lens.</li><li>3. Perform a lens power calculation based on the estimate and/or eye measurements.</li></ol></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The inventors have found that although all three steps are important, the second step of estimating the postoperative position of an intraocular lens may benefit most from improvements in the current state of the measurement arts. For example, in the Norrby reference previously cited in the Background section above, preoperative estimation of postoperative intraocular lens position was determined to be the largest contributor of error in the refractive outcome of cataract surgery, with an error contribution of 35%, relative to all error sources evaluated.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Furthermore, the inventors have found that the combined measurements <i>of AL, ACD<sub>pre</sub>,</i> and <i>CR</i> are highly predictive in calculating the position of the implanted intraocular lens 100 or optic 102. As used herein, a "calculated position" or similar phrases, as applied to an IOL or ophthalmic lens after implantation after an ocular surgical procedure, means an estimated or calculated distance between a cornea of an eye and the IOL or lens after insertion, injection, or formation within the eye. The calculated position will generally be given herein in terms of the "postoperative anterior chamber depth" (<i>ACD<sub>Pos</sub></i>)<i>,</i> which is defined herein as the distance from an apex of a cornea to an apex of an implanted intraocular lens. The calculated position may<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> also be in terms of an "estimated lens position" <i>(ELP),</i> which is defined as a distance from an apex of a cornea to some effective lens plane of an implanted intraocular lens. For example, J.T. Holladay, M.D. defines <i>ELP</i> as a distance between an apex of a cornea and an effective principal plane of an implantable intraocular lens (e.g., <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>J.T.

where AL is an the axial length of the eye, <i>ACD</i><sub>pre</sub> is the anterior chamber depth prior to an ocular surgical procedure, CR is a radius of curvature of the cornea, and C1-C4 are constants.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In some embodiments, the calculated position of an IOL or ophthalmic lens after an ocular surgical procedure may be an estimated or calculated distance between the cornea of an eye and a plane passing through the haptics of an ophthalmic lens, referred to herein and a lens haptic plane. One of the co-inventors, Sverker Norrby, has developed a thick-lens calculation scheme based on the lens haptic plane concept. See, for example, <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>Norrby S.; J.

The lens haptic plane is defined herein as a plane where the IOL haptic makes contact with the eye tissue. As seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, the lens haptic plane generally coincides with the equator of the capsular bag 20. As used herein, the distance between the cornea and the lens haptic plane will be designated by "LHP". The LHP may be an additional independent parameter used in calculating or selecting a lens power. It has been observed that the LHP is, in principle, generally independent of the power of an intraocular lens, while <i>ACD<sub>post</sub></i> generally depends more on power, although this generally produces only a small shift. The LHP is the plane of contact with tissue (the equator of the capsular bag). Due to angulation of the haptic the anterior surface of an intraocular lens is generally posterior to LHP. The higher the power, the thicker the intraocular lens. Therefore, the higher the lens power, the more anterior is the anterior surface. Thus, the offset between LHP and anterior surface depends on power.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In certain embodiments, a highly predictive formulation for a calculated distance between the cornea and a lens haptic plane of a capsular bag of an eye or of a haptic of an ophthalmic lens has the mathematical relationship: <maths id="math0002" num="(2)"><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="italic">LHP</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>ʹ</mi><mo>+</mo><mfenced separators=""><mi>C</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>ʹ</mi><mo>×</mo><mi mathvariant="italic">AL</mi></mfenced><mo>+</mo><mfenced separators=""><mi>C</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>ʹ</mi><mo>×</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="italic">ACD</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">pre</mi></msub></mfenced><mo>+</mo><mfenced separators=""><mi>C</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mn>4</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>ʹ</mi><mo>×</mo><mi mathvariant="italic">CR</mi></mfenced><mo>,</mo></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="120" he="7" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>

In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the calculated position of the intraocular lens 100 is based on measured or calculated values <i>of AL, ACD<sub>pre</sub>,</i> and <i>CR</i> of the eye 10. These values may be used in one or more of Equations 1-4 to calculate the lens position.

In particular, Equation 2 has been found to have a statistical P-Value of P less than or equal to 0.031. Based on the PLS analysis for this data, Equation 3 has a relatively low statistical variation compared to other prior art formulations in calculating <i>ACD<sub>post</sub>,</i> for example, having Q2 variation of less than or equal to about 0.20, where "about" means ±0.01, and a residual standard deviation (RSD) of less than or equal to about 0.3, where "about" means ±0.01. It is estimated that these results can improve difference between planned and final outcome, sometimes called mean absolute error (MAE), by 0.07 Diopters to a value of 0.053, based on data from the European cataract outcome study (http://www.eurocat.net, accessed 2008-07-10).</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">A characteristic of the mathematical relationship described by Equation 2 is that the calculated value of <i>ACD<sub>post</sub></i> has a surprisingly low sensitivity to variations in the measured axial length AL. As discussed below in the examples, the sensitivity of Equation 2 is only about 0.45% change in the calculated value of <i>ACD<sub>post</sub></i> when the value of AL changes by 1% from a<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> nominal value, for example a nominal value of 24 mm or 25 mm. This is much lower than the sensitivity of other evaluated mathematical relationships based on different prior art combinations of measured eye parameters, which varied from about 0.7% to about 2.4% when the value of AL is changed by 1% from a nominal value. Advantageously, the low dependence on <i>AL</i> of Equations 1-4 allows accurate calculations of <i>ACD<sub>post</sub></i> to be made with less accurate measurements <i>of AL.</i></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Another surprising result from the study discussed in the Examples below is that the addition of lens thickness LT to Equations 1-4 showed essentially no correlation of <i>ACD<sub>post</sub></i> with LT. This is in contrast to other prior art formulas (e.g, Olsen and Holladay) which include <i>LT</i> along with <i>AL, ACD<sub>pre</sub>,</i> and <i>CR</i> in calculating <i>ACD<sub>post</sub>.</i> Thus, the formulas in Equations 1-4 advantageously determine <i>ACD<sub>post</sub></i> and <i>LHP</i> without the need to measure <i>LT</i> at all.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In some examples one or more of the measured variables in Equations 1-4 may be left out; however, this has been found to decrease the predictability. For example, as discussed below in the Examples section, the measurement of CR may be left out and the coefficients for AL and <i>ACD<sub>pre</sub></i> be re-evaluated. This can be useful for subjects that have already had a corneal refractive procedure such as LASIK and there is no record of the corneal curvature before the procedure.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The element 210 of the method 200 comprises element 210 of calculating a position of the intraocular lens 100 or the optic 102 after an ocular surgical procedure.

In general, these formulations include equations for estimating <i>ELP.</i> Many of these formulas are based on thin-lens theory, in which each lens is reduced to a power at its principal plane. The position of the principal plane may depend on the shape factor of the lens or on the vergence of the incoming light, hence <i>ELP</i> is not generally indicative of the true position of the intraocular lens. The formulas differ from each other in the algorithms for estimation of <i>ELP.</i> These algorithms were obtained by analysis of large amounts of clinical data and adjusted such that the calculated refracted outcome on average agreed with that found postoperatively.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">To compensate for deviations in unusually long or unusually short eyes, many formulas also include certain "fudge" factors. For example, the Holladay 1, SRK/T, Hoffer Q formulas include a SF-, A- and ACD-constant, respectively, that is specific for a given intraocular lens model and is associated with an average postoperative position of that model. Manufactures may give preliminary estimates of these constants, which may then be "personalized" by or for a particular surgeon. To "personalize" a constant for a given formula the surgeon may perform several cases with the preliminary constant, and subsequently adjusts the constant such that the mean difference with refractive outcomes becomes zero. Derivation of these formula algorithms is generally based on back-calculation of clinical outcome using thin-lens theory. They may, therefore, be confounded with all errors of the measured parameters involved, and the oversimplification of thin-lens theory.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The Haigis formula is based on thin-lens theory, but has a somewhat different approach. It uses three constants in the algorithm for <i>ELP,</i> two of which are multiplicative coefficients for <i>AL</i> and <i>ACD.</i> By using three constants it can better approximate the nonlinear relationship between AL and <i>ELP.</i> Olsen has presented a formula based on thick-lens theory, though still assuming the paraxial approximation. It uses 5 parameters to predict the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> postoperative position of the anterior surface of the IOL, <i>ACD<sub>post</sub></i> (in mm): <i>AL, ACD,</i> lens thickness (LT in mm), corneal radius (<i>CR</i> in mm), and corneal diameter ("white-to-white" in mm). The advantage with the thick-lens model is that the optical components are represented by the refracting surfaces at their real positions. The challenge is that all input parameters must be correct. There are no "fudge" factors to tweak the results with, except the <i>ACD<sub>post</sub></i> prediction algorithm itself. The Holladay 2 formula, which has not been published, resides in the Holladay IOL Consultant software and can use up to 7 parameters in the <i>ELP</i> prediction algorithm: <i>AL</i>, <i>K</i>, <i>ACD</i>, <i>LT</i>, corneal diameter, preoperative refraction in Diopters, and patient age (in years). It is still apparently based on thin-lens theory.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In an effort to evaluate various types of formulas for calculating the position of an implanted intraocular lens, a study was conducted, in which 23 regular cataract patients received either an AMO CeeOn 911A or an AMO TECNIS Z9000 IOL.

id="p0048" num="0048">Of the 23 patients enrolled in the study, 10 received a CeeOn 911A IOL and 13 a Tecnis Z9000 IOL. One patient in the former group did not complete the study, leaving a total of 22 cases for analysis. Data of this type are frequently analyzed by multiple linear regression (MLR); however, such analysis may be valid only if the parameters are not correlated to each other. When the parameters are correlated, partial least squares (PLS) regression is considered a better approach. PLS regression is further capable of handling category variables, such as sex, and can cope with missing data. Accordingly, data in this study was analyzed by PLS regression<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> using SIMCA P 12+ (Umetrics AB, Umeå, Sweden). In accordance with the manual of SIMCA, each combination of input parameters is referred to as a "model", not to be confused with IOL model.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">For small data sets, as in this study, the prediction power of a model was tested by cross validation by elimination of one observation at a time; thereafter a new model was calculated. This new sub-model was used to predict the observation eliminated. The process was continued until all observations were eliminated once. An average prediction error was then calculated from the sum of squares of all prediction errors of the sub-models. This was used to calculate the statistic Q<sup>2</sup>, which is an estimate of how much of the variation in the result parameter (<i>ACD<sub>post</sub></i> in this case) can be predicted by the model parameters at a chosen level of certainty. A 95% level was chosen for this study. This type of cross validation (CV), also known as "Jack- Knifing", delivers uncertainty intervals for each model variable. CV-ANOVA of the prediction errors yields the residual standard deviation (RSD), and the reliability of the PLS-models as a P-value. As commonly done we consider P &lt; 0.05 as statistically significant.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Of the various models evaluated, some of the more relevant ones are reported in Table 2. Some of models shown in Table 2 represent some of the more common measurement combination used in estimating <i>ACD<sub>post</sub>.</i> However, of all the models shown, only model number 8 (which corresponds to embodiments of the present invention discussed in relation to Equations 1-4) proved to be clearly statistically significant (e.g., having a value of P&gt;0.05). This model also had a reasonably low RSD of 0.20.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> -->

In present formulas the algorithms for prediction of the postoperative IOL position, or the <i>ACD<sub>post</sub>,</i> were obtained by back-calculation by means of the optical formula.

This confirms that the Rostock formulation provides relationships that has a low sensitivity to the value of the axial length AL of the eye. By contrast, the other formulations that were analyzed showed a much higher sensitivity to the value of axial length AL. The least sensitive of these remaining formulations was that of Haigis, which was still more than three times as sensitive as the Rostock equation, Equation 3. These results demonstrate that the Rostock formulation clearly has a very low sensitivity to the value of axial length <i>AL</i> of an eye.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Prediction of postoperative intraocular lens position in cases where a subject has had a previous corneal refractive surgery is an ever increasing problem.
