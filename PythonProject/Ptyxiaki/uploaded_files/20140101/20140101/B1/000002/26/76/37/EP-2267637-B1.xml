Magnetic card 6 is taken in by rollers 11 and is transferred along a transferring path defined by a plurality of pairs of transferring rollers 12, 13 which are placed with a given distance. The spacing between rollers 11 and 12 is slightly less than the length of the card 6. Likewise, the spacing between rollers 12 and 13 is slightly less than the length of the card 6.

When a user inserts magnetic card 6 through card slot 5, magnetic head 7 or a sensor (not shown in the figure) detects a magnetic strip formed on inserted magnetic card 6 (ST1).

Time of suspending motor 14 can be controlled based on a period of time since detection of the card by photo sensors 18. Also, it can be controlled based on a period of time since detection of magnetic head 7 for detecting insertion of a card. Suspension of magnetic card 6 is established to be 100 to 500ms in this embodiment (ST3).</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Thereafter, motor 14 is activated (ST4) to restart taking in magnetic card 6. After magnetic card 6 is taken in to the position of magnetic head 15, formed in the card reader (ST5), magnetic head 15 performs reading out or writing from or onto magnetic card 6 (ST6).</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the operation of taking in magnetic card 6 of this embodiment, the operation is temporarily suspended while the back end of magnetic card 6 projects from card slot 5 and is continued after a given period of time. As a result, even when magnetic head 20 is (illegally) attached to the outside of card slot 5, such as on the surface of front panel 3, as indicated with an imaginary line in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 3 (a)</figref>, magnetic card 6 is temporarily stopped such that magnetic head 20 cannot completely read out magnetically recorded information of inserted magnetic card 6. Therefore, illegal reading out of magnetically recorded information by magnetic head 20 can be prevented. It should be noted, however, that the apparatus is arranged so that stopping the card in this way to prevent illegal reading thereof does not effect the authorised reading of the card by the magnetic head 15.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The following describes ejection of magnetic card 6 in magnetic card reader 1 of this embodiment in reference to a flowchart of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 2 (b)</figref>.

Therefore, even though magnetic head 20 is (illegally) attached to the front panel as indicated with an imaginary line in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 3 (b)</figref>, one can prevent magnetically recorded information of magnetic card 6, which is ejected through magnetic head 20, from being read out.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">According to magnetic card reader 1 of this embodiment, transferring of the card is suspended only once during taking in and ejection of the card.

In this case, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 4</figref>, after shutter 9 is opened in ST22, a given period of time is<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> counted in ST23; thereafter, motor 15 is rotated (started) in ST24.

By monitoring the output, whether the end of inserted magnetic card 6 comes in contact with shutter 9 can be detected. When it is in contact, the process proceeds from ST33 to ST34 wherein shutter 9 is opened. Thereafter, the user pushes in magnetic<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> card 6 further such that the end of magnetic card 6 is held between transferring rollers 11 to start the operation of taking in of the magnetic card (ST35).

In this case, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 6</figref>, a part of slot frame 60, which defines card slot 5 of magnetic card reader 1, is projected from opening 4 of front panel 3. Projection 61 faces a magnetic strip of inserted magnetic card 6; hence, it is preferable to form projection 61 on both top and bottom thereat in the case of handling a magnetic card having magnetic strips on both sides.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">This configuration makes illegal mounting of a magnetic head to the outside of card slot 5 difficult or impossible. Therefore, one may prevent a magnetic head from illegal reading out of information on a magnetic card.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In the second configuration, illegal reading out can be prevented by detecting whether a foreign object, such as a magnetic head, is illegally attached to card slot opening 4 of the front panel. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 7</figref>, detector 70 is attached on the back side of the front panel at a position in the vicinity of card slot 5; detector<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> 70 detects whether a foreign object, such as magnetic head 20, is illegally attached to the front surface of the front panel.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">As detector 70, for example, one may employ a optical reflective sensor shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 7</figref>; a foreign object on the front surface can be detected forming detection opening 71 on front panel 3. Instead of a reflective sensor, one may employ a microwave sensor, a metal detecting sensor, or a mechanical sensor such as a micro switch.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In the third configuration, even though a magnetic head is illegally mounted at card slot opening 4 of front panel 3, reading of a magnetic card can be disabled by a disturbance magnetic field generator. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8</figref>, disturbance magnetic field generator 80, in which coil 82 is wound around iron core 81, is attached in the vicinity of card slot 5 to prevent magnetic head 20, illegally attached to the outside of the front panel, from reading of a magnetic card by generating a disturbance magnetic field. A current in coil 82 can be either direct or alternating.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In general terms, there is provided a magnetic card transaction apparatus that has means for causing a discontinuity in the transfer path or movement along that path of said magnetic card, when the magnetic card projects outwardly from the card slot. In this way, it is possible to prevent reading of the magnetic card by a magnetic head, which is illegally mounted on the outside of the card slot. For example, as described above, in a magnetic card transaction apparatus of the present invention, transferring of a magnetic card is either temporarily suspended or the direction of transferring is reversed during the operation of taking in or ejecting the card from a card slot. However, the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments.
