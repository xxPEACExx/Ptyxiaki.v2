The aforementioned gazette describes that partial separation on the interface between the oxide superconductor and the metal tube caused in sintering can be prevented according to this method by setting the metal tube in the high-pressure state.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">More specifically, the metal tube filled with the oxide superconducting powder can be press-fitted to a sintered body by holding the metal tube in a high-pressure state of 500 to 2000 kg/cm<sup>2</sup> (about 50 to 200 MPa) at least either in the heat treatment or after the heat treatment. Thus, when the superconductor partially causes quenching, heat resulting from this quenching can be quickly removed. In addition, it is also possible to prevent deterioration of the superconductivity resulting from a separation part forming a stress concentration part causing distortion.

Therefore, the wire is compressed before pressurizing gas penetrates into the wire through pinholes, whereby formation of voids and blisters can be sufficiently suppressed by the pressurization.

Therefore, the wire is compressed before pressurizing gas penetrates into the wire through pinholes, whereby formation of voids and blisters can be sufficiently suppressed by the pressurization.

In relation to the critical current density J<sub>c</sub> at a high temperature, the critical temperature<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> T<sub>c</sub> (77 K, for example: since the critical temperature T<sub>c</sub> of the Bi2212 phase is close to or not more than the same) is reduced and hence the critical current density J<sub>c</sub> is also reduced.</p><heading id="h0007">(2) As to Bi2223 Phase</heading><p id="p0029" num="0029">The Bi2223 phase extremely hardly absorbs or discharges oxygen, and the oxygen content thereof hardly changes when the wire is annealed in the oxygen atmosphere.

An oxide superconducting wire 1 has a plurality of oxide superconductor filaments 2 extending in the longitudinal direction and a sheath part 3 covering the same.

Primary rolling is performed on this wire (step S3), followed by a first heat treatment (step S4). An oxide superconducting phase is generated from the raw material powder due to these operations.

When held in this state, creep deformation is caused as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4(c)</figref> so that voids present on the junction interface shrink while a contaminative portion such as an oxide film is partially broken/decomposed to cause diffusion of atoms and progress sintering. The voids between the superconducting crystals 12 finally substantially disappear as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4(d)</figref>, and a stable junction interface is formed.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">To pass a current through a superconducting wire is to pass a current between superconducting crystals constituting the superconducting wire. What limits the quantity of a current passable while keeping a superconducting state (causing no electric resistance) in a refrigerant (e.g., liquid nitrogen or helium, or a refrigerator) for employing a superconducting wire is generally the junction between superconducting crystals having a weak superconducting state (the superconducting crystals have stronger superconductivity than the junction between the crystals). Voids inevitably remain in the junction between the superconducting crystals in normal atmospheric sintering. When the number of voids between the superconducting crystals is reduced, therefore, the performance of the superconducting wire is so improved that reduction of the critical current density can be prevented.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">More specifically, the sintering density of an oxide superconductor heat-treated in the atmospheric pressure was 80 to 90% as to an oxide superconducting wire containing a Bi2223 phase, while the sintering density of an oxide superconductor prepared by setting the total pressure of a pressurized atmosphere to 10 MPa was 93 to 96 %, and reduction of the number of voids formed between oxide superconducting<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> crystals was observed.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Second, the oxide superconducting wire can be prevented from blisters formed in the heat treatment.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The inventors have investigated the number of blisters formed in a heat-treated wire when varying the total pressure for heat-treating an oxide superconducting wire in a pressurized atmosphere. <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref> is a diagram showing the relation between total pressures P (MPa) of a pressurized atmosphere and numbers (/10 m) of blisters of a wire. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>, it is understood that the number of blisters in the oxide superconducting wire is remarkably reduced when the total pressure of the pressurized atmosphere exceeds 0.5 MPa and the blisters in the oxide superconducting wire substantially disappear when the total pressure is in excess of 1 MPa. Such results have been obtained conceivably for the following reason:
<ul><li>Powder of an oxide superconductor is generally filled into a metal tube at a filling factor of about 80 % of the theoretical density before sintering, and hence gas is present in voids of the powder. The gas in the voids of the powder causes cubic expansion when reaching a high temperature in a heat treatment, to blister the wire. According to this example, however, the heat treatment is performed in the pressurized atmosphere of at least 1 MPa, and hence the pressure outside the metal tube can increase beyond that in the metal tube. Thus, the wire is conceivably prevented from blisters caused by the gas in the voids of the powder.</li></ul></p><p id="p0068" num="0068">The inventors have further studied the cause for blisters of the wire, to also recognize that adsorbates such as carbon (C), water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) adhering to the raw material powder of the oxide superconductor are vaporized during sintering and the volume in the metal tube expands due to this gas to blister the wire. However, such blisters of the wire resulting from vaporization of the adsorbates to the powder can also conceivably be prevented since the external pressure can increase beyond the intermetallic internal pressure by performing the heat treatment in the pressurized atmosphere of at least 1 MPa.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Thus, it is conceivably possible to substantially remove not only blisters resulting from the gas present in the voids of the raw material powder of the oxide superconductor but also blisters resulting from vaporization of the adsorbates adhering to the surfaces of particles thereof. The blisters of the oxide superconducting wire cause reduction of the critical current density, and hence reduction of the critical current density can be prevented by preventing the wire from blisters.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Third, the partial oxygen pressure can be readily controlled in the heat treatment.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">The inventors have found that a 2223 phase of a Bi-based oxide superconductor is stably formed when the partial oxygen pressure is controlled to at least 0.003 MPa and not more than 0.02 MPa regardless of the total pressure. A non-superconducting phase such as Ca<sub>2</sub>PbO<sub>4</sub> is formed if the partial oxygen pressure exceeds 0.02 MPa, while the Bi2223 phase is hardly formed and the critical current density is reduced if the partial oxygen pressure is less than 0.003 MPa.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 6</figref> is a diagram showing total pressures and partial oxygen pressures as to a gas mixture containing about 80 % of nitrogen and about 20 % of oxygen. <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref> is a diagram showing the relation between total pressures and oxygen concentration values in a case of setting the partial oxygen pressure constant.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 6</figref>, a Bi2223 phase is stably formed without controlling the partial oxygen pressure when the total pressure of the pressurized atmosphere is the atmospheric pressure of 1 atm (0.1 MPa), for example, since the partial oxygen pressure is equivalent to the level of 0.2 atm (0.02 MPa) shown by a dotted line. As the total pressure of the pressurized atmosphere increases to 2 atm, 3 atm ··· (0.2 MPa, 0.3 MPa, ...), however, the partial oxygen pressure also increases to exceed the level of 0.2 atm shown by the dotted line. Consequently, the Bi2223 phase is not stably formed. Therefore, the partial oxygen pressure must be controlled to at least 0.003 MPa and not more than 0.02 MPa by varying the mixing ratio of oxygen gas in a gas mixture, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref>. A dotted line in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref> shows the level of 0.2 atm (0.02 MPa) similarly to the dotted line in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 6</figref>.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">In practice, the partial oxygen pressure is controlled by monitoring the total<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> pressure and the oxygen concentration. In other words, the partial oxygen pressure is calculated by multiplying the value of the total pressure by the oxygen concentration. Therefore, if the total pressure is 50 MPa, for example, the oxygen concentration is 0.01 % when the heat treatment is performed with a partial oxygen pressure of 0.005 MPa. Therefore, the injected gas mixture must be controlled by measuring the oxygen concentration of 0.01 %. However, the oxygen concentration of 0.01 % is substantially identical to a measurement error, and hence it is difficult to control the oxygen gas in the injected gas mixture by correctly measuring this oxygen concentration. According to this example, the total pressure in the pressurized atmosphere is set to less than 50 MPa so that the concentration of the oxygen gas in the injected gas mixture can be kept high to some extent by reducing influence by a measurement error of the oxygen concentration, whereby the partial oxygen pressure can be readily controlled.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">While this example has been described with reference to the case of constituting the pressurized atmosphere of nitrogen and oxygen, the pressurized atmosphere may be constituted of rare gas and oxygen.

The thickness of a portion (portion A) having pinholes in the wire increases after the heat treatment as compared with that before the heat treatment.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Thus, it has been recognized that formation of voids and blisters can be effectively suppressed by performing the heat treatment in the aforementioned pressure range (at least 1 MPa and less than 50 MPa) when there are no pinholes while formation of voids and blisters cannot be sufficiently suppressed by merely performing the heat treatment in the aforementioned pressure range when there are pinholes.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">In the heat treatment in the pressurized atmosphere according to the present invention, plastic flow and creep deformation take place in the superconducting crystals formed in the heat treatment due to the high pressure of at least 1 MPa outside the wire, whereby voids between the oxide superconducting crystals formed in the heat treatment are suppressed. Further, the gas in the voids of the oxide superconducting crystal<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> powder formed in the heat treatment or the gas adhering to the oxide superconducting crystal powder formed in the heat treatment can be inhibited from expansion in the heat treatment due to the pressure from outside the metal tube, whereby the oxide superconducting wire is inhibited from formation of blisters. Consequently, reduction of the critical current density resulting from voids and blisters is prevented.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">In a wire having pinholes, however, pressurizing gas penetrates into the wire through the pinholes also when the aforementioned heat treatment in the pressurized atmosphere is performed. Therefore, no difference is caused between the internal and external pressures of the wire and formation of voids and blisters is not sufficiently suppressed by the heat treatment in the pressurized atmosphere. Consequently, the effect of preventing reduction of the critical current density is reduced.<br/>
Referring to <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 8</figref>, the thickness W of a sheath part 3 may be increased, in order not to form the pinholes 14 passing from outside up to oxide superconductor filaments 2. If the thickness W of the sheath part 3 is increased, however, the ratio of the oxide superconductor filaments 2 in an oxide superconducting wire 1 is reduced to reduce the quantity of current passable per unit area. Therefore, the inventors have made deep studies, to find that formation of voids and blisters can be suppressed for improving the critical current density without increasing the thickness W of the sheath part 3 also in a wire having pinholes by employing a technique described below.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">According to this technique, pressurization is performed at a speed of at least 0.05 NTa/min. at a heat-up time before a heat treatment in at least either a first heat treatment (step S4) or a second heat treatment (step S6). In the heat treatment, the total pressure in the atmosphere is controlled to continuously increase. In cool-down time immediately after the heat treatment, further, control is made to compensate for reduction of the pressure resulting from temperature reduction (to add a pressure).</p><p id="p0085" num="0085"><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 10</figref> is a diagram showing the relation between temperatures and pressures in a heat treatment step and time in a second example of the present invention.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 10</figref>, the pressure is gently increased according to the state<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> equation of gas at a heat-up time before the heat treatment if the temperature of the atmosphere is not more than 700°C, for example. When the temperature of the atmosphere substantially exceeds 700°C, the pressure in the atmosphere is increased to about 10 MPa. At this time, the pressure in the atmosphere is increased at a blast with a pressing speed of at least 0.05 MPa/min.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">The inventors have found that the speed of pressurizing gas penetrating into a wire through pinholes is less than about 0.05 NPa/min. when an oxide superconducting wire having the pinholes is heat-treated in a pressurized atmosphere. Therefore, the pressure in the atmosphere can be kept higher than that in the wire at the heat-up time before the heat treatment by controlling the total pressure of the atmosphere to continuously increase at a speed of at least 0.05 MPa/min. at the heat-up time before the heat treatment.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">Thereafter the temperature is kept at 830°C, for example, in the heat treatment. On the other hand, the pressure in the atmosphere is continuously increased. While the pressing speed in the heat treatment is preferably as high as possible, the total pressure exceeds 50 MPa if the pressing speed is excessively high and hence the pressure must be continuously increased at such a proper pressing speed that the total pressure in the heat treatment does not exceed 50 MPa. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 10</figref>, the pressure is increased to about 30 MPa.

In other words, the 0.2 % yield strength is reduced to about 50 MPa when the temperature of the atmosphere reaches 400°C, and the 0.2 % yield strength is reduced to about 25 MPa when the temperature of the atmosphere reaches 600°C. Thus, the 0.2 % yield strength of silver is reduced to a level substantially identical to the total pressure (at least 1 MPa and less than 50 MPa) of the aforementioned pressurized atmosphere when the temperature of the atmosphere is 400°C. Further, the 0.2 % yield strength of silver is reduced to about half the total pressure (at least 1 MPa and less than 50 MPa) of the aforementioned pressurized atmosphere when the temperature of the atmosphere is 600°C. According to the aforementioned technique, it follows that a pressure is applied to the wire when the strength of the sheath part is reduced to a level substantially identical to the total pressure of the pressurized atmosphere. Therefore, the sheath part is readily compressed through compressive force resulting from pressurization due to an effect similar to that of hot working. Consequently, the wire is compressed before the pressurizing gas penetrates into the wire through pinholes, whereby formation of voids and blisters can be sufficiently suppressed by the pressurization, and the sintering density of the oxide superconducting filaments can be improved.
