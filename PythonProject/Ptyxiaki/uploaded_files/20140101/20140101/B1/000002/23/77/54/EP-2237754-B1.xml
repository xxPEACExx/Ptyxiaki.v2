Field of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to dressings and scaffolds for wound healing and more specifically to fiber-microsphere composite bioresorbable wound dressings and scaffolds.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>2. Description of Related Art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Advances in materials science has led to the development of materials for wound scaffolds and dressings that function to support and protect soft tissues that are slowly resorbed by the body for the convenience and comfort of a patient. The wound scaffolds and dressings are resorbed through chemical and biological processes of the body of a patient, thus eliminating the additional painful process of removing these wound scaffolds and dressings, which are oftentimes partially or wholly attached to the soft tissue itself.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A recent development to wound healing therapy has been the advent of reduced pressure tissue treatment, where a wound scaffold or dressing is applied to an affected area and a reduced pressure is applied to the wound scaffold or dressing to enhance the removal of wound fluids from the wound area and induce granulation tissue formation. Effectively applying such a reduced pressure requires that the wound scaffold or dressing maintain a certain level of porosity to be able to provide fluid flow-through capabilities during the therapy. Conventional wound scaffolds and dressings, such as gauze and the like, tend to compact between the reduced pressure manifold and the soft tissue, thus significantly decreasing the porosity of the scaffold or dressing. Sponge type material is in use as well for such therapies, yet their composition is not of a material that is bioresorbable, thus they must be removed or replaced from the tissue site from time to time, which may cause some discomfort to a patient.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0004"><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">The problems presented by existing scaffolds and dressings are solved by a fiber-microsphere composite scaffold according to an illustrative embodiment of the invention. The fiber-microsphere composite scaffold includes a first layer of either a resorbable microsphere material or a resorbable fiber material adjacent to a second layer of the other resorbable microsphere material or resorbable fiber material. The fiber-microsphere composite scaffold provides for exudation of the tissue site while preventing complete compression of the fiber-microsphere composite scaffold. When used with a reduced pressure tissue treatment system, the fiber-microsphere composite scaffold provides for good support and flexibility while preventing complete compression and therefore occlusion of the pores of the fiber-microsphere composite scaffold to facilitate the exudation of the wound fluids from the tissue site.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The microsphere material provides thickness and porosity and the fiber material provides support and containment for the microsphere material within the fiber-microsphere composite scaffold. The combination of the alternating layers of fiber material and microsphere material provides for improved flexibility and exudation through the thickness of the microspheres combined with the flexibility and containment of the fiber material. This combination of layers of materials provides good flow of exudated wound fluids while maintaining some resistance to compression through use or reduced pressure. This combination minimizes compression of the fiber-microsphere composite scaffold during use, such as during reduced pressure tissue treatment.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">One illustrative embodiment includes a fiber-microsphere composite scaffold including a first layer of material selected from one of a layer of bioresorbable microspheres and a layer of bioresorbable fibers; and a second layer of material selected from the other of the layer of bioresorbable microspheres and the layer of bioresorbable fibers.

These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical structural, mechanical, electrical, and chemical changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. To avoid detail not necessary to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, the description may omit certain information known to those skilled in the art. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The term "reduced pressure" as used herein generally refers to a pressure less than the ambient pressure at a tissue site that is being subjected to treatment. In most cases, this reduced pressure will be less than the atmospheric pressure at which the patient is located. Alternatively, the reduced pressure may be less than a hydrostatic pressure of tissue at the tissue site. Although the terms "vacuum" and "reduced pressure" may be used to describe the pressure applied to the tissue site, the actual pressure applied to the tissue site may be significantly less than the pressure normally associated with a complete vacuum. Reduced pressure may initially generate fluid flow in the tube and the area of the tissue site. As the hydrostatic pressure around the tissue site approaches the desired reduced pressure, the flow may subside, and the reduced pressure is then maintained. Unless otherwise indicated, values of pressure stated herein are gauge pressures.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The term "tissue site" as used herein refers to a wound or defect located on or within any tissue, including but not limited to, bone tissue, adipose tissue, muscle tissue, neural tissue, dermal tissue, vascular tissue, connective tissue, cartilage, tendons, or ligaments. The term "tissue site" may further refer to areas of any tissue that are not necessarily wounded or defective, but are instead areas in which it is desired to add or promote the growth of additional tissue. For example, reduced pressure tissue treatment may be used in certain tissue areas to grow additional tissue that may be harvested and transplanted to another tissue location.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The term "surface" as used herein refers to all or a portion of a surface comprising the plane of a particular material. The term "layer" as used herein generally refers to all or a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> portion of a particular layer of material. For example, a microsphere layer refers to a layer of material that includes microspheres. Moreover, the term "layer" should be understood to describe almost any shape or form of a material, but commonly will refer to a material that is in the shape of a continuous or discontinuous sheet or film of almost any thickness and degree of regularity or irregularity. A layer may comprise one material, or two or more materials.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present fiber-microsphere composite scaffold may be used on different types of wounds or tissues, such as surface wounds, deep-tissue wounds, and subcutaneous wounds. For example, the fiber-microsphere composite scaffold may be placed adjacent to a bone of a patient and then the skin of the patient may be closed.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, an illustrative embodiment of a fiber-microsphere composite scaffold 100 is shown.

For example, fiber-microsphere composite scaffold 200 may include a fourth or additional layers of material, such as another fiber layer above the microsphere layer 206. In another example, fiber-microsphere composite scaffold 100 may include a fourth or additional layers of material, such as a microsphere layer above the fiber layer 106. The fiber-microsphere composite scaffolds described herein may include any number of layers for a desired application. The additional layers may alternate between fiber layers and microsphere layers or the scaffolds may include adjacent layers of the same type of material.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The flow channels described herein may be created by voids and/or cells in the fiber and microsphere layers that are fluidly connected to or in communication with adjacent voids and/or cells. The flow channels may allow fluid communication throughout a particular layer of the fiber or microsphere material and between layers. The flow channels may be uniform in shape and size, or may include patterned or random variations in shape and size. Variations in shape and size of the voids and/or cells of the fiber and/or microsphere layers may be<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> selectively chosen and used to alter the flow characteristics of fluid and/or exudates through the fiber and/or microsphere layers.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The flow channels described herein allow distribution of reduced pressure and/or transportation of exudates and fluids to and from a particular tissue site. The flow channels provided in each layer of material may be an inherent characteristic of the material, provided for example by the porosity of the layers, or the flow channels may be chemically, mechanically, or otherwise formed in the material prior to or after assembly of the layers of material of the fiber-microsphere composite scaffold. The placement of these layers of material adjacent to one another enables fluid communication between layers.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Regardless of whether pores, voids, apertures, or some other combination thereof are used to define the flow channels, the porosity of one layer of material, either fiber layer or microsphere layer, may be different than an adjacent layer of material to minimize in-growth of tissue into the adjacent layer of material. The porosity of one layer of material, either fiber layer or microsphere layer, may be controlled by limiting the size of the pores, voids, and/or apertures, or by controlling the number (i.e. density) of pores, voids, and/or apertures disposed in a particular layer of material.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The flow channels in the fiber layers may be formed by voids between the individual fibers. For fiber layers comprised of non-woven fibers, the sizing and spacing of the voids may be more random than with fiber layers comprised of woven fibers. The size and density of voids in fiber layers having woven fibers may be selectively controlled based on the tightness of the weave.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The flow channels in the microsphere layers may be formed by voids or spaces between the microspheres.

In another illustrative embodiment, the pore size of the fiber layers and the microsphere layers may be from about 400 microns to about 600 microns. Since the microspheres in the microsphere layers may be adjacent to the fiber layers, it is desired that the voids, pores, or cells of the fiber layers be smaller in size than the size of the microspheres to prevent the microspheres from passing through the voids, pores, or cells of the fiber layers.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The layer of material, either fiber layer or microsphere layer, most distal from the tissue site typically will be the layer of material that is closest to the source of reduced<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> pressure or vacuum applied in the fiber-microsphere composite scaffold reduced pressure tissue treatment apparatuses 400, 500, and 600. This layer of material may assist in distributing the reduced pressure or vacuum received from the reduced pressure 410 via reduced pressure delivery tube 412. This layer of material may further be used to distribute fluids that are introduced to the tissue site or to manifold wound exudates and other fluids collected from the tissue site. In one embodiment, this layer of material may be any porous material that is capable of accomplishing these tasks, and may not be limited to fiber or microsphere layers. For example, the distribution material may include without limitation devices that have structural elements arranged to form flow channels, such as open-cell cellular foams, porous tissue collections, and liquids, gels and other foams that include or cure to include flow channels.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Certain pores, voids, and/or apertures of the layers of material may be "closed" such that the pores, voids, and apertures are not fluidly connected to adjacent pores, voids, and apertures.

In one aspect, the outer membrane layer may be affixed or adhered to the present fiber-microsphere composite scaffold such that it is easily removed by a user prior to placing it a tissue site.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The scaffolds described herein may be substances or structures used to enhance or promote the growth of cells and/or the formation of tissue. The scaffolds are typically three dimensional porous structures that provide a template for cell growth. The scaffolds may be infused with, coated with, or comprised of cells, growth factors, or other nutrients to promote cell growth. A scaffold may be used as a manifold in accordance with the embodiments described herein to administer reduced pressure tissue treatment to a tissue site similar to tissue sites 408, 504, and 604.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The fiber-microsphere composite scaffolds described herein may be any particular thickness, but preferably have a thickness of from about 1 mm to about 30 mm. The thickness of the fiber-microsphere composite scaffolds is typically measured in a direction normal to the tissue site. The thickness of the individual layers comprising the fiber-microsphere composite scaffold may vary depending on the type of layer. For example, in one embodiment, the microsphere layer may have a thickness of between about 0.2 mm and about 1 mm. As<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> another example, in one embodiment, the fiber layer may have a thickness of between about 0.1 mm and about I mm. The dimensions of the fiber-microsphere composite scaffolds in a plane normal to the thickness dimension may vary depending on the size of the tissue site. The fiber-microsphere composite scaffolds and individual fiber layers and microsphere layers may be provided in a large size and then trimmed or formed to fit the tissue site.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The fiber layers described herein may be comprised of continuous filaments or discreet elongated pieces, similar to thread-like materials. Some illustrative fibers include without limitation natural fibers, man-made fibers, mineral fibers, polymer fibers, and those fibers commonly known in the art as microfibers.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The fiber layers described herein may include a mesh of fibers in either a random, unorganized configuration as shown by the cross sections of <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">FIGS. 1 - 6</figref>, or alternatively the fiber layers may comprise an organized fabric configuration also capable of supporting tissue ingrowth. The organized configuration is a fabric configuration which may be comprised of threads, yarns, nets, knits, weaves, laces, or felts of fibers. The fiber layers should be sufficiently open to allow infiltration of exudates and ingrowth of tissue through the open spaces between the fibers. In general, any bioabsorbable material may be suitable as a fiber material for the fiber layers as long as the mechanical properties and rate of bioabsorption are also appropriate for the intended application.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The fibers comprising the fiber layers may be spunbond, meltblown, or otherwise joined. Spunbond fibers are fibers that are formed by extruding molten thermoplastic material as filaments from a plurality of fine, usually circular capillaries of a spinnerette with the diameter of the extruded filaments then being rapidly reduced. Meltblown fibers are fibers that are formed by extruding molten thermoplastic material as filaments from a plurality of fine, usually circular, die capillaries as molten threads or filaments into a high velocity, usually heated gas (e.g., air) stream which attenuates the filaments of molten thermoplastic material to reduce their diameter. Thereafter, the meltblown fibers are carried by the high velocity gas stream and are deposited on a collecting surface to form a fabric of randomly disbursed meltblown fibers. Additionally, the fiber material may be woven or non-woven.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The dimensions of the fiber layers and microsphere layers of the fiber-microsphere composite scaffolds may be any size, thickness, surface area, or volume necessary to fit a desired application. In one embodiment, the fiber layers and microsphere layers may be formed in small sheets having desired thicknesses for a particular application. The fiber layers<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> and microsphere layers may further be manufactured or formed in large sheets to span large tissue sites.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Microspheres may be obtained by various techniques, including by a solvent evaporation method. This method may be described as follows: the active principle to be encapsulated and the polymer which constitutes the microspheres are dissolved in a water-immiscible volatile organic solvent. In one illustrative embodiment, the microspheres may incorporate bioactive agents, such as drugs, growth factors, or other agents. The resulting solution is emulsified using a surface-active agent. Gradual evaporation of the organic solvent leads to the conversion of the droplets of the emulsion into solid microspheres in which the active principle is trapped.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The microspheres may be loose or joined. In one illustrative embodiment, the microspheres are sintered together. The sintering process includes heating the microspheres to a temperature that softens the material of the microspheres. The pressure of the sintering process is also dependent on the other process parameters, such as temperature and of material type of the microspheres.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The material composition of the fiber layers and 510 and microsphere layers described herein may be any bioresorbable material, including polymer-type materials. As used herein, the term bioresorbable generally means a material that slowly dissolves and/or digests in a living being, such as a human, and may be synonymous with bioabsorbable, biodissolvable, biodegradable, and the like. In one embodiment, bioresorbable may describe the property of a material, when the material is exposed to conditions that are typical of those present at a tissue site, to degrade into products that can be naturally removed from the tissue site within a period that substantially coincides with the period of wound healing. Such degradation products can be absorbed into the body of the patient or may be transmitted into another layer of the dressing. The period of wound healing is to be understood to be the period of time measured from the application of a dressing to the time that the wound is substantially healed. This period can range from a period of several days for simple skin abrasions on rapidly healing patients, to several months for chronic wounds on patients that heal more slowly. The dressings described herein may be fabricated so that the time required for bioresorption and/or bioabsorption of the scaffold material can be tailored to match the type of wound and the time necessary for healing. For example, in some dressings, the scaffold material may be designed to degrade within a period of one week, while in other dressings it may be designed to degrade within a period of one-to-three months, or even longer if desirable.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Typically, bioresorbable materials are broken down or metabolized by the body of a patient to smaller components that may ultimately be released from the body. A particular material may also be chosen based on the material's ability to support the growth of new tissue prior to resorption. Examples of suitable bioresorbable materials include without limitation polylactide ("PLA") (both L-lactide and D,L-lactide), copolymer of Poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide), polyglycolic acid ("PGA"), alpha esters, saturated esters, unsaturated esters, orthoesters, carbonates, anhydrides, ethers, amides, saccharides, polyesters, polycarbonates, polycaprolactone ("PCL"), polytrimethylene carbonate ("PTMC"), polydioxanone ("PDO"), polyhydroxybutyrate, polyhydroxyvalerate, polydioxanone, polyorthoesters, polyphosphazenes, polyurethanes, collagen, hyaluronic acid, chitosan, hydroxyapatite, coralline apatite, calcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, carbonates, bioglass, allografts, autografts, and mixtures and/or co-polymers of these compounds. These compounds may be combined to produce co-polymers with fixed ratios of the polymers, such as 70:30 ratio of L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide. In addition, these compounds, polymers, and co-polymers may be linear or non-linear compounds.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In one illustrative embodiment, all or some of the layers of material, both fiber layers and microsphere layers, of the fiber-microsphere composite scaffold may be joined together to provide a unitary scaffold. For example, the alternating layers of material of the fiber-microsphere composite scaffold may be sintered together during manufacture. In another illustrative embodiment, all or some of the layers of material, both fiber layers and microsphere layers, of the fiber-microsphere composite scaffold may be bonded to each other. Bonding may be accomplished by heating all or some of the layers at their interfaces or surfaces and applying force to press the layers into a bonded connection. Alternatively, adhesives or mechanical fasteners may be used to connect the layers to one another as long as the fastening or bonding means does not substantially and negatively affect the distribution of pressure through the layers. For example, bioresorbable or biocompatible adhesives, such as fibrin adhesive, may be used to join the layers of material of the fiber-microsphere composite scaffold. In yet another illustrative embodiment, the layers of material may not be connected to one another, but rather, the layers of material may simply be placed in contact with one another prior to and/or during application of the reduced pressure tissue treatment or nonreduced pressure tissue treatment use. In yet still another illustrative embodiment, two of the layers of material may be bonded to one another, and a third or additional layers of material placed in contact with one of the two bonded layers.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Alternatively, the layers of material may be lightly bound together into a composite, multi-layer dressing prior to its application to the wound. Such binding may be accomplished by forming a second layer, such as for example, fiber layer, directly onto one side of a layer of a microsphere so that there will be points where the layers are bonded at the interface of the two layers. Thermal or ultrasonic pointbonding, as well as certain adhesives, may also be used to bond the layers of material. A feature of the interface between the layers of material is that it provides that the layers may be easily separated by the mere act of manually pulling a second layer from a first layer, for example, without disturbing the location of the first layer on the tissue site.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The addition of the microsphere layers to the fiber-microsphere composite scaffold resists collapsing of the fiber layers during application of reduced pressure. When the microspheres of the microsphere layers are either bonded together or attached to an adjacent fiber layer, the fiber-microsphere composite scaffold is capable of being trimmed or sized to fit a tissue site without substantially loss of individual microspheres.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In addition to the aforementioned aspects and illustrative embodiments of the present fiber-microsphere composite scaffold, a method for manufacturing a fiber-microsphere composite scaffold is provided in another illustrative embodiment. <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a flow chart of a process for making a fiber-microsphere composite scaffold 700. In steps 702 and 704, a first layer of material and a second layer of material are prepared according to the disclosure contained herein. The first layer may be one of a fiber layer or a microsphere layer. The second layer then is the other of the fiber layer or microsphere layer. Additionally, as described above, the first and second layers of material may consist of the same type of material and additional layers of material may be different.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In step 706, an inquiry is made as to whether an additional layer of material is desired. If the answer to this inquiry is "yes," then in step 708 another layer of material is prepared. As long as the answer to the inquiry at step 706 is yes, then additional layers of material, either fiber layers or microsphere layers, are prepared. If the answer to the inquiry in step 706 is "no," then in step 710 the layers of material are oriented where in an alternating fashion based on the type of material. For example, if the first layer of material is a fiber layer, then the second layer of material will be a microsphere layer. Likewise, if the second layer of material is a microsphere layer, then a third layer of material may be a fiber layer, and so on. As described herein, adjacent layers of the same type of material may be oriented next to a layer<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> of material of a different type. In step 712, an inquiry is made as to whether the oriented layers are to be joined or otherwise fastened together.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">If the answer to the inquiry in step 712 is "yes," then in step 714 the layers are joined together according to the principles disclosed herein. If the answer to the inquiry is "no," then the individual layers of material are finished into a fiber-microsphere composite scaffold. Likewise, in step 714, the joined layers are finished into a fiber-microsphere composite scaffold. In step 716, the finished fiber-microsphere composite scaffold may be shaped, formed, trimmed, cut, or the like to complete its final shape. Additionally, in step 716, any additional manufacturing steps, such as finishing, sterilization, packaging, and the like are performed.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an illustrative embodiment of a flow chart of an illustrative process for treating a tissue site with a reduced pressure tissue treatment system 800.
