coated article using the same. More particularly, it relates to a UV-shielding coating composition which is coated onto a plastic or organic resin substrate and heat cured to form a film having visible light transparency, UV-shielding and long-term weatherability, and a coated article using the same. It also relates to a coated article comprising a cured film of the coating composition and a silicon base hard coating thereon, exhibiting mar resistance as well.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>BACKGROUND</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">As a substitute for transparent flat glass, transparent materials having non-shattering nature or greater shatter resistance than glass have been widely used in these years. For example, plastic substrates, especially polycarbonate resins, due to their excellent properties including transparency, impact resistance, and heat resistance, are currently used as structural members in place of glass, in various applications including windows in buildings and vehicles, and meter covers.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, it is strongly desired to improve the surface properties of molded polycarbonate resins because their<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> surface properties like mar resistance and weatherability are poor as compared with glass. Nowadays, polycarbonate resins intended for use as vehicle windows, road noise barriers or the like are desired to withstand weathering over ten years.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Known means for improving the weatherability of molded polycarbonate resins include lamination of an acrylic resin film having good weatherability to the surface of polycarbonate resin substrates, and provision of a UV absorber-containing resin layer on the polycarbonate resin surface by coextrusion or the like.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Also, known means for improving the mar resistance of molded polycarbonate resins include coating of thermosetting resins such as polyorganosiloxane and melamine resins and coating of polyfunctional acrylic photo-curable resins.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Further, a method of producing a transparent part having both weatherability and mar resistance is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPS5692059A"><text>JP-A S56-92059</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JPH01149878A"><text>JP-A H01-149878</text></patcit>. UV-absorbing transparent articles are known comprising a resin substrate, an undercoat layer having a large loading of UV absorber added, and a protective coating of a colloidal silica-laden polysiloxane coating composition formed on the undercoat layer.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, the heavy loading of UV absorber into the undercoat layer gives rise to several problems. The heavy loading can adversely affect the adhesion of the undercoat layer to the underlying substrate or the overlying protective coating of a colloidal silica-laden polysiloxane coating composition. The UV absorber will escape from the undercoat composition via volatilization during heat curing step. On outdoor use over a long period of time, the UV absorber will gradually bleed out, exerting detrimental effects like cracking and whitening or yellowing. It is unacceptable from the standpoint of mar resistance to add a large amount of UV absorber to the colloidal silica-laden polysiloxane coating composition of which the overlying protective coating is made.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is known from <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JPH08151415A"><text>JP-A H08-151415</text></patcit> to form a protective coating on the surface of a synthetic resin or the like using<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> a mixture of a benzotriazole or benzophenone-derived UV-absorbing vinyl monomer and a vinyl monomer copolymerizable therewith as a coating component. This protective coating, however, has only limited mar resistance since it is made of a vinyl polymer.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is also known to form a coating on a resin substrate to produce a multilayer resin article using a copolymer of a benzotriazole or benzophenone-derived UV-absorbing vinyl monomer, an alkoxysilyl-containing vinyl monomer, and a vinyl monomer copolymerizable therewith as a coating component, the coating having adhesion to the resin substrate and imparting weatherability to the article.

These articles are noticeably improved in the adhesion of the polysiloxane resin coating and weatherability. Since the crosslinking network formation of alkoxysilyl groups in the undercoat does not proceed to a full extent, post-crosslinking of residual (or uncured) alkoxysilyl or hydroxysilyl groups can occur with the passage of time, inviting a likelihood of introducing strain to the coating and thus causing defects like cracks and delamination. That is, the coated articles are still insufficient in long-term weathering. In addition, when the coating is exposed to rapid changes of the ambient temperature, especially changes at relatively high temperature, the likelihood of crack occurrence by post-crosslinking is increased.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is also known to use zinc or titanium oxide nanoparticles as the metal oxide nanoparticles having UV shielding property (see <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="JP3319326B"><text>JP 3319326</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="JP3846545B"><text>JP 3846545</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="JPH11209695A"><text>JP-A H11-209695</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="JP3347097B"><text>JP 3347097</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0014" dnum="JP2002060687A"><text>JP-A 2002-60687</text></patcit>). However, on account of residual photocatalytic activity, a coating loaded<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> with such metal oxide nanoparticles can not avoid a phenomenon that the coating develops cracks or peels in a weathering test.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><patcit id="pcit0015" dnum="JP3509749B"><text>JP 3509749</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0016" dnum="JP2002087817A"><text>JP-A 2002-87817</text></patcit> disclose an attempt to suppress photocatalytic activity by coating surfaces of zinc or titanium oxide nanoparticles with another oxide. A coating loaded with surface-coated zinc oxide nanoparticles has a longer lifetime in a weathering test than bare zinc oxide nanoparticles. However, the coating is still insufficient as outdoor UV shielding members partly because cracks develop in a long-term weathering test.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In general, visible light transparency is one of the important properties of coating compositions for forming weather resistant surface protective coatings. If metal oxide nanoparticles are used as the UV shielding agent, visible light transparency is substantially impaired depending on average particle size and tendency to agglomerate. <patcit id="pcit0017" dnum="JPH11278838A"><text>JP-A H11-278838</text></patcit> discloses that when zinc oxide nanoparticles are prepared by a specific method, a dispersion thereof has a smaller particle size and is not susceptible to agglomeration. A coating composition having this zinc oxide nanoparticle dispersion compounded therein would be highly transparent to visible light although this is not described in the Examples.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As discussed above, a number of attempts have been made to improve the weather resistance, mar resistance and other properties of coating compositions. However, there is not available a coating composition whose cured film exhibits mar resistance, UV shielding property, and sufficient weather resistance and durability to withstand prolonged outdoor exposure while maintaining visible light transparency.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Citation List</u></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0018" dnum="JPS5692059A"><text>JP-A S56-92059</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: <patcit id="pcit0019" dnum="JPH01149878A"><text>JP-A H01-149878</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 3: <patcit id="pcit0020" dnum="JPH08151415A"><text>JP-A H08-151415</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 4: <patcit id="pcit0021" dnum="JP2001114841A"><text>JP-A 2001-114841</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 5: <patcit id="pcit0022" dnum="JP3102696B"><text>JP 3102696</text></patcit><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></li><li>Patent Document 6: <patcit id="pcit0023" dnum="JP2001214122A"><text>JP-A 2001-214122</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 7: <patcit id="pcit0024" dnum="JP2001047574A"><text>JP-A 2001-047574</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 8: <patcit id="pcit0025" dnum="JP2007231060A"><text>JP-A 2007-231060</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 9: <patcit id="pcit0026" dnum="JP2008120986A"><text>JP-A 2008-120986</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 10: <patcit id="pcit0027" dnum="JP3319326B"><text>JP 3319326</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 11: <patcit id="pcit0028" dnum="JP3846545B"><text>JP 3846545</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 12: <patcit id="pcit0029" dnum="JPH11209695A"><text>JP-A H11-209695</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 13: <patcit id="pcit0030" dnum="JP3347097B"><text>JP 3347097</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 14: <patcit id="pcit0031" dnum="JP2002060687A"><text>JP-A 2002-060687</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 15: <patcit id="pcit0032" dnum="JP3509749B"><text>JP 3509749</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 16: <patcit id="pcit0033" dnum="JP2002087817A"><text>JP-A 2002-087817</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 17: <patcit id="pcit0034" dnum="JPH11278838A"><text>JP-A H11-278838</text></patcit></li></ul></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A general aim herein is to provide new and useful coating compositions, desirably for coating organic resist substrates e.g. transparent substrates, whose cured films maintain visible light transparency, have mar resistance and UV shielding property, and also have sufficient weather resistance and durability to withstand prolonged outdoor exposure. Related aspects are methods of preparation of the compositions, their use to form coatings on substrates, and articles coated with them in cured state.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The invention pertains in one aspect to a coating composition comprising a resin and zinc oxide nanoparticles as a UV-shielding agent. The inventors have found that when a dispersion of composite zinc oxide nanoparticles obtained by coating zinc oxide nanoparticles with a specific coating so as to suppress photocatalytic activity to a substantial extent is compounded in the coating composition, the cured film exhibits adhesion, mar resistance and UV shielding property, maintains visible light transparency, and offers weather resistance and crack resistance against prolonged outdoor exposure which could not be achieved in the prior art. Specifically, the coating composition is made from (A) a dispersion in a dispersing medium of composite zinc oxide nanoparticles which are obtainable by coating surfaces of zinc oxide nanoparticles with at least one member selected from the group consisting of oxides and hydroxides of Al, Si, Zr and Sn, said dispersion having a photocatalytic<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> degradability of up to 25%, wherein the photocatalytic degradability (PD) is determined by adding the dispersion to a methylene blue solution, irradiating black light to the methylene blue solution for 12 hours, measuring the absorbance of the solution at 653 nm before and after the black light irradiation, and calculating according to the following formula: <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mi>PD</mi><mspace width="1em"/><mfenced><mo>%</mo></mfenced><mo>=</mo><mfenced open="[" close="]" separators=""><mfenced separators=""><mi mathvariant="normal">A</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">0</mn><mo>-</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">A</mi></mfenced><mo>/</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">A</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">0</mn></mfenced><mo>×</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">100</mn></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="78" he="6" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
wherein A0 is the initial absorbance and A is the absorbance after the black light irradiation, (B) a vinyl copolymer obtained from copolymerization of (b-1) 1 to 50% by weight of an alkoxysilyl-containing vinyl monomer, (b-2) 5 to 40% by weight of a UV-absorbing vinyl monomer, and (b-3) 10 to 94% by weight of another monomer copolymerizable therewith, and (C) a solvent, the solids content of composite zinc oxide nanoparticle dispersion (A) being 1 to 50% by weight based on the solids content of vinyl copolymer (B).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">More particularly, the inventors have found the following. A coating composition comprising (A) a dispersion of (optionally surface-coated) composite zinc oxide nanoparticles, (B) a vinyl copolymer having alkoxysilyl and organic UV-absorbing groups attached on side chains, and (C) a solvent is coated and cured into a cured film which has a lower coefficient of linear expansion than prior art coating films. In the film, alkoxysilyl groups in vinyl copolymer (B) and/or SiOH groups resulting from hydrolysis thereof form siloxane crosslinks together, and alkoxysilyl groups in vinyl copolymer (B) and/or SiOH groups resulting from hydrolysis thereof form crosslinks with surface OH groups on the (optionally surface-coated) composite zinc oxide nanoparticles in dispersion (A). These crosslinks form a dense three-dimensional crosslink network, which contributes to a low coefficient of linear expansion, together with the low expansion of the (optionally surface-coated) composite zinc oxide nanoparticles themselves. Further when a polysiloxane base hard resin coating is laid on this coating film which<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> serves as a primer, the resulting coating system is resistant to cracking and delamination over a long period of time.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The vinyl copolymer (B) has organic UV-absorbing groups attached to side chains which are crosslinked within the film of the coating composition. That is, UV-absorbing groups are anchored within the film to control a propensity of UV-absorbing groups to migrate toward the film surface. This obviates a whitening phenomenon of outer appearance and a loss of adhesion, prevents dissolution or leaching of UV-absorbing groups in water or solvent, minimizes a reduction with time of the UV-absorbing effect, and prevents volatilization of UV-absorbing groups from the film during heat curing treatment at high temperature. In addition, the (optionally surface-coated) composite zinc oxide nanoparticles in dispersion (A) have effective UV shielding property. The synergy of the composite zinc oxide nanoparticles in dispersion (A) with the vinyl copolymer (B) provides outstanding UV resistance which has not been available in the prior art.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">When an organopolysiloxane base hard protective coating layer is laid on a primer layer of the coating composition, alkoxysilyl groups in vinyl copolymer (B) and/or SiOH groups resulting from hydrolysis thereof and OH groups pendant from surfaces of (optionally surface-coated) composite zinc oxide nanoparticles in dispersion (A) offer reactivity with the organopolysiloxane base hard protective coating layer, contributing to adhesion. Also the alkoxysilyl groups and/or SiOH groups resulting from hydrolysis thereof form crosslinks, contributing to heat resistance as well as mar resistance and weatherability.

In general, zinc oxide nanoparticles have a UV shielding function and a photocatalyst function at the same time.

By contrast, the (surface-coated) composite zinc oxide nanoparticles have a very low photocatalytic activity, minimizing crack formation. Since the (surface-coated) composite zinc oxide nanoparticles are prepared by coating surfaces of zinc oxide nanoparticles with an oxide or hydroxide, typically silica, and are preferably further surface treated with a hydrolyzable silane, their photocatalytic activity is minimized.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The photocatalytic activity may be evaluated by measuring a change of absorbance by photodegradation of methylene blue.

The DC arc plasma method is most preferred because of high productivity. Since the zinc oxide nanoparticles prepared by the DC arc plasma method have very strong adsorptivity probably because of good surface crystallinity so that they strongly adsorb amino, imino, quaternary ammonium base or other functional groups in a dispersant, the particles are uniformly dispersed and they do<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> not adsorb each other. As a result, a coating composition having compounded therein the zinc oxide nanoparticles prepared by the DC arc plasma method may form a coating which is highly transparent and free of turbidity. A dispersant may preferably be used in dispersing composite zinc oxide nanoparticles in a dispersing medium.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The DC arc plasma method which is preferably used in preparing zinc oxide nanoparticles involves the steps of providing a consumable anode made of a zinc source such as metallic zinc, producing a plasma flame of argon gas from a cathode, heating the zinc source for evaporation, and oxidizing the zinc vapor, followed by cooling. By this method, zinc oxide nanoparticles are effectively prepared, which have an average particle size (volume average particle size D<sub>50</sub>) in the range of 10 to 200 nm as measured by the light scattering method. Particles with an average particle size of less than 10 nm may be inefficient to prepare whereas an average particle size of more than 200 nm indicates a more possibility of coarse particle formation.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">For component (A), composite zinc oxide nanoparticles are prepared by coating surfaces of zinc oxide nanoparticles with at least one member selected from oxides and hydroxides of Al, Si, Zr and Sn. Examples of the composite zinc oxide nanoparticles include those in which zinc oxide nanoparticles are provided with an oxide coating by using an alkoxide of Al, Si, Zr or Sn and effecting hydrolysis, and those which are obtained by adding a sodium silicate aqueous solution to zinc oxide nanoparticles, neutralizing the solution for causing an oxide or hydroxide to precipitate on particle surfaces, and optionally further heating the precipitated oxide or hydroxide to enhance crystallinity.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In the composite zinc oxide nanoparticles, the coating weight of oxide and/or hydroxide is preferably 0.1 to 20% by weight, and more preferably 1 to 10% by weight. If the coating weight is less than 0.1 wt%, then such a coating is ineffective for controlling photocatalytic activity and difficult to improve chemical resistance. If the coating<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> weight is more than 20 wt%, then the amount of the core zinc oxide is less than 80 wt%, sometimes leading to a loss of UV shielding efficiency per unit weight.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In a preferred embodiment, the composite zinc oxide nanoparticles are further surface treated with at least one member selected from hydrolyzable silanes and partially hydrolytic condensates thereof, to produce surface-coated composite oxide nanoparticles.

For the hydrolysis, metal oxide nanoparticles, typically colloidal silica, dispersed in water may also be used.

Suitable catalysts include organic acids and inorganic acids such as hydrogen fluoride, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, maleic acid, benzoic acid, malonic acid, glutaric acid, glycolic acid, methanesulfonic acid, and toluenesulfonic acid, solid acid catalysts such as cation exchange resins having carboxylic or sulfonic acid groups on the surface, and water-dispersed metal oxide nanoparticles such as acidic water-dispersed colloidal silica.

An excess amount of water may not only lead to a reduction of system efficiency, but also give rise to a problem that when the hydrolyzate is formulated in a final coating composition, the hydrolyzate may have a reduced solubility in the vinyl polymer (B), and the remaining water can adversely affect to detract from coating and drying efficiencies. With these taken into account, the amount of water is preferably from 50 parts to 200 parts by weight.

Condensation may be effected continuous to the hydrolysis while maintaining the liquid temperature at room temperature or heating at a temperature of not higher than 100°C. A temperature higher than 100°C may cause gelation. Condensation may be promoted by distilling off the alcohol or ketone formed by hydrolysis at a temperature of at least 80°C and atmospheric or subatmospheric pressure. Also for the purpose of promoting condensation, condensation catalysts such as basic compounds, acidic compounds or metal chelates may be added. Prior to or during the condensation step, an organic solvent may be added for the purpose of adjusting the progress of condensation or the concentration, or a dispersion of metal oxide nanoparticles such as colloidal silica in water or organic solvent may also be added.

With a Mw below the range, a coating<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> tends to have low toughness and insufficient adhesion.

At this point, metal oxide nanoparticles dispersed in water such as silica sol may be used. A catalyst may be added to the system for adjusting its pH to the described range and to promote hydrolysis. Suitable catalysts include organic acids and inorganic acids such as hydrogen fluoride, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, maleic acid, benzoic acid, malonic acid, glutaric acid, glycolic acid, methanesulfonic acid, and toluenesulfonic acid, solid acid catalysts such as cation exchange resins having carboxylic or sulfonic acid groups on the surface, and water-dispersed metal oxide nanoparticles such as acidic water-dispersed silica sol. Alternatively, a dispersion of metal oxide nanoparticles in water or organic solvent such as silica sol may be co-present upon hydrolysis. In case the dispersing medium of the (surface-coated) composite zinc oxide nanoparticle dispersion as component (A) is water or a water-soluble organic solvent, it is acceptable to mix water, an acidic hydrolytic catalyst and alkoxysilane<!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --> in the co-presence of this dispersion so that hydrolytic condensation reaction may take place.

An excess of water may lower system efficiency and in a final coating composition, residual water can adversely affect coating operation and drying. Water is preferably used in an amount of 50 parts by weight to less than 150 parts by weight for the purpose of improving storage stability, mar resistance, and crack resistance.

Also for the purpose of promoting condensation, condensation catalysts such as basic compounds, acidic compounds or metal chelates may be added. Prior to or during the condensation step, an organic solvent may be added for the purpose of adjusting the progress of condensation or the concentration, or a dispersion of metal oxide nanoparticles in water or organic solvent such as silica sol or the (surface-coated) composite zinc oxide nanoparticle dispersion (A) may also be added. For the reason that a silicone resin generally builds up its molecular weight and reduces its solubility in water or alcohol formed as condensation proceeds, the organic solvent added herein should preferably be one having a boiling point of at least 80°C and a relatively highly polarity in which the silicone resin is fully dissolvable. Examples of the organic solvent include alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol, n-butanol, isobutanol, t-butanol, and diacetone alcohol; ketones such as methyl propyl ketone, diethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone, and diacetone alcohol; ethers such as dipropyl ether, dibutyl ether, anisole, dioxane, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, and propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA); and esters such as propyl acetate, butyl acetate, and cyclohexyl acetate.</p><p id="p0153" num="0153">The silicone resin resulting from condensation should preferably have a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of at least 1,500, more preferably 1,500 to 50,000, and even more preferably 2,000 to 20,000, as measured by GPC versus polystyrene standards.

The coating solution was applied onto a cleaned surface of a 0.5 mm polycarbonate resin substrate (Iupilon® Sheet, Mitsubishi Engineering-Plastics Corp.) by dip coating and heat cured at 120°C for 60 minutes to form a film of about 6-8 µm thick. The film was tested for physical properties, with the results also shown in Tables 3 and 4.<br/>
(1) Dispersion stability<br/>
The coating composition was allowed to stand at room temperature for one week, after which the dispersed state of (surface-coated) composite zinc oxide nanoparticles was observed and rated according to the following criterion.
<ul><li>○: well dispersed, no settlement</li><li>×: agglomerated and settled</li></ul>
(2) Coefficient of linear expansion (CE)<br/>
A 1.5 g portion of the coating composition was weighed and placed in an aluminum cup where it was held at room temperature for 8 hours, allowing volatile components to evaporate off. The sample was heat cured on a hot plate at 80°C for 1 hour and at 130°C for 1 hour, then allowed to cool down to room temperature. The cured film was stripped from the aluminum cup, and a specimen of 15 mm × 5 mm was punched out (thickness about 150 µm).

(3) Initial film appearance<br/>
A cured film of the coating composition in a single film form was visually observed for outer appearance.<br/>
(4) Film transparency<br/>
A film was measured for haze by a haze meter NDH2000 (Nippon Denshoku Industries Co., Ltd.).<br/>
(5) Initial adhesion<br/>
The coated substrate was examined for adhesion by a cross-hatch adhesion test according to JIS K5400, specifically by scribing the sample with a razor along 6 longitudinal and 6 transverse lines at a spacing of 2 mm to define 25 square sections, tightly attaching adhesive tape (commercially available) thereto, rapidly pulling back the adhesive tape at an angle of 90°, and counting the number (X) of coating sections kept unpeeled. The result is expressed as X/25.<br/>
(6) Appearance and adhesion after water immersion<br/>
The coated substrate was immersed in boiling water for 2 hours, after which it was visually observed for appearance and examined for adhesion by the adhesion test (5).<br/>
(7) Mar resistance<br/>
Mar resistance was analyzed according to ASTM D1044 by mounting a Taber abrasion tester with wheels CS-10F, measuring a haze after 500 turns under a load of 500 g, and calculating a haze difference (ΔHz, %) before and after the test.<br/>
(8) Weather resistance<br/>
A weathering test was carried out by Eyesuper™ UV tester (Iwasaki Electric Co., Ltd.) which operated one cycle of [black panel temperature 63°C, humidity 50% RH, illuminance 50 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, raining intervals of 10 sec/hour for 5 hours] and [black panel temperature 30°C, humidity 95% RH for 1 hour]. The test was continued for 250 hours and 500 hours. A yellowing index (YI) was measured according to JIS K7103 before and after the test, from which a change of yellowing<!-- EPO <DP n="65"> --> index (ΔYI) was computed.
