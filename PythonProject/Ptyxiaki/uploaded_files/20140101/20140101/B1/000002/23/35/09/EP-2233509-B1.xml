id="p0002" num="0002">Since aromatic polyesters typified by polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene-2,6-naphthalate have excellent mechanical properties, dimensional stability and heat resistance, they are widely used in films. Especially polyethylene-2,6-naphthalate has more excellent mechanical properties, dimensional stability and heat resistance than polyethylene terephthalate and is therefore used in application fields in which the requirements for these properties are very high, for example, base films for high-density magnetic recording media. However, the requirement for dimensional stability is becoming higher and higher in high-density magnetic recording media, and the further improvement of this property is desired.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Patent Documents 1 to 4 propose a polyalkylene-6,6'-(alkylenedioxy)di-2-naphthoate obtained from a diethyl-6,6'-(alkylenedioxy)di-2-naphthoate which is an ester compound of 6,6'-(alkylenedioxy)di-2-naphthoic acid. According to these documents, a crystalline polyethylene-6,6'-(ethylenedioxy)di-2-naphthoate having a melting point of 294°C is presented.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, since the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> polyalkylene-6,6'-(alkylenedioxy)di-2-naphthoate presented by these patent documents has a very high melting point and very high crystallinity, it has the following problems: when it is to be formed into a film, its extrusion becomes nonuniform due to low fluidity in a molten state, and when it is to be stretched after it is extruded, its crystallization proceeds and it is broken by stretching at a high draw ratio.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent Document 3 teaches that a magnetic recording flexible disk having a small tracking shift is obtained by setting the maximum temperature expansion coefficient of a film comprising polyethylene-6,6'-(ethylenedioxy)di-2-naphthoate to 10 to 35 (ppm/°C), the maximum humidity expansion coefficient of the film to 0 to 8 (ppm/%RH), the difference between the maximum and minimum temperature expansion coefficients to 0 to 6.0 (ppm/°C) and the difference between the maximum and minimum humidity expansion coefficients to 0 to 4.0 (pm/%RH).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, the requirement for the improvement of recording density in magnetic recording media is now very high and, accordingly, dimensional stability required for the base film cannot be attained not only with polyethylene terephthalate but also with polyethylene-2,6-naphthalate and a film presented by Patent Document 3.

As the Young's modulus becomes higher, these expansion coefficients become lower. However, the Young's modulus cannot be increased infinitely and has its limits from the viewpoints of film formability and the acquisition of a Young's modulus in an orthogonal direction. Therefore, even when the Young's modulus is almost the same, a film having a low temperature expansion coefficient and a low humidity expansion coefficient is desired. Since a film comprising the above polyalkylene-6,6'-(alkylenedioxy)di-2-naphthoate has a low humidity expansion coefficient though its Young's modulus is low, it is considered as a preferred film which meets the above requirement.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">However, referring to the above Patent Documents 1 to 4, though a film comprising a polyalkylene-6,6'-(alkylenedioxy)di-2-naphthoate can have a very high Young's modulus in one direction, its Young's modulus in a direction orthogonal to the above direction is extremely low. Further, it has another problem that its temperature expansion coefficient is very high though its humidity expansion coefficient is very low.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The inventors of the present invention found that, when an aromatic dicarboxylic acid component such as naphthalenedicarboxylic acid and a 6,6'-(alkylenedioxy)di-2-naphthoic acid component are copolymerized, a film having excellent properties of both the aromatic dicarboxylic acid and the polyalkylene-6,6'-(alkylenedioxy)di-2-naphthoic acid can be obtained and filed a patent application for this<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> invention.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">This polyester resin comprising the 6,6'-(alkylenedioxy)di-2-naphthoic acid component as a comonomer has excellent properties and is a useful resin. However, it was found that, in the production of a magnetic recording medium having a film comprising this resin as a base film, when tension is applied to the film at a high temperature in the step of applying a coating composition for forming a magnetic layer and drying it, the base film elongates, thereby making it impossible to form a uniform magnetic layer. This problem does not occur in a film comprising polyethylene-2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Then, the inventors of the present invention conducted intensive studies on the elongation of the film and found that the elongation can be suppressed by controlling the ratio of a recurring unit derived from the 6,6'-(alkylenedioxy)di-2-naphthoic acid component and another recurring unit adjacent to the above recurring unit. The present invention was accomplished based on this finding.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a polyester resin comprising a recurring unit (A) represented by the following formula and a recurring unit (B) represented by the following formula as the main constituents:<br/>

Further, these coating layers were calendered with a small-sized test calender (five sets of steel rolls and nylon rolls) at a temperature of 70°C and a linear pressure of 200 kg/cm and cured at 70°C for 48 hours. The coating nonuniformity of the obtained film having a magnetic layer was checked with the eye based on the following criteria. Visual checking was carried out by installing a fluorescent lamp on the rear side of the film and counting light leaks through the magnetic layer. A back coat layer was formed on the film having a magnetic layer as required, and the resulting laminate was slit to a width of 12.65 mm and set in a cassette to obtain a magnetic recording tape.
