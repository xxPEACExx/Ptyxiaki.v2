load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0002">Field of the Invention:</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an exposure device (exposure apparatus) provided with a plurality of light-emitting sections (a plurality of blinking sections or intermittent light-emitting sections such as LED heads, etc.), and a method for producing the exposure device.</p><heading id="h0003">Description of the Related Art:</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">An exposure member (for example, LED head (Light Emitting Diode head), etc.) which has a plurality of light-emitting sections arranged in a row and which expose a photosensitive or photoconductive body is conventionally used in an image-forming apparatus. Such an exposure device is provided with a light-emitting element such as LED, etc. and a casing which holds the light-emitting element. The exposure device needs to be subjected to positioning (subjected to positional adjustment) correctly with respect to the photosensitive body so that the exposure position with respect to the photosensitive body is accurate so as to form a satisfactory image. In Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2002361931A"><text>2002-361931</text></patcit>, there is disclosed an exposure device in which a frame supporting a photoconductive drum (photoconductive body) is positioned with respect to an LED head (exposure member) by using a structure having a concave-convex shape, etc.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The exposure device which is disclosed in the above-mentioned Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2002361931A"><text>2002-361931</text></patcit> and which exposes the photoconductive drum is provided with an LED head having an LED, an lens array<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> which forms an image (images) of a light emitted from the LED on the photoconductive drum as an erecting image, at xl magnification; and a housing which supports the LED and the lens array. The lens array includes GRIN lenses which are made of glass, which are gradient index lenses (each having refractive index gradient) and which are aligned in a row or in a plurality of rows; and the lens array is formed in an elongated shape extending in the axis direction of the photoconductive drum.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Further, the elongated lens array is arranged in the housing so as to protrude downward form the lower surface of the housing, and the lens array has the corner portions, on both ends in the longitudinal direction of the lens array, which are pointed substantially at a right angle.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Furthermore, in the exposure device disclosed in the above-mentioned Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2002361931A"><text>2002-361931</text></patcit>, a spacer for maintaining the spacing distance, in the optical axis direction, between the LED head and the photoconductive drum is arranged between the LED head and the photoconductive drum. Conventionally, as an example of such image-forming apparatus, there is known an image-forming apparatus in which an eccentric cam is arranged between a plate-shaped spacer and the LED head to thereby finely adjust, with the eccentric cam, the spacing distance in the optical axis direction (hereinafter referred to as "optical axis-direction distance) between the photoconductive drum and the LED head.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In a case that, as in the exposure device disclosed in the above-mentioned Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2002361931A"><text>2002-361931</text></patcit>, the frame supporting the photoconductive drum (photoconductive body) is to be positioned with respect to the LED head (exposure member) by using a structure having a concave-convex shape, etc., it is necessary to construct the casing of the LED head with high precision and with high rigidity. Therefore, it is hitherto necessary to produce the casing of the LED head with the aluminum die casting, etc. When the LED head is produced with such material and such producing method, then there is a problem such that the LED head becomes large-sized and the production cost becomes higher.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Moreover, even if a positioning portion with the concave-convex positioning structure is formed in the casing, it is not easy to fix (firmly fix) the light-emitting element to the casing and while maintaining a positional relationship between the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> light-emitting section of the light-emitting element and the positioning portion with high precision. Therefore, the positional relationship between the light-emitting section of the light-emitting element and the concave-convex positioning structure in the conventional apparatus has unsatisfactory or low precision, and there is a problem such that the positioning precision between the photoconductive body and the light-emitting section is low when the casing provided with the concave-convex positioning structure is simply assembled into other member or component.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further, since the above-described LED head is used in the vicinity of or closely to the photoconductive drum, there is a fear that when the image-forming apparatus such as a printer is used for a long period of time, toner scattered from the photoconductive drum, etc. and/or paper powder generated from a paper sheet, etc. are attached or adhered to the lower surface of the lens array, which in turn lower the image quality. In this case, it is possible to remove the toner, etc. from the lower surface of the lens array by wiping the lower surface with a cloth or the like. However, when the corner portions on the both ends of the lens array are pointed or sharp as in the apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2002361931A"><text>2002-361931</text></patcit>, the cloth, etc. is caught or hooked by the corner portion(s), which in turn makes the cleaning operation with the cloth, etc. complicated. Moreover, when the cloth caught at the corner portion is torn and the fiber generated from the torn portion of the cloth is adhered to the lower surface of the lens array, there is a fear that the image quality is further lowered.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In addition, in the conventional technique (apparatus), the size of the eccentric cam and/or the spacer needs to be very small since the optical axis-direction distance is short, giving rise to the limitation to the precision in adjustment by the eccentric cam and the cam stroke. If such limitation is generated, it is not possible to set the optical axis-direction distance highly precisely, giving rise to a possibility that the image quality is lowered.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The inventors of the present application have developed a structure provided with a support frame which supports the LED head; a spacing distance-maintaining member (corresponding to the spacer) which maintains the spacing distance (distance) between the support frame and the photoconductive drum; and a cam which is arranged between the support frame and the LED head. With this structure, there is no need to provide any spacing distance-maintaining member or cam<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> between the LED head and the photoconductive drum in the optical axis-distance which is short, thus solving the problems described above associated with the limitation to the precision in adjustment by the eccentric cam and the cam stroke and consequently the lowering of image quality.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">However, with the above-described structure, when an excessive force is applied to the LED head upon, for example, cleaning the LED head, the LED warps with the cam as the warpage point and is elastically deformed in some cases. If the LED head is elastically deformed in such a manner, then the direction of the light emitted from the LED head is deviated from the normal direction, thus leading to a problem such that the image quality is lowered.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">From <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US20050001896A1"><text>US 2005/0001896 A1</text></patcit> an optical write head as an exposure device is known mounted on a printer. The optical write head has a lens holder, a substrate having light-emitting elements array chips thereon and a heat sink. The substrate is fixed on the heat sink.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In particular, cone-shaped projections are provided outside the lens forming area in the middle on one surface of a resin lens plate and depressions to be fitted to these projections are formed on the other surface. A resin lens array is formed by stacking the resin lens plate one over another through fitting these projections and depressions to each other. A fitting depression having a flat supporting seat face at a position on an optical path of light emitted by light-emitting elements of a light-emitting element array chip is formed on the lens holder, and the resin lens array is placed in the fitting depression. A transparent cover composed of a flat and smooth plate is arranged over the output surface of the resin lens array and a metal retainer is attached to the transparent cover so that a pressing pressure is always applied to the resin lens array.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="JP2005028606A"><text>JP 2005-028606 A</text></patcit> discloses an exposure device according to the preamble of claim 1 and a method for producing an exposure device according to the preamble of claim 15. It shows an optical writing unit is known, which comprises a light-emitting element array arranged linearly with a plurality of light-emitting elements, an imaging element array arranged linearly with a plurality of imaging elements, a member for holding the light-emitting element array and the imaging element array, and a member for supporting<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the holding member, wherein the supporting member is imparted with a positional adjustment reference.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The present invention was made in view of such a situation. Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to provide an exposure device and a method for producing an exposure device, by which the adjustability of a frame member with respect to a casing is improved.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the present invention, this object is achieved by the exposure device having the features of claim 1 and by a method for producing an exposure device having the features of claim 15. Advantageous further developments are set forth in the dependent claims.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to such an exposure device, the exposure head and the frame member are fixed to each other such that the light-emitting sections and the reference portion are in a correct positional relationship. Therefore, even when the construction is adopted in which the exposure device is assembled successively into another member, such as a support member supporting the exposure device and the body of the image-forming apparatus, etc., it is possible to provide a correct positional relationship between the photoconductive body and the exposure device.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">With such a method for producing the exposure device, it is possible to produce the above-described exposure device. Further, upon producing the exposure device, the positional relationship between the light-emitting sections and the reference portion is fixed (determined) by curing the first adhesive while the position of the reference portion is adjusted with respect to the light-emitting sections. Afterwards, by adhering the casing and the frame member with the second adhesive at a portion of the casing and a portion of the frame member which are different from the projections, it is possible to firmly fix the casing and the frame member with each other. Further, the second adhesive has elastic coefficient after curing which is<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> smaller from that of the first adhesive. Therefore, the force exerting to and warping the casing and the frame member due to the shrinkage (contraction) of the second adhesive when the second adhesive is cured is relatively small, and thus preventing any inconvenience or problem which would be otherwise caused such that the positional relationship, between the light emitting sections and the reference portion with the first adhesive, obtained upon fixing the casing and the frame member with the first adhesive, is disarranged or degraded; and thus making it possible to maintain satisfactory positional relationship.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The exposure device of the present invention may further include: an elongated lens array which focuses the light emitted from the light-emitting sections; a housing which supports the lens array such that the lens array is projected outward from the housing; and covers which are made of resin and arranged on the lens array on both ends, respectively, in a longitudinal direction of the lens array, the covers each having a height flush with or higher than a light-exit surface of the lens array.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In this case, the covers are provided which are made of resin and arranged on the lens array on both ends, respectively, in the longitudinal direction of the lens array, the covers each having a height flush with or higher than the light-exit surface of the lens array. Therefore, at the time of cleaning, it is possible to prevent, with the covers, the cloths, etc. from being caught or hooked at a corner portion of the lens array.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Accordingly, it is possible to easily perform the cleaning operation for the lens array and to suppress the cloth, etc. from being torn, thereby making it possible to maintain the image quality satisfactorily.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The exposure device of the present invention may further include: a support frame which supports the exposure head; and two adjusting members which are arranged between the exposure head and the support frame to be away from each other in a longitudinal direction of the exposure head, and which adjust a spacing distance between the exposure head and the support frame; wherein a projection portion may be provided on one of the exposure head and the support frame at a portion between the two adjusting members, the projection portion projecting from one of the exposure head and the support frame toward the other of the exposure head and the support frame.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In this case, the projection portion is provided on one of the exposure head<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> and the support frame at a portion between the two adjusting members, the projection portion projecting from one of the exposure head and the support frame toward the other of the exposure head and the support frame. Accordingly, even when any excessive force is applied to the exposure head and the exposure head attempts to warp with the two adjusting members as the warpage points, the projection portion and the support frame (or the exposure head) abut or come into contact with each other.

The transport belt 73 makes contact with the respective photoconductive drums 53 on the outer surface of the transport belt 73. On the inner surface side of the transport belt 73, four pieces of the transfer roller 74 are arranged to be opposite to (to face) the photoconductive drums 53, respectively.

A member constructed by assembling the casing 110, the LED circuit board 130 and the lens array 140 is an LED head 180 as an example of the exposure head.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The casing 110 has a body 111 of the casing (case body 111) which is made of resin in a shape elongated in the right and left direction, and an opening is formed in the case body 111 at an upper portion of the case body 111. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, an opening 112 is formed in the case body 111 at a lower portion of the case body 111. The opening 112 allows a light emitted from an LED array 132, of the LED circuit board 130, to pass through the opening 112. Edge portions at the upper end of<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> the case body 111 forms a flange 113 extending outward in the front/rear direction of the case body 111. The upper surface of the flange 113 and the upper surface of edge portions, of the case body 111, in the left/right direction are, as will be described later on, is an adhesion surface 113A to be adhered to the plate member 120 with an adhesive 150 (first adhesive 151 and second adhesive 152).</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Two pieces of a projection 114 are formed in the adhesion surface 113A at each of the both ends in the longitudinal direction of the adhesion surface 113A. Each of the projections 114 is projected upward, namely toward the plate member 120. To explain in more detail, the projection 114 is arranged in the flange 113 at each of the end portions in the longitudinal direction of the flange 113, so that the projections 114 are provided on the flange 113 both at the front and rear sides, respectively. When the casing 110 is adhered to the plate member 120, the four projection 114 are brought into contact with the plate member 120 and serve as portions (positioning portions) determining a relationship between the orientation of the plate member 120 and the orientation of the casing 110. Note that, as will be described later on, the adhesive 150 is coated on the projections 114. Accordingly, the projections 114 are brought into contact with the plate 120 via the adhesive 150.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, the plate member 120 is provided with an elongated metal plate (plate body 121) which covers the upper portion of the casing 110 (case body 111). In the plate body 121 of the plate member 120, reference holes 122 and 123 as an example of the reference portion, and a wiring hole 125 are formed by the press working. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, the plate member 120 is formed to have a width greater than the width of the casing 110. Here, the term "width of the plate member 120 (width of the casing 110)" means a width of the plate member 120 (casing 110) in the front/rear direction which is orthogonal to the optical axis of the light emitted from the LED array 132 (to be described later on) and orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the plate member 120 (casing 110). Since the width of the plate member 120 is greater than the width of the casing 110, the adhesion surface 113A (see <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>) of the casing 110 faces (is opposite to) the plate member 120 even if the plate member 120 is shifted in the width direction to some extent with respect to the casing 110. This makes it possible to perform the positional adjustment in the width direction of the casing 110.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In this exemplary embodiment, the plate member 120 is not provided with any<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> mechanical engagement to be positioned with respect to the casing 110 (LED head 180).

However, note that with respect to the longitudinal direction of the LED head 180, if the LED elements are arranged in an area (range) broader than an image formation range (area) of image to be formed on the paper P, then the exposure can be performed in an appropriate exposure range by adjusting the signal to be transmitted to the LED head 180. Therefore, it is allowable to perform the positioning with respect to the longitudinal direction of the LED head 180 by a mechanical engagement between the plate member 120 and the casing 110 (LED head 180). Accordingly, it is allowable that the plate member 120 and the LED head 180 are in a relationship such that the plate member 120 and the LED head 180 are movable relative to each other in a range in which the positional adjustment between the plate member 120 and the LED head 180 can be performed at least regarding the width direction of the LED head 180.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In a case that the plate body 121 is made of a metal plate, it is possible to lower the production cost and to obtain such a rigidity of the plate body 121 that the plate body 121 sufficiently reinforces the casing 110. In addition, an effect can be obtained to shield electromagnetic wave generated from the LED circuit board 130. It is possible to use, as the material for forming the plate body 121, iron, aluminum alloy, etc. However, it is also possible to use a material other than the iron, aluminum alloy, etc., a material such as hard resin, FRP, ceramics or the like.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, the reference hole 122 on the right side is a circular hole, and the reference hole 123 on the left side is a long hole elongated in the longitudinal direction of the plate member 120. The reference holes 122 and 123 each serve as a positioning portion into each of which a positioning pin 41C of the head supporting member 41 is fitted to thereby position the head supporting member 41 and the LED exposure device 100 with each other. Since the reference hole 123 is a long hole, it is possible to absorb or tolerate the size change such as the expansion or contraction due to the temperature change in the LED exposure device 100 and the head supporting member 41.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The LED circuit board 130 is provided with a circuit board 131, an LED<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> array 132 arranged on the circuit board 131, and a harness 133.

The rollers 41B are rolled on the circumferential surface of the photoconductive drum 53, at a portion adjacent to the photoconductive surface 53A, and serve as a spacing distance-maintaining member for maintaining the spacing distance (distance) between the LED array 132 and the photoconductive surface 53A of the photoconductive drum 53. Further, the head supporting member 41 is provided with two pieces of the positioning pin 41C extending downward.

Then, the first adhesive 151 is coated (applied) on the projections 114 on the adhesion surface 113A of the casing 110, the projections 114 being arranged on the adhesion surface 113A at four positions, respectively, and on the adhesion surface 113A at two inner portions located inside, with respect to the projections 114, in the longitudinal direction of the adhesion surface 113A. Note that with respect to the inner portions as described above, since the first adhesive 151 are coated on the both flanges in the front and rear sides, the adhesive 151 is coated on the inner portions at four positions in total. The first adhesive 151 is a public known photo-curable resin. Then, the harness 133 is passed through the wiring hole 125 of the plate member 120.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Afterwards, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6B</figref>, a positioning jig 200 is used to subject the casing 110 and the plate member 120 to the positional adjustment (positioned with each other).

The positioning jig 200 has an elongated measurement stand 201, and a side wall 202 extending upward from one end of the measurement stand 201. In the positioning jig 200, placement portions 203 on which the casing 110 is to be placed are formed on the upper surface of the measurement stand 201, at both end portions of the upper surface, respectively, to project upward from the both end portions.

The CCD 204 receives the light emitted from the certain LED element. The light received by the CCD 204 is outputted to an image analyzer 208 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 6C</figref>, and a shift amount (deviation amount) of the position of the casing 110, with respect to the plate member 120, in the front/rear direction (width direction) is calculated and outputted by the image analyzer 208. Namely, the light emitted from the certain LED element is received by a certain pixel of the CCD 204. Then, a shift amount between the certain pixel receiving the light and a predetermined pixel in the front/rear direction is outputted. Depending on the shift amount, the micrometer heads 206 are operated manually or by feedback control, to thereby adjust the position of the casing 110 in the front/rear direction. In such a manner, the positional relationship is adjusted for the light-emitting sections of the LED array 132 provided on the casing 110 and the reference holes 122, 123 of the plate member 120. After the adjustment is completed, the first adhesive 151 is cured by a UV light irradiated from a UV radiation device 209.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">By curing the first adhesive 151, the casing 110 and the plate member 120 are<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> positioned (positionally adjusted) and fixed to each other. Further, for firmly fixing the casing 110 and the plate member 120, and for preventing any dirt, dust, etc. from entering into the casing 110, the second adhesive 152 is coated on the casing 110 and the plate member 120 at the entire circumference of a portion of the casing 110 and at the entire circumference of a portion of the plate member 120, the portions facing with each other, in such a manner that the second adhesive 152 is infiltrated (permeated) in a gap between the casing 110 and the plate member 120, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 6D</figref>. Specifically, in a case that the second adhesive 152 is a liquid adhesive (having a low viscosity), the second adhesive 152 may be injected or poured directly toward the gap between the casing 110 and the plate member 120. Alternatively, the second adhesive 152 may be poured into the gap between the casing 110 and the plate member 120 by using a spatula, etc. Then, the UV light is irradiated again from the UV radiation device 209 to thereby cure the second adhesive 152. Here, it is preferable to use, as the second adhesive 152, an adhesive having an elastic coefficient after curing which is smaller than that of the first adhesive 151. In this case, even if the first adhesive 152 is shrank or contracted when being cured, the force generated by the shrinkage of the second adhesive 152 and affecting to warp (change, compromise) the positional relationship between the casing 110 and the plate member 120 is weaker than the fixing force of the first adhesive 151. For this reason, the positional relationship between the casing 110 and the plate member 120 fixed by the first adhesive 151 is not disarranged or deteriorated.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">With respect to the LED exposure device 100 which is assembled in such a manner, the positioning pins 41C of the head supporting member 41 are fitted to the references holes 122, 123 respectively as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, and is subjected to focus adjustment by the adjustment of the eccentric cams 43. Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, each of the LED exposure devices 100 is attached to the upper cover 12 via one of the LED-attachment members 14.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">In such a manner, the LED exposure device 100 is accurately positioned, with respect to the head supporting member 41, by the reference holes 122, 123. Further, for example, by mechanically engaging the head supporting member 41 to the body frame 15, the LED exposure device 100 is positioned (positionally-adjusted) with respect to the photoconductive drum 53 at the same time when the upper cover 12 is closed. As described above, the positional relationship between the LED exposure<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> device 100 and the photoconductive drum 53 is fixed accurately. Thus, it is possible to form a satisfactory image in the color printer 1.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">As explained above, according to the LED exposure device 100 used in the color printer 1 of the present exemplary embodiment, the following effects can be obtained. Namely, in the LED exposure device 100, the plate member 120 which has an elongated shape and which is provided with the reference holes 122, 123 for positioning, is firmly fixed in a state that the plate member 120 is positioned, with respect to the light-emitting sections of the LED array 130, in the width direction and longitudinal direction of the plate member 120 which are orthogonal to the optical axis of the light emitted from the light-emitting sections of the LED array 130. Therefore, even when a construction is adopted in which the LED exposure devices 100 are successively assembled into (with respect to) the head supporting members 14, etc., it is possible to obtain accurate positional relationship between the photoconductive drums 53 and the LED exposure devices 100.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Further, since the casing 110 is made of resin, it is possible to make the thickness of the casing 110 to be thin, thereby making it possible to realize a small-sized color printer 1. Furthermore, since the plate member 120 is adhered to the casing 110 to form an integrated body such that the plate member 120 closes the casing 110, it is possible to obtain sufficient rigidity while realizing a small-sized LED exposure device 100.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Since the plate member 120 is made of metal, it is possible to obtain sufficient rigidity for the LED exposure device 100, while shielding electromagnetic wave generated from the LED circuit board 130 to thereby suppress the influence due to the electromagnetic wave to other device or component in the color printer 1.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Moreover, since the plate member 120 has a size in the width direction thereof greater than that of the casing 110, it is possible to securely obtain adjustment margin for the plate member 120 with respect to the casing 110 in the width direction of the plate member 120, thereby making it possible to secure the fixing force between the plate member 120 and the casing 110 after the positional adjustment.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">Since the plate member 120 is provided with the wiring hole 125 through which the harness for supplying signal to the LED circuit board 130 is passed, the harness can be wired without lowering the rigidity of the plate member 120.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">The casing 110 and the plate member 120 are adhered to each other with the<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> adhesive 150, and the adhesive 150 is coated on the entire circumference of the portion of the casing 110 and is coated on the entire circumference of the portion of the plate member 120, the portions facing each other (are opposite to each other). Accordingly, the casing 110 and the plate member 120 are fixed firmly, thereby making it possible to obtain the rigidity for the LED exposure device 100 and to prevent any dirt, dust, etc. from entering into the casing 110 as well. Further, since the photo-curable resin is used as the adhesive 150, it is possible to quickly perform the fixing after the positioning (positional adjustment), improving the positioning precision and the production efficiency.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">According to the method for assembling the LED exposure device 100 explained in the exemplary embodiment, the first adhesive 151 is coated on the plurality of projections 114, which project from the casing 110 toward the plate member 120, and the first adhesive 151 is cured in a state that the positions of the reference holes 122, 123 are adjusted (subjected to the positional adjustment) with respect to the light-emitting sections. Then, the casing 110 and the plate member 120 are adhered to each other, at the portion of the casing 110 and the portion of the plate member 120 which face each other and which are different from the projections 114, with the second adhesive 152 having the elastic coefficient after curing which is smaller than that of the first adhesive 151. Therefore, it is possible to fix the position of the plate member 120 with respect to the casing 110 with the first adhesive 151. Thereafter, even when the second adhesive 152 is shrank when the second adhesive 152 is cured, the force generated to the shrinkage of the second adhesive 152 and compromising or changing the positional relationship between the casing 110 and the plate member 120, is small as compared with the fixing force by the first adhesive 151. Therefore, the positional relationship between the casing 110 and the plate member 120 fixed by the first adhesive 151 is not compromised or changed.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">As described above, the first exemplary embodiment has been explained. However, the apparatus is not limited to the above-described embodiment. With respect to the specific construction or arrangement, it is possible to appropriately make changes. For example, in the first embodiment, the positional relationship in the longitudinal direction of the casing 110 and the plate member 120 is determined by bringing the casing 110 into contact with the side wall 202 of the positioning jig 100 and by<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> supporting the plate member 120 with the support tools 207. However, it is allowable to adjust the position in the longitudinal direction of the casing 110 with respect to the plate member 120 in a similar manner as that regarding the width direction, namely by using the positional measurement result by the CCD 204 and by moving the position in the longitudinal direction of the casing 110 with respect to the plate member 120 manually or by feedback control.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">Further, the LED array 132 has a manufacturing warpage in some cases in which a row of the light-emitting sections are arched or embowed as seen from the optical axis direction. In such a case, however, it is also possible to cure the adhesive 150 in a state that such warpage is rectified by applying force to the casing 110.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">In the first exemplary embodiment, although the projections 114 are provided on the casing 110, the projections 114 may be provided on the plate member 120. Further, the first adhesive 151 may be coated on the plate member 120 at portions corresponding to the projections 114, instead of being coated on the projections 114. Further, although the reference holes 122, 123 are used as examples of the reference portion, the shape of the reference portion is not specifically limited provided that the positional adjustment (positioning) can be performed with respect other part or component.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Moreover, although the plate member 120 is used as an example of the frame member, it is not necessarily indispensable that the frame member has a plate-shape.

In consideration of this, the corner portion of the cover 400 made of resin is formed to have a shape which is rounder than the corner portion of the lens array 341 made of glass because when the cover 400 is formed by injection molding, the shape of the die (mould) having a rounded corner portion is transferred to the corner portion of the cover 400.
