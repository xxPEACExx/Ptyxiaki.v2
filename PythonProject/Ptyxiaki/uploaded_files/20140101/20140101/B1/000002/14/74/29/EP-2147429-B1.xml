An application program may query a personality resource file for a prompt corresponding to a personality. Then the prompt may be received at a speech synthesis engine. Next, the speech<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> synthesis engine may query a personality voice font database for a voice font corresponding to the personality. Then the speech synthesis engine may apply the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> voice font to the prompt. The voice font applied prompt may then be produced at an output device.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description provide examples and are explanatory only. Accordingly, the foregoing general description and the following detailed description should not be considered to be restrictive. Further, features or variations may be provided in addition to those set forth herein.

Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the following description to refer to the same or similar elements. While embodiments of the invention may be described, modifications, adaptations, and other implementations are possible. For example, substitutions, additions, or modifications may be made to the elements illustrated in the drawings, and the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> methods described herein may be modified by substituting, reordering, or adding stages to the disclosed methods. Accordingly, the following detailed description does not limit the invention. Instead, the proper scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Embodiments of the invention may increase a device's (e.g. a mobile device or embedded device) appeal through personality theme incorporation. The personality may be an individual's personality and may be a celebrity figure's personality. To provide this personality theme, embodiments of the invention may use synthesized speech, music, and visual elements. Moreover, embodiments of the invention may provide a device that portrays a single personality or even multiple personalities.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Consistent with embodiments of the invention, speech synthesis may portray a target individual (e.g. the personality) through using a "voice font" generated, for example, from recordings made by the target individual or individuals. This voice font may allow the device to sound like a specific individual when the device "speaks." In other words, the voice font may allow the device to produce a customized voice. In addition to the customized voice, message prompts may be customized to reflect the target individual's grammatical style. In addition, the synthesized speech may also be augmented by recorded phrases or messages from the target individual.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Furthermore, music may be used by the device to portray the target individual. In the case where the target individual is a musical artist, for example, songs by the target individual may be used for ring tones, notifications, etc., for example. Songs by the target individual may also be included with the personality theme for devices with media capabilities. Devices portraying actors as the target<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> individual could use theme music from movies or television shows where the actor appeared.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Visual elements within the personality theme may include, for example, target individual images, objects associated with the target individual, and color themes that end-users might identify with the target individual or with the target individual's work. An example may be the image of a football for a "Shawn Alexander phone." The visual elements could appear in the background on the mobile device's screen, in window borders, on some icons, or event printed on the phone exterior (possibly on a removable faceplate).</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Accordingly, embodiments of the invention may customize a personality theme for a device around one or more personalities, possibly a celebrity (the "personality skin") to provide a "personality skin package" used to deliver the personality theme. For example, embodiments of the invention may grammatically alter standard prompts to match the target individual's speaking style. Moreover, embodiments of the invention may include a "personality skin manager" that may allow users to switch between personality skins, remove personality skin packages, or download new personality skin packages, for example.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A "personality skin" may comprise, for example: i) a customized voice font generated from recordings from the target individual; ii) speech prompts customized to match a speaking style of the target individual; iii) personality-specific audio clips or files; and iv) personality-specific images or other visual elements. Where these elements (or others) are delivered together in a single package, they may be referred to as a personality skin package.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> shows a personality-based theme system 100. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, system 100 may include a first application program 105, a second application program 110, a third application program 115, a first personality resource file 120, a first default resource file 125, a second personality resource file 130, and a third default resource file 135. In addition, system 100 may include a speech synthesis engine 140, a personality voice font database 150, a default voice font database 155, and an output device 160. Any of first application program 105, second application program 110, or third application program 115 may comprise, but not limited to, any of electronic mail and contacts applications, word processing applications, spreadsheet applications, database applications, slide presentation applications, drawing or computer-aided application programs, etc. Output device 160 may, for example, comprise any of output devices 414 as described in more detail below with respect to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>. As described in greater detail below with respect to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, system 100 may be implemented using system 400. Furthermore, as described in greater detail below, system 100 may be used to implement one or more of method 300's stages as described in greater detail below with respect to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In addition, system 100 may comprise or otherwise be implemented in a mobile device. The mobile device 105 may comprise, but is not limited to, a mobile telephone, a cellular telephone, a wireless telephone, a wireless device, a hand-held personal computer, a hand-held computing device, a multi-processor system, a micro-processor-based or programmable consumer electronic device, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a telephone, a pager, or any other device configured to receive, process, and transmit information. For example, the mobile device may comprise an electronic device configured to communicate wirelessly<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> and be small enough for a user to carry the electronic device easily. In other words, the mobile device may be smaller than a notebook computer and may comprise a mobile telephone or PDA, for example.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> shows a personality-based theme management system 200. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, system 200 may include, but not limited to first application program 105, second application program 110, a personality manager 205, an interface 210, and a registry 215. As described in greater detail below with respect to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, system 200 may be implemented using system 400. The operation of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> will be described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart setting forth the general stages involved in a method 300 consistent with an embodiment of the invention for providing a personality-based theme. Method 300 may be implemented using a computing device 400 as described in more detail below with respect to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>. Ways to implement the stages of method 300 will be described in greater detail below. Method 300 may begin at starting block 305 and proceed to stage 310 where computing device 400 may query (e.g. by first application program 105 in response to a user initiated input,) first personality resource file 120 for a prompt corresponding to a personality. For example, first application program 105 prompts may be stored in first personality resource file 120. Each speech application (e.g. first application program 105, second application program 110, third application program 115, etc.) may provide a personality-specific resource file for each personality skin. If a speech application chooses not to provide a personality-specific resource file for a given personality, a default resource file (e.g. first default resource file 125, third default resource file 135) may be used. The personality-specific resource files may be provided with each personality skin<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> package. When installed, the personality skin package may install the new resource file for each application.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">From stage 310, where computing device 400 queries first personality resource file 120, method 300 may advance to stage 320 where computing device 400 may receive the prompt at speech synthesis engine 140. For example, first application program 105, second application program 110, or third application program 115 may provide the prompt to speech synthesis engine 140 through speech service 145.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Once computing device 400 receives the prompt at speech synthesis engine 140 in stage 320, method 300 may continue to stage 330 where computing device 400 (e.g. speech synthesis engine 140) may query personality voice font database 150 for a voice font corresponding to the personality. For example the voice font may be created based on recordings of the personality's voice. In addition, the voice font may be configured to make the prompt sound like the personality when produced. In order to implement the customized voice feature of a personality skin, speech synthesis (or text-to-speech) engine 140 may be used. A voice font may be created for the target individual by processing a series of recordings made by that target individual. Once the font has been created it may be used by synthesis engine 140 to produce speech that sounds like the desired target individual.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">After computing device 400 queries personality voice font database 150 in stage 330, method 300 may proceed to stage 340 where computing device 400 (e.g. speech synthesis engine 140) may apply the voice font to the prompt. For example, applying the voice font to the prompt may further comprise augmenting the voice font applied prompt with recorded phrases of the personality<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> (e.g. target individual). In addition, the prompt may be altered to conform with a grammatical style of the personality (e.g. target individual).</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">While synthesized speech may sound acoustically like the target individual, the words used by system 100 for dialogs or notifications, may not accurately reflect the speaking style of target individual. In order to more closely match the speaking style of the target individual, applications (e.g. first application program 105, second application program 110, third application program 115, etc.) may also choose to alter the specific messages (e.g. prompts) to be spoken, such that they use the words and prosody characteristics the device user may expect the target individual to use. These alterations may be made by changing the phrases to be spoken (including prosody tags). Each speech application may need to make these alterations for their respective spoken prompts.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Once computing device 400 applies the voice font to the prompt in stage 340, method 300 may proceed to stage 350 where computing device 400 may produce the voice font applied prompt at output device 160. For example, output device 160 may be disposed within a mobile device. Output device 160 may, for example, comprise any of output devices 414 as described in more detail below with respect to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>. Once computing device 400 produces the voice font applied prompt at output device 160 in stage 350, method 300 may then end at stage 360:</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A system that may support personality skin packages may include a "personality skin manager." As stated above, <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> shows a personality-based theme management system 200. Personality-based theme management system 200 may provide interface 210 that may allow users, for example, to switch<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> between personality skins, to remove installed personality skin packages, and to purchase and download new personality skin packages.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">First application 105 and second application 110 may load the appropriate resource file depending on the current voice font. The current voice font may be made available to first application 105 or second application 110 at runtime through a registry key. Additionally, personality manager 205 may notify first application 105 or second application 110 when the current skin (and thereby the current voice font) is updated. Upon receiving this notification, first application 105 or second application 110 may reload their resources as appropriate.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In addition to the customization of prompts, application designers may wish to customize speech recognition (SR) grammars, so the end user can issue voice commands in the speaking style of the target individual, or to address the device by the name of the individual. Such grammar updates may be stored and delivered in resource files in a manner similar to the customized prompts described above. These grammar updates may be particularly important in the multiple-personality scenario described below.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Besides managing the speech components of the personality skin package (voice font, prompts, and possibly grammars), personality manager 205 may also manage the visual and audio components of the personality skin such that when a user switched to a different personality skin, the look and sound of the device may update along with its voice. Some possible actions could include, but are not limited to, updating the background image on the device and setting a default ring tone.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Consistent with embodiments of the invention, the personality concept can also be extended such that a single device could portray multiple<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> personalities. Consequently, supporting multiple personalities at one time may require additional RAM, ROM, or processor resources. Multiple personalities may extend the concept of a personality-based device in a number of ways. As described above, multiple personality skins may be stored on a device and may be selected at runtime by the end user or changed automatically by personality manager 205 based on a generated or user-defined schedule. In this scenario, only additional ROM may be required to store the inactive voice font databases and application resources. This approach may also be used to allow the device to change moods as a particular mood for an individual could be portrayed through a mood-specific personality skin. Applying moods to the device personality could make the device more entertaining and could also be used to convey information to the end user (for example, the personality skin manager could switch to a "sleepy" mood when the device battery becomes low).</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Consistent with multiple personality embodiments of the invention, more than one personality may be active at a time. For example, each personality may be associated with a feature or set of features on the device. Then the end user may interact with a feature (e.g. e-mail) or a set of features (e.g. communications) by interacting with the associated personality. This approach may also help to restrain grammars if the user addresses the device by the name of the personality associated with the functionality he or she wants to interact with (e.g. "Shawn, what's my battery level?", "Geena, what's my next appointment?") Furthermore, when the user gets notifications from the device, the voice used may indicate to the user to which functional area the message belongs. For example, the user may be able to tell that a notification is related to e-mail because he or she recognizes the voice as belonging to the personality associated with e-mail<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> notifications. The system architecture may changes slightly in this situation, because applications may specify the voice to be used for the device's notifications. Personality manager 205 may assign the voice that each application may use and the application may need to speak using the appropriate engine instance.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">An example may comprise a system for providing personality-based theme. The system may comprise a memory storage and a processing unit coupled to the memory storage. The processing unit may be operative to query, by an application program, a personality resource file for a prompt corresponding to a personality and to receive the prompt at a speech synthesis engine. In addition, the processing unit may be operative to query, by the speech synthesis engine, a personality voice font database for a voice font corresponding to the personality. Moreover, the processing unit may be operative to apply, by the speech synthesis engine, the voice font to the prompt and to produce the voice font applied prompt at an output device.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Another example may comprise a system for providing personality-based theme.
