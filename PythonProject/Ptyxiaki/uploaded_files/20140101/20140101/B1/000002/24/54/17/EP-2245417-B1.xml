The term "panel" encompasses the terms "air foils","plates", "fins", "wings" and other surfaces when used in the relevant context. Hereinafter the term "object" or "body" in the following text refers to devices to which panels are coupled.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Panels can vary in size and shape as well as having various spatial configurations, not necessarily flat in shape. Examples for the use of such elements are solar-panels for satellites, various types of broadcasting and reception antennas and the elevation and stabilization devices used in wings of space ships, rockets and projectiles of various kinds.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Panels are so designed as to bestow a relative large footprint to the objects they are part of. The larger the area and span of wings of aircrafts and rockets, the greater are their maneuverability and gliding abilities. The advantages of large footprint-feature in flight may cause disadvantages and difficulties in storing, transporting and deploying of panel-equipped objects.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Folding and deploying panels in two different axes are known and four relevant patents are listed below:</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4664339A"><text>US 4,664,339 (Crossfield</text></patcit>) disclosed a missile appendage deployment mechanism for receipt on the side of a missile or projectile and in a stowed position.

The airfoil is attached to a yoke by a pivot pin. The yoke shaft is pivoted in the body in a manner to allow it to pivot 90 degrees tangentially with respect to the body. The airfoil assembly may be retained by a cover which is removable to deploy the airfoil. The shaft of the yoke is mounted at a small angle to the axis of the body so that the airfoil has an angle of attack relative to the airstream when it pivots tangentially outward. When the cover is removed, a spring starts the airfoil rotating out into the airstream where drag drives it to the 90 degree position. The yoke is locked in the 90 degree position by a yoke lock pin. The airfoil, which is rigidly attached by pins to the pivot pin, cannot begin to rotate about the pivot pin until the yoke has rotated 90 degrees. A flat on the head of the pivot pin rides on the surface of the body preventing rotation in a vertical direction until the 90 degrees of tangential rotation has been completed. Aerodynamic lift acting on the airfoil then rotates it upward to a position about normal to the body axis where it is locked by an airfoil lock pin.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5326049A"><text>US 5,326,049 (Rom et al.</text></patcit>) described a wing, normally folded in an inoperative position and to be unfolded to an operative position when the body is accelerated in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the body.

The folding of the panel is done by two consecutive turns that bring the panel to a "wrapping" posture along side the object to which it is coupled, where the broad surface of the panel is substantially tangential to the external surface of the object body (i.e., a "folded position"). Correspondingly, the deployment of the panel is done by implementing the above two consecutive turns in reverse, bringing the panel to a posture erect with respect to the object panel (i.e., a "deployed position"). An explanation of the deployment and folding of panels in accordance with the present invention follows:</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">From a folded state an electronic command-signal, a pyrotechnical-mechanism or some other triggering mechanism commences the deployment of a panel device in accordance with the present invention. The triggering command releases a locking mechanism. From the folded position, the released panel undergoes a first turning about a first turning axis substantially parallel to the surface of the object body, so as to be positioned perpendicularly to the object body in a "first erect posture". The panel is then displaced along the first turning axis to be positioned in a "second erect posture". A first pivot constrains the motion of the panel to the first turning, except for when the panel is displaced into the second erect posture. Next, by "stored energy" originating from either a spring, a hydraulic-piston or a pneumatic mechanism connected to a pressured gas source or a gas-generator, the panel undergoes a second turning about a second turning axis that is substantially 90 degrees in perpendicular to the first turning axis, and the panel is inserted into a stabilizing slot between two protective plates,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> where it is now in the deployed position. A second pivot constrains the motion of the panel to the second turning, except for when the panel is in the first erect posture. The panel can now be locked in place in either a permanent locking arrangement or a locking arrangement that permits the refolding of the panel.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">By way of example detailed elaboration of a embodiment of the present invention is given hereinafter, where the panels are wings of a projectile or other flying object.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Wings serve as aerodynamic surfaces providing lift to a flying object. To be effective wings typically span a substantial distance from the body of projectile thus bestowing a large footprint. The footprint dictates large packaging, storage and maintenance volumes. Foldable wings were introduced, and can be seen, for example on aircraft parked on aircraft carrier decks. The need for parking room is met by reducing the wing span of parked aircraft on board aircraft carriers. But when a substantial portion of the wing folded to an up-right position, the space freed on the sides of the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> aircraft is replaced with occupied space over the aircraft, a space which on the upper deck of an aircraft carrier is abundant. If a winged object is to be stored in on a confined space the wing span may pose a true problem.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">As the length of a wing is usually greater than its width, folding it across results in either shortening the wing by as much as half (in the case of about 180 degrees fold), or having the wind protrude upwards (in the case of about 90 degrees fold).</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The present invention introduces a wing of a projectile which can be folded in a twin-action sequence. A first action brings the elongated aspect of the wing to a substantially parallel position along the adjacent body to which it is attached, to a side-by-side configuration with the body, and a second action in which the now side-by-side wing is turned about an axis parallel to the adjacent body, bringing the broad surface of the wing to a tangential stored position with respect to the body external surface.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">By doing so the footprint of the wing is greatly reduced, allowing for minimal space storage.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">When deploying the wing from the stored position the above sequence of actions is performed in reverse order, bringing the wing to the deployed position.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a wing is disclosed that can be easily and swiftly deployed from the folded state and remain fixed in the deployed position.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">By "projectile" is meant, for the purpose of the present invention and throughout this specification (unless specifically stated otherwise) any object that is ejected, thrown, tossed, propelled, shot, dropped, flown or otherwise dispatched to make its way in air, be it aerodynamically, free falling or any other way of travel in air.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In some embodiments of the present invention the body with the folded wing is stored in a container which holds the folded wing to the body of the object.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In some embodiments of the present invention the folded wing is fastened to the body of the object by a fastener and a controlled release mechanism removes the fastener to allow immediate deployment of the wing.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Reference is now made to the figures:</p><p id="p0055" num="0055"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is an illustration of a foldable deployable wing 12 in accordance an embodiment of the present invention with the wing locked in a deployed position by a flexible snap-lock mechanism 14 in a substantially vertical, perpendicular deployed<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> position, relative to the outer surface of projectile 16.. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1</figref> should be viewed in conjunction with <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5</figref> which illustrates a lateral cross-section illustration across the wing folding and deploying device in accordance an embodiment of the present invention with wing 12 in a deployed position.

Support plates 20, 22, serve as reinforcement members while snap-lock 14 and spring 28, elastically hold the wing down. Spring 28 rests on stand 26 which is a plate located in between support plates 20 and is secured at one end to pin 30 that runs substantially parallel to the plates, and at the other end to anchoring point 32 which is connected to wing 12. A pin 29 is connected to the end of spring 28, and is coupled to anchoring point 32.
