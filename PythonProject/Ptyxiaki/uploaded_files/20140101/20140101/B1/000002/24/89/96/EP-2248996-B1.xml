id="p0003" num="0003">Gas turbines have combustion chambers wherein a fuel is combusted to generate a hot gas flow to be expanded in one or more expansion stages of a turbine.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Each expansion stage consists of a stator airfoil row and a rotor airfoil row. During operation the hot gas generated in the combustion chamber passes through the stator airfoil row to be accelerated and turned, and afterwards it passes through the rotor airfoil row to deliver mechanical power to the rotor.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For reasons of assembly, between the inner and outer wall of the combustion chamber and the inner and outer wall of the stator airfoil row a gap is provided; through these gaps cooling air for cooling the combustion chamber and the stator airfoil row inner and outer walls is ejected into the hot gases path.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In addition, also between the stator and the rotor airfoil row inner and outer walls a gap is provided; also through these gaps cooling air is fed.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As the stator airfoils extend in the paths of the hot gas, they constitute a blockage for the hot gas flow.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Thus stator airfoils generate regions of high static pressure in the stagnation regions upstream of their leading edges and regions of lower static pressure in the regions in-between.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The result is a non uniform circumferential static<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> pressure distribution upstream of the stator airfoil row (called bow-wave) which varies in a roughly sinusoidal manner.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">This pressure distribution could cause hot gas entering into the gaps; this must be avoided because it would cause overheating of structural parts adjacent to the gaps.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Traditionally this problem is addressed supplying additional air (purge air) fed through the gaps at high pressure (i.e. pressure greater than the sinusoidal pressure peaks).</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As a consequence, the total amount of cold air (cooling air + purge air) fed through the gaps is much greater than that necessary for cooling of the parts making up the hot gas flow channel.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Such an excessive cold air is undesirable, because it causes the overall power and efficiency of the gas turbine to be reduced.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In order to reduce the amount of purge air fed, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5466123A"><text>US5466123</text></patcit> discloses a gas turbine having a stator and a rotor with gaps between their inner and outer walls.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The inner stator wall has an upstream zone (the zone upstream of the stator airfoils) that is axisymmetric, and a downstream zone (the zone in the guide vane flow channels defined by two adjacent stator airfoils) that is non-axisymmetric.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">This configuration of the inner stator wall lets the non-uniformities (i.e. the peaks) of the hot gases pressure in a zone downstream of the stator airfoils be counteracted, but it has no influence on the hot gases pressure upstream of the stator airfoils.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2009019282A"><text>W02009/019282</text></patcit> discloses a gas turbine having a combustion chamber followed by a stator (and a rotor) airfoil row.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Between the inner and/or outer wall of the combustion chamber and stator airfoil row a gap is provided through which cold air is fed.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The borders of the gaps of the stator and/or combustion chamber inner and/or outer walls have radial steps that cooperate to influence the pressure distribution in the gaps.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2008120748A"><text>WO2008/120748</text></patcit> discloses a gas turbine with radial depressions at the upstream border of the platform of a blade row.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">The technical aim of the present invention is therefore to provide a gas turbine by which the said problems of the known art are eliminated.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Within the scope of this technical aim, an object of the invention is to provide a gas turbine with which the cold air fed into the hot gas path can be reduced when compared to traditional gas turbines.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A further object of the invention is to provide a gas turbine that lets the efficiency be increased and overheating of the rotor disc and static structure adjacent to it be limited.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The technical aim, together with these and further objects, are attained according to the invention by providing a gas turbine in accordance with the accompanying claims.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Advantageously, the gas turbine according to the invention lets the power output be increased with respect to traditional gas turbine.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0026" num="0026">Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will be more apparent from the description of a preferred but non-exclusive embodiment of the gas turbine according to the invention, illustrated by way of nonlimiting example in the accompanying drawings, in which:<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> -->

for sake of simplicity in the following the hot section of the gas turbine is referred to as the gas turbine.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The gas turbine 1 comprises an annular combustion chamber 2 defined by an inner wall 3 and an outer wall 4.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Downstream of the combustion chamber 2 one or more expansion stages 5, 6 are provided to expand the hot gas coming from the combustion chamber 2.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Each expansion stage 5, 6 is defined by a stator airfoil row 7 defined by an annular inner stator wall 8 and an annular outer stator wall 9 housing a plurality of stator airfoils 10.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Downstream of each stator airfoil row 7 a rotor airfoil row 11 is provided; the rotor airfoil row 11 is defined by an annular inner rotor wall 12 and an annular<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> outer rotor wall 13 housing a plurality of rotor airfoils 14.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The walls 3, 4 of the combustion chamber 2 are adjacent to the walls 8, 9 of a first airfoil row 7, but an inner and an outer gap 15, 16 are provided between them.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Through these gaps 15, 16 cold air is supplied (in this context the temperature of the cold air is defined as much colder than the temperature of the hot gas).</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In addition, gaps 17, 18 are also provided between the inner stator and rotor walls 8, 12, and between the outer stator and rotor walls 9, 13.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Also through these gaps 17, 18 cold air is supplied.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The expansion stage 6 downstream of the expansion stage 5 has the same configuration of the expansion stage 5, thus an inner and an outer gap 19, 20 are provided between the rotor inner and outer walls 12, 13 of the stage 5 and the stator inner and outer walls of the stage 6.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Possible further expansion stages have the same configuration.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Naturally different combinations are possible such that one or more of the described gaps may not be present.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In the following the invention will be described with particular reference to the expansion stage 5 immediately downstream of the combustion chamber 2 and the inner stator wall 8; it is anyhow clear that the same considerations apply for the outer stator wall 9 of the expansion stage 5, and for the inner and/or outer stator walls of each stage downstream of a rotor airfoil row (such as for example the stator inner and/or outer walls of the expansion stage 6 downstream of the rotor airfoil row 11).</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">A border 25 of the inner stator wall 8 facing the gap 15 is axisymmetric and preferably circular in shape; it is preferably aligned with the inner wall 3 of the combustion chamber 2 to guide the hot gases flow limiting the pressure<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> drops.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Moreover, the zone of the inner stator wall 8 downstream of the gap 15 and upstream of the stator airfoils 10 is non-axisymmetric and provides bumps 26, circumferentially located in the regions where the static pressure of the hot gas flow is lowest; the bumps 26 are arranged to locally increase the static pressure of the hot gas flow passing close to them.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In fact, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 4</figref>, the near-endwall hot gas flow is guided such that the flow upstream of the bumps is decelerated and its pressure locally increased.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">This lets the circumferential pressure distribution of the hot gas flow upstream of the stator airfoil row be more uniform, because in the regions having higher pressure the pressure remains substantially unchanged, but in the regions having lower pressure it is increased.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Moreover, also the static pressure inside of the gaps is influenced and, in particular, it is increased.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In this respect, <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 5</figref> (referring to a gas turbine according to the prior art) shows the circumferential static pressure distribution outside (curve A) and inside (curve B) of the gap 15.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In the same way, <figref idrefs="f0005">figure 6</figref> (referring to a gas turbine according to the invention) shows the circumferential static pressure distribution outside (curve A) and inside (curve B) of the gap 15(see also <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>).</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">From <figref idrefs="f0004">figures 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">6</figref> it can be recognised that the differential static pressure between the inside and outside of the gap is reduced, i.e. the peak of differential pressure between curves A and B in the gas turbine of the invention is lower than that between curves A and B of the prior art.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">This negative pressure gradient pointing into the gap causes the hot gas entering the gap.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The configuration according to the invention decreases the pressure gradient and therefore minimises the amount of hot gas entering the gap 15.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The amount of cold air fed through the gap 15 can thus be reduced with respect to traditional gas turbines.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In particular, each bump 26 faces a guide vane flow channel 27 defined between two adjacent stator airfoils 10.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Moreover, each bump 26 is closer to the suction side 28 than to the pressure side 29 of the two adjacent stator airfoils 1, where a minimum region of circumferential pressure distribution is located.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The bumps 26 extend into the guide vane flow channels 27, where they can fade to a common axisymmetric or non-axisymmetric shape of the inner stator wall 8. This downstream part of the bumps has no impact on the flow in the gap region and can therefore be chosen individually (<figref idrefs="f0003">figure 4</figref>, dashed line).</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">As shown in the figures, each bump 26 surrounds a front portion of a stator airfoils 10.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The bumps 26 define an inner circumferentially sinusoidal stator wall 8 facing the gap 15.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The operation of the gas turbine of the invention is apparent from that described and illustrated and is substantially the following.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The stator airfoils 10 (defining a blockage for the hot gases flow) cause the static pressure of the hot gases flow to be locally increased upstream of the stator airfoils 10 with a substantially circumferential sinusoidal distribution.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The hot gas flow coming from the combustion chamber 2 passes close to the bumps 26 and locally increases its static pressure in the region upstream of the stator blade row 7, and enters the guide vane flow channels 27 defined between the stator airfoils 10.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The pressure increase caused by the bumps 26 occurs in the regions of low pressure upstream of the stator blade row 7, such that the circumferential pressure distribution upstream of the stator airfoils 10 is more uniform; in addition the pressure difference between the inner and the outer of the gap is reduced.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">This lets the risk of hot gas ingestion be reduced, with no need of a high flow rate of cold air (cooling + purge air).</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">The gas turbine conceived in this manner is susceptible to numerous modifications and variants, all falling within the scope of the inventive concept; moreover all details can be replaced by technically equivalent elements. In practice the materials used and the dimensions can be chosen at will according to requirements and to the state of the art.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><heading id="h0006">REFERENCE
