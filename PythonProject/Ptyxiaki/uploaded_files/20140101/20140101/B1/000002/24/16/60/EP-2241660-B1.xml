Patent Citation 1 discloses two separately movable gripper units, one of which is provided with a scissor-like cutter and is driven by turning of a drive shaft which works as a track in guiding the movement. A cam mechanism is formed between the both gripper units, for driving the cutter. The cam mechanism is actuated along the direction along which the track shaft extends. The knitting yarn is cut with the cutter when it is in the state of being gripped by each of the two grippers. An edge yarn resulting from the cutting of the knitting yarn can be treated in the same manner as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0014">Fig. 20</figref> of Patent Citation 1.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Another edge yarn cutting and gripping device is also disclosed<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> which is structured so that the scissor-like cutter is driven together with the gripper by the turning of the drive shaft to guide the gripper unit (See Patent Citation 2, for example). The device disclosed by Patent Citation 2 is structured so that when the drive shaft is shifted angularly in one direction and returned from the reference angle, the gripper can be moved down into a needle bed gap to catch and grip the knitting yarn extending from the knitted fabric to the yarn feeder at some midpoint in it. In the middle of the downward movement of the griper into the needle bed gap, the scissor-like cutter is opened and is held in its opened state even after the gripper is moved up, so that the knitting yarn is pulled up in the opened cutter. When the drive shaft is shifted angularly in the opposite direction and returned from the reference angle, only the cutter is closed, so that the knitting yarn gripped by the gripper is cut with the cutter on the side near the knitted fabric.

However, each of the knitting yarn cut<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> and grip devices merely has the function of cutting the knitting yarn and gripping it on the yarn feeder side until the next set up. After the cutting, the edge yarn on the knitted fabric side is released from the gripper, so that the treatment as is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0014">Fig. 20</figref> of Patent Citation 1 cannot be done. Also, although the knitting yarn is caught and gripped in the state of being able to be cut with the cutter in the way that the drive shaft is shifted angularly in one direction and returned from the reference angle to move the grippers up and down, the drive shaft must be shifted angularly in the opposite direction from the reference angle, for cutting the knitting yarn with the cutter. This means that two steps of the one reciprocating motion of the drive shaft in one direction from the reference angle and another reciprocating motion of the same in the opposite direction therefrom are necessary for the turning of the drive shaft to drive the gripper and the cutter so as to grip and cut the knitting yarn, where the reciprocating angular displacement of the drive shaft is taken as a single step.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The edge yarn treatment of Patent Citation 1 requires that the cam mechanism be driven along the direction along which the drive shaft extends, in order to actuate the cutter. Thus, this edge yarn treatment requires two steps of driving the gripper by the turning of the drive shaft and driving the cam mechanism along the drive shaft, thus involving complicated control and long operating time. In addition, when the cam mechanism is driven along the drive shaft to actuate the cutter, the gripper units must be stably held with respect to the drive shaft. For stability of the fixed position of the gripper units, the gripper units are required to have a somewhat increased resistance to slippage when moved along the drive shaft. As the resistance<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> to slippage increases, the gripper units decrease in movement speed when being moved along the drive shaft and resultantly a motor as a driving source for the movement is also increased in size.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to provide an edge yarn treatment device for a flatbed knitting machine which is capable of driving two grippers and a cutter to grip and cut a knitting yarn in a single operation of turning of the drive shaft.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>Technical Solution</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention provides an edge yarn treatment device for a flatbed knitting machine, which provided with:
<ul><li>a pair of units, each having grippers which are separately movable over a needle bed gap of the flatbed knitting machine and are advanced to or retracted from the needle bed gap to catch and grip a knitting yarn, and</li><li>a pair of drive shafts extended over the needle bed gap, the drive shafts being able to respectively drive the units in a manner so as to move the grippers toward or away from the needle bed gap by turning of the drive shafts,</li><li>one of the units being provided with a scissor-like cutter capable of cutting the knitting yarn gripped between both of the grippers,</li><li>the edge yarn treatment device further comprising a switching mechanism which is driven by one of the drive shafts in such an associated relationship that when the grippers of the unit driven by the drive shaft are on the way of moving toward the needle bed gap, the cutter can be opened, while on the other hand, when they are on the way of moving away<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> therefrom, the cutter can be closed, so as to switch opening or closing movement of the cutter.</li></ul></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the present invention, said switching mechanism comprises:
<ul><li>a driving member mounted on said one drive shaft and having two abutment lugs projecting at spaced points, and</li><li>a switching member which is mounted on said unit mounting the cutter thereon and is disposed in such a position that when the drive shaft mounting the driving member thereon is turned, the switching member can be alternately abutted with two abutment lugs to selectively open or close the cutter by abutment with one or the other of the abutment lugs.</li></ul></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the present invention, said driving member is mounted on a different unit from said unit mounting the cutter thereon and is driven in a combined manner by the drive shaft for driving the grippers in that unit.</p><heading id="h0006"><b>Advantageous Effects</b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to the present invention, a pair of units, each having grippers, are separately movable over the needle bed of the flatbed knitting machine. The grippers are moved toward or away from the needle bed gap by turning of the drive shafts. One of the units is provided with the scissor-like cutter. The switching mechanism may be driven by one of the drive shafts in such an associated relationship that when the grippers of the unit driven by the drive shaft are on the way of moving toward the needle bed gap, the cutter can be opened, while on the other hand, when they are on the way of moving away therefrom, the cutter can be closed. The other gripper can be moved toward the needle bed gap by turning of the other drive shaft. Thus, the two grippers and the cutter can be driven for the gripping<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> and the cutting of the knitting yarn in a single operation of the turning of both of the driving shafts. The drive shaft for driving the cutter may be separate from the drive shaft for driving the grippers of the unit mounting the cutter thereon, to carry out the gripping of the knitting yarn with the grippers and the cutting of the knitting yarn with the cutter separately. The drive shaft for driving the cutter may be common with the drive shaft for driving the grippers of the unit mounting the cutter thereon, to carry out the gripping of the knitting yarn with those grippers only and the cutting of the knitting yarn continuously.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the present invention, since the two abutment lugs on the driving member are spaced from each other, an angle of the drive shaft at which the cutter begins to be opened when the grippers are moved toward the needle bed gap and an angle of the drive shaft at which the cutter begins to be closed when the grippers are moved away from the needle bed gap can be varied with each other. This varied angle can provide a preferred timing in opening or closing the cutter even when the turning of the drive shafts is carried out in a single operation.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to the present invention, the driving member of the switching mechanism for switching the opening or closing movement of the cutter and the switching lever are provided in two separate units, respectively. The opening or closing movement of the cutter cannot be switched until the two separate units are moved close to each other to an extent that the abutment lugs of the driving member are nearly abutted with the switching member. Accordingly, although the grippers and the cutter can be driven in a single operation of the turning of the single drive shaft,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> only the grippers may also be driven when the two units are separated from each other.</p><heading id="h0007"><b>Brief description of drawings</b></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1] Fig. 1</figref> is a front

present invention. In the flatbed knitting machine including the edge yarn treatment device 1, a knitting yarn is fed from a yarn feeding member such as a yarn feeder to knitting needles movable into a needle bed gap 2 across which front and back needle beds are arranged opposite to each other, to knit a knitted fabric with the knitting needles. A number of knitting needles are arranged in parallel in each of the needle beds. A carriage is moved in reciprocation along the needle beds together with the yarn feeding member, while driving the knitting needles selectively, to knit the knitted fabric. The yarn feeding member runs along a yarn guide extended over the needle bed gap 2. After completion of the knitting of a finger of a glove, the knitting yarn is put in the state of extending between the knitting needle at which the knitting is ended and the yarn feeding member immediately before the start to knit the next finger of the glove.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The edge yarn treatment device 1 is used for treating the edge yarn<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> produced when the knitting yarn extending in this state is caught and cut. The edge yarn treatment device 1 includes two gripper units of a left gripper unit 3 and a right gripper unit 4. The left gripper unit 3 and the right gripper unit 4 have gripping portions 5, 6 respectively which are in the form of grippers capable of gripping the knitting yarn at their front ends. The left gripper unit 3 and the right gripper unit 4 are supported by two drive shafts 7, 8 extending over the needle bed gap 2 so that they can be moved laterally in a sliding manner.
