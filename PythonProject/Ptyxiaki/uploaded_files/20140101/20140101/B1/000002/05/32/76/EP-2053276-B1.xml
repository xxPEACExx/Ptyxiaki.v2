One exemplary powertrain includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from a prime mover power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an output member. The output member can be operatively connected to a driveline for a motor vehicle for transmitting tractive torque thereto. Electric machines, operative as motors or generators, generate a torque input to the transmission, independently of a torque input from the internal combustion<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> engine. The electric machines may transform vehicle kinetic energy, transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy that is storable in an electrical energy storage device. A control system monitors various inputs from the vehicle and the operator and provides operational control of the powertrain, including controlling transmission operating state and gear shifting, controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the electrical power interchange among the electrical energy storage device and the electric machines to manage outputs of the transmission, including torque and rotational speed. A hydraulic control system is known to provide pressurized hydraulic oil for a number of functions throughout the powertrain.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Operation of the above devices within a hybrid powertrain vehicle require management of numerous torque bearing shafts or devices representing connections to the above mentioned engine, electrical machines, and driveline. Input torque from the engine and input torque from the electric machine or electric machines can be applied individually or cooperatively to provide output torque. Various control schemes and operational connections between the various aforementioned components of the hybrid drive system are known, and the control system must be able to engage to and disengage the various components from the transmission in order to perform the functions of the hybrid powertrain system. Engagement and disengagement are known to be accomplished within the transmission by employing selectively operable clutches.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Clutches are devices well known in the art for engaging and disengaging shafts including the management of rotational velocity and torque differences between the shafts. Clutches are known in a variety of designs and<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> control methods. One known type of clutch is a mechanical clutch operating by separating or joining two connective surfaces, for instance, clutch plates, operating, when joined, to apply frictional torque to each other. One control method for operating such a mechanical clutch includes applying the hydraulic control system implementing fluidic pressures transmitted through hydraulic lines to exert or release clamping force between the two connective surfaces. Operated thusly, the clutch is not operated in a binary manner, but rather is capable of a range of engagement states, from fully disengaged, to synchronized but not engaged, to engaged but with only minimal clamping force, to engaged with some maximum clamping force. The clamping force available to be applied to the clutch determines how much reactive torque the clutch can carry before the clutch slips.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The hydraulic control system, as described above, utilizes lines charged with hydraulic oil to selectively activate clutches within the transmission. However, the hydraulic control system is also known to perform a number of other functions in a hybrid powertrain. For example, an electric machine utilized within a hybrid powertrain generates heat. Known embodiments utilize hydraulic oil from the hydraulic control system in a continuous flow to cool the electric machine in a base machine cooling function. Other known embodiments additionally are known to react to higher electric machine temperatures with a selectable or temperature driven active machine cooling function, providing additional cooling in the high temperature condition. Additionally, known embodiments utilize hydraulic oil to lubricate mechanical devices, such as bearings. Also, hydraulic circuits are known to include some level of internal leakage.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Hydraulic oil is known to be pressurized within a hydraulic control system with a pump. The pump can be electrically powered or preferably mechanically driven. In addition to this first main hydraulic pump, hydraulic control systems are known to also include an auxiliary hydraulic pump. The internal impelling mechanism rotates operates at some speed, drawing hydraulic oil from a return line and pressurizing the hydraulic control system. The supply of hydraulic flow by the pump or pumps is affected by the speed of the pumps, the back pressure exerted by the hydraulic line pressure (P<sub>LINE</sub>), and the temperature of the hydraulic oil (T<sub>OIL</sub>).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The resulting or net P<sub>LINE</sub> within the hydraulic control system is impacted by a number of factors. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a model of factors impacting hydraulic flow in an exemplary hydraulic control system, in accordance with the present disclosure. As one having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, conservation of mass explains that, in steady state, flow entering a system must equal the flow exiting from that system. As applied to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a flow of hydraulic oil is supplied to the hydraulic control system by the pumps. The flow exits the hydraulic control system through the various functions served by the hydraulic control system. This exemplary embodiment includes the following functions: hydraulic oil fills clutch mechanisms in order to provide clamping force required to lock the clutch, as described above; hydraulic oil provides both base cooling and active cooling of the electric machines and other components as required; hydraulic oil is used to lubricate portions of the transmission; and hydraulic oil flows through leakage internal to the hydraulic circuit. P<sub>LINE</sub> describes the resulting charge of hydraulic oil maintained in the system: for any flow through a system, the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> resulting pressure within the system depends upon the flow resistance within the system. Higher flow resistance in the system results in higher system pressures for a given flow. Conversely, lower flow resistance in the system results in lower system pressures for a given flow. Applied to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, P<sub>LINE</sub> or the pressure within the hydraulic control system, changes depending upon usage of the hydraulic control system. For example, filling a previously unfilled transmission clutch consumes a significant amount of hydraulic oil from the hydraulic control system. The orifice leading to the clutch includes low resistance in order to draw the significant amount of hydraulic oil over a short time span. As a result, during the clutch filling process, P<sub>LINE</sub> in an otherwise unchanged hydraulic control system will reduce. Conversely, for a given set of functions served by the hydraulic control system, P<sub>LINE</sub> varies based upon the flow supplied by the pumps. For any given set of flow restrictions associated with the functions served, increased flow from the pumps will result in higher P<sub>LINE</sub>.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">As noted above, main hydraulic pumps are known to be powered mechanically, driven as a parasitic device from the engine. Hybrid powertrains are known to operate with an engine running or stopped, depending upon the current hybrid control strategy. Under engine stopped operation in a powertrain utilizing a mechanically driven main pump, the main pump cannot provide a supply of hydraulic flow, and, instead, an auxiliary pump must be used to provide P<sub>LINE</sub> required to operate the vehicle. A method to accurately control P<sub>LINE</sub> in a hybrid powertrain through engine running and stopped operation would provide useful control of the hydraulic control system.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">A method for controlling hydraulic line pressure of a hydraulic control system in an electro-mechanical transmission adapted to selectively transmit mechanical power to an output member includes determining an available flow from a main hydraulic pump, determining an available flow from an auxiliary hydraulic pump, determining a flow consumption of functions served by the hydraulic control system, determining an estimated hydraulic line pressure based upon the flow from the main hydraulic pump, the flow from the auxiliary hydraulic pump, and the flow consumption, determining a desired hydraulic line pressure to fulfill functions served by the hydraulic control system, comparing the desired hydraulic line pressure to the estimated hydraulic line pressure, and controlling the main hydraulic pump and the auxiliary hydraulic pump based upon the comparing the desired hydraulic line pressure to the estimated hydraulic line pressure.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">One or more embodiments will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a model of factors impacting hydraulic flow in an exemplary hydraulic control system, in accordance with the present disclosure;</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram of an exemplary powertrain, in accordance with the present disclosure;</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram of an exemplary architecture for a control system and powertrain, in accordance with the present disclosure;<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic diagram of a hydraulic circuit, in accordance with the present disclosure;</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> schematically depicts an exemplary line pressure estimation module capable of estimating P<sub>LINE</sub>, in accordance with the present disclosure;</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6</figref> schematically depicts an exemplary available line pressure estimation module capable of describing the maximum available pressure that can be generated by the hydraulic control system given current vehicle operation, in accordance with the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 7</figref> schematically depicts an exemplary system utilizing a estimated hydraulic line pressure to control a main pump and an auxiliary pump within a range, in accordance with the present disclosure.</p><heading id="h0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the purpose of limiting the same, <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0001">3</figref> depict an exemplary electro-mechanical hybrid powertrain.

The distributed control module system includes an engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. A hybrid control module (hereafter 'HCP') 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of the ECM 23, the TCM 17, the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface ('UI') 13 is operatively connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle operator controls or directs operation of the electro-mechanical hybrid powertrain. The devices include an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP') from which an operator torque request is determined, an operator brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a transmission gear selector 114 ('PRNDL'), and a vehicle speed cruise control (not shown). The transmission gear selector 114 may have a discrete number of operator-selectable positions, including the rotational direction of the output member 64 to enable one of a forward and a reverse direction.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The aforementioned control modules communicate with other control modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (hereafter 'LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of states of operating parameters and actuator command signals between the various control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-specific. The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned control modules, and other control modules providing functionality such as antilock braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple communications buses may be used to improve communications speed and provide some level of signal redundancy and integrity. Communication between individual control modules can also be effected using a direct link, e.g., a serial peripheral interface ('SPI') bus (not shown).</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the powertrain, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the user interface 13 and the powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 generates various commands, including: the operator torque request ('T<sub>O_REQ</sub>'), a commanded output torque ('T<sub>CMD</sub>') to the driveline 90, an engine input torque command, clutch torques for the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission 10; and the torque commands for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, respectively. The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the hydraulic control circuit 42 and provides various functions including monitoring various pressure sensing devices (not shown) and generating and communicating control signals to various solenoids (not shown) thereby controlling pressure switches and control valves contained within the hydraulic control circuit 42.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and functions to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-directional interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque command<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> from the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input torque, T<sub>I</sub>, provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon monitored engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The ECM 23 monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the engine input speed to the input shaft 12, which translates to the transmission input speed, N<sub>I</sub>. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of other engine operating parameters including, e.g., a manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. The engine load can be determined, for example, from the manifold pressure, or alternatively, from monitoring operator input to the accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23 generates and communicates command signals to control engine actuators, including, e.g., fuel injectors, ignition modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates command signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic control circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include estimated clutch torques for each of the clutches, i.e., C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, and rotational output speed, No, of the output member 64. Other actuators and sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 for control purposes.

Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and SPI buses. The control algorithms are executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing units to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the actuators, using preset calibrations.

A first continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode I, or MI, is selected by applying clutch C1 70 only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON ('MI_Eng_On') or OFF ('MI_Eng_Off'). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode II, or<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> MII, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to the carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON ('MII_Eng_On') or OFF ('MII_Eng_Off'). For purposes of this description, when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to zero revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating. A fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed of the transmission 10, i.e., N<sub>I</sub>/N<sub>O</sub>, is achieved. A first fixed gear operation ('FG1') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C4 75. A second fixed gear operation ('FG2') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C2 62. A third fixed gear operation ('FG3') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C4 75. A fourth fixed gear operation ('FG4') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C3 73. The fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed increases with increased fixed gear operation due to decreased gear ratios in the planetary gears 24, 26, and 28. The rotational speeds of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, N<sub>A</sub> and N<sub>B</sub> respectively, are dependent on internal rotation of the mechanism as defined by the clutching and are proportional to the input speed measured at the input shaft 12.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and brake pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or more of the other control modules determine the commanded output torque, T<sub>CMD</sub>, intended to meet the operator torque request, T<sub>O_REQ</sub>, to be executed at the output member 64 and transmitted to the driveline 90. Final vehicle acceleration is affected by other factors including, e.g., road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The operating range state is determined for the transmission 10 based upon a variety of operating characteristics of the powertrain. This<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> includes the operator torque request, communicated through the accelerator pedal 113 and brake pedal 112 to the user interface 13 as previously described. The operating range state may be predicated on a powertrain torque demand caused by a command to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in an electrical energy generating mode or in a torque generating mode. The operating range state can be determined by an optimization algorithm or routine which determines optimum system efficiency based upon operator demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The control system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 based upon an outcome of the executed optimization routine, and system efficiencies are optimized thereby, to manage fuel economy and battery charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined based upon a fault in a component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the torque-generative devices, and determines the power output from the transmission 10 required to achieve the desired output torque to meet the operator torque request. As should be apparent from the description above, the ESD 74 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are electrically-operatively coupled for power flow therebetween.

Main pump flow module 505 receives as inputs N<sub>MAIN</sub>, the indicated speed of the main pump; main pump control factors, indicating any measures taken to modulate hydraulic flow contributing to P<sub>LINE</sub> resulting from operation of the main pump; T<sub>OIL</sub>; and a fed-back indication of P<sub>LINEEST</sub>. It will be appreciated that N<sub>MAIN</sub> can be monitored<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> directly from the main pump, or in the case of a mechanically driven pump with a direct drive ratio to the speed of the engine driving the pump, N<sub>MAIN</sub> can be derived by monitoring the engine speed and applying the drive ratio. Main pump control factors can include a description of any known means utilized by the system to modulate the output of the main pump, for example, the use of a selectable flow restrictor, a selectable flow bypass circuit, or operation of a solenoid used to affect resulting P<sub>LINE</sub>. Main pump flow module 505 utilizes the inputs to model or estimate a FLOW MAIN term, describing hydraulic flow currently coming from the main pump and contributing to P<sub>LINE</sub>. Additionally, main pump flow module 505 estimates FLOW MAIN MAX, describing the maximum flow that could be delivered from the main pump given current vehicle operation. Aux pump flow module 510 receives as inputs N<sub>AUX</sub>, the indicated speed of the auxiliary pump 550; T<sub>OIL</sub>; and a fed-back indication of P<sub>LINEEST</sub>. Depending upon the hydraulic control system configuration, an additional input describing aux pump control factors could additionally be implemented. Aux pump flow module 510 utilizes the inputs to model or estimate a FLOW AUX term, describing hydraulic flow currently coming from the auxiliary pump and contributing to P<sub>LINE</sub>. Additionally, aux pump flow module 510 estimates FLOW AUX MAX, describing the maximum flow that could be delivered from the auxiliary pump given current vehicle operation. Flow max summation module 515 receives the FLOW MAIN MAX and FLOW AUX MAX signals from the aforementioned flow modules and provides a flow max term describing the maximum flow that can be provided by the main and aux pumps given current vehicle operation. Similarly, flow effective summation module 520 receives<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> the FLOW MAIN and FLOW AUX signals from the aforementioned flow modules and provides a flow effective term describing the total current flow that is being provided by the main and aux pumps. As described above in relation to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>, a line pressure estimator module 525 is operative to receive inputs and provide a P<sub>LINEEST</sub>, describing the estimated current P<sub>LINE</sub>. It should be noted that P<sub>LINE</sub> can be measured directly by a pressure transducer. P<sub>LINE</sub> maximum determination module 530 utilizes inputs, including resulting terms from modules 515 and 525, described above, to generate P<sub>MAX</sub>. P<sub>LINE</sub> minimum determination module 535 utilizes inputs, including resulting terms describing the functional requirements that must be fulfilled by the hydraulic control system, to generate P<sub>MIN</sub>. Pump control module 540 receives inputs from modules 525, 530, and 535, described above, and P<sub>DESIRED</sub>. Pump control module includes a control output to auxiliary pump 550. Pump control module 540 can describe a single device issuing control commands to devices affecting the flow from the main pump, such as a flow regulator, and to auxiliary pump 550 and any device affecting the flow from auxiliary pump 550. Alternatively, pump control module 540 can inclusively describe a plurality of devices serving command and control functions associated with operation and modulation of the pumps and their outputs. Alternatively, pump control module 540 can communicate with other modules, for example, pressure regulator control module 560 as depicted.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">While the above embodiments describe a system utilizing a main pump driven by the engine and an auxiliary pump electrically driven, one having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the methods described herein can be used with a wide variety of hydraulic control system<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> configurations. For example, a single electrically powered pump can be used in place of the two pump embodiment described above, and P<sub>LINE</sub> can be used in to control such a configuration.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">It is understood that modifications are allowable within the scope of the disclosure.
