has stretchability and self-fastenability. The nonwoven fabric is suitable for a tape used in medical or sport field (such as a bandage or a supporter).</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In medical and sport fields, various tapes such as bandages and supporters have conventionally been used for compressing, immobilizing (or fixing), or protecting a body part (e.g., a limb and an affected area or part) properly by applying the tapes on the body part. These tapes require properties such as fastenability (e.g., a self-fastenability due to only contacting the surfaces of tape with each other and a fastenability due to an adhesive agent), in addition to stretchability or conformability, sweat-absorbability, and air-permeability. In order to achieve the properties mentioned above, in particular, stretchability or fastenability, a soft component such as a rubber-series or acrylic latex is usually applied on a surface of a bandage (see Patent Documents 1 to 5). However, the soft component possibly causes a skin irritation or<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> an unpleasantly humid (or steamy) and warm state of the area covered with the tape due to a reduced air flow through the tape. Possibly, an allergy is also induced. In terms of safety, the tapes mentioned above are undesirable.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In order to reduce irritation to skin, a medical material using a natural rubber latex containing a small amount of protein as an adhesive agent (see Patent Document 6) or an self-adhesive bandage using a specific acrylic polymer as an adhesive agent (see Patent Document 7) has been proposed. However, since the medical materials disclosed in the Patent documents also use the adhesive agent after all, the fact is that the drawbacks have not been eliminated drastically.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As mentioned above, there has not been a product such as a bandage or a supporter, satisfying both a sufficient self-fastenability and an appropriate stretchability without an adhesive agent. Most of the conventional products are torn by hand in a length direction of the product. A tape which can be torn by one hand easily and whose end formed by tearing can easily be fixed in place on a surface of the underlying tape has not been developed yet.

The present invention has achieved based on the findings.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">That is, the nonwoven fabric of the present invention comprises a conjugated fiber comprising a plurality of resins which are different in thermal shrinkage and form a phase separation structure. In the nonwoven fabric, the conjugated fibers are arranged in a direction approximately parallel to a surface direction of the nonwoven fabric and crimped. In addition, the conjugated fibers have an average fiber length of 10 to 100 mm and an average curvature radius of fiber crimp of 20 to 200 µm and the crimps are distributed approximately uniformly in a thickness direction of the nonwoven fabric wherein the nonwoven fabric has a curved ratio of fiber of not less than 1.3 in each of three areas and a proportion of the minimum curved ratio of fiber relative to the maximum curved ratio of fiber not less than 75% in each of the three areas, providing that the nonwoven fabric is cut across the thickness direction and the cross section is divided in a direction perpendicular to the thickness direction equally into three. The resin constituting the conjugated fiber may comprise a non thermal adhesive resin under moisture which has a softening point or melting point of not lower than 100°C and forms at least a portion of a surface of the conjugated fiber. The nonwoven fabric of the present invention may be a nonwoven fabric which is substantially free from an adhesive agent and in which each fiber is substantially not melt-bonded to another. The conjugated fiber may comprise a polyalkylene arylate-series resin and a modified polyalkylene arylate-series resin and have a parallel (a side-by-side) or eccentric sheath-core form. In the above-mentioned nonwoven fabric the proportion of the conjugated fiber may be not less than 80% by mass. The nonwoven fabric of the present invention may have a plurality<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> of low-density portions and a plurality of high-density portions in a surface direction. The low-density portion and the high-density portion may be alternately formed in a periodic pattern. In addition, the nonwoven fabric mentioned above may have a strength at break of 5 to 30 N/50mm, an elongation at break of not less than 50%, a recovery after 50% elongation of not less than 80%, and a slip stress at curved surfaces in contact of not less than 0.5 N/50mm, in at least one direction. The nonwoven fabric of the present invention may have a tape- or band-like form and a ratio of the strength at break in a length direction relative to the strength at break in a width direction of 1.5 to 50. The nonwoven fabric of the present invention may be a tape such as a bandage or a supporter. The nonwoven fabric of the present invention may be a nonwoven fabric obtainable by a process for producing a nonwoven fabric comprising a step for forming a web with a fiber including a conjugated fiber comprising a plurality of resins which are different in thermal shrinkage and form a phase<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> separation structure and a step for heating the resulting fiber web with a high-temperature water vapor to allow the conjugated fiber to develop a crimp having an average curvature radius of 20 to 200 µm.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention includes a process for producing the nonwoven fabric which comprises a step for forming a web with a fiber including a conjugated fiber comprising a plurality of resins which are different in thermal shrinkage and form a phase separation structure and a step for heating the resulting fiber web to allow the conjugated fiber to develop a crimp. The production process may further comprise a step for entangling the fibers in an area of the fiber web loosely before the step for heating the resulting fiber web with a high-temperature water vapor to allow the conjugated fiber to develop a crimp.</p><heading id="h0006">EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">Since the nonwoven fabric of the present invention comprises conjugated (composite) fibers forming specific crimps and entangled with each other appropriately, the nonwoven fabric has a high stretchability and is easy to tear by hand, without using a pair of scissors or the like. In addition, since the nonwoven fabric can be self-fastened easily and firmly by overlapping an end or the like thereof in place on a surface of the underlying nonwoven fabric without using an adhesive agent, the nonwoven fabric can be used safely for the human body without using a skin<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> irritating material (e.g., a latex harmful for the human body). The nonwoven fabric of the present invention is thus suitable for a tape used for applications where the tape contacts with the human body. Since the nonwoven fabric of the present invention has air-permeability in addition to the properties mentioned above, the nonwoven fabric is suitable for a tape (such as a bandage or a supporter). Moreover, a tape prepared from the nonwoven fabric can be torn across the width direction easily, and the end formed by tearing the tape is fastened in place on a surface of the underlying tape.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Incidentally, the term "be self-fastened" in the present specification means that a tape- or belt-shaped nonwoven fabric is fastened, without using an auxiliary part or an adhesive agent, by overlapping an end or the like of the nonwoven fabric with a surface of the underlying nonwoven fabric to engage the nonwoven fabric surfaces with each other as if both sides of a hook and loop fastener couple or join together.</p><heading id="h0007">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>]<br/>

Such a non thermal adhesive resin under moisture preferably includes, for example, a polypropylene-series resin, a polyester-series resin, and a polyamide-series resin.

A conjugated fiber having an excessively small fineness is difficult to produce and has a low fiber strength.

On the other hand, an excessively long fiber length hinders formation of a fiber web having a uniform basic weight. In addition, at the web formation, the resulting fiber web has many fiber entanglements, which hinder the crimp development since the move of the fibers is restrained by the entanglement. Therefore, it is difficult to provide a nonwoven fabric having stretchability. In the present invention, when the conjugated fiber having a fiber length within the range mentioned above is crimped, the crimp of the fiber forming the nonwoven fabric surface partly protrudes from the inside of the nonwoven fabric, which is consequently advantageous to enhancement of the self-fastenability of the nonwoven fabric mentioned later.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Such a conjugated fiber mentioned above develops<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> a crimp (or the crimp of such a conjugated fiber mentioned above is allowed to manifest themselves) by a heat treatment.

Specifically, in each area of three areas obtained by dividing a cross section equally into three in a direction perpendicular to the thickness direction, particularly, in a middle area (inner layer), the number of the fibers forming a coil-like crimp having at least one turn is, for example, 5 to 50 pieces per area of 5 mm (in a length along<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> with the surface direction) by 0.2 mm (in a length along with the thickness direction), preferably 10 to 50 pieces per area of 5 mm (in a length along with the surface direction) by 0.2 mm (in a length along with the thickness direction), and more preferably 20 to 50 pieces per area of 5 mm (in a length along with the surface direction) by 0.2 mm (in a length along with the thickness direction). In the nonwoven fabric of the present invention, owing to most of the crimped fiber long axes, which are parallel to the nonwoven fabric surface, the number of crimps is uniformly distributed in the thickness direction. Such a nonwoven fabric has a high stretchability without containing a rubber or an elastomer. In addition, the nonwoven fabric has a strength enough for practical use without an adhesive agent. Incidentally, the term "an area obtained by dividing the cross section into three with respect to the thickness direction" in the present description means each area of the three areas obtained by dividing the cross section with respect to the thickness direction of the nonwoven fabric equally into three in a direction perpendicular to the thickness direction.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In addition, the uniform distribution of the crimps in the thickness direction of the nonwoven fabric of the present invention is also evaluated from the uniformity of the curved ratio of fiber in the thickness direction of the nonwoven fabric. The curved ratio of fiber means a ratio (L2/L1) of a fiber length (L2) of the crimped fiber<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> relative to a length between the both ends of the crimped fiber (L1). The curved ratio of fiber (particularly, the curved ratio of fiber in the middle area in the thickness direction of the nonwoven fabric) is 1.3 or more (e.g., 1.35 to 5), preferably 1.4 to 4 (e.g., 1.5 to 3.5), and more preferably 1.6 to 3 (particularly, 1.8 to 2.5). Incidentally, in the present invention, as described later, since the curved ratio of fiber is measured based on an electron micrograph of the cross section of the nonwoven fabric, the fiber length (L2) means not a fiber length obtained by straightening a fiber which is three-dimensionally crimped to measure the length (an actual length), but a fiber length obtained by straighten a fiber whose crimps are two-dimensionally observed on an electron micrograph (a fiber length on a photograph).

The proportion of the minimum curved ratio of fiber relative to the maximum curved ratio of fiber in each area (the ratio of the minimum curved ratio of fiber among the three areas relative to the maximum curved ratio of fiber among the three areas) is, for example, not less than 75% (e.g., about 75 to 100%), preferably about 80 to 99%, and more preferably about 82 to 98% (particularly about 85 to 97%).</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Specifically, the curved ratio of fiber and the uniformity of the curved ratio of fiber are measured as follows; (1) taking an electron micrograph of the cross section with respect to the thickness direction of the nonwoven fabric; (2) dividing the cross section on the photograph equally into three in a direction perpendicular to the thickness direction to obtain three areas [a surface layer (a surface area), an inner layer (a middle area), and a backside layer (a backside area)], each of which has the same thickness in the middle of the layer and is parallel to another in the thickness direction; (3) selecting a measuring area by adjusting the length of the measuring area to not less than 2 mm in the length direction of the nonwoven fabric and the width of the measuring area to an appropriate length to count the number of the fiber pieces suitable for measuring the curved ratio of fiber of not less than 100 pieces (preferably not less than 300 pieces,<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> and more preferably about 500 to 1000 pieces); (4) measuring the curved ratio of fiber of all fibers in the measuring area of each area and calculating the average curved ratio of fiber of each area; and (5) comparing the average of the maximum curved ratio of fiber and the average of the minimum curved ratio of fiber among the three areas to calculate the uniformity of the curved ratio of fiber.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The potential crimping fiber constituting the nonwoven fabric has an approximately coil-like form after the crimp development, as mentioned above.

Here, the average curvature radius is an index representing the average size of the loop of the coil-like crimped fiber. A large average curvature radius of the coil-like crimped fiber means that the crimped fiber has a loosely twisted coil-like form. In other words, the crimped fiber has a coil-like form having a small number of crimps or loops. Moreover, a small number of crimps provide a modest fiber entanglement, which is disadvantageous to producing a nonwoven fabric having a sufficient stretchability. On the other hand, the development of crimps having an excessively small average curvature radius provides an insufficient fiber<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> entanglement, which reduces the strength of the web.

Blending the non-conjugated fiber with the conjugated fiber can balance between the strength with the tearability by hand of the nonwoven fabric.

The entanglement of the crimped fibers occurs in a direction parallel to the surface of the nonwoven fabric. In the thickness direction (or an oblique direction) of the nonwoven fabric, the conjugated fibers are also entangled with each other. However, the entanglement of the fibers in the thickness direction (or an oblique direction) of the nonwoven fabric is loose. In particular, in the present invention, during the shrinkage or contraction of the conjugated fibers in the fiber web, i.e., during the change in the form of the conjugated fiber into a coil-like form, the helical crimps or loops of the conjugated fibers are entangled with another. Owing to the helical crimps or loops entangled with each other as mentioned above, the fibers are prevented from falling apart even when the nonwoven fiber is stretched. Therefore, the nonwoven fabric of the present invention can greatly be stretched in the surface direction (longitudinal direction) of the nonwoven fabric rather than in the width direction or in the thickness direction thereof. In addition, since the helical crimps forming the nonwoven fabric surface or protruding from the inside of the nonwoven fabric are easily entangled with each other by pressing the nonwoven fabric surfaces in<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> contact against each other, the nonwoven fabric shows self-fastenability. Moreover, the entanglement of the helical crimps arranged in the surface and length directions are unraveled when the helical crimps are stretched or elongated by applying a tensile strength on the nonwoven fabric in the length direction thereof. Therefore, the nonwoven fabric is easy to tear.

Therefore, when the nonwoven fabric is stretched in the thickness direction, the nonwoven fabric does not show such stretchability as a stretchability (contracting or shrinking property) which is observed at an elongation in the surface direction.

The thickness of the nonwoven fabric can be selected from, for example, the range of about 0.1 to 10 mm. The thickness thereof is, for example, about 0.2 to 5 mm, preferably about 0.3 to 3 mm, and more preferably about 0.4 to 1.5 mm. The nonwoven fabric having a basic weight or thickness within the range mentioned above has stretchability and tearability in a well-balanced way.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The elongation at break in at least one direction (e.g. , a length direction of a tape-shaped nonwoven fabric) of the nonwoven fabric of the present invention may be not less than 50%, preferably not less than 60% (e.g., about 60 to 300%), and more preferably not less than 80% (e.g., about 80 to 250%). The nonwoven fabric having an elongation at break within the range mentioned above has a high stretchability.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The recovery of the nonwoven fabric of the present invention after being subjected to 50% elongation in at least one direction (the recovery after 50% elongation) may be not less than 70% (e.g., 70 to 100%), for example, not less than 80% (e.g., 80 to 100%), preferably not less than 90% (e.g., 90 to 100%), and more preferably not less than 95% (e.g., 95 to 100%). The nonwoven fabric having<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> a recovery after elongation within the range mentioned above has a high conformability to move of the nonwoven fabric being elongated. For example, the nonwoven fabric used as a bandage conforms to the form of a part to which the nonwoven fabric is applied, and the nonwoven fabric surfaces in contact are pressed against each other to immobilize and compress the part properly. In particular, when the nonwoven fabric is wound twice or more by overlapping the surfaces thereof, fastening force is produced by pressing the nonwoven fabric surfaces in contact against each other. The generated fastening force consequently corresponds to an entire recovery stress. The entire recovery stress mentioned above is similar to a recovery stress of a nonwoven fabric having an increased basic weight. That is, when a nonwoven fabric having a small recovery after elongation is used for winding around a body part having a complicate shape or when a body part which is being wrapped with a nonwoven fabric having a small recovery after elongation accidentally moves, the nonwoven fabric cannot conform to the shape or move and the deformation of the nonwoven fabric due to the movement is not restored. In such a case, the immobilization of the nonwoven fabric wrapped around part becomes deteriorated.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The nonwoven fabric of the present invention shows behavior in recovery after 50% elongation in at least one direction. The stress at 25% elongation in 50% elongation in at least one direction [elongation stress (X)] and the<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> stress at 25% elongation in recovery after 50% elongation [recovery stress (Y)] are measured. The ratio of the recovery stress (Y) relative to the elongation stress (X) [(Y/X)] may be not less than 0.05, for example, not less than 0.1, preferably not less than 0.3, and more preferably not less than 0.4 (particularly, about 0.5 to 1.0). A nonwoven fabric having a high ratio of the recovery stress (Y) relative to the elongation stress (X) can maintain a high stress at recovery after being elongated. When such a nonwoven fabric is used as a tape to wind around a body part, the body part is more firmly immobilized. A nonwoven fabric having a small ratio of the recovery stress (Y) relative to the elongation stress (X) has a low stress at recovery. That is, when such a nonwoven fabric is used as a tape to wind around a body part, the immobilizing property of the tape is low. Accordingly, the nonwoven fabric mentioned above is not suitable for an application such as a bandage.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The nonwoven fabric of the present invention has also an excellent self-fastenability and is suitable for using as a tape such as a bandage. Incidentally, the self-fastenability is a property or an ability to fasten itself or hook onto itself by bringing the surfaces into contact to couple or entangle the surfaces in contact with each other without using an adhesive agent or the like. Specifically, after the nonwoven fabric as a bandage is wound around an object once, an end of the bandage is<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> overlapped in place on the underlying nonwoven fabric (or the bandage is torn and the end produced or formed by tearing is overlapped) and fastened. In a series of the actions mentioned above, with being elongated, the nonwoven fabric surfaces in contact are pressed against each other to join or to couple the surfaces in contact with each other, whereby the nonwoven fabric shows self-fastenability. In this case, ideally, the nonwoven fabric surfaces in contact are joined or coupled with a strength higher than the breaking strength of the nonwoven fabric. In practice, the way or direction of winding the nonwoven fabric around an objective part often depends on the state or shape of the part. Changing the way or direction of winding the nonwoven fabric increases the frictional force of the nonwoven fabric surfaces in contact, which increases the self-fastenability of the nonwoven fabric. Therefore, even though the strength between the surfaces in contact is lower than the strength at break, the bandage can practically be fastened. The strength between the nonwoven fabric surfaces in contact is difficult to measure. To overcome the difficulty, in the present invention, "slip stress at curved surfaces in contact" is used for evaluation of the self-fastenability (slip resistance at curved surfaces in contact). The nonwoven fabric which can be used as a bandage in practice preferably requires a predetermined self-fastenability and a "slip stress at curved surfaces in contact" of not less than 0.5 N/50mm, and more preferably not less than 1. 0 N/50mm<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> (particularly not less than 3.0 N/50mm). The stress at curved surfaces in contact plays an important role in the self-fastenability of the nonwoven fabric. The larger the slip stress at curved surfaces in contact is, more firmly the nonwoven fabric can be fastened after winding the nonwoven fabric around an objective part and tearing the nonwoven fabric. Accordingly, an excessively small slip stress at curved surfaces in contact fails to fasten the nonwoven fabric firmly, whereby the nonwoven fabric wound around the part gradually unfastens from the end of the nonwoven fabric. Incidentally, using a tensile tester, the slip stress at curved surfaces in contact is measured in accordance with the method set forth in Examples described later.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Moreover, a large number of the coil-like crimped fiber or crimped fiber having a loop protruding from the inside of the nonwoven fabric or forming the nonwoven fabric surface improves the fastenability due to the entanglement of the crimped fibers of the nonwoven fabric surfaces in contact. In addition, a bandage end produced or formed by tearing after winding the nonwoven fabric around an objective matter (e.g., a body part such as a hand or a finger) has the crimped fibers freely moving (the free fibers which are sticking out of the end or which have an fiber end formed by tearing). The free fibers can freely be entangled with the coil-like crimped fibers or crimped fibers having a loop of the underlying nonwoven fabric,<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> whereby a highly excellent self-fastenability is provided. The number of the coil-like crimped fibers or crimped fiber having a loop of the nonwoven fabric surface is, for example, not less than 7 pieces per 1 cm<sup>2</sup>, preferably about 8 to 50 pieces per 1 cm<sup>2</sup>, and more preferably about 9 to 45 pieces per 1 cm<sup>2</sup> (particularly about 10 to 40 pieces per 1 cm<sup>2</sup>). Incidentally, in the present invention, the concrete measuring method of the number of the coil-like crimped fibers or crimped fibers having a loop is the method described in Examples.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Furthermore, the strength at break of the nonwoven fabric of the present invention is, for example, 5 to 30 N/50mm, preferably 6 to 25 N/50mm, and more preferably 7 to 20 N/50mm in at least one direction (e.g., a length direction). The strength at break plays an important role in the tearability by hand. The feature of the nonwoven fabric of the present invention is easy to tear by hand. The nonwoven fabric to be used as a bandage also requires "tenacity" against tearing. The "tenacity" means that even though the nonwoven fabric gets a cut which triggers tearing in its use, the nonwoven fabric does not easily tear from the cut. That is, since the break of the nonwoven fabric is easily triggered as tearing starts, the tearability by hand of the nonwoven fabric could ultimately depend on the strength at break. Accordingly, an excessively large strength at break makes it difficult to tear the nonwoven fabric by one hand in its use. On the<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> other hand, a nonwoven fabric having an excessively small strength at break lacks strength and breaks easily. Such a nonwoven fabric is not easy to use.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In particular, the nonwoven fabric to be used as a bandage requires a certain strength to fasten the end formed by tearing the bandage after winding the bandage around an affected part or the like as much as need, being stretched in the length direction. Therefore, it is preferable that the strength at break of the nonwoven fabric satisfy the above mentioned range in the length direction of the bandage.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In addition, in order to produce a bandage from the nonwoven fabric of the present invention, it is necessary to process the nonwoven fabric to give a desirable width or length of the bandage. The above-mentioned process is usually facilitated using a slitter rewinder. Accordingly, in the present invention, in order to secure an efficient production of the bandage it is also preferable that the strength at break of the nonwoven fabric be within the above-mentioned range in the length direction.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">On the other hand, the strength at break in the width direction may be lower than the strength at break in the longitudinal (lengthwise) direction. The strength at break in the width direction may be, for example, about 0.05 to 20 N/50mm, preferably about 0.1 to 15 N/50mm, and more preferably about 0.5 to 10 N/50mm (particularly about 1 to 8 N/50mm).<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --></p><p id="p0057" num="0057">As mentioned above, the nonwoven fabric of the present invention is not only anisotropic in the surface direction and the thickness direction but also usually anisotropic in the machine direction (MD) and the cross direction (CD). That is, in the production process for the nonwoven fabric of the present invention, the axis directions of the coil-like crimped fibers tend to be arranged not only in a direction approximately parallel to the surface direction of the nonwoven fabric but also in a direction approximately parallel to the machine direction. As a result, a nonwoven fabric produced in rectangular form has stretchabilities and properties at break, each being different in the machine direction and the cross direction. In particular, the nonwoven fabric has strengths at break different in the machine direction and the cross direction. In order to use such a nonwoven fabric as a bandage, the machine direction of the nonwoven fabric is allowed to correspond to the length direction of the nonwoven fabric to impart a strength at break within the range mentioned above to the nonwoven fabric. Concretely, the strength at break in the length direction (machine direction) relative to that in the cross direction is, for example, 1.5 to 50, preferably 2 to 40, and more preferably 3 to 30. In addition, letting the strength at break in the length direction be 1, the strength at the cross direction is, for example, about 0.01 to 1, preferably about 0.03 to 0.8, and more preferably<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> about 0.05 to 0.6 (particularly about 0.1 to 0.5).</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The nonwoven fabric of the present invention preferably has water repellency. This is the reason why the use of nonwoven fabric for applications where the fabric contacts with a human body, particularly, such as a bandage or a supporter, prevents water on the outer layer of the nonwoven fabric wrapped around an affected area from getting therethrough and reaching the affected area. The water repellency is imparted to the nonwoven fabric to be treated with water or a water vapor (or untreated nonwoven fabric). In the production process described later, the fibers of the untreated nonwoven fabric is exposed to water or a water vapor to wash away a hydrophilic material adhered to the fibers, whereby the fibers are allowed to exhibit the inherent behaviors of the resin on the surface of the fibers The concrete water repellency preferably shows a score of not less than 3 (preferably 3 to 5, and more preferably 4 to 5) in JIS L1092 Testing methods for water resistance of textiles (Spray test).</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In addition, the washing-away action with water or a water vapor removes an oil for a fiber which has been adhered to the fibers as well, leading to a decrease in skin irritation of the nonwoven fabric of the present invention.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The nonwoven fabric has an air-permeability of not less than 0.1 cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>·second measured in accordance a Fragzier tester method, for example, about 1 to 500<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>·second, preferably about 5 to 300 cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>·second, and more preferably about 10 to 200 cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>·second.

The web-forming process which may be used includes a conventional process, e. g. , a direct process such as a spun bond process or a melt-blow process, a carding process using a melt-blow fiber or a staple fiber, and a dry process such as air-laid process. Among these processes, a carding process using a melt-blow fiber or a staple fiber, particularly, a carding process using a staple fiber is commonly used. The web obtained by using the staple fiber may include, e.g., a random web, a semi-random web, a parallel web, and a cross-wrap web.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The obtained fiber web is then subjected to a step for heating the web to crimp the fibers thereof in order to produce a nonwoven fabric. In the obtained nonwoven fabric, the conjugated fibers are arranged with putting<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> the fiber length direction to a direction parallel to the web surface, and the crimps having a specific curvature radius are distributed almost uniformly in the thickness direction of the nonwoven fabric. However, in the present invention, in order to prevent the potential crimping fibers from scattering in the step for heating the web to crimp the potential crimping fibers, a step for entangling the fibers in an area of the fiber web loosely with each other is preferably performed before the step for heating the web. The fiber-entangling step mentioned above may be a process for entangling the fibers mechanically. The preferred one includes a process for entangling the fibers by applying or spraying (or ejecting) a low-pressure water to the web. The process comprising the step spraying a low-pressure water, in the present invention, is not a process for entangling the fibers firmly using a water flow to produce a high web strength (e.g., a common hydroentangled nonwoven fabric), but a process for restraining the move of the fibers by bringing the fiber web in a wet state to fix the fibers loosely. In such an entangling process using a low-pressure water, the spray of water may be continuously, preferably, intermittently or periodically. The intermittent or periodic spray of a low-pressure water to the fiber web forms a plurality of low-density portions and a plurality of high-density portions. The low-density portion and the high-density portion are formed alternately in a periodic pattern. Owing to the formation of density<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> difference in the fiber web, the fibers in an area of the fiber web, mainly in the high-density portion, are loosely entangled with each other to prevent the fiber from scattering by spraying with a high-temperature and high-pressure water vapor in the next step. On the other hand, in the low-density portion, the fiber entanglement hardly occurs since the amount of the fibers is small. In addition, less fiber-fiber contacts do not prevent the fibers from moving freely, which is advantageous to an excellent crimp development.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">That is, the water ejection pressure in the step for entangling the fibers is preferably as low as possible in order to entangle the fibers loosely with each other. The water ejection pressure is, for example, about 0.1 to 1. 5 MPa, preferably about 0.3 to 1.2 MPa, and more preferably about 0.6 to 1.0 MPa. Incidentally, the water temperature is, for example, about 5 to 50°C, preferably about 10 to 40°C, for example, about 15 to 35°C (a room temperature).</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">The process for spraying the web with water intermittently or periodically is not particularly limited to a specific one as long as the process can produce the density differences (i.e., the high-density and low-density portions) are alternately formed in a periodic pattern. The preferred one includes a process for ejecting water to the fiber web through a plate-like matter (e.g., a porous plate) having a plurality of pores forming a spraying area or pattern in a regular form in terms of the convenience.<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --></p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Concretely, the fiber web obtained in the step for forming a fiber web is transferred by a belt conveyor to the next step. Then the fiber web may be transferred to pass through a clearance between a drum comprising a porous plate (a porous plate drum) and the conveyor belt, being placed on the conveyor belt. The conveyor belt may be water-permeable. The use of such a conveyor belt allows a water mist ejected from the porous plate drum inside at a pressure within the range mentioned above to penetrate the fiber web and the conveyor belt while the fiber web is passing through the clearance between the porous plate drum and the belt. The water sprayed in this manner moves aside the fibers constituting the web on the belt to a non-sprayed area which is not corresponding to a pore of the porous plate, whereby the amount of the fiber in the area corresponding to the pores is reduced. In this stage, the density difference may be produced by spraying the web with water to form pores in the areas corresponding to the pores of the drum (sprayed areas).</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The pore alignment or arrangement structure of the porous plate is not particularly limited to a specific one. The pore alignment structure may be, for example, a pore alignment structure in which the pores are disposed in a mesh pattern or cross-striped pattern (hound's-tooth check pattern). Each pore usually has the same size. The size is, for example, about 1 to 10 mm, preferably about 1.5 to 5 mm. The pitch between the pores adjacent to each other<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --> is usually the same. The pitch therebetweeen is, for example, about 1 to 5 mm, preferably about 1.5 to 3 mm.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">An excessively small pore size decreases the amount of the water passing through the pores, whereby the fibers of the fiber web are sometimes not moved aside by the water passing through the web. An excessively large pore size requires widening the pitch between the pores, in order to stabilize a form of a drum. The use of such a drum often produces or forms an area which is not contacted with water in the web, whereby an irregularity of quality is caused or a uniform treatment of the web becomes difficult. In addition, an excessively small pitch between the pores requires reducing the pore size, and the amount of the water is reduced. The use of a drum having an excessively large pitch between the pores produces or forms an area which is not contacted with water as well, whereby an irregularity of quality is caused.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Finally, the fiber web in which the fibers loosely entangled with each other in places is transferred by the belt conveyor for the next step. In the step, the web comprising the potential crimping fibers is heated to crimp the fiber. The heating process may be a dry heat treatment. The preferred one includes a treatment with a high-temperature water vapor. In the high-temperature water vapor treatment, the fiber web transferred by the belt conveyor is exposed to a high-temperature or a heated water vapor (high pressure steam) flow to crimp the<!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --> conjugated fibers (potential crimping fibers), whereby the nonwoven fabric of the present invention is obtained. That is, in the present invention, during the crimp development, the conjugated fibers shrink or the form of the fibers changes into a coil-like form to entangle the fibers three-dimensionally.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">In a common production step of a nonwoven fabric comprising the conjugated fibers, a step for fixing the fibers (fiber-entangling step) and a heating step for developing crimps of the potential crimping fibers are separately performed. Therefore, it is necessary that a fiber web comprising the conjugated fiber as a main component be subjected to fiber-entangling step by a needle-punching or hydroentangling to provide the web with a form suitable or stable for processing in the next step and then the web be subjected to a dry heating treatment to crimp the fibers. For that reason, the nonwoven fabric obtained by the conventional production process has strongly entangled fibers after the heat treatment, thereby increasing stress at elongation in the length direction. Such a nonwoven fabric is difficult to tear by hand with ease. In the present invention, the fiber web having a fiber entanglement as minimized as possible is subjected to heat (particularly, a high-temperature water vapor treatment) to develop the crimps of the fibers and to entangle the fibers at the same time, whereby easy-tearability is attained.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">Concretely, the fiber web treated with a water at<!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --> a low pressure is subjected to a high-temperature water vapor treatment, being transferred by the belt conveyor. As soon as the high-temperature water vapor treatment starts, the fiber web contracts or shrinks. Accordingly, it is preferable that an excess amount of the fiber web be fed just before being exposed to a high-temperature water vapor. Depending on an objective size of the nonwoven fabric, the web is overfed at a rate of about 110 to 300%, and preferably about 120 to 250% per objective length of the nonwoven fabric.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">The belt conveyor to be used is not particularly limited to a specific one as long as the conveyor can principally transfer the fiber web without deforming the form of the fiber web. The preferably used one includes an endless conveyer. Incidentally, a common single belt conveyer may be used, and according to need, a combination of the common single belt conveyers (i.e., two common single belt conveyers) may be used to transfer the fiber web with holding the web between the belts of these conveyors. Transferring the web by the two conveyers in the above-mentioned manner prevents the deformation of the web being transferred due to an external force such a high-temperature water vapor (steam) or a vibration of the conveyer at the web treatment.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">In order to supply the fiber web with a water vapor, a conventional water vapor spraying apparatus is used. The preferred one includes an apparatus which can spray the<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> fiber web approximately uniformly in the entire width direction with a water vapor at a desirable pressure and amount. In the combination use of the two belt conveyers, a first conveyor may have a first vapor spraying apparatus for supplying the web with the vapor disposed therebehind to supply the web with the vapor through a water-permeable conveyor belt or the conveyor net placed on the conveyor, and a second conveyor may have a first suction box disposed therebehind. A surplus vapor which has passed through the web may be removed by the suction box. However, in order to apply the water vapor on the fiber web sufficiently and to develop the crimps of the fiber due to the heat of the water vapor more efficiently, it is necessary to prevent the web from being applied a force as much as possible. Therefore, it is preferable that the water vapor be supplied without suction by the suction box. In addition, in order to treat the both surfaces of the web with the vapor at once, the first conveyer may further have a second suction box disposed behind the conveying surface, being distanced from the first vapor spraying apparatus in the traveling direction of the web, and the second conveyer may further has a second vapor spraying apparatus disposed behind the conveying surface. An alternative process for subjecting the both surfaces of the fiber web to the vapor treatment without the second vapor spraying apparatus is as follows: allowing the fiber web to pass through the clearance between the first vapor spraying apparatus; reversing the obtained<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> fiber web; and allowing the reversed fiber web to pass through therebetween to subject another surface of the web to the vapor treatment.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">The endless belt to be used for the conveyer is not particularly limited to a specific one as long as the belt does not hinder the transport of the web or the high-temperature vapor treatment. When a net is used as an endless belt, a net having a mesh count smaller than about 90 (e.g., about 10 to 50) is preferred. A net having a mesh count more then above-mentioned number has a low air-permeability and makes it difficult to allow the water vapor to pass therethrough. The preferred material of the belt in terms of heat resistance for the water vapor treatment or the like includes, for example, a metal, a polyester-series resin treated for heat resistance, and a heat-resistant resin such as a polyphenylenesulfide-series resin, a polyarylate-series resin (a fully aromatic-series polyester-series resin) or an aromatic polyamide-series resin.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">The high-temperature water vapor sprayed from the water vapor spraying apparatus is an air (or gaseous) flow and enters the inside of the web being treated without moving the fibers thereof greatly, unlike a hydroentangling or a needle-punching. Presumably, this water vapor-entering effect allows the vapor to cover the surface of each fiber of the web efficiently, whereby the uniform crimp development due to heat can be attained. Moreover, since<!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --> the water vapor treatment can transmit or conduct heat to the inside of the fiber more sufficiently than a dry heat treatment, the degree of crimping is almost uniform in the surface direction and the thickness direction of the nonwoven fabric.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">For spraying the high-temperature water vapor, a plate or die having a plurality of predetermined orifices arranged continuously in a width direction thereof is used as a nozzle, and the plate or die is disposed to arrange the orifices in the width direction of the fiber web to be conveyed. The plate or die may have at least one orifice line or a plurality of orifice lines, being parallel to each other. Moreover, it is possible that a plurality of nozzle dies, each having one orifice line, be disposed being parallel to each other.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">The thickness of a plate nozzle having an orifices formed thereon may be about 0.5 to 1 mm. The diameter of the orifice or the pitch between the orifices is not particularly limited to a specific one as long as the condition of the diameter or pitch thereof efficiently provides an objective crimp development and a fiber entanglement in the crimp development. The diameter of the orifice is usually, about 0.05 to 2 mm, preferably about 0.1 to 1 mm, and more preferably about 0.2 to 0.5 mm. The pitch between the orifices is, usually, about 0.5 to 3 mm, preferably about 1 to 2.5 mm, and more preferably about 1 to 1.5 mm. An excessively small diameter of the orifice<!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --> tends to cause difficulties, for example, a difficulty in producing such a nozzle with a high accurate process and a difficulty in using such a nozzle due to a frequent plugging of the orifice. An excessively large diameter of the orifice decreases the power for jetting with vapor of the nozzle. On the other hand, an excessively small pitch between the orifices makes the distance between nozzle holes so close that the strength of the nozzle is decreased. An excessively large pitch between the orifices causes a possible insufficient contact of a high-temperature water vapor with the fiber web, whereby the strength of the obtained web is low.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">The high-temperature water vapor to be used is not particularly limited to a specific one as long as an objective crimp development of the fibers and an appropriate fiber entanglement in the crimp development can be achieved.

An excessively high or strong pressure of the water vapor disturbs the arrangement of the fibers constituting the web or entangles the fibers more than need. In addition, in an extreme case, the fibers are melt-bonded, whereby an objective stretchability is hardly achieved. On the other hand, an excessively weak pressure of the water vapor fails to give an amount of heat which is necessary to the<!-- EPO <DP n="51"> --> crimp development of the fibers or allow a water vapor to penetrate the fiber web, whereby the distribution of the crimp of the fibers tends to be ununiform in the thickness direction of the nonwoven fabric. Moreover, controlling uniform ejection of the water vapor from the nozzle is difficult.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">The temperature of the high-temperature water vapor is, for example, about 70 to 150°C, preferably about 80 to 120°C, and more preferably about 90 to 110°C.

If necessary, the web after the water vapor treatment may be dried. It is necessary that the fibers of the surface of the nonwoven fabric be not bonded by the heat from a heating element for drying in contact with the nonwoven fabric and the nonwoven fabric do not deteriorate stretchability after drying. As long as the stretchability of the nonwoven fabric is maintained after the drying, the drying can employ a conventional manner (or process). For example, a large-scale dryer which is used for drying a nonwoven fabric, such as a cylinder dryer or a tenter dryer may be used. However, since the amount of the water remaining in the nonwoven fabric is so small<!-- EPO <DP n="52"> --> that the nonwoven fabric can practically be dried by a relatively simple drying means, the drying preferably used is a non-contacting manner (e.g. , an extreme infrared rays irradiation, a microwave irradiation, and an irradiation of electron beam) or a manner for spraying a hot air or a manner for allowing a hot air to pass through the nonwoven fabric.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">The nonwoven fabric obtained by the above-mentioned manner is a nonwoven fabric which has been exposed to water and then a high-temperature water vapor atmosphere in the production process.

Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> (1), an end of the sample 1 was fixed on a core pipe 3 (a pipe roll which was made of a polypropylene resin and had an outer diameter of 30 mm and a length of 150 mm) with a scotch tape 2, and using an alligator clip 4 (the gripping distance was 50 mm, and a rubber sheet having a thickness of 0.5 mm had been fixed on the inside of the clip with a double-faced adhesive tape before use), a 150 g-weight 5 was attached to another end of the sample 1 to apply the entire weight on the whole width of the sample 1 evenly.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">The core roll (pipe roll) 3 which was suspending the weight 5 through the sample 1 was rolled up and made five turns to lift the weight 5, paying attention to minimize the swing of the weight 5 (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> (2)). In this state of the sample 1 and the weight 5, let a boundary between an outermost layer of the sample 1 formed into a cylinder by winding the sample 1 around the pipe roll 3 and a plane area of the sample 1 unwound be a base point 6. The boundary was regarded as a border line between an area of the sample 1 wound around the pipe roll 3 and an area of the sample 1 straighten by the gravity of the weight 5. Keeping the state mentioned above, i.e., paying attention to keep the position of the base point 6, the alligator clip 4 and the weight 5 were quietly removed from the end of the sample 1. Then the sample 1 wound around the pipe roll 3 was cut at a point 7 which was located a half-circle away from the<!-- EPO <DP n="57"> --> base point 6, with a razor, to give a cut 8, paying attention to avoid cutting the underlying sample 1 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>). Incidentally, the point 7 also corresponded to an imaginary point 6, which would be obtained if the pipe roll would be rotated by 180°.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">The slip stress at curved surfaces in contact of the sample 1, i.e. , the slip stress at curved surfaces in contact between the outermost layer area and the inner layer area which had been placed under the outermost layer and wound around the pipe roll 3 was measured using a tensile tester ("Autograph" manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation). The pipe roll 3 was fixed on a jig 9 disposed on a chuck base at a fixed lateral stationary side of the tensile tester (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>). The end of the sample 1 (the end to which the alligator clip 4 had been attached) was gripped by a chuck 10 at a load cell side to stretch the sample 1 at a tensile speed of 200 mm/minute. When the sample 1 was torn (separated) at the cut 8, the measured value (tensile strength) was regarded as the slip stress at curved surfaces in contact. Incidentally, when the sample 1 was broken before torn at the cut 8 because of the slip stress at curved surfaces in contact which was strong enough to surpass the strength at break, the sample 1 was evaluated as "broken".</p><heading id="h0023">(9) Recovery after 50% elongation</heading><p id="p0096" num="0096">In accordance with JIS L1096 "Testing method for woven fabrics", the recovery after 50% elongation was measured.

The area in which the fibers were observed was equally divided in a direction perpendicular to the thickness direction into three areas (a surface layer, an inside layer, and a backside layer). The measuring area was defined as an area which was in almost middle of each layer and had a length of not less than 2 mm in the length direction and a width adjusted to allow the area to contain<!-- EPO <DP n="59"> --> not less than 500 of the measurable fiber pieces. In each measuring area, the distance between the ends (the shortest distance) of each fiber was measured. In addition, the fiber length (the fiber length on the photograph) of the same fiber was measured. That is, in case of an objective fiber having an end protruding from the inside of the nonwoven fabric, the end was simply regarded as an end required to measure the distance between the ends. In case of an objective fiber having an end hiding in the nonwoven fabric, the boundary from which the fiber was visible (the end of the fiber on the photograph) was regarded as an end required to measure the distance between the ends. Providing that among the fibers photographed, a fiber image which did not have a distance between the ends of the not less than 100 µm continuously was not included in the measuring objects. The curved ratio of fiber (L2/L1) [the fiber length (L2) relative to the distance between the ends (L1)] was calculated. Incidentally, the average curved ratio of fiber was calculated for each of the three areas (the surface layer, the inside layer, and the backside layer) obtained by dividing the cross section equally in a direction perpendicular to the thickness direction. In addition, the uniformity of the curved ratio of fiber in the thickness direction was calculated from the proportion of the maximum and minimum curved ratios of fiber of each layer.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of the manner of measuring the distance between the ends of the fiber<!-- EPO <DP n="60"> --> photographed (or the fiber on the photograph). <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4(a)</figref> illustrates a fiber having an end protruding from of the inside of the nonwoven fabric and another end hiding in the nonwoven fabric.

The number of the crimped fiber having a loop (the fiber which was helically crimped and had a number of at least one turn) or the number of the coil-like crimped fibers forming the nonwoven fabric surface was counted per 1 cm<sup>2</sup> in the nonwoven fabric<!-- EPO <DP n="61"> --> surface on the photograph. That is, only a fiber easily recognized as a mono-fiber forming a smooth loop was counted as the crimped fiber having a loop.

The conjugated fiber comprised a polyethylene terephthalate resin (A component) having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.65 and a modified polyethylene terephthalate resin (B component). The B component had been obtained by copolymerizing a polyethylene terephthalate resin the same as the A component with 20 mol% of isophthalic acid and 5 mol% of diethylene glycol.

Incidentally, a pair of belt conveyors used for overfeeding the web comprised a first belt conveyor and a second belt conveyor which was the same as the first one and disposed above the first one. The first and second belt conveyors revolved at the same speed rate in the same direction, and the clearance therebetween was adjustable arbitrarily.</p><p id="p0105" num="0105">Then the card web was introduced to a water vapor spray apparatus disposed behind the belt conveyor. The card web was subjected to a water vapor treatment by spraying the card web perpendicularly with a water vapor ejected at a pressure of 0.4 MPa from the water vapor spray apparatus.

The water vapor spray apparatus, which was disposed behind the first conveyor, was equipped with a nozzle to eject a water<!-- EPO <DP n="63"> --> vapor toward the web through the conveyor belt, and a suction apparatus was disposed behind the second conveyor. However, the suction apparatus was not actuated.

Then the resulting web was subjected to a heat treatment in a hot air dryer having a temperature of 130°C to develop the crimps of the fibers of the web. The obtained nonwoven fabric had stretchability. However, the nonwoven fabric evidently had a low recovery stress. The nonwoven fabric was slit in a width of 5 cm in the length direction.

As in Example 1, the resulting web was overfed into a water vapor spray apparatus disposed behind the belt conveyor, paying attention not to inhibit the compression of the web. The web was then subjected to a water vapor treatment by spraying the card web with a water vapor ejected at a pressure of 0.4 MPa from the water vapor spray apparatus perpendicular to the web. In the water vapor treatment, the coil-like crimps of the potential crimping fibers were developed and the<!-- EPO <DP n="75"> --> fibers were simultaneously entangled with each other, and a nonwoven fabric was obtained. Incidentally, the conditions of the water vapor spray nozzle, the processing speed, and the distance between the nozzle and the conveyor belt equipped with the suction apparatus or box were the same as in Example 1. The nonwoven fabric was slit in a width of 5 cm in the length direction. The resulting nonwoven fabric was rolled up to produce a stretchable and self-fastenable bandage of the present invention. After wrapping the obtained bandage around a finger about three times, the bandage was strongly stretched by hand at the place to be torn.

Incidentally, the conjugated fiber comprised a polyethylene terephthalate resin having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.65 (A component) and a modified polyethylene terephthalate resin (B component).

The resulting nonwoven fabric was rolled up to produce a bandage.

However, the observation also revealed an insufficient degree of crimping of the fiber and a large diameter of the crimps. The results of the evaluation of the obtained nonwoven fabric are shown in Tables 1 to 3.</p><heading id="h0039">Reference example</heading><p id="p0133" num="0133">Using a commercially available self-adhesive bandage (manufactured by Johnson &amp; Johnson, "BAND-AID (registered trademark) Koredake kantan houtai (stretch type) 5 cm-width"), the stretchability and fastenability, which is achieved by virtue of adhesive agent, were determined by the same manner as in the present invention. The bandage had an uneven surface which provided stretchability, and the surface was coated with an adhesive agent comprising a non-natural rubber component in order to provide self-adhesiveness. Incidentally, the measuring samples of the bandage had the length direction corresponding to the machine direction (MD) of the bandage. The results are shown in Table 1. The results of the measurements show that the bandage had a high recovery after<!-- EPO <DP n="78"> --> 50% elongation, which was 99%, and a high slip stress at curved surfaces in contact, which was evaluated as "broken". However, in a practical use it required a lot of effort to tear the bandage by stretching at the place to be torn after wrapping the bandage around a finger. In addition, since the surface of the bandage was coated with the adhesive agent, a dust or dirt was adhered on or attached to the surface of the bandage during its use.<!-- EPO <DP n="79"> --></p><p id="p0134" num="0134">[Table 1]

The results of Tables 1 to 3 show that the stretchable and self-fastenable bandage of the present invention has a self-fastenability similar to the self-adhesiveness which a conventional bandage using an adhesive agent achieves, in addition to an excellent stretchability and tearability by hand.</p><heading id="h0040">Comparative Example 5</heading><p id="p0137" num="0137">The card web used in Example 1 was subjected to a heat treatment at 130°C for 3 minutes in a hot air dryer to develop the coil-like crimps of the fibers. The observation of the surface of the obtained nonwoven fabric having a crimp developed by the above-mentioned manner revealed an irregular texture formed by the high-density portions and low-density portions of the fibers in an islands-in-sea form. Incidentally, the irregular texture differed from the density difference formed by using the porous plate drum in Example. The high-density portions or the low-density portions had a diameter of about 10 mm φ and irregularly distributed in the nonwoven fabric, whereby the nonwoven fabric had an extremely poor appearance. When the nonwoven fabric was strongly stretched at the place to be torn after the nonwoven fabric was wrapped around a finger about three times as in Example 1, the nonwoven fabric was torn without showing a slight elongation. The nonwoven fabric was fastened by overlapping the end produced by tearing the nonwoven fabric in place on the underlying nonwoven fabric. However, since<!-- EPO <DP n="83"> --> the nonwoven fabric was loosely fastened and not so tight fitting, when the finger was slowly moved, not only the rolled nonwoven fabric was almost slipped from the finger, but also the end fastened on the underlying nonwoven fabric became peeled.</p><p id="p0138" num="0138">Presumably, the reason for such a phenomenon is as follows: the crimp development of the fibers due to the use of the hot air having a low thermal conductivity and an ability of passing through the web freely allows the fibers aggregated before the water vapor treatment to increase the entanglement of the fiber. At such a fiber entanglement a pulling force is generated, so that the fibers less aggregated before the water vapor treatment is pulled in directions opposite to each other.</p><p id="p0139" num="0139">On the other hand, as in Examples, the high-temperature water vapor was used to fix the fibers of the nonwoven fabric, being restrained, and the nonwoven fabric contracted. Moreover, presumably, owing to the higher thermal conductivity of the high-temperature water vapor than that of the hot air, the construction of the nonwoven fabric was sufficiently developed, with fixing the fibers , which led to amore uniform construction compared with the construction by the hot air. Such a construction inhibits the generation of an evidently irregular texture caused by the use of the hot air.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980490" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="87"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Ein Vliesstoff, der eine konjungierte Faser umfasst, die mehrere Harze umfasst, die sich in ihrer thermischen Schrumpfung unterscheiden und die eine Struktur mit Phasentrennung aufweisen, wobei die konjugierten Fasern in einer Richtung in etwa parallel zu einer Oberflächenrichtung des Vliesstoffs angeordnet sind und gekräuselt sind und die konjugierten Fasern eine mittlere Faserlänge von 10 bis 100 mm aufweisen und einen mittleren Krümmungsradius der Faserkräuselung von 20 bis 200 µm aufweisen und die Kräuselungen in etwa gleichmäßig in einer Dickenrichtung des Vliesstoffs verteilt sind, wobei der Vliesstoff ein Krümmungsverhältnis der Faser von nicht weniger als 1,3 in jedem der drei Bereiche aufweist und das Verhältnis des minimalen Krümmungsverhältnisses der Faser zum maximalen Krümmungsverhältnis der Faser nicht weniger als 75% in jedem der drei Bereiche beträgt, mit der Maßgabe, dass der Vliesstoff entlang der Dickenrichtung geschnitten wird und der Querschnitt in eine Richtung im rechten Winkel zur Dickenrichtung gleichmäßig in drei Teile geteilt wird.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0002" num="0002"><claim-text>Ein Vliesstoff gemäß Anspruch 1, wobei die mehreren Harze ein Harz umfassen, das unter Feuchtigkeit kein thermischer Klebstoff ist, welches einen Erweichungspunkt oder Schmelzpunkt von nicht weniger als 100 °C aufweist und mindestens einen Teil einer Oberfläche der konjugierten Faser bildet.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0003" num="0003"><claim-text>Ein Vliesstoff gemäß Anspruch 1 oder 2, welcher im Wesentlichen frei von einem Klebemittel ist, wobei jede Faser im Wesentlichen nicht mit einer weiteren schmelzverbunden ist.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0004" num="0004"><claim-text>Ein Vliesstoff gemäß einem der Ansprüche 1 bis 3, wobei die konjugierte Faser ein Harz vom Polyalkylen-Arylat-Typ und ein modifiziertes Harz vom Polyalkylen-Arylat-Typ umfasst und wobei die konjugierte Faser eine Seite-an-Seite-Form oder eine exzentrische<!-- EPO <DP n="88"> --> Kern-Hüllen-Form aufweist.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0005" num="0005"><claim-text>Ein Vliesstoff gemäß einem der Ansprüche 1 bis 4, wobei der Anteil der konjugierten Faser nicht weniger als 80 Masse-% beträgt.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0006" num="0006"><claim-text>Ein Vliesstoff gemäß einem der Ansprüche 1 bis 5, der mehrere Bereiche mit niedriger Dichte und mehrere Bereiche mit hoher Dichte in einer Oberflächenrichtung aufweist, wobei der Bereich mit niedriger Dichte und der Bereich mit hoher Dichte abwechselnd in einem periodischen Muster gebildet sind.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0007" num="0007"><claim-text>Ein Vliesstoff gemäß einem der Ansprüche 1 bis 6, der eine Bruchfestigkeit von 5 bis 30 N/50 mm, eine Bruchdehnung von nicht weniger als 50%, eine Erholung nach 50% Dehnung von nicht weniger als 80% und eine Gleitfähigkeit (engl.
