In such a type of shading assembly the two opposite opening sides of the opening are provided with guides embodied to guide longitudinal side edges of the shading member.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It is an object of the present invention to provide an alternative shading assembly.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Thus, in accordance with the present invention a shading assembly is presented which is characterized in that the flexible shading member is defined by two shading member parts which each have a first edge connected to one of said opposite opening sides and an opposite second edge, wherein said second edges of both shading member parts together define an elongate releasable connection device of the type further comprising a movable operating member which upon movement along said second edges connects or disconnects said second edges, wherein said opposite opening sides are provided with storage devices extending along the entire length of said opening sides for progressively receiving and housing the shading member parts when the operating member moves in a direction for disconnecting said second edges, and for progressively dispensing the shading member parts when the operating member moves in a direction for connecting said second edges, and wherein each storage device is<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> provided with a pressure member movable along said storage device for progressively pressing a respective one of the shading member parts into said storage device when the operating member moves in a direction for disconnecting said second edges, which pressure members are connected to the operating member in a manner to be moved thereby.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The shading assembly according to the present invention does not comprise a winding tube. The shading member now is a two-part shading member with two shading member parts which will be detached from each other at the second edges and which will move apart and (by virtue of the pressure members) will move into the respective storage devices when the shading member (by an appropriate movement of the operating member in a first direction) is moved towards the position freeing the opening, and which at least, partly will move out of said storage devices towards each other to be connected again at said second edges when the shading member (by an appropriate opposite movement of the operating member) is moved towards the position covering the opening.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is noted that the opening can have a shape with parallel opening sides (for example a rectangular shape) but it is conceivable too that the opening is differently shaped (e.g. circular, oval or triangular).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In one embodiment of the shading assembly according to the present invention the elongate releasable connection device is of the zipper type and the movable operating member defines a zipper slider. As an alternative the elongate releasable connection device is of the bag slide closure type and the movable operating member defines a bag slide closure slider. It should be noted however that it is conceivable too to provide other types of elongate releasable connection devices to be implemented in the present invention.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In another embodiment each pressure member is connected to the operating member by a rod capable of transmitting<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> tensile forces and pressure forces, wherein each rod has two opposite ends pivotably connected to the operating member and respective pressure member, respectively, and wherein each rod has a variable length. Such a rod (or similar elongate member) will cause the pressure member to move when the operating member is operated, such that the pressure member then automatically will operate according to its envisaged function (specifically progressively pushing the shading member parts into the respective storage devices) without the need for separate driving means. The rod (and thus the pressure members and operating member relative to each other) are able to assume a position which is a-vourable for opening or closing the shading member. The variable length also will be of advantage when the opening does not have parallel opening sides.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is possible that at least one of the rod, pressure member and operating member comprises limiting means for limiting the pivot motion of the rods between a straight position in which both rods extend substantially perpendicularly to the direction of movement of the operating member and in which both pressure members and operating member substantially are positioned in line with each other, and an inclined position in which the rods are inclined such that, as seen in a direction in which the operating member will move for disconnecting said second edges of the shading member parts, the operating member is positioned ahead of the pressure members. The so-called straight position will be reached when the operating member is moved to the position in which the shading member is completely covering the opening; in this position the rods assume a position with minimal length. The inclined position occurs at least when the operating member moves in the opposite direction; the rods then will assume a position with maximum length.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In one embodiment each rod comprises at least two rod parts received the one in the other in a telescoping<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> manner for varying its length. But also other means are conceivable for varying the length of the rods (such as for example when the rods are articulated).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is possible too that the pressure members and the operating member are interconnected in a fixed position relative to each other.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In another embodiment of the shading assembly according to the present invention it is further provided with covering members for at least partially covering the pressure members and operating member in the position of the flexible shading member completely covering the opening and in the position of the flexible shading member freeing said opening. Such covering members also will cover the sections of the shading member parts adjacent the pressure members and operating member, thus offering the assembly a neat appearance.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">It is possible, then, that the covering members comprise two plate shaped, for example rectangular or triangular, members.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In a further embodiment one of said plate shaped members which is intended to cover the pressure members and operating member in the position of the flexible shading member completely covering the opening has a fixed position, whereas the other plate shaped member moves along with the pressure members and operating member. Both plate shaped members may have a complementary shape such that both plate shaped members may be positioned close to each other in the open position of the shading assembly.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">When, in accordance with yet another embodiment of the shading assembly according to the present invention, the storage devices and pressure members are provided with cooperating guide projections and recesses for defining the relative movement between a storage device and respective pressure member, the relative position between those parts<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> which is required for pushing the shading member parts into the storage devices will be maintained automatically.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Further it is possible that each storage device comprises a profiled member with a substantially U-shaped cross section defined by two legs connected by a bottom, wherein said two legs define an open side facing the opposite storage device, and wherein flexible retention means are provided for closing said open side. The flexible retention means allow the introduction of the shading member parts into and the removal from the cavity defined within the profiled members, while still being able to maintain the shading member parts within said cavity without the need for additional means.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">It is possible that the flexible retention means comprise an array of flexible brush hairs extending from at least one leg towards the opposite leg along substantially the entire length of the profiled member, but as an alternative the flexible retention means may comprise a flexible lip extending from at least one leg towards the opposite leg along substantially the entire length of the profiled member.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In yet another embodiment the flexible retention means comprise a flexible strip which has a first end connected to a pressure member for movement along therewith. When the pressure member moves for pushing a shading member part into a profiled member, the flexible strip automatically follows the pressure member and closes the open side of the profiled member behind the pressure member for keeping the shading member part in the profiled member.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">It is possible that the flexible strip has an opposite second end which is windable onto or from a winding mechanism or that the flexible strip has an opposite second end which is guided around a reversal roller and back into the profiled member (for example into a channel defined therein below/adjacent the bottom).<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">When, indeed, such a profiled member is provided as storage device the first edge of a shading member part could be connected to the bottom of said respective profiled member.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">It is to be expected that in most embodiments of the shading assembly according to the present invention the elongate releasable connection device defined by said second edges of the shading member parts will extend along a straight line. As a result a symmetrical structure is obtained which also from an aesthetical point of view may be an advantage. It should be noted, however, that the above does not preclude the possibility that the elongate releasable connection device defined by said second edges of the shading member parts will extend along a curved line.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In a basic embodiment of the shading assembly according to the present invention the operating member and pressure members are devised to be moved manually. However, in a more sophisticated embodiment it is possible too that the shading assembly further comprises a drive member for moving the operating member and pressure members.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">For example the drive member may engage the operating member and/or pressure member and may comprise one of a drive cable driven by a motor (e.g. an electric motor), a cylinder-piston assembly, a telescopic arm and a linkage arrangement.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In a specific embodiment of the shading assembly according to the present invention the structure is an open roof structure for a vehicle, the opening is a roof opening provided in a stationary roof part of said vehicle and the flexible shading member is a flexible sun screen.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In a second aspect the present invention relates to an open roof construction for a vehicle, comprising a roof opening in a stationary roof part of said vehicle and a sun screen assembly cooperating with said roof opening,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> which sun screen assembly comprises a shading assembly according to the present invention.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Hereinafter the invention will be elucidated while referring to the drawings, in which

The roof opening 3 may be closed and opened by a movable panel 4, as is known per se. In the illustrated embodiment the roof opening 3 is rectangular and comprises two opposite parallel longitudinal side edges 5. It should be noted however that the roof opening may have other shapes too, such as for example oval, circular or triangular.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A sun screen assembly cooperating with said roof opening 3 and comprising a shading assembly according to the present invention has not been illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> but will be elucidated while referring to the remaining figures.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Thus <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref> schematically and in a perspective view illustrates part of a shading assembly for shading the substantially rectangular roof opening 3. Generally such a shading assembly will be located at a level below the movable panel 4 such as not to interfere with the movement thereof and will comprise two opposite parallel opening sides 6 which may be similar to, be part of or be positioned close to the side edges 5 of the roof opening 3. The shading assembly comprises a flexible shading member (or flexible sun screen) which is movable between a position completely covering said opening 3 and a position freeing said opening 3. The flexible shading member may comprise different kinds of cloth (for example transparent or not, different colours, thick or thin, etcetera)</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The flexible shading member is defined by two shading member parts 7 and 8 which each have a first edge 9 (best seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 3</figref>) connected to one of said opposite parallel opening sides and an opposite second edge 10, wherein said second edges 10 of both shading member parts 7,8 together define an elongate releasable connection device 11 of the type further comprising a movable operating member 12 which upon movement along said second edges 10 connects or disconnects said second edges.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The elongate releasable connection device 11 may be of the zipper type in which the movable operating member 12 defines a zipper slider. As an alternative the elongate releasable connection device 11 may be of the bag slide closure type in which the movable operating member 12 defines a bag slide closure slider. It is noted, however, that also other continuous closures of a similar type may be applied.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref> the elongate releasable connection device 11 defined by said second edges 10 of the shading member parts 7,8 extends along a straight line and centrally in parallel to said opposite opening sides 6 of the opening 3. As an alternative, however, it also could extend along a curved line, as indicated schematically by the chain line 24 and/or not centrally.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The operating member 12 may be devised to be moved manually as is commonly known for a zipper slider. However, it is possible too that a drive member is provided for moving the operating member 12, such as a drive cable 25 driven by a motor, e.g. an electric motor 26.

Said pressure members 14 are connected to the operating member 12 as to be moved thereby in a manner to be described later. Already here it is emphasized, however, that the phrase "to be moved thereby" does not necessarily mean that the pressure member<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> 14 and operating member 12 always move synchronously.

As will appear below, such a variation in length will occur automatically under influence of operating forces acting on each rod.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>, which is a view according to TV in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 3</figref>, illustrates that the pressure member 14 comprises limiting means or stops 30,31 for limiting the pivot motion of the rod 27 between a straight position (as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 4</figref> in dotted lines by rod part 29' and as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 5a</figref>) in which both rods 27 extend substantially perpendicularly to the opposite parallel opening sides 6 (or profiled members 13) of the opening 3 and in which both pressure members 14 and operating member 12 substantially are positioned in line with each other, and an inclined position (as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 4</figref> in full lines by rod part 29 and as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">figures 5b-d</figref>) in which the rods 27 are inclined such that, as seen in a direction in which the operating member 12 will move for disconnecting said second edges 10 of the shading member parts 7,8, the operating member 12 is positioned ahead of the pressure members 14. In both positions one of the stops 30,31 engages the rod part 29, but it will be clear that other equivalent limiting means may be applied. Thus it is conceivable too that the inclined position will be defined by the maximum amount in which the rods 27 are allowed to increase their length.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The operation of the shading assembly will be described while referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 5.

During the first stage of this movement of the operating member 12 the pressure members 14 remain in their initial position while the rods 27 pivot and are increased in length. During this first stage parts of the second edges 10' are disconnected from each other to make the shading member parts 7,8 less taut there and to offer these the opportunity to be pushed into the profiled members 13 when the pressure members 14 will start to move along with the operating member 12. The pressure members 14 will start to move when the rods 27 have reached the inclined position with maximum inclination (pivot angle).</p><p id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5c</figref> shows a position in which the operating member 12 and pressure members 14 have moved a certain distance for partly opening the shading assembly.

It should be noted that the leading edge of the pressure members 14 could be shaped for engaging and guiding the shading member parts 7,8 in a most effective manner.
