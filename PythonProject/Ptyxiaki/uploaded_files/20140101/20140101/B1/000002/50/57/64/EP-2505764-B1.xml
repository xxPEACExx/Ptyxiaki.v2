load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><u>Field of the invention</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a downhole driving unit for insertion into a well, comprising a driving unit housing, and a wheel assembly comprising a stationary part and a rotational part, the stationary part being connected with the driving unit housing and being rotatably connected with the rotational part. The present invention also relates to a downhole system comprising the driving unit and an operational tool.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Background art</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">When operating in a downhole well, tools used for the operation may not be submergible themselves. Some tools are positioned at the front of coiled tubing and are driven forward by pushing the tubing further down the well. Other tools are lowered into the well by means of a wireline, and gravity will thus ensure that the tool submerges. Hence, not all tools are capable of moving in the well and thus need to be moved forward in the well by an additional tool. In particular, this is the case in the horizontal part of the well, as gravity cannot aid in the movement.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Several tools have been developed for this purpose, <i>inter alia</i> one running on a caterpillar track. However, this tool has the disadvantage that it cannot always hold its footing in the more uneven parts of the well, and in some cases, it is impossible for such a tool to pass a place where two well pipes meet but do not abut, hence leaving a gap. Another tool has wheels driven by means of a roller<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> chain, such as the downhole tractor disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO0046481A"><text>WO 0046481</text></patcit>, and all driven by one motor. However, if the motor is unable to drive all wheels, the tool is unable to drive itself any further. This may be the case if the well has an obstacle and one wheel is unable to be driven across the obstacle.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Well tools often utilise hydraulics for performing operations or providing propulsion in transportation tools, also denoted as well tractors. Supplying pressurised hydraulic fluid to various parts of a downhole tool requires a reliable and robust hydraulic system, as tools in the well cannot be accessed easily.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Specially the supply of hydraulic fluid into moving parts of a downhole tool is challenging. Furthermore, preventing dirty well fluid from entering hydraulic movable parts can be challenging.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary of the invention</u></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to wholly or partly overcome the above disadvantages and drawbacks of the prior art. More specifically, it is an object to provide an improved downhole tool for moving an operational tool forward in all parts of a well and also in wells having a small inner diameter, such as 54 mm (2 1/8 inches) while preventing well fluid from entering hydraulic movable parts.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The above objects, together with numerous other objects, advantages, and features, which will become evident from the below description, are accomplished by a solution in accordance with the present invention by a downhole driving unit for insertion into a well, comprising:

end.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Moreover, the stationary part may be a cam ring of the hydraulic motor.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The wheel assembly may further comprise a sealing member arranged between the stationary part and the rotational part or between a first part of the rotational part and a second part of the rotational part.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In addition, the sealing member may be a sealing ring, such as an O-ring, a sealing layer, or a sealing disc.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Said sealing layer or sealing disc may cover most of the closing member.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In another embodiment, the wheel assembly may be suspended in the driving unit housing.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Furthermore, the spring member may be a circlip or a snap ring.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Additionally, the spring member may be ring-shaped and may have a gap so that when the ring is inserted, the ring can be squeezed together to obtain a smaller diameter and then spring back to its original diameter when released again.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Moreover, the rotational part may comprise a wheel ring, and a bearing may be arranged between the cam ring and the wheel ring.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In one embodiment, the hydraulic motor may be a radial piston motor.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The downhole driving unit according to the invention may further comprise an arm assembly movable between a projected position and a projected position in relation to the driving unit housing, and the arm assembly may be connected with or form part of the stationary part of the wheel assembly.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Furthermore, the downhole driving unit according to the invention may comprise an arm activation assembly arranged in the driving unit housing for moving the arm assembly between the retracted position and the projected position.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Also, the wheel assembly may further comprise a planetary gearing system.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In addition, the planetary gearing system may comprise planet gears engaging the sun gear and the ring gear, the planet gears being interconnected by means of a carrier member.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Moreover, the hydraulic motor may have a rotatable section which is connected with a sun gear of the planetary gearing system.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Said planetary gearing system may be comprised in the hydraulic motor housing.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Further, the planetary gearing system may comprise a ring gear constituted by the wheel ring or the closing member.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Also, the arm assembly may comprise a wheel arm, and the wheel arm may comprise fluid channels for providing fluid to and from the hydraulic motor through the stationary part.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In one embodiment, the rotatable section may be a hydraulic cylinder block.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Said hydraulic motor may comprise pistons movable within cylinders in the hydraulic cylinder block.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Also, the hydraulic cylinder block may comprise cylinders in which a piston moves in each of the cylinders, the piston comprising a piston body and a ball bearing suspended in a piston body so that the ball bearing abuts the cam ring.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Additionally, the hydraulic cylinder block may comprise fluid channels arranged in alignment with the fluid channels in the wheel arm so that fluid is led from the wheel arm to cylinders in the hydraulic cylinder block.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The downhole driving unit according to the invention may further comprise a pump for providing fluid to the hydraulic motor.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The present invention further relates to a downhole system comprising the driving unit according to the invention and an operational tool connected with the driving unit for being moved forward in a well or borehole.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In one embodiment, the operational tool may be a stroker tool, a key tool, a milling tool, a drilling tool, a logging tool, etc.</p><p

The hydraulic motor 23 has a hydraulic motor housing 93 and a rotatable section 84 connected with the rotational part 92 for rotating part of the wheel assembly 90 and thus drive the wheel ring 99 and the driving unit 11 forward in the well. As shown, the stationary part 91 and the rotational part 92 constitute the hydraulic motor housing 93, and the wheel assembly 90 comprises a spring member 113 connecting the stationary part 91 with the rotational part 92 in order to assemble the hydraulic motor housing 93 and thus the wheel assembly 90. The spring member 113 is a snap ring or a circlip being a ring-shaped member having a gap so that when the ring is inserted, the ring can be squeezed together to obtain a smaller outer diameter and then spring back to its original diameter when released again in a groove with which it is to engage.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In <figref idrefs="f0005">Figs. 5A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">5B</figref>, the stationary part 91 is a cam ring 24 of the hydraulic motor 23, and the wheel ring 99 is closed from one end and open at the other end to engage the outer circumference of the cam ring 24. The wheel ring 99 has a groove 114 in which the snap ring 113 is inserted to engage and fasten a projecting flange 120 of the cam ring 24 to the wheel ring 99. In a second groove 121 in the wheel ring 99, a sealing member 27 is arranged so as to seal between<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the cam ring 24 and the wheel ring 99 when squeezed together by the snap ring 113.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">By having a snap ring 113 for connecting the wheel ring 99 and the cam ring 24, the hydraulic motor housing 93 is assembled in a simple manner without using e.g. a screw connection which may become leaky when the wheel is used, and dirty well fluid can thus enter the motor housing, and small fragments in the well fluid may ruin the function of the motor and thus the rotation of the wheel. Furthermore, the seal between the wheel ring 99 and the cam ring 24 can be a face seal, and the sealing member can be a conventional O-ring which is easily replaced.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The stationary part 91 and the rotational part 92 constitute the hydraulic motor housing 93 in which the rotatable section 84 of the hydraulic motor 23 rotates in relation to the cam ring 24 driving the rotational part 92 of the wheel assembly 90. Thus, the cam ring 24 is stationary, and a ball bearing 36 is arranged on an outside of the cam ring 24 between the cam ring 24 and the wheel ring 99 in order to provide a simple and substantially friction-free transition between the rotatable wheel ring and the stationary cam ring. By arranging the transition between the rotational part 92 and the stationary part 91 of the wheel assembly 90 between the cam ring 24 and the wheel ring 99, a more friction-free transition is provided in that a ball bearing 36 can be arranged therebetween. Furthermore, a more fluid-tight hydraulic motor housing is provided.

The driving unit 11 is most often used for moving an operational tool into a specific position in the well or just forward in the well while an operation is performed, such as moving a logging tool forward while logging fluid and formation data in order to optimise the production of oil fluid from the well. Another operational tool could also be a stroker tool providing an axial force in one or more strokes, a key tool opening or closing valves in the well, positioning tools such as a casing collar locator (CCL), a milling tool or drilling tool, etc. The operational tool is connected through a connector 14.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047"><figref idrefs="f0008">Figs. 7A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">7B</figref> show a cross-sectional view of the wheel assembly in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>.

In this way, well fluid surrounding the driving unit is kept out of the hydraulic motor housing 93. The hydraulic motor 23 is thus comprised in the same housing as the wheel assembly 90 so that the motor housing and the wheel housing are the same housing and thus the same fluid chamber. The solution of the present invention is thus very compact in that the arm assembly 60 with the wheel assembly 90, when retracted in the driving unit housing 51, only takes up little space, so that the diameter of the driving unit 11 and thus of the downhole tool is not substantially increased when there are wheels at the end of the arms 60 of the driving unit 11.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> The closing member 26 is directly connected with the hydraulic cylinder block for transmitting the rotational force of the hydraulic motor 23 to the wheel ring 99 in order to move the driving unit 11 forward in the well.
