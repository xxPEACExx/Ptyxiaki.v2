Further, the terms "outboard" and "inboard" are used toward the outboard tread edge and inboard tread edge, respectively, to refer relative positions or directions with respect to the tire axial direction.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Thus, the above-mentioned crown circumferential grooves 3 are the outboard crown circumferential groove 3A and the inboard crown circumferential groove 3B.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">By the asymmetrical groove arrangement, the outboard crown circumferential groove 3A is disposed closer to the tire equator C than the inboard crown circumferential groove 3B, and the groove width W1a of the outboard crown circumferential groove 3A is set to be larger than the groove width W1b of the inboard crown circumferential groove 3B in order to effectively improve the drainage and snow performance during straight running and cornering.<br/>

The indentations 12A and 12B are configured such that the circumferential length L6 is gradually decreased from the respective edges 5o and 5i toward the widthwise center of the center land zone 5 so that the indentation has a substantially trapezoidal shape in its top view. Preferably, the maximum circumferential length L6a of the indentation is set in a range of from 6 to 10 mm and the depth thereof is set in a range of from 6 to 9 mm. Therefore, the outboard indentations 12A and inboard indentations 12B can be engaged with the snow packed thereinto and it is possible to improve the snow performance by utilizing the shearing force of the packed snow. By the stagger arrangement of the outboard and inboard indentations 12A and 12B, the generation of the shearing force becomes smooth in the tire circumferential direction.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The center sipes 13 are inclined to the same direction at an angle α5a of from 50 to 80 degrees with respect to the tire circumferential direction.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The center sipes 13 are the outboard sipes 13A and the inboard sipes 13B.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The outboard sipes 13A are disposed on the outboard tread edge side of the center sub groove 11 and connected to inner ends of the outboard indentations 12A. The inboard sipes 13B are disposed on the inboard tread edge side of the center sub groove 11 and connected to inner ends of the inboard<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> indentations 12B. Accompanying the stagger arrangement of the outboard and inboard indentations 12A and 12B, the phase of the outboard sipes 13A is circumferentially sifted from that of the inboard sipes 13B. The outboard and inboard sipes 13A and 13B increase edges in the center land zone 5, and improve the wet performance and the ice performance such as traction. Further, the center land zone 5 is not crossed by lateral grooves wider than the sipes in order to maintain rigidity.
