It is caused by a recessive genetic disorder (chromosome 1 q21-q31) resulting in deficiency of glucocerebrosidase, also known as glucosylceramidase, which is a membrane-bound lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the glycosphingolipid glucocerebroside (glucosylceramide, GlcCer) to glucose and ceramide. Gaucher disease is caused by point mutations in the hGCD (human glucocerebrosidase) gene (GBA), which result in accumulation of GlcCer in the lysosomes of macrophages. The characteristic storage cells, called Gaucher cells, are found in liver, spleen and bone marrow. The associated clinical symptoms include severe hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia and skeletal deterioration.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The gene encoding human GCD was first sequenced in 1985 (6) The protein consists of 497 amino acids derived from a 536-mer pro-peptide. The mature hGCD contains five N-glycosylation amino acid consensus sequences (Asn-X-Ser/Thr). Four of these sites are normally glycosylated. Glycosylation of the first site is essential for the production of active protein. Both high-mannose and complex oligosaccharide chains have been identified (7) hGCD from placenta contains 7% carbohydrate, 20% of which is of the high-mannose type (8). Biochemical and site-directed mutagenesis studies have provided an initial map of regions and residues important to folding, activator interaction, and active site location (9).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Treatment of placental hGCD with neuraminidase (yielding an asialo enzyme) results in increased clearance and uptake rates by rat liver cells with a concomitant increase in hepatic enzymatic activity (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Furbish et al., 1981, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 673:425-434</text></nplcit>). This glycan-modified placental hGC is currently used as a therapeutic agent in the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> treatment of Gaucher's disease. Biochemical and site-directed mutagenesis studies have provided an initial map of regions and residues important to folding, activator interaction, and active site location [<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Grace et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269:2283-2291 (1994</text></nplcit>)].</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">There are three different types of Gaucher disease, each determined by the level of hGC activity. The major cells affected by the disease are the macrophages, which are highly enlarged due to GlcCer accumulation, and are thus referred to as "Gaucher cells".</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The identification of a defect in GCD as the primary cause of Gaucher's disease led to the development of enzyme replacement therapy as a therapeutic strategy for this disorder.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">De Duve first suggested that replacement of the missing lysosomal enzyme with exogenous biologically active enzyme might be a viable approach to treatment of lysosomal storage diseases [<nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Fed Proc. 23:1045 (1964</text></nplcit>)].</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Since that time, various studies have suggested that enzyme replacement therapy may be beneficial for treating various lysosomal storage diseases. The best success has been shown with individuals with type I Gaucher disease, who were treated with exogenous enzyme (β-glucocerebrosidase), prepared from placenta (Ceredase<sup>™</sup>) or, more recently, recombinantly (Cerezyme<sup>™</sup>).</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Unmodified glucocerebrosidase derived from natural sources is a glycoprotein with four carbohydrate chains. This protein does not target the phagocytic cells in the body and is therefore of limited therapeutic value. In developing the current therapy for Gaucher's disease, the terminal sugars on the carbohydrate chains of glucocerebrosidase are sequentially removed by treatment with three different glycosidases. This glycosidase treatment results in a glycoprotein whose terminal sugars consist of mannose residues. Since phagocytes have mannose receptors that recognize glycoproteins and glycopeptides with oligosaccharide chains that terminate in mannose residues, the carbohydrate remodeling of glucocerebrosidase has improved the targeting of the enzyme to these cells [<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>Furbish et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta 673:425, (1981</text></nplcit>)].</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As indicated herein, glycosylation plays a crucial role in hGCD activity, therefore deglycosylation of hGCD expressed in cell lines using either tunicamycin (<i>Sf9</i> cells) or point mutations abolishing all glycosylation sites (both <i>Sf9</i> and COS-1 cells), results in complete loss of enzymatic activity. In addition, hGCD expressed in <i>E. coli</i> was found to be inactive. Further research indicated the significance of the various glycosylation sites<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> for protein activity. In addition to the role of glycosylation in the actual protein activity, the commercially produced enzyme contains glycan sequence modifications that facilitate specific drug delivery. The glycosylated proteins are remodeled following extraction to include only mannose containing glycan sequences.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The human GCD enzyme contains 4 glycosylation sites and 22 lysines. The recombinantly produced enzyme (Cerezyme<sup>™</sup>) differs from the placental enzyme (Ceredase<sup>™</sup>) in position 495 where an arginine has been substituted with a histidine. Furthermore, the oligosaccharide composition differs between the recombinant and the placental GCD as the former has more fucose and N-acetyl-glucosamine residues while the latter retains one high mannose chain. As mentioned above, both types of GCDs are treated with three different glycosidases (neuraminidase, galactosidase, and P-N acetyl-glucosaminidase) to expose terminal mannoses, which enables targeting of phagocytic cells. A pharmaceutical preparation comprising the recombinantly produced enzyme is described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5549892A"><text>US 5,549,892</text></patcit>. It should be noted that all references mentioned are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">One drawback associated with existing lysosomal enzyme replacement therapy treatment is that the <i>in vivo</i> bioactivity of the enzyme is undesirably low, e.g. because of low uptake, reduced targeting to lysosomes of the specific cells where the substrate is accumulated, and a short functional <i>in vivo</i> half-life in the lysosomes.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Another major drawback of the existing GCD recombinant enzymes is their expense, which can place a heavy economic burden on health care systems. The high cost of these recombinant enzymes results from a complex purification protocol, and the relatively large amounts of the therapeutic required for existing treatments. There is therefore, an urgent need to reduce the cost of GCD so that this life saving therapy can be provided to all who require it more affordably.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Proteins for pharmaceutical use have been traditionally produced in mammalian or bacterial expression systems. In the past decade a new expression system has been developed in plants. This methodology utilizes Agrobacterium, a bacteria capable of inserting single stranded DNA molecules (T-DNA) into the plant genome. Due to the relative simplicity of introducing genes for mass production of proteins and peptides, this methodology is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative protein expression system (1).<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">While post translational modifications do not exist in bacterial expression systems, plant derived expression systems do facilitate these modifications known to be crucial for protein expression and activity. One of the major differences between mammalian and plant protein expression system is the variation of protein sugar side chains, caused by the differences in biosynthetic pathways. Glycosylation was shown to have a profound effect on activity, folding, stability, solubility, susceptibility to proteases, blood clearance rate and antigenic potential of proteins. Hence, any protein production in plants should take into consideration the potential ramifications of plant glycosylation.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Protein glycosylation is divided into two categories: N-linked and O-linked modifications (2). The two types differ in amino acid to which the glycan moiety is attached to - N-linked are attached to Asn residues, while O-linked are attached to Ser or Thr residues. In addition, the glycan sequences of each type bears unique distinguishing features. Of the two types, N-linked glycosylation is the more abundant, and its effect on protein function has been expensively studied. O-linked glycans, on the other hand are relatively scarce, and less information is available regarding their affect on proteins.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">The background art does not teach or suggest a device, system or method for selectively producing glycosylated proteins in plant culture. The background art also does not teach or suggest such a device, system or method for producing high mannose proteins in plant culture. The background art also does not teach or suggest a device, system or method for producing proteins in plant culture through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The background art also does not teach or suggest such a device, system or method for producing proteins in plant culture through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) while bypassing the Golgi body. The background art also does not teach or suggest such a device, system or method for producing proteins in plant culture by using an ER signal to by-pass the Golgi body.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The present invention overcomes these disadvantages of the background art by providing the embodiments as characterized by the claims.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">It should be noted that the term "plant culture" as used herein includes any type of transgenic and/or otherwise genetically engineered plant cell that is grown in culture. The genetic engineering may optionally be permanent or transient. Preferably, the culture features cells that are not assembled to form a complete plant, such that at least one biological structure of a plant is not present. Optionally and preferably, the culture may feature a plurality of different types of plant cells, but preferably the culture features a particular type of plant cell. It should be noted that optionally plant cultures featuring a particular type of plant cell may be originally derived from a plurality of different types of such plant cells.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The plant cells may be grown according to any type of suitable culturing method, including but not limited to, culture on a solid surface (such as a plastic culturing vessel or plate for example) or in suspension.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">More particularly, the invention relates to host cells, particularly transgenic suspended carrot cells, vectors and methods for high yield expression and production of biologically active high mannose human Glucocerebrosidase (GCD) having glucocerebrosidase catalytic activity. The invention further provides for compositions for the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The present invention is also of host cells comprising new vector compositions that allow for efficient production of genes encoding human GCD, having glucocerebrosidase catalytic activity.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The present invention therefore solves a long-felt need for an economically viable technology to produce proteins having particular glycosylation requirements, such as the high mannose glycosylation of lysosomal enzymes such as GCD for example. The present invention is able to solve this long felt need by using plant cell culture.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In order to further explain the present invention, a brief explanation is now provided of the biosynthetic pathway of high-mannose proteins. The basic biosynthesis pathway of high-mannose and complex N-linked glycans is highly conserved among all eukaryotes. Biosynthesis begins in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) with the transfer of the glycan precursor from a dolichol lipid carrier to a specific Asn residue on the protein by the oligosaccharyl transferase. The precursor is subsequently modified in the ER by glycosidases I and II and a hypothetical mannosidase to yield the high mannose structures, similar to the process occurring in mammals.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Further modifications of the glycan sequence to complex and hybrid structures occur in the Golgi. Such modifications include removal of one of the four mannose residues by α-mannosidase I, addition of an <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine residue, removal of the two additional mannose residues by α-mannosidase II, addition of <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine and optionally, at this stage, xylose and fucose residues may be added to yield plant specific N-linked glycans. After the transfer of xylose and fucose to the core, complex type N-glycans can be further processed via the addition of terminal fucose and galactose. Further modifications may take place during the glycoprotein transport.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Several approaches are currently used in the background art to control and tailor protein glycosylation in plants, all of which have significant deficiencies, particularly in comparison to the present invention. Gross modifications, such as complete inhibition of glycosylation or the removal of glycosylation sites from the peptide chain is one strategy. However, this approach can result in structural defects. An additional approach involves knock-out and introduction of specific carbohydrate processing enzymes. Again, this approach is difficult and may also have detrimental effects on the plant cells themselves.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The present invention overcomes these deficiencies of the background art approaches by using an ER signal and/or by blocking secretion from the ER to the Golgi body.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As indicated above, proteins transported via the endomembrane system first pass into the endoplasmic reticulum. The necessary transport signal for this step is represented by a signal sequence at the N-terminal end of the molecule, the so-called signal peptide. As<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> soon as this signal peptide has fulfilled its function, which is to insert the precursor protein attached to it into the endoplasmic reticulum, it is split off proteolytically from the precursor protein. By virtue of its specific function, this type of signal peptide sequence has been conserved to a high degree during evolution in all living cells, irrespective of whether they are bacteria, yeasts, fungi, animals or plants.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Many plant proteins, which are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum by virtue of the signal peptide do not reside in the ER, but are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and continue trafficking from the Golgi to the vacuoles.

In the past few years a promising new expression system was found in plants. Due to the relative simplicity of introducing new genes and potential for<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> mass production of proteins and peptides, 'molecular pharming' is becoming increasingly popular as a protein expression system.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">One of the major differences between mammalian and plant protein expression system is the variation of protein glycosylation sequences, caused by the differences in biosynthetic pathways. Glycosylation was shown to have a profound effect on activity, folding, stability, solubility, susceptibility to proteases, blood clearance rate and antigenic potential of proteins. Hence, any protein production in plants should take into consideration the potential ramifications of plant glycosylation.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">Carbohydrate moiety is one of the most common post-translational modifications of proteins. Protein glycosylation is divided into two categories: N-linked and O-linked. The two types differ in amino acid to which the glycan moity is attached on protein - N-linked are attached to Asn residues, while O-linked are attached to Ser or Thr residues. In addition, the glycan sequences of each type bears unique distinguishing features. Of the two types, N-linked glycosylation is the more abundant, and its effect on proteins has been extensively studied. O-linked glycans, on other hand are relatively scarce, and less information is available regarding their influence on proteins. The majority of data available on protein glycosylation in plants focuses on N-linked, rather than O-linked glycans.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">The present invention describes herein a plant expression system based on transgenic plant cells, which are preferably root cells, optionally and preferably grown in suspension. This expression system is particularly designed for efficient production of human GCD having glucocerebrosidase activity. The term "high mannose" includes glycosylation having at least one exposed mannose residue.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">Thus, in a first aspect, the present invention relates to a host cell producing human GCD having glucocerebrosidase activity. Preferably, the recombinant protein features an ER (endoplasmic reticulum) signal peptide, more preferably an ER targeting signal peptide. Alternatively or additionally, the recombinant protein features a signal that causes the protein to by-pass the Golgi. The signal preferably enables this recombinant protein to feature high mannose glycosylation, more preferably by retaining such glycosylation, and most preferably by targeting the ER and/or by by-passing the Golgi. As described in greater detail herein, such a signal is implemented as a signal peptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, which forms part of the protein sequence.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> It should be noted that the signal is a targeting signal.

Such nucleic acid molecule comprises a first nucleic acid sequence encoding the human GCD having glucocerebrosidase catalytic activity operably linked to a second nucleic acid sequence encoding a vacuolar targeting signal peptide of SEQ ID NO: 2. It should be noted that as used herein, the term "operably" linked does not necessarily refer to physical linkage. The first nucleic acid sequence may optionally and preferably further be operably linked to a third nucleic acid sequence encoding an ER (endoplasmic reticulum) targeting signal peptide.

"Host cell" as used herein refers to cells which can be recombinantly transformed with naked DNA or expression vectors constructed using recombinant DNA techniques. As used herein, the term "transfection" means the introduction of a nucleic<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> acid, e.g., naked DNA or an expression vector, into a recipient cells by nucleic acid-mediated gene transfer. "Transformation", as used herein, refers to a process in which a cell's genotype is changed as a result of the cellular uptake of exogenous DNA or RNA, and, for example, the transformed cell expresses a recombinant form of the desired protein.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">It should be appreciated that a drug resistance or other selectable marker is intended in part to facilitate the selection of the transformants.

Expression vectors are typically self-replicating DNA or RNA constructs containing the desired gene or its fragments, and operably linked genetic control elements that are recognized in a suitable host cell and effect expression of the desired genes. These control elements are capable of effecting expression within a suitable host. Generally, the genetic control elements can include a eukaryotic promoter expression control system. Such system typically includes a transcriptional promoter, an optional operator to control the onset of transcription, transcription enhancers to elevate the level of RNA Expression, a sequence that encodes a suitable ribosome binding site, RNA splice junctions, sequences that terminate transcription and translation and so forth.

The topical carrier is selected so as to provide the composition in the desired form, e.g., as a liquid or non-liquid carrier, lotion, cream, paste, gel, powder, ointment, solvent, liquid diluent, drops and the like, and may be comprised of a material of either naturally occurring or synthetic origin. It is essential, clearly, that the selected carrier does not adversely affect the active agent or other components of the topical formulation, and which is stable with respect to all components of the topical formulation. Examples of suitable topical carriers for use herein include water, alcohols and other nontoxic organic solvents, glycerin, mineral oil, silicone, petroleum jelly, lanolin, fatty acids, vegetable oils, parabens, waxes, and the like. Preferred formulations herein are colorless, odorless ointments, liquids, lotions, creams and gels.</p><p id="p0142" num="0142">Ointments are semisolid preparations, which are typically based on petrolatum for other petroleum derivatives. The specific ointment base to be used, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, is one that will provide for optimum active ingredients delivery, and, preferably, will provide for other desired characteristics as well, e.g., emolliency or the like: As with other carriers or vehicles, an ointment base should be inert, stable, nonirritating and nonsensitizing. As explained in <nplcit id="ncit0018" npl-type="b"><text>Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19th Ed. (Easton, Pa.: Mack Publishing Co., 1995), at pages 1399-1404</text></nplcit>, ointment bases may be grouped in four classes: oleaginous bases; emulsifiable bases; emulsion bases; and water-soluble bases. Oleaginous ointment bases include, for example, vegetable oils, fats obtained from animals, and semisolid hydrocarbons obtained from petroleum. Emulsifiable ointment bases, also known as absorbent ointment bases, contain little or no water and include, for example, hydroxystearin sulfate, anhydrous lanolin and hydrophilic petrolatum. Emulsion ointment bases are either water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions or oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions, and include, for example, cetyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate, lanolin and stearic acid. Preferred water-soluble ointment bases are prepared from polyethylene glycols of varying molecular weight; again, reference may be made to Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy for further information.</p><p id="p0143" num="0143">Lotions are preparations to be applied to the skin surface without friction, and are typically liquid or semiliquid preparations, in which solid particles, including the active agent, are present in a water or alcohol base. Lotions are usually suspensions of solids, and may comprise a liquid oily emulsion of the oil-in-water type. Lotions are preferred formulations herein for treating large body areas, because of the ease of applying a more fluid composition. It is generally necessary that the insoluble matter in a lotion be finely divided. Lotions will typically contain suspending agents to produce better dispersions as well as active ingredients useful for localizing and holding the active agent in contact with the skin, e.g., methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or the like.</p><p id="p0144" num="0144">Creams containing the selected active ingredients are, as known in the art, viscous liquid or semisolid emulsions, either oil-in-water or water-in-oil. Cream bases are water-washable, and contain an oil phase, an emulsifier and an aqueous phase. The oil phase, also sometimes called the "internal" phase, is generally comprised of petrolatum and a fatty alcohol such as cetyl or stearyl alcohol; the aqueous phase usually, although not necessarily, exceeds the oil phase in volume, and generally contains a humectant. The emulsifier in a cream formulation, as explained in Remington, supra, is generally a nonionic, anionic, cationic or amphoteric surfactant.</p><p id="p0145" num="0145">Gel formulations are preferred for application to the scalp. As will be appreciated by those working in the field of topical active ingredients formulation, gels are semisolid, suspension-type systems. Single-phase gels contain organic macromolecules distributed substantially uniformly throughout the carrier liquid, which is typically aqueous, but also, preferably, contain an alcohol and, optionally, an oil.</p><p id="p0146" num="0146">Various additives, known to those skilled in the art, may be included in the topical formulations of the invention. For example, solvents may be used to solubilize certain active ingredients substances. Other optional additives include skin permeation enhancers, opacifiers, anti-oxidants, gelling agents, thickening agents, stabilizers, and the like.</p><p id="p0147" num="0147">The topical compositions may also be delivered to the skin using conventional dermal-type patches or articles, wherein the active ingredients composition is contained within a laminated structure, that serves as a drug delivery device to be affixed to the skin. In such a structure, the active ingredients composition is contained in a layer, or "reservoir", underlying an upper backing layer. The laminated structure may contain a single reservoir, or it may contain multiple reservoirs. In one embodiment, the reservoir comprises a polymeric matrix of a pharmaceutically acceptable contact adhesive material that serves to affix the system to the skin during active ingredients delivery. Examples of suitable skin contact adhesive materials include, but are not limited to, polyethylenes, polysiloxanes, polyisobutylenes, polyacrylates, polyurethanes, and the like. The particular polymeric adhesive selected will depend on the particular active ingredients, vehicle, etc., i.e., the adhesive must be compatible with all components of the active ingredients-containing composition. Alternatively, the active ingredients-containing reservoir and skin contact adhesive are present as separate and distinct layers, with the adhesive underlying the reservoir which, in this case, may be either a polymeric matrix as described above, or it may be a liquid or hydrogel reservoir, or may take some other form.</p><p id="p0148" num="0148">The backing layer in these laminates, which serves as the upper surface of the device, functions as the primary structural element of the laminated structure and provides the device with much of its flexibility. The material selected for the backing material should be selected so that it is substantially impermeable to the active ingredients and to any other components of the active ingredients-containing composition, thus preventing loss of any components through the upper surface of the device. The backing layer may be either occlusive or non-occlusive, depending on whether it is desired that the skin become hydrated during active ingredients delivery. The backing is preferably made of a sheet or film of a preferably flexible elastomeric material. Examples of polymers that are suitable for the backing layer include polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyesters.</p><p id="p0149" num="0149">During storage and prior to use, the laminated structure includes a release liner. Immediately prior to use, this layer is removed from the device to expose the basal surface thereof either the active ingredients reservoir or a separate contact adhesive layer, so that the system may be affixed to the skin. The release liner should be made from an active ingredients/vehicle impermeable material.</p><p id="p0150" num="0150">Such devices may be fabricated using conventional techniques, known in the art, for example by casting a fluid admixture of adhesive, active ingredients and vehicle onto the backing layer, followed by lamination of the release liner. Similarly, the adhesive mixture may be cast onto the release liner, followed by lamination of the backing layer. Alternatively, the active ingredients reservoir may be prepared in the absence of active ingredients or exapient, and then loaded by "soaking" in an active ingredients/vehicle mixture.</p><p id="p0151" num="0151">As with the topical formulations of the invention, the active ingredients composition contained within the active ingredients reservoirs of these laminated system may contain a number of components. In some cases, the active ingredients may be delivered "neat," i.e., in the absence of additional liquid. In most cases, however, the active ingredients will be dissolved, dispersed or suspended in a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, typically a solvent or gel. Other components, which may be present, include preservatives, stabilizers, surfactants, and the like.</p><p id="p0152" num="0152">It should be noted that the protein of the invention is preferably administered to the patient in need in an effective amount. As used herein, "effective amount" means an amount necessary to achieve a selected result. For example, an effective amount of the composition of the invention may be selected for being useful for the treatment of a lysosomal storage disease.</p><p id="p0153" num="0153">Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in context of the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in an amount effective to achieve the intended purpose. More specifically, a therapeutically effective amount means an amount of active ingredient effective to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate symptoms of disease or prolong the survival of the subject being treated.</p><p id="p0154" num="0154">Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.</p><p id="p0155" num="0155">For any active ingredient used in the methods of the invention, the therapeutically effective amount or dose can be estimated initially from activity assays in animals. For example, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating concentration range that includes the IC<sub>50</sub> as determined by activity assays.</p><p id="p0156" num="0156">Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the active ingredients described herein can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in experimental animals, e.g., by determining the IC<sub>50</sub> and the LD<sub>50</sub> (lethal dose causing death in 50 % of the tested animals) for a subject active ingredient. The data obtained from these activity assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human.

However, in the monosaccharide composition, signals consistent with Arabinose were detected.</p><p id="p0266" num="0266">An important point is that the hGCD protein N-glycan composition analysis showed that the majority of the N-glycans terminate with mannose residues. This agrees with the requirement for mannose terminating N-glycans assisting the uptake of therapeutic hGCD by the macrophage mannose receptor. However,<!-- EPO <DP n="55"> --> neither native GCD nor recombinant GCD produced in mammalian cells is high mannose.
