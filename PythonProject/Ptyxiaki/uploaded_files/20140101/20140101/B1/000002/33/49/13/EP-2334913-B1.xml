The camshaft assembly 40 has an inner shaft 4 and an outer shaft 2.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The camshaft assembly 40 may be for a multiple cylinder engine or a single cylinder engine.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">For a multiple cylinder engine, the outer shaft 2 is hollow with multiple slots (not shown) that run perpendicular to the axis of rotation and has a sprocket 14 attached to the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> outside of the outer shaft 2. Inside the hollow outer shaft 2 is a hollow inner shaft 4 with multiple holes (not shown) that run perpendicular to the length of the shaft. A first set of cam lobes 6 are rigidly attached to the outer shaft 2 and a second set of cam lobes 8 are free to rotate and placed on the outer shaft 2 with a clearance fit. The second set of cam lobes 8 are positioned over slots (not shown) on the outer shaft 2 and are controlled by the inner shaft 4 through a mechanical connection (not shown).</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">For single cylinder engines, the outer shaft 2 is hollow and has a sprocket 14 attached to the outside of the outer shaft 2. Inside the hollow outer shaft 2 is a hollow inner shaft 4. At least one cam lobe 6 is directly attached or hard pressed to the outer shaft and at least one other cam lobe 8 is directly attached or hard pressed to the inner shaft 4. At one end of the camshaft assembly, the rotor 10 of the phaser 70 is rigidly attached to the inner shaft 4.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Internal combustion engines have employed various mechanisms to vary the angle between the camshaft and the crankshaft for improved engine performance or reduced emissions. The majority of these variable camshaft timing (VCT) mechanisms use one or more "vane phasers" on the engine camshaft (or camshafts, in a multiple-camshaft engine). In most cases, the phasers have a rotor 10 with one or more vanes 10a, mounted to the end of the camshaft assembly 40, surrounded by or coaxially located within the housing 12. The housing 12 and the rotor 10 form chambers in which the vanes 10a fit, dividing the chambers into advance chambers 3 and retard chambers 5. The vane 10a is capable of rotation to shift the relative angular position of the housing 12 and the rotor 10. It is possible to have the vanes 10a mounted to the housing 12, and the chambers in the rotor 10, as well. A portion of the housing's outer circumference forms the sprocket 14, pulley or gear accepting drive force through a chain, belt, or gears, usually from the crankshaft, or possible from another camshaft in a multiple-cam engine. Front end plate 43 is bolted to the front side of the housing 12. The back plate 41 is formed as part of the housing 12 and sprocket. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0023">Figure 23</figref>, a separate back plate 41 may be bolted to the backside of the housing 12. A vent 43a is present in the front end plate 43 and is aligned with the control valve 21 of the phaser 70.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The phaser 70 adjusts the phase of the outer and inner shafts 2, 4 relative to each other. The end of the inner shaft 4 of the camshaft assembly 40 has a bore 4c that forms a sleeve for receiving the spool 20 of the control valve 21 of the phaser 70. The spool 20 has a first end with a recess 20a that receives a spring 23 and second end 20e that that engages an alignment plug 50 present within the inner shaft 4, preventing the spool 20, from rotating relative to the inner shaft 4. The spring 23 biases the spool 20 in a first direction away from the front plate 43. The spool 20 also has metering slots 20b, 20c, 20d that aid in directing fluid to the advance and retard chambers 3, 5 and to a lock pin 42.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Between the first cam lobe 6 and the back end plate 41 is a first wide bearing 49 and adjacent to the second cam lobe 8 is second bearing 51. Within the first wide bearing 49 are two main passages 18, 52 that lead to aligned ports and annuluses in the outer and inner shafts 2, 4. The annuluses 28, 30, 32 in the outer shaft 2 are aligned with the ports 29, 31, 27 on the inner shaft 4 and the metered slots 20b, 20c, 20d of the spool 20 depending on the position of the spool 20 within the inner shaft 4. The first passage 18 in the first wide bearing 49 supplies fluid to the phaser 70 and feeds the bearing 49. The first passage 18 is in fluid communication with a groove 19 in the first wide bearing 49 that is aligned with three annuluses 28, 30, 32 in the outer shaft 2, an advance annuluses 28 in the outer shaft 2 leading to an advance port 29 in the inner shaft 4, a supply or common annulus 30 in the outer shaft 2 leading to a central port 31 in the inner shaft 4, and a retard annulus 32 in the outer shaft 2 leading to a retard port 27 in the inner shaft 4. The advance annulus 28, the retard annulus 30, and the first passage 18 each have a check valve present 34, 36, 22 respectively. The check valves 34, 36, 22 are preferably band check valves or disc check valves, although other types of check valves may also be used.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The second passage 52 in the first wide bearing 49 supplies fluid that controls the lock pin 42 and biases the position of the spool 20 of the control valve 21 in a second direction, towards the front plate 43, via a valve 62. The valve 62 may be an on/off valve with a constant source of pressurized fluid or an infinitely variable valve.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The lock pin 42 is present within a bore 10b in the rotor 10 of the phaser. The lock pin 42 includes a lock pin body 46 and a spring 43. The spring 43 biases the lock pin body 46 towards a locked position in which the lock pin body 46 engages a recess 53 in the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> housing 12 and the housing 12 is locked relative to the rotor 10. In an unlocked position, fluid biases the lock pin body 46 away from the recess 53 in the housing 12 and against the spring 43.

The majority of these variable camshaft timing (VCT) mechanisms use one or more "vane phasers" on the engine camshaft (or camshafts, in a multiple-camshaft engine). In most cases, the phasers have a rotor 10 with one or more vanes 10a, mounted to the end of the camshaft assembly, surrounded by or coaxially located within the housing 8. The housing and the rotor form chambers in which the vanes 10a fit, dividing the chambers into advance chambers 3 and retard chambers 5. The vane 10a is capable of rotation to shift the relative angular position of the housing 12 and the rotor 10. It is possible to have the vanes 10a mounted to the housing 12, and the chambers in the rotor 10, as well. A<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> portion of the housing's outer circumference forms the sprocket 14, pulley or gear accepting drive force through a chain, belt, or gears, usually from the crankshaft, or possible from another camshaft in a multiple-cam engine. Front end plate 43 is bolted to the front side of the housing 12. The back plate 41 is formed as part of the housing 12 and sprocket. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0023">Figure 23</figref>, a separate back plate 41 may be bolted to the backside of the housing 12.

The spool 20 has a first end with a recess 20a that receives a spring 23 and a second end 20e that engages an alignment plug 50 present within the inner shaft 4, preventing the spool 20 from rotation. The spring 23 biases the spool 20 in a first direction away from the front plate 43. The spool 20 also has metering slots 20b, 20c, 20d that aid in direction fluid to the advance and retard chambers 3, 5 and to a lock pin 42.
