Whether manual or powered, wheelchairs provide an important degree of independence for those they assist. However, this degree of independence can be limited if the wheelchair is required to traverse obstacles such as, for example, curbs that are commonly present at sidewalks, driveways, and other paved surface interfaces.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In this regard, most wheelchairs have front and rear casters to stabilize the chair from tipping forward or backward and to ensure that the drive wheels are always in contact with the ground. One such wheelchair is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5435404A"><text>US Patent No. 5,435,404 to Garin</text></patcit>. On such wheelchairs, the caster wheels are typically much smaller than the driving wheels and located both forward and rear of the drive wheels. Though this configuration provided the wheelchair with greater stability, it made it difficult for such wheelchairs to climb over obstacles such as, for example, curbs or the like, because the front casters could not be driven over the obstacle due to their small size and constant contact with the ground.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5964473A"><text>US Patent No. 5,964,473 to Degonda et al.</text></patcit> describes a wheelchair having front and rear casters similar to Garin and a pair of additional forward lift wheels. The lift wheels are positioned off the ground and slightly forward of the front caster. Configured as such, the lift wheels first engage a curb and cause the wheelchair to tip backwards. As the wheelchair tips backwards, the front caster raises off the ground to a height so that it either clears the curb or can be driven over the curb.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">While Degonda et al. addressed the need of managing a front caster while traversing an obstacle such as a curb, Degonda et al. is disadvantageous in that additional wheels (i.e., lift wheels) must be added to the wheelchair. Hence, it is desirable to provide a wheelchair that does not require additional lift wheels or other similar type mechanisms to raise a front<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> caster off the ground to a height so that the caster either clears an obstacle or can be driven over the obstacle.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6129165A"><text>US-A-6,129,165</text></patcit> discloses a curb-climbing front wheel drive power wheelchair having a frame, a seat connected to the frame, a pair of drive wheels connected to the frame and rotatable about a transverse axis below a portion of the seat supporting the wheelchair occupant's thighs. The power wheelchair also has a pair of ground-engaging idler wheels, in the form of casters, connected to the frame behind the drive wheels, as well as non-caster, anti-tip wheels forward of the drive wheels. The anti-tip wheels may be connected to the motors by way of rigid pivot arms upon which the drive wheels are mounted ahead of the motors and which are mounted upon the frame for turning about a horizontal axis. Alternatively, the anti-tip wheels are mounted upon dedicated pivot arms mounted for turning on the frame about a horizontal axis, whilst the motors are on other pivot arms upon which the drive wheels arc mounted ahead of the motors and which are mounted on the frame for turning about another horizontal axis. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6129165A"><text>US-A-6,129,165</text></patcit> is disadvantageous in that the anti-tip wheels are configured to be above the ground when the wheelchair is in static equilibrium. Such a configuration does not provide the wheelchair with a greater stability.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Summary of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the present invention, there is provided a wheelchair for traversing obstacles according to claim 1. As used herein, when two objects are described as being coupled or attached, it is applicants' intention to include both direct coupling and/or attachment between the described components and indirect coupling and/or attachment between the described components such as through one or more intermediary components.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to a specific embodiment of the invention, the wheelchair has a frame and a seat for seating a passenger. Pivotally coupled to the frame are a pair of pivot arms. Each pivot arm has a first distal portion, a second distal portion, and a pivotal connection between the first and second distal portions for pivotally coupling the pivot arm to the frame. A motor is coupled to the first distal portion and a front caster is coupled to the second distal portion of each pivot arm. A drive wheel is coupled to each motor for translating the rotational energy of the motor to the ground. At least one rear caster is coupled to the frame to provide<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> for rear stability. By accelerating the wheelchair forward, the drive wheels generate a moment causing each pivot arm to pivot or rotate thereby raising the front casters to a height sufficient to traverse the obstacle.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The pivotal coupling between the motor and the pivot arm may be further influenced by a resilient member providing suspension between the motor and pivot arm. The motor is preferably a gearless, brushless, direct-drive motor, although brush-type motors with transmissions can also be used. A front resilient assembly may be coupled to the frame and to the pivotal connection of the motor to the pivot arm so as to provide a constant resilient force between the frame, the pivotal connection of the motor, and the arm.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A method of traversing one or more obstacles using a wheelchair according to the invention includes, for example, accelerating a wheelchair toward the one or more obstacles and, through such accelerating, causing a raising of the front casters by pivoting the arms that are coupled to the front casters so that the front casters are raised to a height sufficient for the front casters to traverse the obstacle. The step of pivoting the arms coupled to the front casters includes, for example, the step of generating a moment associated with the pivot arms causing the pivot arms to rotate in the direction of raising the front casters. The height by which the front casters must be raised to traverse an obstacle varies from raising the front casters to a height where their axles are just above the height of the obstacle to raising the front casters to a height where the casters' lower extremities are above the height of the obstacle. In the case where the front casters are raised to a height where their axles are just above the height of the obstacle, the wheelchair engages the front casters with the obstacle and drives the front casters thereover.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A method of descending curb-like obstacles using a wheelchair according to the invention lowers the front casters over a curb onto the new lower elevation when descending to provide forward stability for the wheelchair while the drive wheels and rear caster(s) are still on higher curb elevation. As the drive wheels continue over the curb and contact the new lower elevation forward stability is still maintained by virtue of the front casters while the or each rear caster is still on the higher curb elevation.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">An advantage of the wheelchair of the present invention is to provide a cost-efficient wheelchair that can traverse one or more curb-like obstacles.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Another advantage of the wheelchair of the present invention is to provide a mid-wheel drive wheelchair with pivotable front caster assemblies.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">It is, therefore, a further advantage of the present invention to provide a torque-based method of raising the front casters of a wheelchair for traversing curb-like obstacles.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>Brief Description of the Drawings</u></b></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the accompanying drawings which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, embodiments of the invention are illustrated, which, together with a general description of the invention given above, and the detailed description given below, serve to example the principles of this invention.

The wheelchair 100 has a pair of drive wheels 102 and 104, front casters 106 and 108, rear caster 110, and front riggings 112 and 114. The front riggings 112 and 114 include footrests 116 and 118 for supporting the feet of a passenger. The front riggings 112 and 114 are preferably mounted so as to be able to swing away from the shown center position to the sides of wheelchair 100. Additionally, footrests 116 and 118 can swing from the shown horizontal-down position to a vertical-up position thereby providing relatively unobstructed access to the front of wheelchair 100.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The wheelchair 100 further includes a chair 120 having a seat portion 122 and a back portion 124 for comfortably seating a passenger. Chair 120 is adjustably mounted to frame 142 so as to be able to move forward and backward on frame 142, thereby adjusting the passenger's weight distribution and center of gravity relative to the wheelchair. In the most preferred embodiment, chair 120 should be positioned such that a substantial portion of the wheelchair's weight when loaded with a passenger is generally above and evenly distributed between drive wheels 102 and 104.

In particular, <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 4A</figref> is a free body diagram illustrating the forces acting on wheelchair 100 when the wheelchair is in static equilibrium. The various forces shown include F<sub>p</sub>, F<sub>b</sub>, F<sub>s</sub>, F<sub>fc</sub>, F<sub>rc</sub>, and F<sub>w</sub>. More specifically, F<sub>p</sub> is the force representing gravity acting on the center of<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> gravity of a person C<sub>gp</sub> sitting in wheelchair 100. Similarly, F<sub>b</sub> is the force representing gravity acting on the center of gravity of the batteries C<sub>gb</sub> used to power wheelchair 100. Resilient member or spring 144 introduces a resilient force F<sub>s</sub> acting on pivot arm 132 through its connection to the housing of drive motor 136. A second resilient member or spring 146 (see <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 3</figref>) provides a similar force on pivot arm 134. Rear caster 110 has a force F<sub>rc</sub> acting on its point of contact with the ground. Front caster 106 has a force F<sub>fc</sub> acting on its point of contact with the ground. Front caster 108 (not shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 4A</figref>) has a similar force acting on it as well. Drive wheel 102 has force F<sub>w</sub> acting on its point of contact with the ground and drive wheel 104 also has a similar force acting thereon.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In wheelchair 100, the center of gravity of a person C<sub>gp</sub> sitting in the wheelchair is preferably located behind a vertical centerline 402 through pivotal connection P. Similarly, the center of gravity of the batteries C<sub>gb</sub> is located behind the vertical centerline 402. As already described, it is possible to obtain between approximately 80% to 95% weight distribution on drive wheels 102 and 104, with the remainder of the weight being distributed between the front casters 106 and 108 and the rear caster 110. As will be explained in more detail, such an arrangement facilitates the raising and lowering of the front casters 106 and 108 during acceleration and deceleration of the wheelchair 100.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Under static equilibrium such as, for example, when the chair is at rest or not accelerating or decelerating as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 4A</figref>, the net rotational moment around pivotal connection P and pivot arms 132 and 134 is zero (0) (i.e., ∑F<sub>n</sub>r<sub>n</sub> = 0, where F is a force acting at a distance r from the pivotal connection P and n is the number of forces acting on the wheelchair). Hence, pivot arms 132 and 134 do not tend to rotate or pivot.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 4B</figref>, wheelchair 100 is shown accelerating. The forces are the same as those of <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 4A</figref>, except that an acceleration force F<sub>a</sub> is acting on drive wheel 102. A similar force acts on drive wheel 104. When the moment generated by the acceleration force F<sub>a</sub> exceeds the moment generated by spring force F<sub>s</sub>, pivot arm 132 will begin to rotate or pivot such that front caster 106 begins to rise. As the moment generated by the acceleration force F<sub>a</sub> continues to increase over the moment generated by spring force F<sub>s</sub>, the pivot arm 132 increasingly rotates or pivots thereby increasingly raising front caster 106 until the maximum rotation or pivot has been achieved. The maximum rotation or pivot is achieved when pivot arm 132 makes direct contact with frame 142 or indirect contact such as through, for<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> example, a pivot stop attached to frame 142. Pivot arm 134 and front caster 108 behave in a similar fashion.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Hence, as the wheelchair 100 accelerates forward and the moment created by accelerating force F<sub>a</sub> increases over the moment created by spring force F<sub>s</sub>, pivot arms 132 and 134 begin to rotate or pivot thereby raising front casters 106 and 108 off the ground. As described, it is preferable that front casters 106 and 108 rise between 1 and 6 inches and most preferably between 1 and 4 inches off the ground so as to be able to traverse a curb or other obstacle of the same or similar height.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 4C</figref>, a free body diagram illustrating the forces acting on wheelchair 100 when the wheelchair is decelerating is shown. The forces are the same as those of <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 4A</figref>, except that a deceleration force F<sub>d</sub> is acting on drive wheel 102 instead of an acceleration force F<sub>a</sub>. A similar force acts on drive wheel 104. The moment generated by the deceleration force F<sub>d</sub> causes pivot arm 132 to rotate in the same direction as the moment generated by spring force F<sub>s</sub>, i.e., clockwise as shown. If front caster 106 is not contacting the ground, this pivot arm rotation causes front caster 106 to lower until it makes contact with the ground. If front caster 106 is already contacting the ground, then no further movement of front caster 106 is possible. Hence, when wheelchair 100 decelerates, front caster 106 is urged towards the ground. Pivot arm 134 and front caster 108 behave in a similar manner.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The spring force F<sub>s</sub> can be used to control the amount of acceleration and deceleration that is required before pivot arm 132 pivots and raises or lowers front caster 106. For example, a strong or weak spring force would require a stronger or weaker acceleration and deceleration before pivot arm 132 pivots and raises or lowers front caster 106, respectively. The exact value of the spring force- F<sub>s</sub> depends on designer preferences and overall wheelchair performance requirements for acceleration and deceleration. For example, the spring force F<sub>s</sub> must be strong enough to keep chair 120 and the passenger from tipping forward due to inertia when the wheelchair is decelerating. It should also be noted that, in conjunction with the spring force F<sub>s</sub>, the center of gravity of the person C<sub>gp</sub> sitting in the wheelchair can be modified. For example, the center of gravity C<sub>gp</sub> may be moved further rearward from vertical centerline 402 by moving chair 120 rearward along frame 142 with or without adjusting the magnitude of the spring force F<sub>s</sub>. Moreover, the position of pivotal connection P may be moved along the length of pivot arms 132 and 134 thereby changing the ratio of distances between the pivotal connection P and the motor drive assemblies and<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> casters 106 and 108 thereby resulting changing the dynamics of the pivot arms and wheelchair. Hence, a combination of features can be varied to control the pivoting of pivot arms 132 and 132 and the raising and lowering of front casters 106 and 108.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0007 f0008">Figures 5A through 5E</figref>, the curb-climbing capability of wheelchair 100 will now be described. In <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 5A</figref>, the wheelchair 100 approaches a curb 502 of approximately 2 to 4 inches (approximately 5 to 10 cm) in height. The wheelchair 100 is positioned so that front casters 106 and 108 are approximately 6 inches (approximately 15 cm) from the curb 502. Alternatively, wheelchair 100 can be driven directly to curb 502 such that front casters 106 and 108 bump against curb 502 and are driven thereunto, provided the height of curb 502 is less than the axle height of front casters 106 and 108 (not shown).</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Nevertheless, in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 5B</figref> from preferably a standstill position, drive motors 136 and 138 are "torqued" so as to cause pivot arms 132 and 134 to pivot about, for example, pin or bolt 330 and raise front casters 106 and 108 off the ground. The torquing of drive motors 136 and 138 refers to the process by which drive motors 136 and 138 are directed to instantaneously produce a large amount of torque so that the acceleration force F<sub>a</sub> creates a moment greater than the moment generated by spring force F<sub>s</sub>. Such a process is accomplished by the wheelchair's passenger directing the wheelchair to accelerate rapidly from the standstill position. For example, a passenger can push hard and fast on the wheelchair's directional accelerator controller (not shown) thereby directing the wheelchair to accelerate forward as fast as possible. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 5B</figref> and as described in connection with <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">Figures 4A-4C</figref>, such "torquing" causes pivot arms 132 and 134 to pivot about pin 330 thereby causing front casters 106 and 108 to rise. During torquing, the wheelchair 100 accelerates forward toward the curb 502 with the front casters 106 and 108 in the raised position.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 5C</figref>, front casters 106 and 108 have passed over curb 502. As front casters 106 and 108 pass over or ride on top of curb 502, drive wheels 102 and 104 come into physical contact with the rising edge of curb 502. Due to the drive wheels' relatively large size compared to the height of curb 502, the drive wheels 102 and 104 are capable of engaging curb 502 and driving there over--thereby raising the wheelchair 100 over curb 502 and onto a new elevation. Once raised, the front casters 106 and 108 are lowered as the inertial forces of the passenger and battery approach zero. These inertial forces approach zero when wheelchair 100 either decelerates such as, for example, by engaging curb 502 or<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> by accelerating wheelchair 100 to its maximum speed (under a given loading) at which point the acceleration approaches zero and wheelchair 100 approaches the state of dynamic equilibrium. Either scenario causes pivot arms 132 and 134 to lower front casters 106 and 108 onto the new elevation.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 5D</figref> shows wheelchair 100 after the drive wheels 102 and 104 have driven over curb 502 and onto the new elevation with front casters 106 and 108 lowered. Rear caster 110 still contacts the previous lower elevation. By such contact, rear caster 110 provides rearward stability preventing wheelchair 100 from tipping backwards as the wheelchair climbs the curb 502. <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 5E</figref> illustrates wheelchair 100 after rear caster 110 has engaged and surmounted curb 502.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Hence, the present invention provides a feature by which the front casters of a wheelchair can be raised and lowered when the wheelchair must climb or surmount a curb or obstacle.

In <figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 6B</figref>, front casters 106 and 108 have gone over curb 602 and are in contact with the new lower elevation. As front casters 106 and 108 go over the curb or obstacle 602, they are urged downward toward the new lower elevation by the force generated by springs 144 and 146. This results in very little impact or feeling of loss of stability to the wheelchair passenger because the wheelchair 100 stays substantially level as the front casters 106 and 108 drop over curb 602 to the new lower elevation.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In <figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 6C</figref>, drive wheels 102 and 104 have gone over curb 602 and are in contact with the new lower elevation.

More specifically, springs 144 and 146 urge the back of seat 120 rearward to counter any forward tipping tendency that the wheelchair may exhibit. In addition or in the alternative, an electromechanical stop or spring dampener can be energized by sensing inertial forces, angle<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> of the wheelchair frame, or current to or from the drive motors, which would prevent the wheelchair from tipping forward (not shown).</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In <figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 6D</figref>, rear caster 110 has gone over curb 602 and contacts the new lower elevation.

The rear caster provides rearward stability during such curb-climbing. In descending curb-like obstacles, wheelchair 100 lowers the front casters over the obstacle to provide forward stability as the drive wheels drive over the obstacle. The resilient members or springs provide rearward stability by urging the rear of the wheelchair's seat downward to counter any forward tipping tendency that the wheelchair may exhibit when descending a curb or obstacle.

In particular, <figref idrefs="f0014">Figure 10A</figref> is a free body diagram illustrating the forces acting on wheelchair 700 when the wheelchair is in static equilibrium. The various forces shown include F<sub>p</sub>, F<sub>b</sub>, F<sub>s</sub>, F<sub>fc</sub>, F<sub>rc</sub>, and F<sub>w</sub>. As described in <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">Figures 4A-4C</figref>, F<sub>p</sub> is the force representing gravity acting on the center of gravity of a person C<sub>gp</sub> sitting in wheelchair 700. Similarly, F<sub>b</sub> is the force representing gravity acting on the center of gravity of the batteries C<sub>gb</sub> used to power wheelchair 100. Spring 944 introduces a force F<sub>s</sub> acting on pivot arm 732. Spring 938 (see <figref idrefs="f0012">Figure 9A</figref>) provides a similar force on pivot arm 732. Rear caster 710 has a force F<sub>rc</sub> acting on its point of contact with the ground. Front caster 708 has a force F<sub>fc</sub> acting on its point of contact with the ground. Front caster 706 (see <figref idrefs="f0012">Figure 9A</figref>) has a similar force acting on it as well. Drive wheel 704 has force F<sub>w</sub> acting on its point of contact with the ground and drive wheel 702 (see <figref idrefs="f0012">Figure 9A</figref>) also has a similar force acting thereon.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In wheelchair 700, the center of gravity C<sub>gp</sub> of a person sitting in the chair is preferably located just behind a vertical centerline 1002 through pivotal connection P. Similarly, the center of gravity C<sub>gb</sub> of the batteries is located behind the vertical centerline<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> 1002. As already described, it is possible to obtain between approximately 80% to 95% weight distribution on drive wheels 702 and 704, with the remainder of the weight being distributed between the front casters 706 and 708 and the rear caster 710. As will be explained in more detail, such an arrangement facilitates the raising and lowering of the front casters 706 and 708 during acceleration and deceleration of the wheelchair 700.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Under static equilibrium such as, for example, when the chair is at rest or not accelerating or decelerating as shown in <figref idrefs="f0014">Figure 10A</figref>, the net rotational moment around pivotal connection P and pivot arms 732 and 734 is zero (0) (i.e., ∑F<sub>n</sub>r<sub>n</sub> = 0, where F is a force acting at a distance r from the pivotal connection P and n is the number of forces acting on the wheelchair). Hence, pivot arms 732 and 734 do not tend to rotate or pivot.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In <figref idrefs="f0015">Figure 10B</figref>, wheelchair 700 is shown accelerating. The forces are the same as those of <figref idrefs="f0014">Figure 10A</figref>, except that an acceleration force F<sub>a</sub> is acting on drive wheel 704. A similar force acts on drive wheel 702. When the moment generated by the acceleration force F<sub>a</sub> exceeds the moment generated by spring force F<sub>s</sub>, pivot arm 734 will begin to rotate or pivot such that front caster 708 begins to rise. As the moment generated by the acceleration force F<sub>a</sub> continues to increase over the moment generated by spring force F<sub>s</sub>, pivot arm 734 increasingly rotates or pivots thereby increasingly raising front caster 708 until the maximum rotation or pivot has been achieved. The maximum rotation or pivot is achieved when pivot arm 734 makes direct contact with frame 742 or indirect contact such as through, for example, a pivot stop attached to frame 742. Pivot arm 734 and front caster 708 behave in a similar fashion.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Hence, as the wheelchair 700 accelerates forward and the moment created by accelerating force F<sub>a</sub> increases over the moment created by spring force F<sub>s</sub>, pivot arms 732 and 734 being to rotate or pivot thereby raising front casters 706 and 708 off the ground. As described, it is preferable that front casters 706 and 708 rise between 1 and 6 inches off the ground so as to be able to overcome a curb or other obstacle of the same or similar height.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0016">Figure 10C</figref>, a free body diagram illustrating the forces acting on wheelchair 700 when the wheelchair is decelerating is shown. The forces are the same as those of <figref idrefs="f0014">Figure 10A</figref>, except that a deceleration force F<sub>d</sub> is acting on drive wheel 702 instead of an accelerating force F<sub>a</sub>. A similar force acts on drive wheel 702. The moment generated by the deceleration force F<sub>d</sub> causes pivot arm 734 to rotate in the same direction as the<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> moment generated by spring force F<sub>s</sub>, i.e., clockwise as shown. If front caster 708 is not contacting the ground, this pivot arm rotation causes front caster 708 to lower until it makes contact with the ground. If front caster 708 is already contacting the ground, then no further movement of front caster 708 is possible. Hence, when wheelchair 700 decelerates, front caster 708 is urged clockwise or towards the ground. Pivot arm 732 and front caster 706 behave in a similar manner.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">As with wheelchair 100, the spring force F<sub>s</sub> can be used to control the amount of acceleration and deceleration that is required before pivot arm 734 pivots and raises or lowers front caster 708. For example, a strong or weak spring force would require a stronger or weaker acceleration and deceleration before pivot arm 734 pivots and raises or lowers front caster 708, respectively. The exact value of the spring force F<sub>s</sub> depends on designer preferences and overall wheelchair performance requirements for acceleration and deceleration. For example, the spring force F<sub>s</sub> must be strong enough to keep chair 720 and the passenger from tipping forward due to inertia when the wheelchair is decelerating. Additionally, because horizontal pivot bracket 936 has a plurality of mounting holes (see <figref idrefs="f0012">Figure 9A</figref>, for example) for mounting vertical pivot brackets 932 and 934, the amount of spring force F<sub>s</sub> applied to the pivot arms can also be controlled by the appropriate choice of mounting for such brackets. It should also be noted that, either alone or in conjunction with the spring force F<sub>s</sub> and the vertical and horizontal pivot bracket configuration, the center of gravity of the person C<sub>gp</sub> sitting in the wheelchair can be modified. For example, the center of gravity C<sub>gp</sub> may be moved further rearward from vertical centerline 1002 with or without adjusting the magnitude of the spring force F<sub>s</sub>. Hence, a combination of features can be varied to control the pivoting of pivot arms 732 and 732 and the raising and lowering of front casters 706 and 708.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0017 f0018">Figures 11A through 11E</figref>, the curb-climbing capability of wheelchair 700 will now be described. In <figref idrefs="f0017">Figure 11A</figref>, the wheelchair 700 approaches a curb 1102 of approximately 3 to 6 inches in height. The wheelchair 700 is positioned so that front casters 706 and 708 are approximately 6 inches from the curb 1102. Alternatively, wheelchair 700 can be driven directly to curb 1102 such that front casters 706 and 708 bump against curb 1102 and are driven thereunto, provided the height of curb 1102 is less than the axle height of front casters 706 and 708 (not shown).<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Nevertheless, in <figref idrefs="f0017">Figure 11B</figref> from preferably a standstill position, drive motors 736 and 738 are "torqued" so as to cause pivot arms 732 and 734 to pivot about, for example, pin or bolt 922 and raise front casters 706 and 708 off the ground. As described earlier, the torquing of drive motors 736 and 738 refers to the process by which drive motors 736 and 738 are directed to instantaneously produce a large amount of torque so that the acceleration force F<sub>a</sub> creates a moment greater than the moment generated by spring force F<sub>s</sub>. Such a process is accomplished by the wheelchair's passenger directing the wheelchair to accelerate rapidly from the standstill position. For example, a passenger can push hard and fast on the wheelchair's directional accelerator controller (not shown) thereby directing the wheelchair to accelerate forward as fast as possible. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0017">Figure 11B</figref> and as described in connection with <figref idrefs="f0014 f0015 f0016">Figures 10A-10C</figref>, such "torquing" causes pivot arms 732 and 734 to pivot about pin 922 thereby causing front casters 706 and 708 to rise. During torquing, the wheelchair 700 accelerates forward toward the curb 1102 with the front casters 706 and 708 in the raised position.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In <figref idrefs="f0017">Figure 11C</figref>, front casters 706 and 708 have passed over curb 1102. As front casters 706 and 708 pass over or ride on top of curb 1102, drive wheels 702 and 704 come into physical contact with the rising edge of curb 1102. Due to the drive wheels' relatively large size compared to the height of curb 1102, the drive wheels 702 and 704 are capable of engaging curb 1102 and driving there over--thereby raising the wheelchair 700 over curb 1102 and onto a new elevation. As drive wheels 702 and 704 engage curb 1102, suspension spring 920 cushions the impact of the transition. Once raised, the front casters 706 and 708 are lowered as the inertial forces of the passenger and battery approach zero. These inertial forces approach zero when wheelchair 700 either decelerates such as, for example, by engaging curb 1102 or by accelerating wheelchair 700 to its maximum speed (under a given loading) at which point the acceleration approaches zero and wheelchair 700 approaches the state of dynamic equilibrium. Either scenario causes pivot arms 732 and 734 to lower front casters 706 and 708 onto the new elevation.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063"><figref idrefs="f0018">Figure 11D</figref> shows wheelchair 700 after the drive wheels 702 and 704 have driven over curb 1102 and onto the new elevation with front casters 706 and 708 lowered. Rear caster 710 still contacts the previous lower elevation. By such contact, rear caster 710 provides rearward stability preventing wheelchair 700 from tipping backwards as the wheelchair climbs the curb or obstacle 1102. <figref idrefs="f0018">Figure 11E</figref> illustrates wheelchair 700 after rear<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> caster 710 has engaged and surmounted curb or obstacle 1102. <figref idrefs="f0019">Figures 12A, 12B, 12C, 12D, and 12E</figref> correspond to enlarge portions of <figref idrefs="f0017">Figures 11A, 11B, 11C</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0018">11D, and 11E</figref>, respectively, particularly showing the orientation and range of motion experienced by front resilient assembly 931 as the wheelchair climbs a curb.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Hence, the embodiment of wheelchair 700 provides a feature by which the front casters of a wheelchair can be raised and lowered when the wheelchair must climb or surmount a curb or obstacle. By raising the front casters to an appropriate position, whether completely clear of the curb or obstacle height or partially clear thereof, the wheelchair's drive wheels can, in effect, drive the wheelchair over the curb or obstacle.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0020">Figures 13A through 13D</figref>, the curb descending capability of wheelchair 700 will now be described. Referring now particularly to <figref idrefs="f0020">Figure 13A</figref>, wheelchair 700 slowly approaches a curb 1302, which represents a drop in elevation. In <figref idrefs="f0020">Figure 13B</figref>, front casters 706 and 708 have gone over curb 1302 and are in contact with the new lower elevation. As front casters 706 and 708 go over curb 1302, they are urged downward toward the new lower elevation by the force generated by springs 938 and 944. This results in very little impact or feeling of loss of stability to the wheelchair passenger because the wheelchair 700 stays substantially level as the front casters 706 and 708 drop over curb 1302 to the new lower elevation.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">In <figref idrefs="f0020">Figure 13C</figref>, drive wheels 702 and 704 have gone over curb 1302 and are in contact with the new lower elevation. As drive wheels 702 and 704 go over curb or obstacle 1302, suspension springs such as spring 920 cushion the impact of such a transition. Also as drive wheels 702 and 704 go over curb 1302, wheelchair 700 is prevented from tipping forward by springs 938 and 944 and front casters 706 and 708. More specifically, springs 938 and 944 urge the front of frame 742, through frame mounting bracket 940 (see <figref idrefs="f0012 f0013">Figures 9</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0014 f0015 f0016">10</figref>), upward to counter any forward tipping tendency that the wheelchair may exhibit.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">In <figref idrefs="f0020">Figure 13D</figref>, rear caster 710 has gone over curb 1302 and contacts the new lower elevation. As rear caster 710 drops down over curb 1302, very little impact or instability is experienced by the wheelchair passenger because most of the wheelchair's weight (including passenger weight) is supported by drive wheels 702 and 704, which are already on the new lower elevation. Hence, as rear caster 710 goes over curb 1302 and contacts the new lower elevation, the wheelchair passenger experiences a low-impact transition between elevations.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Therefore, wheelchair 700 provides a stable, low-impact structure and method for climbing or descending over curb-like obstacles. In climbing curb-like obstacles, wheelchair 700 raises the front casters to a height sufficient for the front casters to go over the curb-like obstacle and allow the wheelchair's drive wheels to engage the obstacle. The rear caster provides rearward stability during such curb-climbing. In descending curb-like obstacles, wheelchair 700 lowers the front casters over the obstacle to provide forward stability as the drive wheels drive over the obstacle. Suspension springs associated with the drive wheels provide for low-impact transitions for the passenger between elevations representing curbs or obstacles. Springs associated with the front casters provide forward stability by urging the front of the wheelchair's frame upward to counter any forward tipping tendency that the wheelchair may exhibit when descending a curb or obstacle.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">While the present invention has been illustrated by the description of embodiments thereof, and while the embodiments have been described in considerable detail, it is not the intention of the applicants to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail.
