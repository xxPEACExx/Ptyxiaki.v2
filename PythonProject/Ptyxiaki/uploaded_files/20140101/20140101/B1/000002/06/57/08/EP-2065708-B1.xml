Cholesterol is distributed especially in VLDL, LDL and HDL. Since HDL is considered as a prophylaxis factor of heart diseases due to arteriosclerosis, it is known that measurement of blood level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), instead of HDL, provides a useful criterion for predicting onset of arteriosclerotic diseases.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">At present, ultracentrifugation method, electrophoresis method, and precipitation method are widely known as measurement methods of HDL cholesterol. However, the ultracentrifugation method requires long time for separation, and ultracentrifugation apparatuses themselves are expensive so that low cost measurement cannot be expected, and therefore the method is unsuitable for routine tests. The electrophoresis method still has problems concerning quantification, for example, difference of electrophoresis supporting.medium causes difference of separation performance, and depending on condition for use thereof or type of detection reagent used, difference in measurement results may be caused.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The precipitation method is a method of precipitating CHM, LDL and VLDL using a combination of a polyanion and a divalent metal ion as a precipitation reagent, and measuring cholesterol in HDL, i.e., HDL-cholesterol, remaining in the supernatant using a chemical reagent or an enzyme. As the precipitation reagent, combination systems of a polysaccharide sulfate and an alkaline earth metal ion or a divalent metal ion other than alkaline earth metal,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> which was well known from early 1960s, inorganic polyanion salt systems, polyethylene glycol, and the like are widely used (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>Nakai T., HDL-Metabolism, Assay Methods and Clinical Application), Chugai Igaku-Sha, 1986</text></nplcit>). Specific examples of the precipitation reagent include, for example, heparin-calcium type reagents, dextran sulfate-magnesium type reagents, phosphotungstic acid-magnesium type reagents.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In these precipitation methods, serum and a precipitation reagent are mixed and left for a given period of time, and subjected to centrifugation at 3000 rpm, then a given volume of the supernatant is separated and used to perform a chemical reaction or an enzymatic reaction and thereby quantify HDL-cholesterol. However, this procedure has problems resulting from the precipitation reagent, problems concerning centrifugation operation. For example, as improvements of the precipitating agent for increasing precipitation efficiency, methods disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (KOKAI) Nos. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP55078254A"><text>55-78254</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP55093065A"><text>55-93065</text></patcit>,<patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP61263467A"><text> 61-263467</text></patcit>,<patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP62019768A"><text> 62-19768</text></patcit>, Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) No. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP1039553A"><text>1-39553</text></patcit>, have been proposed.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is known that, in the conventional precipitation methods, when a reagent containing much triglycerides is used, a part of precipitates float after the centrifugation, and thus they also have a problem that adjustment of centrifugation conditions is additionally needed in order to avoid the problem. Moreover, the method of using phosphotungstic acid salt-magnesium ion has also a problem that production of precipitates may vary depending on pH of the solution, and thus strict pH adjustment become necessary. Furthermore, when the supernatant of the centrifuged solution is separated, and especially when volume of the supernatant is small, it is difficult to determine the border of the precipitates by visual inspection, and therefore there arise problems concerning reproducibility or precision, or individual differences may occur to degrade precision of the quantitative analysis. Therefore, it is desired to provide a means for improving these drawbacks concerning centrifugation operation.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In recent years, direct methods not requiring these complicated operations and usable in automatic analyzers have been rapidly spreading. For example, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO8131197A"><text>8-131197</text></patcit> discloses a method for measuring cholesterol in HDL in which sulfated cyclodextrin used as a coagulant is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> sufficiently reacted with lipoproteins other than HDL, and then an enzyme modified with polyoxyethylene glycol is made to react thereon. International Publication <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="WO9826090A"><text>WO98/26090</text></patcit> discloses a method in which lipoproteins other than HDL are eliminated with a catalase in the first step, and HDL-C is measured by using an activator which specifically reacts on HDL in the second step. Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="JP9096637A"><text>9-96637</text></patcit> describes a method in which antibodies directed to lipoproteins other than HDL is first made to react, then HDL is dissolved, and cholesterol in HDL is measured. Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="JP11056395A"><text>11-56395</text></patcit> describes a method of measuring cholesterol in HDL by using a combination of an HDL-soluble surfactant and a dissolution inhibitor for lipoproteins other than HDL. International Patent Publication <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="WO0448605A"><text>WO04/48605</text></patcit> describes a method of measuring lipids in a specific lipoprotein by using a polycyclic polyoxyalkylene derivative. However, in these methods, in order to suppress reactions with lipoproteins other than HDL, expensive reagents such as enzymes modified with PEG and antibodies must be used.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The precipitation method is also mainly used in the field of dry chemistry, and a novel dry type test piece utilizing the direct method has been developed in recent years (Japanese Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="JP3686326B"><text>3686326</text></patcit>). Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="JP2005137360A"><text>2005-137360</text></patcit> describes that selectivity is improved by using lipase derived from <i>Candida rugosa</i>. However, cholesterol in lipoproteins other than HDL cannot be completely removed in any of such test pieces.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further, a water soluble compound comprising phenyl group substituted with 8 to 18 alkyl chains is known as a phenyl ether polyglycidol usable as a surfactant (<patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="GB1022878A"><text>GB1022878</text></patcit>). However, this compound has a problem of low affinity for aromatic organic substances, since the hydrophobic portion of the compound is an alkyl chain, and it is highly concerned that it may act as an environmental hormone since it has an alkylphenol structure. Although a polyglycidol dodecyl ether is also known (<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Sagitani, H. et al., JAOCS, Vol. 66, pp.146-152, 1989</text></nplcit>), this compound has a problem that it requires much time for synthesis thereof because the compound is produced by binding glycidol one by one, and therefore the compound is not suitable for industrial applications. Therefore, it is desired to provide a surfactant which can be used instead of these compounds.

More specifically, the object of the present invention is to provide a surfactant having high affinity for aromatic substances and having a marked ability to emulsify and disperse, and solubilize organic compositions such as organic pigments. A further object of the present invention is to provide a surfactant free from a possibility of acting as an environmental hormone.</p><heading id="h0005">Means for Achieving the Object</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">In order to achieve the aforementioned objects, it is required to provide a surfactant which selectively solubilizes HDL. Therefore, the inventors of the present invention conducted various researches on surfactants, and as a result, they found that if a polycyclic polyglycidol compound was used as a surfactant, instead of a polyoxyethylene type surfactant provided so far, HDL could be selectively solubilized,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> and also found that cholesterol in HDL could be efficiently measured with high accuracy by using such a surfactant. In particular, it was found that a polyglycidol compound represented by the following general formula (I), obtained by binding a phenyl ether substituted with an alkylphenyl group to the glycidol chain, had potent adsorptive property and affinity for aromatic substances, as well as a remarkable ability to solubilize organic compositions, the compound was useful as a surfactant which did not produce turbidity even if the temperature was elevated, and cholesterol in HDL could be very efficiently measured with high accuracy by using this surfactant.
