Suitably, the fluorocarbon chain includes at least eight fluorocarbon groups, -(CF<sub>2</sub>)<sub>8</sub>-. A spacer may also be incorporated in the chain. In some embodiments the spacer includes three or less methylene, -CH<sub>2</sub>- groups.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The B block may be formed of any suitable repeating unit which does not include mesogenic groups, i.e. the B block is a non-liquid crystal hard polymer block.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The B block may be aromatic.

The polymer compositions include at least one liquid crystal block copolymer having at least one A block and at least one B block which is a hard polymer block.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The A block is formed of mesogenic (liquid crystal) repeating units. As used herein, the term "mesogen" shall be used to refer to those structural groups which impart liquid crystal properties, such as stiffness and restriction to rotation, to the polymer. The term "mesogenic unit" as employed herein, shall be used to refer to any polymer repeating units having a mesogen. Mesogenic groups may include other structure groups, as well as spacers such as methylene groups, and linking groups.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Polymer repeating units include backbone portions which including linking groups and typically an intermediate linear or cyclic structure therebetween. Repeating units often include one or more groups pendent to the backbone polymer chains.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The mesogenic repeating unit of the present application may be said to include both a mesogenic portion and a spacer. Spacers are typically flexible and often<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> include methylene (-CH<sub>2</sub>-) groups. Flexible spacers have been found to be advantageous when inserted between the polymer backbone and the mesogenic side group, for example, to separate the motion of the polymer backbone. See, for example, <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>X. Han et al., "Synthesis and Characterization of Side-Chain Liquid Crystalline Poly[1-({[4-cyano-4'-diphenyl)oxy]alkyl}oxy)2,3-epoxypropane]", Macromolecular Chemistry and Physics, Vol. 205, pp. 743-751 (2004</text></nplcit>). The mesogenic repeating units of the A block can be attached together in such a way that the mesogen portion of the mesogenic repeating unit forms a part of the backbone (main chain liquid crystal polymer structure), or they may be attached together in such a way that the mesogen is attached to the polymer backbone as a pendant group (side chain liquid polymer structure). Examples of mesogenic repeating units employed in main chain liquid crystal polymers wherein the mesogen portion of the mesogenic repeating unit forms a part of the backbone is hydroxynaphthoic acid, and poly(p-phenyleneterephthalate).</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Liquid crystals exhibit a phase of matter which exists between a crystalline (solid) and an isotropic (liquid) phase, that has properties between those of a conventional liquid, and those of a solid crystal. For instance, a liquid crystal (LC) may flow like a liquid, but have the molecules in the liquid arranged and oriented in a crystalline way. It is the mesogen of the mesogenic repeating unit which induces the structural order, rigidity and necessary restriction on movement that allows the polymer to display these liquid crystal properties. The mesogen is typically made up of one or more aromatic rings. Suitably, each mesogenic repeating unit has at least one aromatic group per each repeating unit, and more suitably each mesogenic repeating unit has at least two aromatic groups per each repeating unit.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The B block is a hard block, providing that it is not formed of mesogenic repeating units. The block copolymer may also be of a multiblock variety including C blocks, D blocks, etc. The C block and the D block may be either be non-liquid crystal blocks or liquid crystal blocks. For example, in the case of an ABC block copolymer, the A block may be formed of a first mesogenic repeating unit, the B block may be formed of a non-mesogenic repeating unit, and the C block may be formed of a second mesogenic repeating unit different that the first mesogenic repeating unit. In some embodiments, the B block is immiscible with the A block.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The block copolymers may be of the general formula A-B diblock, A-B-A triblock and B-A-B triblock, polyblock copolymers of the formula (A-B)<sub>n</sub> where n is 1 to 20, A(B-A)<sub>n</sub> and B(A-B)<sub>n</sub> where n is 2 to 20, A-B-A-B-A pentablock, multiblock<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> polymers such as A-B-C, A-C-B or BAC triblock copolymers, B-(A-B-C)<sub>n</sub> wherein n is 3 to 20, A-B-C-D multibock copolymers, random block copolymers and alternating random block copolymers, etc.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Furthermore, branched architecture block copolymers including H-type, T-type, stars (including symmetric and heterobranched stars), combs, brushes, dendrons/hyperbranched, etc. may be employed herein.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Individual polymer blocks of a block copolymer are often referred to in the art as being either a "hard block" or a "soft block", and may be defined in terms of its Tg, the hard block having a relatively high glass transition temperature (Tg) and the soft block having a relatively low Tg. A hard block, for example, may be considered as having a high Tg of greater than room temperature or greater than about 25°C, for example, while a soft block may be considered as having a Tg of less than room temperature or less than about 25°C. However, this is intended for illustrative purposes only. For example, see <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="US6790908B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,790,908</text></patcit>, wherein the stiff block is defined as having a glass transition temperature of greater than about 50° C, and preferably greater than 100° C.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The A block, which may also be referred to herein as the mesogenic block, may include any suitable mesogenic repeating unit. In some embodiments, he mesogenic repeating unit has at least one aromatic group per unit, and more suitably the mesogenic repeating unit has at least two aromatic groups per unit. The A block of the liquid crystal block copolymer is characterized by mesogenic repeating units which can provide the liquid crystal block copolymer with stiffness resulting from restriction on rotation caused by steric hindrance and resonance. For example, aromatic ring(s) can provide both steric hindrance and resonance. Some mesogenic repeating units may include both aromatic and aliphatic rings.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The A block may contain any number of repeating units up to about 50.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Suitably, the mesogenic block has an axial ratio, defined by the length of the molecule divided by the diameter (x = L/d), of at least three. This axial ratio provides the mesogenic block with rod-like characteristics.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The mesogenic block can be formed using a variety of techniques including, but not limited to, polymerization of mesogenic monomeric repeating units, addition of mesogenic side chain groups to otherwise non-mesogenic blocks followed by sequential addition of the mesogenic block to a non-mesogenic block, chemical<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> modification of a non-mesogenic block copolymer by addition of mesogenic side chain groups, etc.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">A variety of methods can be employed in the formation of the LCP block copolymers discussed herein and some of which are discussed in more detail below. Conventional condensation reactions are commonly employed, as well as chemical modification of a precursor polymers such as through addition reactions, anionic and cationic polymerization, free radical polymerization, ring opening metathesis polymerization, coupling end-functionalized pre-polymers, group transfer polymerization, sequential sequential addition of a first block to a second block. See, for example, <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>P. Gopalan et al., "Rod-Coil Block Copolymers: An Iterative Synthetic Approach via Living Free-Radical Procedures," Journal of Polymer Science: Part A: Polymer Chemistry, Vol. 41, pp. 3640-3656 (2003</text></nplcit>), <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Hakemi, H., "On the miscibility of liquid crystalline polymers," Polymer, Vol. 41, pp. 6145-6150 (2000</text></nplcit>).</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Condensation reactions are very common in the preparation of LCP copolymers. Condensation often involves first synthesizing the end-blocks and midblocks and subsequently coupling of the end-functionalized prepolymers.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Alternating and random block copolymers have been prepared using condensation reactions. See <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="US3778410A"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 3,778,410</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0014" dnum="US3804805A"><text>3,804,805</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">ABA triblocks may also be prepared using condensation techniques. See, for example, <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>B.L. Rivas et al., "Synthesis and Characterization of Block Copolymers from Poly(p-benzamide) and Poly(propylene glycol)," Macromolecular Chemistry and Physics, Vol. 202, pp. 1053-1059 (2001</text></nplcit>).</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">However, it should be noted that for LC block copolymers formed using condensation mechanisms, some prepolymers may be more suitable for use as end blocks than others due to reactive non-equivalency of the end groups.
