This textile product is particularly suitable to be used in the clothing sector, as well as in the accessories sector, in the furnishing sector, in the household linen sector, in the underwear sector, in the automotive industry, etc.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">The present invention also refers to a manufacturing method for such a textile product.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Multilayer materials, according to the type of layers of which they are composed, are used in countless sectors such as, for example, clothing, household linen etc., thanks to the fact that they combine all the properties of the individual materials of which they are made up. Despite this, they can present some drawbacks. For example, in the clothing sector soft materials are widely used, formed, for example, of an outside in nylon fabric and an inner filling consisting of duck down. Alternatively, the inner filling can be formed of synthetic materials in the form of wadding, such as polyester, these also endowed with softness. However, these types of multilayer, if they have a duck down filling, present an unpleasant loss of feathers towards the outside. Furthermore, since duck down gives rise to allergy problems, any filling thus formed must be pretreated before being used in the manufacture of articles of clothing. Moreover, multilayer materials having the fillings as described above prove bulky because they generally appear in a "puffed up" form. The same problems occur in the case of bed covers like bed quilts. Thus, despite their water repellence and high heat insulating capacity, these multilayers prove unsuitable for particular uses, for example, in the production of technical articles that require both a high heat insulating capacity and also a non "puffed up" form because they must be close-fitting clothes with little bulk.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Object of the present invention is to find an alternative material to multiplayer materials, for example the heat insulating materials used in the clothing sector, that is soft, light, non allergenic, not bulky, with good mechanical strength, possibly water<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> repellent and with heat insulating properties, eliminating the drawbacks of the prior art, and that is also highly aesthetically pleasing.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">This object is achieved in accordance with the invention with the multilayer textile material having the characteristics listed in appended independent claim 1.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Advantageous embodiments of the invention are apparent from the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A further object is that of providing a process for preparing said textile material that is simple and practical</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">This object is achieved with the process having the characteristics listed in appended independent claim 9.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The quilted multilayer textile material according to the invention comprises an essentially transparent outer covering formed by a polymer material and an inner filling for said casing consisting of textile fibres, natural or otherwise, wherein said fibres are in the form of "tops" and/or web, optionally matted.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Said outer covering is formed of two cloths, an outer one and an inner one, which enclose the fibres in the form of tops and/or a web as in a bag: said tops are therefore sandwiched between the two cloths.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the present invention what is meant by "tops" and web is two of the specific physical structures in which non woven textile fibres can be presented depending upon how the staple has been processed.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">"Web" (carded web) stands for a fibrous material deriving from the carding stage of textile staple fibres. Said web is also indicated in the art by the term "carded web" or "carded sliver". Carding is a process that is carried out using rotating cylinders provided with curved metal tips which raise the fluff of the staple fibre at the same time eliminating impurities.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The fibre webs appear as flat textile structures whose cohesion is generally due to the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> each single staple fibre's own adhesive power after they have been subjected to carding. The fibres in said webs are generally twisted or bound to one another and not aligned with one another.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The carded web generally has a thickness of at least 0.5 cm.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is also possible to use as "web" the material deriving from carding of the tops.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">What is meant by "top(s)" is a mat of fibres aligned with each other deriving from the stage of combing of the above defined carded web. What is meant by combing is the process whereby special machines provided with combs smooth the fibres of the carded web and lay them parallel in the direction of the machine, producing a combed sliver, also defined as a top, which proves more homogeneous and less woolly than its precursor, the carded sliver. The top is often also identified by the term "sliver".</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In tops the fibres are thus essentially parallel, and prove physically more orderly than the fibres contained in carded webs and in so-called "nonwoven" fabrics but they are less bound to one another. For this reason slight twisting is applied to the tops to give the combed fibres a minimum of cohesion. The mat of tops is generally cylindrical in shape, even if it can present in the form of long slivers, with a regular section, of fibres of discontinuous length and substantially parallel, slightly twisted.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The fibres in the above described forms of "tops" and web do not have the mechanical consistency of a yarn, a woven material or a nonwoven fabric but are extremely soft and light and the escape of fibre fibrils is considerably reduced compared with staples of the same fibre.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Said tops and webs, even if they consist of nonwoven fibres, are different from the materials normally defined as nonwoven fabrics.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In fact, in nonwoven fabric or materials, the fibre is transformed into fabric by subjecting the carded web to further cohesioning processes such as mechanical needle punching or hydroentangling. In fact the processes of carding and combing alone are not sufficient to transform the fibres into fabrics or nonwoven fabrics since they do not<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> provide the fibres with sufficient mechanical cohesion as necessary for nonwoven fabrics.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Furthermore, said tops and web are different from what is generally indicated as padding in that padding has a very "puffed up" appearance, unlike webs and tops, in that it serves as stuffing to fill mattresses and other parts to be filled. In fact padding is a synthetic fabric formed by a mass of fibres which give a lot of volume, much more than webs and tops.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The material of the fibre used in the tops and/or web which go to make up the filling can be chosen from natural fibres, non natural fibres like synthetic fibres and artificial fibres, or mixtures thereof, which can be presented in the form of tops and/or a web. Tops and/or a web of natural fibres are preferably used.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Sheep wool, goat wool, Geelong wool, merino wool, cashmere, alpaca, mohair, angora, cotton, linen, silk, hemp etc. can be cited as examples of natural fibres. Geelong wool means the most prized part of sheep wool and represents the so-called "hair".</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Viscose, rayon etc. can be cited as examples of artificial fibres.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The same fibres described later for the outer covering can be used as synthetic fibres.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">It is also possible to use as filling "tops" or webs of a blend of two or more fibres, natural or non natural, in an intimate mixture.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">What is meant herein by "intimate mixture" is the mixing of staples deriving from fibres of different materials.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">When fibres in the form of a web are used for the filling, it is possible to place the carded webs one on top of the other in a series of layers, even of fibres differing from one another. The final thickness of the multilayer material is a function of the number of layers.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The "tops" and/or webs used in the present invention can be dyed with chemical or natural dyes or can maintain their natural colour.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">As stated above, the tops and/or webs used in the textile material of the present invention can also be matted.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">What is meant herein by "matted tops or webs" is webs or tops subjected to a matting treatment such as, for example, machine washing at a temperature of 40°C or higher, generally 70°C, which causes a shortening of the length of the fibres and consequently a slight decrease in the initial softness of the fibres but a greater mechanical compactness due to sticking together of the fibres.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">What is meant herein by "matting" is all those treatments of the fibres in hot solutions, above 40°C, which cause fulling of the fibres and/or shortening thereof. Said matting can also be obtained during the dying process of the textile material of the present invention as will be explained later in detail. In fact, during dying the fibres of the articles are subjected to boiling in the dying solution at a temperature of 95°.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The matted webs or tops are also endowed with heat insulating properties, softness, and no "puffed up" appearance, similarly to non matted webs, but they display a greater mechanical strength.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The outer covering consists of cloths of essentially transparent polymer material.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">What is meant herein by "essentially transparent" covering is those coverings that do not provide complete visual covering of the filling below but allow the existence of said filling to be perceived visually. Included, therefore, are all possible degrees of transparency, for example veiled or opaque, which non concealing fabrics can take on; included in particular are transparent fabrics, veiled fabrics, also in the same colour, etc., and which optionally have on the surface prints, polka dots, jacquards, appliqués, etc. which do not cause complete covering of said surface.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Said cloths of polymer material can be a fabric of artificial fibre or a fabric of synthetic fibre, preferably of synthetic fibre.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Viscose, rayon, acetate, lyocell etc. can be cited as artificial fibres. Acrylic, polyamide, polyester, polyurethane, Teflon, polyester, polypropylene fibres, etc. can be cited as synthetic fibres.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The transparent outer covering material can be chosen, for example, from polyamide fabrics such as nylon; polyester fabrics; fabrics made of polyurethane fibres, Teflon fibres, acrylic fibres and other polymer materials used in the textile sector. Furthermore, the outer fabric can be a fabric as described above subsequently made hydrophilic by the conventional methods, for example by coating.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Examples of synthetic/artificial transparent fabrics are georgette, organza, chiffon, etc..</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Alternatively, the same polymer materials described above can be used for the outer covering but in the nonwoven form (not in the form of woven cloths), for example in the form of sheets or films, preferably chosen from polyamide, polyester, polyurethane, Teflon, and acrylic polymers.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">It is also possible, in another embodiment of the invention, to make the inner cloth from a different material from that of the outer cloth, in particular even with a different material from those indicated above for the covering, for example lining material, cotton, etc. This textile material comprising three different layers can be obtained according the process described below.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The multilayer material of the present invention can optionally be in quilted form. This last embodiment is the preferred one.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">When the multilayer textile material of the present invention is quilted it can have quilted stitching of different thicknesses or stitches sewn to secure the different materials used in the casing and in the filling. Furthermore said material can also be presented as a quilt of different possible sizes.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The final thickness of the multilayer material according to the invention is not binding for the purposes of the present invention but is a function of the final use of the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> material.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">It is also possible to provide for the possible presence of one or more layers of tulle between a cloth and the fibres in order to have a further support for said fibres.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In a preferred embodiment the multilayer quilted material comprises:
<ul><li>an outer covering (casing) formed by two cloths and essentially transparent formed by a polymer material chosen from an artificial fibre fabric, a synthetic fibre fabric, and a nonwoven polymer material in sheet form, said sheet being chosen from polyamide, polyester, polyurethane, Teflon, and acrylic polymers,</li><li>an inner filling for said casing consisting of textile fibres, natural and/or non natural, preferably natural, in the form of tops and/or web.</li></ul></p><p id="p0047" num="0047">One embodiment of the multilayer textile material according to the invention provides for an outer covering (casing) of nylon or polyurethane fabric, and a filling formed of a plurality of layers formed by cashmere fibres in the form of a web, preferably matted, and the multilayer textile material is preferably quilted.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The fibres in the form of tops and/or web are much softer than nonwoven fabrics since the latter are subjected to mechanical cohesioning processes to give them strength. Therefore their use in the preparation of textile materials is advantageous with respect to the use of nonwoven fabrics, even though the type of material of the fibres is the same, for example cashmere.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The multilayer textile material of the present invention can be obtained, for example, by first preparing the casing by coupling of two cloths of the outer material, or by coupling a cloth of the outer material with the cloth of the inner covering material, closing one end of said casing, then filling the casing with tops and/or web, and subsequently closing the other end, after optional pressing of the material to remove air.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">At the end of this stage a non-quilted, three-layered textile material is obtained, which is a precursor of the quilted textile material of the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Filling of the casing with fibres in the form of tops and/or web can take place, for example, by housing said tops and/or web between two cardboard sheets so as to keep them in the form of a flat web, subsequently removing said cardboard sheets.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The material obtained in the preceding stage is then preferably subjected to quilting, giving rise to the quilted textile material of the present invention.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Once the three-layered quilted material has been obtained as described above, it is possible, after quilting, to carry out a subsequent stage of matting treatment, chosen from:
<ul><li>washing in hot water, for example 70°C, to mat the filling, preferably when the filling is in the form of a web; or</li><li>dying to obtain colouring both of the filling and of the outer casing if these are initially colourless.</li></ul></p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The dying stage is preferable when the filling has a neutral colour but it is required to be coloured: in fact with a single operation it is possible to obtain simultaneously a matted and coloured filling.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">At the end of this stage a three-layered quilted material is obtained whose inner filling is tops and/or a web of matted fibres.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">This textile material in which the filling is matted presents the same technical qualities as the non matted material such as high heat insulating capacity, minimal bulk, non puffed-up appearance and water repellence, but a slightly different appearance.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Once the filling has been matted, it is then possible, if water repellence is not required, to remove the outer layer (cloth) of the casing in order to give a more different appearance with respect to the non matted precursor material, though without changing the heat insulating capacity, the minimal bulk, and the non puffed-up appearance. This textile material is essentially at least two-layered.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Alternatively, it is also possible after quilting and matting to eliminate the inner layer (cloth), obtaining the two-layered textile material of the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Therefore, starting from the final three-layered product following matting, the outer layer, or the inner layer, can also be removed, there thus remaining the matted webs and/or tops exposed to view and touch. The outer and inner layers (cloths) which contain the fibres initially form part of the fabric (quilt) and are essential as a container to obtain compactness and formation of the fabric of the present invention.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The multilayer material of the present invention is suitable to be used as textile material in various sectors. For example in the clothing sector for manufacturing outerwear (down jackets or jackets), knitwear, shirts, bags, etc.; in the furnishing sector, for example, for covering sofas, chairs, headboards of beds, etc.; in the household linen sector for manufacturing, for example, bed quilts, etc.; and likewise in the underwear sector. Furthermore said multilayer material can be used in the automotive industry, for example for covering car seats.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">The multilayer material of the present invention proves to have the advantage of being softer and lighter than fabrics of the prior art with the same performance, for example heat insulation, thanks to the use of fibres in the form of tops and/or web, also in matted form. Furthermore said filling does not require anti-allergenic treatments as duck down does. In addition said multilayer material does not show loss of fibre fibrils, and is not bulky because it does not present a "puffed up" look.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In addition, when the inner filling is coloured, the contrast between the transparent outer covering and the inner material also makes the multilayer textile material highly aesthetically pleasing.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">If the aesthetic appearance is unimportant for the purposes of the end use, it is possible to use the multilayer textile material as above defined wherein the outer casing is made from the same materials indicated above for the casing but opaque and not transparent.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Numerous changes and modifications of detail within the reach of a person skilled in the art can be made to the present embodiments of the invention without thereby departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980145" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Mehrschichtigen gesteppte Textilmaterial, umfassend:
