The invention also relates to the uses of the device.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">A draft safety regulation requires all passenger-carrying vessels to have on board rescue equipment that is suitable for the recovery of a person in the water, for example, in a man-overboard situation.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">There are several rescue devices currently used on vessels for the purpose of sea rescue and recovery. The simplest arrangement is a scramble net comprising a web of ropes. However, such an arrangement is difficult to deploy and use in practice. Furthermore, it is recognised that to minimise the risk of post-rescue collapse and heart failure caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure, a casualty recovered from the water should be maintained in a horizontal position.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">One of the most commonly used pieces of rescue equipment is the "Jason's Cradle ®", manufactured by Land and Marine Products (LMP). It enables a person who may be exhausted, injured or unconscious to be rescued from the sea by recovering the person in a horizontal position within the cradle. It can also be used as a scramble net or a stretcher. The Jason's Cradle ® is made from sections of rigid plastic that are linked together with stainless steel rods to form a grid or network. Disadvantageously, the purchase and servicing of the cradle is expensive. Furthermore, the plastic cradle is bulky and takes up a large amount of storage space. This is especially inconvenient on a small rescue boat or inflatable craft.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Alternatively the "Dacon Rescue Frame" is also used for rescue and recovery. It is made from parallel glass fibre rods connected together by lengths of webbing which lie at right angles to the rods. The lengths of webbing are made from a flexible material, which is fastened to the rods using metal rivets.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Typically, such rescue devices are attached by an inboard end to one side of a boat or ship, the middle being lowered into the water using a bridle, rope, winch or boathook attached to the outboard end. An individual to be rescued is located in the rescue device in a horizontal position and the outboard end of the rescue device is then raised to bring the individual aboard.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Stretchers are also commonly used rescue devices. The Neil Robertson Stretcher, currently used by the Royal Navy and NATO, was devised in the early 1900s. It is manufactured using canvas and wooden battens. Unfortunately, the battens are susceptible to mildew and rot in damp conditions e.g. on-board a boat, and the canvas can be difficult to clean after use.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO9966165A"><text>WO-A-99/66165</text></patcit> discloses a separate area of endeavour, namely lightweight climbing equipment (so-called "Fibrelight Ladders"). The ladder has carbon fibre rungs enclosed in a sheath made from a flexible material. Either end of each sheath is attached to perpendicular linking webbing elements using bar tack stitching, the linking webbing elements forming either side of the ladder. This type of device is not suitable for sea rescue equipment as it is not wide enough to support an injured or exhausted person being pulled out of the sea in a horizontal position.</p><p id="p0009"

The device 1 comprises a number of (e.g. four) horizontal glass fibre rods 2, each encased within a flexible sheath 7 of tubular polyester construction. Alternatively, the rods 2 are made from a composite material, metal or a fibre, such as carbon fibre. Each sheath 7 has two flanges 3 opposite each other as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 2</figref> and thus forms horizontal webbing. The flanges 3 extend radially outwards away from the rod 2 by 2cm although distances between 1 cm and 8cm would also<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> be suitable. The rods 2 are arranged in parallel and they are connected together by a number of (e.g. five) vertical lengths of webbing 4 which are also made from woven polyester or other synthetic fibre. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 4</figref> the vertical webbing elements 4 are at right angles to the rods 2 and are secured to the flanges 3 of the tubular webbing encasing the rods 2 by sewing 5 or by welding. The width of the tubular webbing 7 is preferably similar to the width of the linking webbing elements 4. The horizontal tubular webbing 7 and vertical linking webbing 4 are both uniformly spaced so the device 1 comprises a grid of rods 2 encased in horizontal webbing and vertical linking webbing 4. The rods 2 are spaced apart by 30 cm and the vertical linking webbing elements 4 are also spaced apart from each other by 30 cm to form a square. The whole rescue device 1 is approximately 1.2m wide (the length of the rigid rods 2) x 3m long (the length of the linking webbing elements 4). The width and length of the device can be adjusted as necessary, e.g. the width can be as small as 60cm.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The horizontal rod 2 at one end of the rescue device 1 is for attachment to a vessel and defines the inboard end 8 of the rescue device 1. The horizontal rod 2 at the other end of the rescue device 1 defines the outboard end 9 of the rescue device 1. At either or both the inboard and outboard ends 8, 9 of the device 1 there are flexible loops 6 extending from the vertical webbing 4.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">It is to be appreciated that in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> the horizontal rods 2 are secured at right angles to the vertical webbing 4 without the need for metal components. Furthermore, the polyester weave from which the vertical and horizontal webbing elements 4, 7 are made is resistant to photo-degradation and sea water.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In preferred embodiments of the present invention, at each section where it joins the horizontal webbing 7 the vertical webbing 4 bifurcates and rejoins in order to form a pocket 11 into which the rigid rod 2 encased in the tubular sheath 7 is inserted and secured by sewing, as exemplified in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 2</figref>. It is particularly preferred that the vertical webbing 4 is a double thickness woven material and the pockets are formed by two single thickness sections of the material, which lie on either side of the horizontal webbing 7.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0058" num="0058">In preferred embodiments the sewing 5 that secures the horizontal tubular webbing 7 and the vertical linking webbing 4 comprises continuous stitching along the length of the flange 3, parallel to the rigid rod 2. In alternative embodiments the horizontal tubular webbing 7 and the vertical linking webbing 4 are secured by zig-zag stitching that spans the depth of the flange 3, but continuous stitching is generally more practical.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In alternative embodiments of the present invention, the width and length of the device 1 is varied depending on the size of the rescue vessel. Furthermore, the number of rods 2 and linking webbing elements 4 that the device 1 comprises may be varied.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">In some embodiments of the present invention, the rescue device additionally comprises a number of the horizontal webbing elements that are of plain construction (i.e. flat) rather than being tubular with flanges 3 and containing rods 2. The purpose of the plain webbing rungs is to increase the support of the cradle without adding bulk and weight.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In further embodiments the length of the device 1 can vary from 1m to 20m. In still further embodiments the rods are spaced between 15cm to 60cm apart and the vertical webbing 4 is spaced between 15cm and 60cm from each other.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In a further embodiment of the present invention, there are floatation devices attached to the outboard end 9, or both the inboard and outboard ends 8, 9, of the device 1 to prevent the ends 8, 9 from sinking in the water, or to hold the inboard end away from the sides of the rescue vessel.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">In use, the rescue device 1 of the present invention is secured by a rigid rod 2 at the inboard end 8 of the device 1 to a rescue vessel (not shown). A rope or bridle is attached to the loops of the outboard end 9 and the middle section 10 of the device 1, between the inner and outboard ends 8, 9, is lowered into the water a short distance away from the vessel. The middle section 10 of the device 1 sinks in the water, enabling a person who may be exhausted or injured to manoeuvre themselves, or a person who may be unconscious to be guided, onto the device 1, substantially parallel to the rods 2. The device could also be manoeuvred under the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> body of the casualty. The outboard end 9 of the device 1 is then retrieved and pulled upwards and towards the vessel using the rope, so rolling or "parbuckling" the person lying on the device 1 onto the vessel. The size of the device 1 is adjusted to be suitable for the size vessel it is used on.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the rescue device 1 is used as a scramble net. The inboard end 8 of the device 1 is secured to the vessel and the rest of the device 1 is lowered over the side of the vessel, allowing multiple people to climb up or down the net simultaneously using the rigid rods 2 as the rungs of a ladder. The device 1 is particularly suitable for climbing because the rigid rods 2 give firm footholds, making it easier to ascend or descend.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">In a further embodiment of the present invention exemplified in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 3</figref>, the rescue device 1 is completely detached from the vessel and used as a stretcher or cradle to carry an injured or exhausted person.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">In one variation of this embodiment the rigid rods 2 are spaced at 15cm intervals, but alternatively the rods 2 can be positioned at intervals ranging from 10cm to 60cm. The device also comprises additional flexible webbing strips parallel to the rigid rods 2. The close spacing of the rods 2 together with the additional flexible webbing strips gives the cradle 1 a substantially solid surface area. This is advantageous when using the device as a cradle because the filled in surface area provides more support and greater comfort for the exhausted or injured person being carried in the cradle. In a further aspect of this embodiment handles or loops 6 are provided that are connected to the rigid rods 2 of the device 1. In use the outermost rigid rods 8, 9 of the cradle 1 are fastened together to contain the body.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">In an alternative embodiment the rescue device 1 is used in air-sea rescue and is lowered into the sea from a rescue helicopter. In this embodiment the rods 2 at the inboard and outboard ends 8, 9 of the device 1 are secured to a line that is attached to the helicopter. The person to be rescued lies horizontally on the device 1, parallel to the horizontal rods 2, and the device 1 folds around the person into a cradle shape as the device 1 is lifted out of the water.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0068" num="0068">In an alternative embodiment of the invention the rescue device 1 is used when climbing, caving or working at height on a construction or building site, high above the ground. In a situation where a person has fallen from a height and is suspended in the air wearing a safety harness, there is a danger of suspension trauma, which can cause permanent injury and death. The rescue device 1 is lowered to enable the suspended person to lie horizontally and restore blood flow to the brain.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">In a still further embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 5</figref>, the device 1 is modified for use as a stretcher. There is provided a series of rigid rods 2 each encased in a flexible sheath 7 with two flanges 3 extending radially from each rigid rod 2. As in the previous embodiments, the rigid rods 2 are connected to linking webbing elements 4 by sewing or welding the linking webbing elements 4 to the flanges 3 of the tubular webbing encasing the rods 2. There is a core area 11 where four rigid rods 2 are arranged in parallel every 30 cm. Alternatively, the core area can comprise between two and eight rigid rods 2 spaced at intervals ranging from every 15cm to every 60cm. The rods in the core area 11 are of a uniform length of 2m, but the length can range between 1.2m and 2.5m.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">At a first end 12 of the stretcher 1, there are panels 14 comprising further rigid rods 2 that are arranged symmetrically on either side of the core area 11. Each rigid rod 2 in the panel 14 is encased within a sheath 7 of tubular flexible material, and each sheath 7 has two flanges 3 extending radially outwards from the rigid rod 2. The additional panels 14 each comprise two rigid rods 2 that are spaced at 20cm intervals. Alternatively, the panels 14 can comprise up to five rigid rods 2 and the spacing can range from 15cm to 60cm. The rods 2 are attached to the core area 11 by the continuous linking webbing elements 4 which extend from the core area 11. The linking webbing elements 4 within the panels 14 are of plain construction (i.e. flat) and do not bifurcate either side of the sheath 7 and rigid rods 2. The linking webbing elements 4 are secured to the flanges 3 of the tubular webbing encasing the rods 2 by sewing or welding. The length of the rods 2 in the panels 14 is 0.75m, but can alternatively be between 0.5m and 1m. The rods 2 in the panels 14 are not in parallel with the rods 2 of the core area 11.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">At approximately the mid-point of the stretcher there is an additional mid-panel 15 of rigid rods 2 on either side of the core area 11. The mid-panels 15 comprise two rigid<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> rods 2, and the rods are spaced at 30cm intervals. Alternatively, the mid-panels 15 can comprise between two to five rigid rods 2 and the spacing can be between 15cm to 60cm. Each rigid rod 2 in the mid-panel 15 is encased within a sheath 7 of tubular flexible material, and each sheath 7 has two flanges 3 extending radially outwards from the rigid rod 2. The rigid rods 2 of the mid-panel 15 are attached to the core area 11 by the continuous linking webbing elements 4 in the same way as described for the lower panels 14. The length of the rigid rods 2 in the mid-panel 15 is 0.5m, but alternatively can range from 25cm to 1 m. The rods 2 of the mid-panel 15 are arranged in parallel with the rods 2 of the core area 11 and they are longer than the distance between adjacent webbing elements 4. Therefore, one end of the rigid rods 2 in the mid-panel are not connected to the core area 11 by a linking webbing element 4. Instead, an additional linking webbing element 16 connects the rigid rods 2 within the mid-panel 15 together but it does not extend towards the core area 11. Loops 6 are provided at the second end 13 of the stretcher 1. The loops 6 are continuous from the flexible sheath 7 surrounding the rigid rods 2 in the core area 11.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">Preferably, there are quick release buckles and straps present on both sets of panels 14,15 to enable a person to be secured into the stretcher (not shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 5</figref>), and there are loops 6 at the first end 12 of the stretcher 1. The loops 6 are continuous from the flexible sheath 7 of the tubular webbing surrounding the rigid rods 2 in the core area 11. Additionally, there is provided a strap of flexible material that runs parallel to the linking webbing elements 4 of the stretcher 1. The strap is positioned at approximately the mid-point of the stretcher, behind the mid-panels 15.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">In use, a person is positioned on the stretcher 1 so that their feet are at the first end 12 of the stretcher 1 and their head is at the second end 13. The panels 14, 15 are wrapped one over the other in order to secure the person on the stretcher 1. The angle of the rods 2 in the panels 14 at the first end 12 of the stretcher 1 in relation to the rods 2 of the core section 11 is such that the panels 14 taper in towards the first end 12 of the stretcher 1. The shape of the mid-panels 15 enables them to be fastened under the arms of the casualty and secured around their torso. If the casualty is unconscious then the additional strap is used to secure their arms by their sides. The loops 6 at the second end 13 of the stretcher enable the stretcher to be lifted vertically when a person is strapped into the stretcher. The loops 6 at the first end 12 of the stretcher can be connected to ropes that are used to guide and<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> stabilise the stretcher whilst it is lifted. Alternatively, the loops 6 are used as mounting points for foot stirrups. The fact that the panels 14 are tapered results in the stretcher being secured more tightly at the first end 12 around a person's feet, and so prevents the person from slipping downwards in the stretcher when it is lifted vertically by the loops 6 at the second end 13. This feature, and the fact that the mid-panels 15 are wrapped around the torso of the casualty, enables the casualty to be fastened securely in the stretcher. This is particularly important if the casualty has a spinal injury.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">In a still further embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref> there is provided a device for removing a corpse or debris from the water. There are provided four or more rigid rods 2, at least two of which are situated at either end 8, 9 of the device. The rods 2 are arranged in parallel and are encased in a flexible sheath 7 with at least one radially extending flange 3. Also provided are two or more strips of flexible linking webbing 4, which are attached to the flanges 3 of the tubular webbing 7 encasing the rigid rods 2 by means of sewing or welding as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>. The flexible linking webbing 4 is arranged perpendicular to the rigid rods 2. A linking webbing element 4 is attached to each end of the rigid rods 2, so as to form a rectangle or square network network of rigid rods 2 and linking webbing elements 4. The dimensions of the device are 2mx3m, but the device can be any size between 1 mx1 m to 4mx4m. A sheet of fabric mesh 17 is attached to the flanges 3 of the tubular material encasing the outermost rigid rods 2 and the linking webbing elements 4 to enable to device to act as a net. The mesh fabric allows water to pass through it easily so the device does not become waterlogged after it has been submerged beneath the water.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">In a variation of this embodiment, extra linking webbing elements 4 are connected between the rigid rods 2, in parallel to the outermost linking webbing elements 4. Also, further linking webbing elements 4 can be connected between the outermost linking webbing elements 4, parallel to the rigid rods 2.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">In use the device described in this embodiment is suitable for recovering and containing a body until the time-point at which the body is disposed. It comprises a minimal number of rigid rods 2 which lowers the overall cost of the device. The device can be disposable.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0077" num="0077">In a still further embodiment as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 7</figref> there is provided a device that is an improvement on the 'Fibrelight Ladder' described in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO9966165A"><text>WO-A-99/66165</text></patcit>. In this embodiment the rigid rods 2 of the ladder are encased in a flexible sheath 7 with radially extending flanges 3. The rigid rods are 20cm in length, although lengths of between 15cm and 30cm are also suitable. The flanges 3 are 2.5mm to 2cm wide, preferably 5mm wide. Either end of the rod 2 is attached to a linking webbing element 4 so there are two linking webbing elements 4 in total. The rod 2 and flexible sheath 7 is attached to the linking webbing element 4. At the point where the tubular webbing sheaths 7 are attached, the linking webbing elements 4 bifurcates and rejoins in order to form a pocket 11 into which the rigid rod 2 encased in the tubular sheath 7 is inserted and secured by sewing. The linking webbing elements 4 are spaced at intervals ranging from every 15cm to 60cm, preferably every 30cm. The rods 2 are uniformly spaced at 15cm to 60cm intervals, preferably at 30cm intervals, along the linking webbing elements 4. In alternative embodiments floatation devices are attached to the ladder.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">In a preferred version of this embodiment, the tubular webbing sheaths 7 extend beyond the ends of the rigid rod 2. These ends of the tubular webbing sheaths 7 are folded back on themselves and secured into the pocket 11 of the linking webbing elements 4 by sewing. The purpose of this is to prevent to rigid rods 2 from moving within the tubular webbing sheaths 7.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">In use, this embodiment of the device of the present invention can be climbed like a rope ladder. Because the weight of an individual climbing the ladder is distributed, through each rigid rod 2, across the entire width of the linking webbing elements 4, strain and wear on the material from which the flexible sheaths 7 and the linking webbing elements 4 is made is minimised.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">In an alternative version of this embodiment, there is provided a device wherein the length of the rigid rod 2 is increased to 30cm, although lengths of between 25cm to 60cm are also suitable. The purpose of the extended length of the rigid rod 2 is to enable the ladder to be climbed more quickly by multiple persons. The extra weight of the second person is supported by increasing the diameter of the rigid rod 2. In a further version of this embodiment, there is provided an additional linking webbing<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> element 4 attached to the rigid rods 2. The additional linking webbing element 4 is positioned parallel to the linking webbing elements 4, preferably half way between the outermost linking webbing elements 4.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">In a still further version, there is provided a device comprising three linking webbing elements 4 and a plurality of rigid rods 2 that bridge two out of the three linking webbing elements 4. The rigid rods are 20 cm long, although lengths of between 15cm to 30cm are also suitable. The rigid rods 2 are spaced at 20cm intervals on alternating sides of the middle linking webbing element 4, although intervals of 15cm to 30cm are also suitable.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">In the above-described embodiments, the rigid rods 2 are cylindrical having a diameter of 15mm. However, in alternative embodiments the horizontal rods 2 are made from carbon fibre and are 10mm in diameter, resulting in the device 1 being lighter. In further embodiments, the diameter of the rods 2 is between 5mm and 25mm, preferably between 8mm and 15mm. In still further embodiments, different rods 2 are made from different materials. In alternative embodiments, the rods 2 are all made from the same material and weights are provided at the mid point to cause the middle section 10 of the device 1, between the inboard and outboard
