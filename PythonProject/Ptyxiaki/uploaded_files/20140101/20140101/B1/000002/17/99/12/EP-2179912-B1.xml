invention relates to a scooter type vehicle according to the preamble of independent claim 1.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Description of Related Art</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP10226374A"><text>JP 10-226374 A</text></patcit> describes a scooter type vehicle having a front cover for covering a frontward area of a head pipe, a leg shield for covering a rearward area of the head pipe, and a foot board joined to a lower part of the leg shield. The scooter type vehicle has a headlight fitted to an upper portion of the front cover. It also has flashers fitted on the left and right of the front cover.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A steering shaft is supported rotatably by a head pipe. A handlebar is secured to a top end portion of the steering shaft. A front fork is secured to a bottom end portion of the steering shaft. A front wheel is supported rotatably by a lower end portion of the front fork The upper half portion of the front wheel is covered by a movable type front fender that turns together with the handlebar.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The movable type front fender has the mudguard function to prevent the rider from being splashed with the mud thrown up by the front wheel. With the movable type front fender, it is possible to prevent the rider sufficiently from being splashed with mud even if the front cover is not particularly large. Thus, the above-described scooter type vehicle enables the front cover to be compact in size while ensuring a sufficient mudguard function. Moreover, the movable type front fender can turn together with the front wheel; therefore, unlike the stationary type front fender, it is not necessary to cover a wide area that surrounds the front wheel. As a result, the scooter type vehicle enables the front fender to be compact while ensuring a sufficient mudguard function.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A scooter type vehicle in which a handle cover that is a separate part from the front<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> cover is provided in front of the handlebar and a headlight or flashers is/are provided in the handle cover is know. In this scooter type vehicle, the handle cover tends to be large in size because the handle cover needs to have a space for installing the headlight or flashers. In the scooter type vehicle described in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP10226374A"><text>JP 10-226374A</text></patcit>, however, a headlight and left and right flashers are fitted to an upper portion of the front cover that covers a frontward area of the head pipe. For this reason, the scooter type vehicle described in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP10226374A"><text>JP 10-226374A</text></patcit> enables a portion surrounding the handlebar to be compact in size.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Nevertheless, in the scooter type vehicle described in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP10226374A"><text>JP 10-226374A</text></patcit>, the headlight and the left and right flashers are arrayed at an upper portion of the front cover along a vehicle width direction. For this reason, it is necessary to ensure a sufficient gap between the headlight and the left and right flashers in order to ensure visibility of the light from the headlight and the light from the left and right flashers. To ensure the just-mentioned gap, it is necessary to make an upper portion of the front cover large along a vehicle width direction. This results in the problem that the front portion of the vehicle becomes large.<br/>
Further, there is known a scooter type vehicle with the elements of the preamble of claim 1 from <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="EP0953500A"><text>EP 0 953 500</text></patcit>.

The rear frame portion 6C is joined to the down frame portion 6B by welding, for example. A foot board 70 is provided above the rear frame portion 6C. The foot board 70 is joined to a lower part of the front cover 2. The front cover 2 and the foot board 70 constitute a vehicle body cover 90. A seat 71 is provided obliquely<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> above and at the rear of the foot board 70. It should be noted that <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is merely for illustrating the body frame 6, and the specific shape of the front cover 2 therein is different from that of the embodiment (i.e., that having a shape as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>). In addition, a later-described flasher 65 and so forth are not depicted in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the motor scooter 1 is furnished with a front wheel 3 and a front fork 4 for supporting the front wheel 3. The front fork 4 has a pair of left and right fork pipes 5L and 5R, a steering shaft 7 (see <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>) supported rotatably by the head pipe 6A, an under bracket 8 for joining a lower end portion of the steering shaft 7 to the fork pipes 5L and 5R. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref>, the steering shaft 7 is supported at the center of the under bracket 8. The fork pipes 5L and 5R are supported so as to be on the left and right of a portion of the under bracket 8 at which the steering shaft 7 is supported. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, what is called a movable type front fender 9 is disposed above the front wheel 3. The front fender 9 is one example of the "mudguard body" of the present invention. The front fender 9 is positioned below the under bracket 8. The front fender 9 is secured to the under bracket 8. The fork pipes 5L and 5R pierce through the front fender 9 and extend obliquely in a rearward and upward direction. When the rider turns a handlebar 10, the steering shaft 7, the fork pipes 5L and 5R, and the under bracket 8 turn accordingly, causing the front wheel 3 to turn. The front fender 9 turns in association with the turning of the handlebar 10. The front fender 9 turns together with the under bracket 8. <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10A</figref> shows the state in which the handlebar 10 is turned to the right, and <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10B</figref> shows the state in which the handlebar 10 is turned to the left. Here, the front fender 9 may be positioned above the under bracket 8. In addition, the front fender 9 may be disposed so as to surround the surrounding area of the under bracket 8 without vertically overlapping the under bracket 8.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>, the handlebar 10 is disposed on top of and at the rear of the head pipe 6A. A handle cover 11 is provided for the handlebar 10. The handle cover 11 covers at least a frontward area of the handlebar 10. The handle cover 11 is formed of a separate part from the front cover 2.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The front cover 2 comprises the center cover 30, side covers 60L and 60R, a rear cover 80 (see <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>), and an inner fender 81 (see <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref>). The center cover 30, the left side cover 60L, and the right side cover 60R are separate parts that are assembled together. They may also be<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> provided for integral in other embodiments. The center cover 30 is disposed in front of the head pipe 6A. The side covers 60L and 60R are joined to the center cover 30. The rear cover 80 is positioned at the rear of the head pipe 6A. The rear cover 80 is joined to the center cover 30 and the side covers 60L and 60R. The front cover 2 of the present embodiment corresponds to the "front cover portion" of the present invention. It should be noted that the front cover 2 of the present embodiment is merely one illustrative example, and ones having a cover with a different, in particular subdivided, configuration are also within the scope of the present invention. For example, each of the side covers 60L and 60R may be divided vertically into two parts. In addition, the rear cover 80 may comprise a plurality of covers. The foot board 70, preferably, is joined seamlessly to the rear cover 80.</p><heading id="h0007"><u>&lt;&lt;Center Cover&gt;&gt;</u></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the center cover 30 is disposed above the front wheel 3 as viewed from the front. More specifically, the center cover 30 is disposed above the front fender 9. As viewed from the front, the center cover 30 is disposed below a handle cover 11. In the present embodiment, a lower end portion of the handle cover 11 is placed inside the center cover 30. In other words, the lower end portion of the handle cover 11 and the upper end portion of the center cover 30 overlap with each other vertically. It should be noted that the lower end portion of the handle cover 11 may be positioned upward of the upper end portion of the center cover 30. In other words, the lower end portion of the handle cover 11 and the upper end portion of the center cover 30 may not overlap with each other vertically.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the center cover 30 slopes down forward, as viewed from a side of the vehicle. The entire center cover 30 is curved so that its vehicle-widthwise outer side portions are positioned rearward of its vehicle-widthwise center portion. In other words, the center cover 30 is curved so as to surround a surrounding area of the head pipe 6A (see <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>). The center cover 30 has a bulging portion 30f bulging forward toward a headlight opening 40. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the center cover 30 includes bottom outer end portions 30A each of which is formed in such a shape as to be closer and closer to the vehicle-widthwise center as its level lowers, as viewed from the front, and top outer end portions 30B each of which is positioned upward of the bottom outer end portions 30A and is formed in such a shape as to be closer and closer to the vehicle-widthwise center as its level rises, as viewed from the front. Each bottom<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> outer end portion 30A is formed so that, as viewed from the front, its upper portion is positioned vehicle-widthwise outward of its lower portion.

The valley lines 32 are positioned vehicle-widthwise outward of the headlight opening 40. The valley lines 32 are<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> formed in a lower portion of the center cover 30. The valley lines 32 are positioned more and more vehicle-widthwise outward toward the top, as viewed from the front. The valley lines 32 are provided on the left and on the right, respectively. The center cover 30 comprises a central portion 30C positioned between the left and right valley lines 32, and side portions 30L and 30R positioned vehicle-widthwise outward of the valley lines 32. The portion inside the valley lines 32 and the portions outside the valley lines 32, in other words, the central portion 30C and the side portions 30L and 30R, are formed so that their surface slopes are different from each other. It is possible to form ridge lines in place of the valley lines 32. Herein, the term "valley line" refers to a line formed by a continuous line-like portion that is recessed from both sides thereof. The term "ridge line" refers to a line formed by a continuous line-like portion that protrudes from both sides thereof.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the front cover 2 forms a contour such as to be recessed inward at boundary portions 50 between the center cover 30 and the side covers 60L and 60R, as viewed from the front. Each of the boundary portions 50 includes the bottom outer end portion 30A that is a boundary portion of the center cover 30 from the side cover 60L or 60R, and a top end portion 60A that is a boundary portion of each of the side covers 60L and 60R from the center cover 30. The portion of the bottom outer end portion 30A of the center cover 30 that is upward of a top end 35t, i.e., the top outer end portion 30B, is formed in such a shape that its width becomes narrower and narrower toward the top, as viewed from the front. Also, the bottom outer end portion 30A of the center cover 30 that is lower than the top end 35t is formed in such a shape that its widths becomes narrower and narrower toward the bottom, as viewed from the front. The bottom outer end portion 30A is formed so as to extend obliquely in a front-rear direction in a side portion of the center cover 30. This ensures a long junction portion between the center cover 30 and the side covers 60L and 60R, resulting in a sufficient strength of the junction portion, and prevents those components from increasing in their sizes vehicle-widthwise.</p><heading id="h0008"><u>&lt;&lt;Side Covers&gt;&gt;</u></heading><p id="p0024" num="0024">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the left side cover 60L and the right side cover 60R extend respectively from the left and right of the center cover 30, as viewed from the front, in a substantially downward direction toward the sides of the front wheel 3. The top end portions 60A of the side covers 60L and 60R are joined to the bottom outer end portions 30A of the center<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> cover 30.

It should be noted that in the present specification, the term "an end portion of the cover" refers to an end of the portion that can be seen from the outside. For example, when two covers are joined to each other at a junction portion and one of the covers is placed below the other cover, the end portion of the one cover refers to the junction portion, not the portion that is placed under the other cover.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Each of the side covers 60L and 60R has a bulging portion 61 that extends further vehicle-widthwise outward of each of the bottom outer end portions 30A of the center cover 30.

The bulging portion 61 is positioned at about the same level as that of the under bracket 8. The bulging portion 61 is formed at least from vertically at about the same level as the bottom outer end portions 30A of the center cover 30 to about the same level as the under bracket 8. The bulging portion 61 bulges toward the outside. It should be noted that the term "outside" here means, of the outer surfaces side and the inner surface sides of the side covers 60L and 60R, the outer surface sides thereof. More specifically, the "outside" means the side that is exposed externally. The bulging portion 61 is a part that is positioned outward of the bottom outer end portions 30A of the center cover 30 and that bulges vehicle-widthwise outwardly with respect to a virtual curved surface joining the center cover 30 to the side covers 60L and 60 R seamlessly and smoothly. Because of the presence of the bulging portion 61, the tangents of the center cover 30 and the side covers 60L and 60R do not match at the junction portion as viewed from the front, so a recess is formed between the center cover 30 and each of the side covers 60L and 60R. In other words, the valley lines are formed at the junction portions between the center cover 30 and the side covers 60L and 60R.

For this reason, in order to turn the under bracket without causing the under bracket to make contact with the front cover, it is necessary to provide a certain gap between the under bracket and the front cover. Accordingly, when the flashers are to be disposed in a lower portion of the front cover at the same level as that of the under bracket, it is necessary that the flashers be disposed vehicle-widthwise outward of the clearance space for the under bracket.
