id="p0002" num="0002">The paste-like emulsified homogenous pre-cheese mixture is to be used for making a traditional ripened cheese.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2006030128A"><text>WO 2006/030128 </text></patcit><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WOA1A"><text>A1</text></patcit> discloses a method of making cheese in accordance with the preamble of claim 1.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The method of making cheese as known form <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2006030128A1"><text>WO 2006/030128 A1</text></patcit> is directed to using dairy powder instead of milk for making a traditional ripened cheese. The use of dairy powder instead of milk has the advantage that the method is independent of local raw milk availability. Furthermore there is no whey as a by-product of the cheese making.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">This known method provides a continuous cheese process instead of the traditional batch cheese process. This is a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> time saving way of making cheese because of the continuous cheese making method.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Compared to the traditional cheese making methods, the method known from <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO2006030128A1"><text>WO 2006/030128 A1</text></patcit> provides a space saving process line because the known method is running on the basis of cheese concentrate and not on raw milk as traditional methods of making cheese.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Compared to the traditional cheese making methods, the energy needed for performing the known method based on dairy powders instead of raw milk is reduced. For instance the pasteurising line capacity will only be 1/10 of a traditional cheese milk pasteurising line. It is clear, that the same proportional reduction of energy will be obtained.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Compared to traditional cheese making methods, another advantage is that the method is more hygienic and safe because according to the known method the process line can be provided as a closed process line whereas traditional cheese making lines are normally more open.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Compared to traditional cheese making methods, the method of this prior art is more simple, because the following equipment may be omitted in a cheese making apparatus: the cheese vat, the cheese whey first drain, the cheese whey second drain, a cutting device for cutting the cheese curd, a device for treating raw milk, and/or cheese pressing equipment.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">However the known method has the disadvantage that the obtained pre-cheese mixture is dull grey and unstable to subsequent heat treatment used for pasteurisation or sterilisation.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Accordingly it is an object of the invention to provide a method of making cheese based on dairy powders which<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> provides a more attractive white pre-cheese mixture which is stable to pasteurisation or sterilisation without separation.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">This object is achieved with the features of the independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to the invention there is provided a method of making cheese comprising the following steps:
<ol><li>(a) supplying water, fat and powders containing whey protein and lactose-reduced dairy protein concentrates into a solid-liquid mixer,</li><li>(b) emulsifying and homogenising the content of the solid-liquid mixer,</li><li>(c) applying low-pressure or vacuum to the inner space of the mixer, wherein</li></ol>
step (b) and/or step (c) are performed until a paste-like emulsified homogenous pre-cheese mixture is obtained,<br/>
characterised in that step (b) and/or step (c) are performed at a temperature between 60°C and 85°C and at a shear rate of more than about 5,000/sec.
<ul><li>step (b) and/or step (c) are performed at a shear rate of more than about 5,000/sec, preferably at a shear rate of more than about 7,500/sec, and more preferably at a shear rate of about 10,000/sec, and/or</li><li>step (b) and/or step (c) are preferably performed at a shear rate of less than about 40,000/sec, preferably at a shear rate of less than about 20,000/sec, and more preferably at a shear rate of about 10,000/sec, and/or<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></li><li>step (b) and/or step (c) are preferably performed until a phase conversion of the content of the solid-liquid mixer takes place, and/or</li><li>in step (b) and/or step (c) the temperature is preferably raised until a phase conversion of the content of the solid-liquid mixer takes place, and/or</li><li>step (b) and/or step (c) are preferably performed until an increase of the viscosity of the contents of the solid-liquid mixer is detected and/or the colour of the contents of the solid-liquid mixer turns white.</li></ul></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The method in accordance with the invention has the advantage, that a very stable pre-cheese mixture is obtained. The best results are obtained by applying a temperature of at least 60°C and high shear rates of at least 5,000/sec. Surprisingly it has been discovered that no phase separation takes place even in case high temperature treatments are made thereafter, like sterilisation etc..</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It has surprisingly been noted that a phase conversion takes place at a temperature of about 60°C, especially when a high shear rate, for instance of about 10,000/sec is applied. After the phase conversion has taken place the temperature can stay on its temperature or raised to a higher temperature without risking a phase separation.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">If the phase conversion takes place, the viscosity of the pre-cheese mixture increases dramatically. The increased viscosity can be easily detected. For instance a higher energy demand of the mixer is due to the increased viscosity. Therefore, the increased viscosity of the contents of the mixer and the higher energy demand is an indication that a phase conversion has taken place.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In accordance with the present invention step (b) and/or<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> step (c) can be performed at a temperature between 62°C and 80°C, preferably at a temperature between 64°C and 77°C, more preferable at a temperature between 65°C, and 75°C, more preferable at a temperature between 67°C and 73°C, and most preferred at a temperature between 68°C and 72°C.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In accordance with the present invention in step (b) the temperature can be increased to the temperature of step (b) after an initial mixing has taken place.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In accordance with the present invention step (b) and/or step (c) can be performed for at least 10 Minutes, preferably for at least 20 Minutes and most preferred for about 30 Minutes.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In accordance with the present invention step (b) and/or step (c) can be performed until the cheese base turns white and there is a marked increase in viscosity, as evidenced by an increase in power consumption of the mixer.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Step (b) and/or step (c) can be performed for less than about 60 Minutes, preferably less than about 45 Minutes and most preferred for about 30 Minutes.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In step (c) the vacuum can be applied to the head space of the mixer with the powder being introduced below the level of the liquid in the mixer. This prevents powder being sucked out by the vacuum.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In step (c) a low-pressure or vacuum of less than about 2 mbar, preferably less than about 1 mbar and more preferably of about 0.5 mbar can be applied.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Step<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> (c) are performed at least partially simultaneously, simultaneously or one after the other.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In accordance with the present invention the paste-like emulsified homogenous pre-cheese mixture can be pasteurised. The pasteurisation can be performed in step (b) and/or step (c) and thereafter. If the pasteurisation is performed in step (b), the temperature is preferably raised to a first temperature, for instance 60°C, until the phase conversion takes place, and thereafter raised to a second temperature, for instance 65°C, where the pasteurisation takes place.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the cheese production the milk is pasteurised, i.e. heated instantaneously to 68-73°C to kill bacteria that can destroy the cheese quality otherwise without affecting the ability of the casein to coagulate. The skilled person knows that temperatures in excess of 73°C cannot be applied, as it causes so considerable changes in the conditions of the milk protein, that the production of good-quality cheese is impossible.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">During pasteurisation, vegetative bacteria are killed. However the spores of the bacteria are heat resistant and will not be killed by the temperatures pasteurisation is performed at. Butyric acid bacteria and other types of such bacteria can be detrimental for the fermentation of cheese. Accordingly it will be advantageous to eliminate the spores also from the pre-cheese mixture. For milk this is normally made by means of a mechanical separation or through the use of a membrane process described as microfiltration. Due to the higher density of spores it is possible to eliminate the spores from the milk using a centrifuge. However this separation method cannot be performed with the pasty-like pre-cheese mixture because of its high viscosity. Similarly, the use of microfiltration is not possible.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Accordingly<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> a method for making cheese wherein a better microbiological cheese quality is described.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Also disclosed is a method of making cheese comprising the following steps:

There is the advantage, that despite the high temperatures a gentle heat treatment can be performed because the intended temperature can be achieved in a very short time.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">It has been surprisingly discovered that due to this gentle heat treatment by means of steam infusion a sterilisation of the paste-like emulsified homogenous pre-cheese mixture can be obtained and that the sterilised pre-cheese mixture can be used to make a traditionally ripened cheese with a better microbiological cheese quality.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The method can also comprise the following step:

For instance the FLEX-MIX PROCESSOR of Invensys APV may be used, preferably with the high shear rate<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> impeller. The mixer should have sufficient power in order to provide a shear rate of at least 5,000/sec, preferable of at least 10,000/sec. There may be vacuum means for applying low pressure or vacuum at the head space of the solid-liquid mixer.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">After the solid-liquid mixer there is preferably an in-line mixer. For instance the DAR mixer of Invensys APV may be used. A dosing pump is provided for dosing production aids (for instance rennet and starter) into the pre-cheese paste entering into the in-line mixer. The in-line mixer is provided for thoroughly mixing the production aids into the pre-cheese paste.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">If pasteurisation of the pre-cheese mixture is desired, for instance a scraped surface heat exchanger may be used, being preferably connected between the solid-liquid mixer and the in-line mixer.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">If sterilisation of the pre-cheese mixture is desired, for instance an infusion heating device, preferably in combination with a heat exchanger, for instance a scraped heat exchanger may be used, being preferably connected between the solid-liquid mixer and the in-line mixer.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">The pre-cheese mixture exiting the in-line mixer preferably comprises dry matter content of 40 to 65%, and preferably of 55% by weight.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">The casein to whey protein ratio of the pre-cheese mixture corresponds to the casein to whey protein ratio of the final cheese.

The skilled person is aware of these techniques.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">As production aids coagulation enzymes (for instance rennet) and/or a chemical acidulant such as glucono-lactone may be added.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">The sterilisation and/or heat treatment step may be carried out at a minimum temperature of 130°C, for instance for at least 3 seconds, or may utilise an equivalent treatment.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">The pre-cheese mixture exiting the in-line mixer normally having a high viscosity, such that the pre-cheese mixture can directly been moulded into moulds or receptacles normally used by the skilled person for further treatment such as ripening etc..</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">In the moulds the pre-cheese mixture will coagulate because of the added production aids such as rennet.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">To complete the coagulation and acidification, preferably an incubation step is following the step of moulding the pre-cheese mixture. During this step the cheeses are in their moulds and incubation takes place at a temperature of 28 to 31°C and a hygrometry rate of 99 to 100% for a period of time which can vary from a few hours to 20 hours, until a pH is obtained in the order of 5.3 to 4.8.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">It will be possible to mould and directly portion cheeses in any desired shape and/or size. This technology enables a wide variety of unusual cheese shapes to be obtained owing to the removal of mechanical pressing.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">After the incubation step has been completed, the cheeses<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> are removed from the moulds and further steps may be performed the skilled person is aware of, for instance salting (in brine or using dry salt) and/or any treatments for obtaining rinds and/or special flavours etc..</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">If desired, other standard cheese-making techniques may be performed the skilled person is aware of.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">The cheese obtained in accordance with the method of the invention are almost identical to traditionally produced cheeses. However the cheeses are obtained by using powder instead of raw milk. Accordingly the production of cheese is very easy. Especially there is no need of remove any by-products as it is necessary in the traditional method for producing cheese.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">In principle any variety of semi-hard or hard cheese analogue can be produced with the method of the present invention.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">It is clear that the description of the specific embodiments of the invention is not to be intended to limit the scope of protection which is defined by the claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980151" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Verfahren zur Herstellung von Käse, das die folgenden Schritte umfasst:
