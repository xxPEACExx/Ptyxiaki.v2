This type of joint has been around for centuries. A screw hole is drilled in one board at an angle and a "pocket" is formed for the head of the screw to fit into. The pockets used to be formed by chisels, and the hole used to be drilled with a brace and a bit. Today, machines can form both a pocket and a through hole much more quickly. This attachment method is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">Figure 29</figref>. In <figref idrefs="f0010">Figure 29</figref>, the Part A is fastened to the Part B by a screw 2 which is inserted through a pre-drilled pocket 4 that is formed in Part A. It is important for the strength of the joint for the screw 2 to exit Part A at approximately halfway through the thickness of the material.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a pocket hole jig tool, comprising: a base including a work-piece side support surface and a work-piece end support surface; a drill guide support slidably mounted to said base and adapted for movement toward and away from said work-piece side support surface of said base; a guide block movably mounted relative to said drill guide support; at least one drill guide bushing mounted to said guide block, wherein said guide block is movably supported by at least one slide surface of said drill guide support ; and a drill guide locking mechanism adapted to lockingly engage said guide block relative to said drill guide support wherein said drill guide locking mechanism includes a cam member movable from a disengaged to an engaged position relative to a cam follower assembly that, upon movement of said cam member to said engaged position, applies a clamping force against a surface of said drill guide support to engage said guide block in a fixed position<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> relative to said drill guide support and wherein said drill guide locking mechanism includes a first cam, a second cam and a third cam each movable from a disengaged position to an engaged position relative to a respective first cam follower mechanism, a second cam follower mechanism and a third cam follower mechanism that, upon movement of said first cam, said second cam and said third cam to said engaged position, each apply a clamping force against a surface of said drill guide support to engage said guide block in a fixed position relative to said drill guide support. This makes it very easy and fast for the user to make this joint. The user can also concentrate his thinking on the finished project instead of concentrating on having to set up the tool. In fact, the user does not even have to know the thickness of the wood he is using; the jig adapts automatically to the wood's thickness.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is also important for the pocket to be drilled to the correct height. If the height is too small, the screw will stick through the surface of Part B. If the height is too big, the joint will not be as strong as it should be. The correct pocket height will be different for different thicknesses of wood and different screw lengths.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">There are several pocket hole jigs on the market today that are used with a drill. These use drill guide bushings that are used to guide a stepped drill. The drill guide bushing is at an appropriate angle for drilling the pocket hole. A stop collar on the drill bit controls the pocket height. Some jigs have the guide bushing slidably attached to a base. Because of the angle of the guide bushing, raising the guide bushing assembly moves the exit location of the screw in Part A further away from the surface of the wood that is touching the guide bushing assembly. The user needs to know how far up to slide the guide bushing assembly for the thickness of wood that he is using. The user then needs to adjust the clamp pad for the thickness of wood. This is a trial and error method where the user adjusts the clamp stop, tries to clamp the wood and tightens or loosens the clamp stop accordingly. This is repeated until the appropriate clamping force is achieved. The user also needs to know the appropriate location the stop collar needs to be set on the drill bit that corresponds with the thickness of wood being used, and the user needs to set the stop collar accordingly. Once the hole is drilled, the user needs to look on a chart to determine the correct screw length to use that corresponds with the thickness of wood being used. Not only does the jig of the present disclosure automatically adjust for different width wood pieces, the jig is also provided with a gauge that points to the correct screw length for the wood thickness.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided herein.

With reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 11</figref>, the drill guide assembly 20 is shown in the loaded position with the drill guide bushings 84 disposed against the work piece W. After the drill guide 20 is slid against the work piece W, the adjustment knobs 78 are tightened to keep the drill guide assembly 20 in the proper position along guide rods 68. The tightening of the adjustment knobs 78 ensures that the drill guide assembly remains in place for this thickness of work piece, which is especially important for doing runs of multiple parts of the same thickness of work pieces W. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 11 and 11A</figref>, the drill guide assembly slide angle A1 is designed relative to the drill guide angle A2 such that the jig will now automatically be set so that the screw will exit the work piece<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> approximately halfway through the thickness of the work piece W, regardless of the thickness of the work piece W. Unlike current pocket hole jigs, the user does not need to know how high to position a drill guide assembly as it happens automatically with the pocket hole jig 10. The relationship between the drill guide angle A2 and the drill guide assembly slide angle A1 is provided wherein a rise-to-run ratio of the angle A2 must be approximately twice the rise-to-run ratio of the angle A1 as illustrated with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 11A</figref>. In other words, for the same rise distance as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 11A</figref>, the angle A1 has a run that is twice the size of the run of angle A2.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 12</figref>, the clamping lever assembly 24 will now be described. The clamping lever assembly 24 includes a slide block 88 supporting a pair of cam lever arms 90. Slide block 88 includes a pair of guide holes 92 disposed on opposite sides of a rod hole 94. A threaded knob 96 is provided for engaging threaded rod 56 which extends from the stationary assembly 16. Guide holes 92 are provided for receiving the guide rods 54 therethrough. The cam lever arms 90 are provided with a cam surface 98 which pivots about a pivot pin 100 which is connected to the slide block 88. Each of the cam lever arms 90 is attached to a connecting pin 102 so that the cam lever arms 90 pivot together about pivot pin 100.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The threaded knob 96 controls the position of the clamping lever assembly 24 relative to the stationary assembly 16. A compression spring (not shown) is provided between the stationary assembly 16 and the sliding clamp assembly 18. The spring keeps the sliding clamp assembly 18 pushed against the clamping lever assembly 24. The clamping lever assembly 24 therefore controls the position of the sliding clamp assembly 18.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">After the drill guide assembly 20 is slid down and registered to the work piece W, and after the knobs 78 of the drill guide assembly 20 are turned to lock the position of the drill guide assembly relative to the position of the sliding clamp assembly 18, the jig is ready for the user to clamp the work piece W. The threaded knob 96 on the clamping lever assembly 24 is turned to exert a clamping force on the work piece W. Because the knob 96 is threaded onto the threaded rod 56 that is fixed to the stationary assembly 16, this has the result of causing the clamping lever assembly 24 to slide closer to the stationary assembly 16. This will push the sliding<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> clamp assembly 18 closer to the stationary assembly 16, which will, in turn, push the drill guide assembly 20 closer to the stationary assembly 16. As the drill guide assembly 20 is already in contact with the work piece W, a clamping pressure on the work piece W is provided. In doing so, the drill guide assembly 20 moves and acts as the clamping surface.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Since the drill guide assembly 20 is already against the work piece W, the threaded knob 96 only has to be turned a little bit, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 15</figref>, to generate the clamping pressure. Also, there is no longer a trial and error method that involves clamping the work piece to test for clamp pressure, unclamping the work piece to adjust the clamp pad, re-clamping the work piece to re-test the clamp pressure, etc. As best shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 13</figref>, the threaded knob 96 has a tab 104 that matches a tab 106 on the slide block 88. This causes the knob 96 to be indexed relative to the slide block 88 so that the knob 96 can only be rotated back to its original location. The knob 96 needs to be in its original location (<figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 14</figref>) when the drill guide assembly 20 needs to be registered against a different thickness work piece W. Rotating the knob 96 to its original location ensures the sliding clamp assembly 18 will also be in a correct location for this registering process, which ensures that the screw 2 will continue to exit the work piece W approximately halfway to its thickness.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 16</figref>, the clamping lever assembly 24 is shown in the engaged position with the lever arm 90 extending downward and the cam surface 98 forcing the sliding clamp assembly 18 toward the engaged position. When making pocket holes, a woodworker will usually have several boards of the same thickness that need pocket holes 4 formed in them. When the clamping lever assembly 24 is moved to the released position, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 17</figref>, by lifting the lever arms 90 to an upward position, the clamping pressure is also released, and clearance in the jig 10 is created for the work piece W to be easily removed from the jig 10. The next work piece W is then able to be inserted against the stationary assembly 16, and the clamping lever assembly 24 is moved back to its activated position. When releasing and re-activating the clamping lever assembly 24, all the set-up positions of all the jig's parts are retained so that the jig 10 is still set up to make perfect pocket holes 4 for the next work piece W.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 18</figref>, the collar stop assembly 22 will now be described. The collar stop assembly 22 includes a stop plate 110 provided with holes 112 through which the drill bit passes through. The stop plate 110 is supported by a pair of guide rods 114 which are each received in the guide holes 76 provided in the drill guide assembly 20. The drill collar stop assembly 22 is slidably attached to the drill guide assembly 20 via the guide rods 114. The holes 112 in the collar stop assembly 22 line up with the holes in the drill guide bushing 84. The pocket height is controlled when the drill's 29 stop collar 116 (best shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 20</figref>) contacts the collar stop assembly 22. When the drill guide assembly 20 is moved up and down for different thicknesses of work piece, the collar stop assembly 22 does not move up and down with it. Therefore, the stop collar on the drill bit no longer has to moved up and down to compensate for the down and up movement of the drill guide bushings 84 like current pocket hole jigs require.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The angle that the collar stop assembly 22 slides in relation to the drill guide assembly is important. In order to keep the holes 112 of the stop collar assembly 22 aligned with the holes in the drill guide bushings 84, the sliding angle of the stop collar assembly 22 has to be approximately the same as the angle of the drill guides 84. Another way to phrase that is that the sliding action of the collar assembly 22 is approximately parallel with the axis of the drill guide bushings 84.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 21</figref>, the height track assembly 26 will now be described. The height track assembly 26 includes a slide block 120 including a pair of curved ramps 122 provided in an upper surface therein. A height adjustment arm 124 extends from one end of the slide block 120 and includes an adjustment guide pin 126 extending from an end thereof.

In particular, the ends of the guide rods 114 engage the curved ramps 122 provided in the slide block 120.

The movement of the height track assembly 26, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figures 23 and 24</figref>, causes an automatic vertical adjustment of the collar stop assembly 22 for either a narrow or a thicker work piece.

The tool is powered on, and plugged into, the wood to cut the biscuit slot. Similarly, the geometry just described can be applied to the fence of a powered pocket hole cutter. The powered part of the tool would slide with the same action that the drill bit slides into the drilling guide bushings. When powered on, the plunging action of the tool in relation to the fence would cut the pocket hole.

Upon rotation of the lock knob 342 in the counterclockwise direction as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0017">Figure 42</figref>, the cam followers 338 are compressed radially inward by the reduced diameter of the cam surface 340 to cause the cantilevered arms 336 to compress against the support shaft 322 and lock the cam follower 330 in a fixed position along the support shaft 322. The cam surface 340 can be provided with a raised detent portion 356 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0017">Figures 42 and 43</figref> to hold the lock knob 342 in its engaged position.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0019 f0020">Figures 48-51</figref>, the stop collar assembly 226 will now be described. The stop collar assembly 226 includes a drill collar stop plate 360 that is slidably supported by the guide rod 316 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0011">Figure 30</figref>. The stop plate 360 includes a pair of cam followers 362 extending generally parallel to the guide rod 316 and engage a cam profile 364 of a cam/arm assembly 366. The cam/arm assembly 366 includes a pivot pin 368 received in pivot holes 370 provided on the drill guide support 218, best shown in <figref idrefs="f0011">Figures 30</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0012">32</figref>. A lower arm 371 extends downward from the pivot pin 368 and is adapted to engage against the workpiece W as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0019">Figure 48</figref>. The arm 371 is biased by a torsion spring 372 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0020">Figure 49</figref> in a direction away from the workpiece W. When the drill collar stop plate 360 is pressed down by the user, the cam followers 362 press on the cam profile 364 causing the cam/arm assembly 366 to pivot so that arm 371 engages the workpiece W. The position of the cam/arm assembly 366 automatically establishes the drill depth of drill 230 by automatically adjusting the height of the collar stop plate 360 dependent upon the position of the cam profile 364 which is, in turn, dependent upon the thickness of the workpiece W. Thus, with the stop collar assembly 226 according to the principles of the present disclosure, the drill collar stop plate 260 is automatically adjusted to an appropriate height for use with different thickness workpieces so that the pocket hole is drilled to an appropriate depth in a workpiece such that the screw inserted therein would exit the approximate center of the workpiece, as desired.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The stop collar assembly 226 resolves the issue of having to repeatedly adjust the position of the drill collar 374 for different wood thicknesses. With reference to <figref idrefs="f0021">Figure 52</figref>, since the collar 374 is adjustable along the length of the drill 230, it is<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> required that the collar 374 be properly positioned along the drill 230 in order for the stop collar assembly to function properly. In particular, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0021">Figure 52</figref>, the dimension "A" as illustrated determines the depth of the countersink of the pocket hole for the screw head to contact. The dimension "B" determines the depth of the pilot hole drilled for the screw to pass. By adjusting the set screw 376 on the collar 374, the collar 374 can be moved along the drill 230. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0021">Figure 53</figref>, the tool 210 can be provided with a drill collar calibration feature 380 which includes a bore 382 with a stop shoulder 383 for receiving a cutting end 384 of a drill 230 and a collar stop feature 386 against which a user can place the collar 374 and secure the set screw 376 for ensuring that the collar stop 374 is secured in the correct location on the drill 230. These features are incorporated in the base 214 of the tool 210. Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0023">Figure 56</figref>, the drill collar calibration feature 380' can be incorporated into the drill guide support 218'.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0021">Figure 52A</figref>, the collar 374 can be provided with an internal chamfer 375 on each side. The chamfer acts to interlock with an invertedly flared stop feature 386 which is received against the chamfered surface 375, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0021">Figure 53</figref>.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0022">Figure 54</figref>, the base 214' can also be provided with storage for additional drills, screwdriver bits 385 and an Allen wrench 387 which can be utilized for adjustment of the set screws 376 provided in the collars 374. Additionally, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0022">Figure 54</figref>, storage features 390 can also be incorporated into the drill guide support 218' as shown. In <figref idrefs="f0022">Figure 54</figref>, the drill storage features 390 are shown including a closed loop design for securing the drills in place. <figref idrefs="f0022">Figure 55</figref> illustrates that the capability of tooling these features in a plastic molded housing can be provided by creating undercuts in the tooling. The solution involves pulling the undercut surfaces from the inside of the housing by creating a window or hole in the housings just in the area of the undercut so that the interior of the closed loop portions can be formed by mold features that are pulled in the inward direction "I" while the outside surface geometry is formed by mold features that are pulled in the outward direction "O." As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0023">Figure 57</figref>, the tool storage features can also include snap-fit raised areas 392 for securing the drills in place. The problem of forming the snap-fit features can also be solved by providing undercut surfaces from<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> the inside of the housing by creating a window or hole in the housing just in the area of the undercut so that the snap-fit features can be formed from the interior of the mold.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980130" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Sackloch-Bohrvorrichtungswerkzeug (210), das Folgendes umfasst:
