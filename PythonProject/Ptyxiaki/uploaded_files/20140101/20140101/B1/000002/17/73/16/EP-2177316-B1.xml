The grinding wheel 12 is supported by: a radial shaft X1 that extends horizontally in the x-axis direction; a work-rotating-shaft direction (simply referred also to as the shaft direction) feed shaft Z1 that extends vertically in the z-axis direction; and a horizontal shaft Y1 that extends horizontally in the y-axis direction that is orthogonal to the x-axis and the z-axis direction. The grinding wheel 12 thus supported is movable in the x-axis, the y-axis, and the z-axis directions.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In addition, as <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> shows, the disc dresser 13 is set in the dressing apparatus 1 annexed to the internal-gear grinding machine. The disc dresser 13 is rotatably supported around a dresser-rotating axis D that is angled at a predetermined dresser-attaching angle A2 with respect to the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> work-rotating shaft C1 (the mechanism configured to rotate the disc dresser 13 around the dresser-rotating axis D can be referred to as dresser-rotating means). The disc dresser 13 is also revolvable around a vertical dresser-revolving shaft C2 (the mechanism configured to revolve the disc dresser 13 around the vertical dresser-revolving shaft C2 can be referred to either as relative-revolving means or as dresser-revolving means). The distance between the disc dresser 13 and the dresser-revolving shaft C2, which is the revolving radius, is adjustable by means of a horizontal dresser-revolving-radius set-up shaft U (the mechanism configured to adjust the revolving radius can be referred to as revolving-radius adjusting means) . Beside the dresser-revolving-radius set-up shaft U, the following shafts are provided to rotatably support the disc dresser 13: a radial shaft X2 that is parallel with the radial shaft X1; a horizontal shaft Y2 that is parallel with the horizontal shaft Y1; and a work-rotating-shaft direction feed shaft Z2 that is parallel with the work-rotating-shaft direction feed shaft Z1. The disc dresser 13 thus supported is movable in the x-axis, the y-axis, and the z-axis directions.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Note that the radial shaft X2, the horizontal shaft Y2, and the work-rotating-shaft direction feed shaft Z2 together form revolving-shaft moving means. In addition, the work-rotating-shaft direction feed shaft Z2 forms oscillating means. Descriptions of these means will be given later.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The grinding of the internal gear 11 with grinding wheel 12 starts with moving the grinding wheel 12 to the machining position while the grinding wheel 12 is angled at the shaft angle A1. The radial shaft X1, the horizontal shaft Y1, and the work-rotating-shaft direction feed shaft Z1 are used for the purpose of moving the grinding wheel 12. The grinding wheel 12 thus moved is made to mesh with the internal gear 11. Then, while the internal gear 11 is made to rotate around the work-rotating shaft C1 and the grinding wheel 12 is made to<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> rotate around the grinding-wheel-rotating axis B, the grinding wheel 12 is made to oscillate in the z-axis direction by means of the work-rotating-shaft direction feed shaft Z1. Here, the grinding wheel 12 is thus oscillated so that the edge faces of the grinding wheel 12 can be in contact with the entire area of each of the tooth faces in the width direction of the internal gear 11.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Here, both the internal gear 11 and the grinding wheel 12 that mesh with each other rotate synchronously with each other while the internal gear 11 and the grinding wheel 12 together form the shaft angle A1. Accordingly, the relative sliding speed between the tooth face of the internal gear 11 and the edge face of the grinding wheel 12 increases, and the increase in the relative speed in turn increases the grinding speed. As a consequence, the internal gear 11 is finished so that the shape of the edge face of the grinding wheel 12 can be transferred to the tooth face of the internal gear 11.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">What should be noted here is that the use of the grinding wheel 12 to grind a predetermined number of the internal gears 11 may possibly cause the degradation of grinding precision of the tooth faces of the internal gear 11. To address this degradation, the dressing of the grinding wheel 12 needs to be carried out on a regular basis by driving the dressing apparatus 1.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The dressing of the grinding wheel 12 with the disc dresser 13 starts with removing the internal gear 11 from the internal-gear grinding machine as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>. Then, the grinding wheel 12 is moved to the machining position while the grinding wheel 12 is kept in the state of being angled at the shaft angle A1. The radial shaft X1, the horizontal shaft Y1, and the work-rotating-shaft direction feed shaft Z1 are used for the purpose of moving the grinding wheel 12. Then, the disc dresser 13 is moved so that the dresser-revolving shaft C2 can<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> be located coaxially with the work-rotating shaft C1. The radial shaft X2, the horizontal shaft Y2, and the work-rotating-shaft direction feed shaft Z2 are used for the purpose of moving the disc dresser 13 in this way. In addition, the disc dresser 13 is moved, with the dresser-revolving-radius set-up shaft U, so that the disc dresser 13 can mesh with the grinding wheel 12 having been placed in the machining position. It should be noted here that the attaching angle for the disc dresser 13 is set to be equal to the helix angle of the internal gear 11. Accordingly, the setting-up for the dressing is completed.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As described above, while the grinding wheel 12 is moved to the machining position, the disc dresser 13 is moved to position where the internal gear 11 would be at the time of grinding the internal gear 11. As a consequence, the state of meshing between the grinding wheel 12 and the disc dresser 13 at the time of dressing becomes almost identical to the state of meshing between the internal gear 11 and the grinding wheel 12 at the time of grinding.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Next, the dressing action carried out by means of the dressing apparatus 1 will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">Figs. 7(a) to 7(c)</figref>.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Now, refer to <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>. Firstly, the disc dresser 13 is made to revolve around the dresser-revolving shaft C2 and is thus moved to a position d1 where the disc dresser 13 can mesh with one of the end portions of the grinding wheel 12. <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7 (a)</figref> shows the state of meshing at this time. Then, while the grinding wheel 12 is made to rotate around the grinding-wheel-rotating axis B and the disc dresser 13 is made to rotate around the dresser-rotating axis D, the disc dresser 13 is made to revolve around the dresser-revolving shaft C2 and is thus moved from the position d1 to another position d2 where the disc dresser 13 can mesh with the middle portion of the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> grinding wheel 12. <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7 (b)</figref> shows the state of meshing at this time. After that, the disc dresser 13 is made to revolve around the dresser-revolving shaft C2 and is thus moved from the position d2 to still another position d3 where the disc dresser 13 can mesh with the other one of the end portions of the grinding wheel 12. <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7(c)</figref> shows the state of meshing at this time.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In this event, the dresser-revolving shaft C2 is made to be located coaxially with the work-rotating shaft C1. In addition, the disc dresser 13 is moved so that the disc dresser 13 can mesh with the grinding wheel 12 having been located at the machining position. Accordingly, the disc dresser 13 revolves in the circumferential direction of the internal gear 11. In addition, at the time of revolving, the disc dresser 13 is made to oscillate in the z-axis direction by means of the work-rotating-shaft direction feed shaft Z2.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The oscillating movement of the disc dresser 13 in the z-axis direction together with the revolution of the disc dresser 13 from the position d1 to the position d3 makes the edge tips of the disc dresser 13 dress the bottom lands of the grinding wheel 12 and makes the edge faces of the disc dresser 13 dress the edge faces of the grinding wheel 12. With a single pass of the revolution of the disc dresser 13 from the position d1 to the position d3, the dressing of each groove portion formed by both the bottom land of the grinding wheel 12 and the edge faces thereof is carried out only on a predetermined area of the groove portion in the length direction thereof. Accordingly, once the above-mentioned single pass is finished, the disc dresser 13 is made to move in the z-axis direction (i.e. upwards) by means of the work-rotating-shaft direction feed shaft Z2, and plural pass actions are repeated. Each one of the groove portions of the grinding wheel 12 is dressed in this way. Then, similar actions are carried out for the purpose of dressing the rest of the groove portions of the grinding wheel 12.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">It should be noted that the dresser-attaching angle A2 of the dresser rotating shaft D needs to be corrected in accordance with the helix angle of the grinding wheel 12 when the disc dresser 13 is oscillated in the z-axis direction. The correction carried out in this way is commonly known as the helical correction. The helical correction is not necessary when the grinding wheel 12 is a spur gear.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In addition, the edges of the grinding wheel 12 are cut out in the following way by use of a special internal helical gear that has to be prepared in a manner different from the preparation manner for the internal gear 11 for the purpose of cutting the edges. Hard grinding grains, such as diamond grinding grains, are electrodeposited on the tooth faces of the internal helical gear for edge-cutting. A column-shaped worm that is kept angled at the shaft angle A1 is made to mesh with the internal helical gear for edge-cutting. In addition, the shape of each edge face of the disc dresser 13 is set so as to be identical to the shape of each edge face of a grinding wheel of an internal-gear shape used for grinding an external gear that is set to be inscribed in and to mesh with the inner gear 11.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Accordingly, in the dressing apparatus according to the present invention, while rotating grinding wheel 12 and the rotating disc dresser 13 that mesh with each other, the disc dresser 13 is made to revolve around the vertical dresser-revolving shaft C2. The use of the dressing apparatus of the present invention thus allows the high-precision dressing of the barrel worm-shaped grinding wheel 12 to be carried out using the disc dresser 13.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In addition, the dresser-revolving shaft C2 of the disc dresser 13 is designed to be movable while the distance of the revolving radius of the disc dresser 13 is designed to be<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> adjustable. Accordingly, the dresser-revolving shaft C2 can be located coaxially with the work-rotating shaft C1 of the internal gear 11, and the distance of the revolving radius of the dresser 13 can be made equal to the distance of the radius of the internal gear 11. As a consequence, the disc dresser 13 revolves in the circumferential direction of the internal gear 11 around the grinding wheel 12 located at the same machining position at which the grinding wheel 12 grinds the internal gear 11. Thus the dressing can be carried out by driving the grinding wheel 12 under similar machining (driving) conditions to the ones employed at the time of the grinding. No new dressing conditions have to be set. In addition, the position of the grinding wheel 12 during the grinding is the same position thereof during the dressing. What can be provided accordingly is a space-saving dressing apparatus with a simple driving control.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In addition, the above-described configuration makes it possible to grind the tooth faces of the internal gear 11 with the grinding wheel 12 thus dressed with high precision in the internal-gear grinding machine.
