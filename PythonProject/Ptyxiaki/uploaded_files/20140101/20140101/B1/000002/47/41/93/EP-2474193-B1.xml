mxw-id="PDES63957025" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method and arrangement in a user equipment and a method and arrangement in a base station. More in particular, it relates to a mechanism for uplink scheduling within a wireless communication system.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In Long Term Evolution (LTE), the scheduler is placed in the eNodeB and the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. The scheduler assigns radio resources, also called Resource Blocks (RB). The user equipments find out where to listen or where to send by listening for downlink (assignments) and uplink (grants) on the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). Also, information concerning which transport format to use is comprised within the assignment and grant, respectively.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The radio downlink is the transmission path from a base station, e.g. an eNodeB to a terminal, or a User Equipment (UE) as the terminal also may be referred to as. The uplink is the inverse of a downlink, i.e. the transmission path from the terminal to the base station.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, as the eNodeB schedules uplink transmissions while the buffers are located in the terminal, the terminal has to notify the eNodeB that it has data that it would like to transmit. The terminal supplies the eNodeB with information about the data in its buffers using two mechanisms; a 1-bit scheduling request (SR) or buffer status reports (BSR). Scheduling requests are transmitted on a control channel such as e.g. Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) or Random Access Channel (RACH). This process is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Figure 1</b></figref>, which depicts prior art uplink scheduling. Buffer status reports are however transmitted on a data channel such as Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) mostly together with user data.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">If the terminal has a valid PUCCH resource for scheduling request configured in any transmission time interval (TTI) it sends a one bit scheduling request when the timing is right. Otherwise it initiates a random access procedure and cancels all pending scheduling requests.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The terminal is only allowed to use the PUCCH at predefined points in time determined by the Dedicated Scheduling Request (D-SR) interval. The delay between the actual generation time of a data packet such as e.g. a Voice over the Internet Protocol (VoIP) packet and the sending of the D-SR can thus become as large as the D-SR interval.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the present context, the generation time is defined as the actual time when the data was put in the transmit buffer at the terminal and arrival time is defined as the time when the eNodeB receives the scheduling request.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">When using service aware buffer estimation such as e.g. VoIP aware buffer estimation, the generation time is valuable.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In VoIP, the buffer estimation algorithm moves between two states, SID and TALK and a state change should preferably occur when the codec switches between the corresponding states. The TALK state is a proactive buffer estimation state which guesses when the next voice frame will arrive and which size it will have, while the SID state is a passive state that expects Scheduling Requests when data has arrived for a user.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As voice frames arrive every 20 ms to the terminal buffer using for instance Adaptive Multi Rate (AMR), the better the algorithm knows the generation time, the more exact it will predict the buffer size and the delay of the voice frame.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The larger the D-SR interval is, the larger the difference between the generation time of the VoIP packet and the arrival time noted by the eNodeB may be. This makes it harder to accurately predict the buffer state and schedule delay-sensitive services, increasing the need for explicit signalling and decreasing the efficiency of the uplink assignments.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The VoIP aware buffer estimator use the arrival of the D-SR, processing time is deducted, as the VoIP packet generation time, and this can be very different from the actual VoIP packet generation time. Furthermore, the eNodeB scheduler does not have correct packet delay information and may schedule the VoIP packet too late, especially in scenarios where the required VoIP delay is relatively short.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">It is to be noted that the scheduling request is a scarce resource and thus the D-SR interval can be relatively long compared to the time between generation of voice packets at the terminal.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2009175159A"><text>US2009175159</text></patcit>_describes a method for allocating resources for a scheduling request indicator (SRI), whereby a NodeB transmits an_SRI subframe offset and an index value to a particular user equipment (UE), such that the UE determines a unique combination of factors for the UE to use as unique physical resource for an SRI in the physical uplink control channel (PUCCH).</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Ericsson's "SR triggering in relation to uplink grants" 3GPP DRAFT; R2-081468, 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP, vol.

The base station and the user equipment are comprised within a wireless communication system. According to the method, the user equipment comprises a buffer and is buffering frames comprising data. The user equipment is sending a scheduling request to the base station, only at certain dedicated moments in time. Those certain dedicated moments in time are separated by a predetermined time interval. Also, the user equipment is sending data primarily after firstly having sent a scheduling request and being scheduled resources by the base station. According to the present method, it is further detected when at least a frame of data is generated in the buffer. As it has been detected that the data to send has been generated in the buffer, a scheduling request is sent to the base station, in order to get a grant for sending the data to the base station. The method also comprises computing a time offset value based on a time difference between a moment when the frame of data was generated in the buffer and a moment when the scheduling request was sent. Then, the computed time offset value is sent to the base station.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to a second aspect, the object is also achieved by a user equipment for assisting a base station in scheduling radio resources. The base station and the user equipment are comprised within a wireless communication system. The user equipment comprises a buffer arranged to buffer frames comprising data. The user equipment is arranged to send a scheduling request to the base station only at certain dedicated moments in time. Those certain dedicated moments in time are separated by a predetermined time interval. Further, the user equipment is arranged to send data only after firstly having sent a scheduling request and being scheduled resources by the base station. The user equipment comprises a detecting unit. The detecting unit is adapted to detect when at least a frame of data is generated in the buffer. Also, the user equipment comprises a computing unit. The computing unit is adapted to compute a time offset value, based on a time difference between a moment when the frame of data was generated in the buffer and a moment when the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> scheduling request was sent. In addition, the user equipment comprises a sending unit. The sending unit is adapted to send a scheduling request to the base station. The sending unit further also adapted to send the computed time offset value to the base station.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to a third aspect, the object is also achieved by a method in a base station for scheduling radio resources to a user equipment served by the base station. The base station and the user equipment are comprised within a wireless communication system. According to the present method, a scheduling request is received from the user equipment. Also, a time offset value is received from the user equipment. The received time offset value is based on a time difference between a moment when a frame of data was generated in the buffer at the user equipment and a moment when the scheduling request was sent from the user equipment. Based on the received time offset value, the moment when the frame of data was generated in the buffer of the user equipment is determined. Further, a buffer state of the user equipment buffer is predicted, by using the determined moment of time when the frame of data was generated in the buffer of the user equipment. Based on the predicted buffer state of the user equipment buffer, radio resources are granted to the user equipment.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to a fourth aspect, the object is also achieved by a base station for scheduling radio resources to a user equipment served by the base station. The base station and the user equipment are comprised within a wireless communication system. The base station comprises a receiving unit. The receiving unit is adapted to receive a scheduling request from the user equipment. Also, the receiving unit is adapted to receive a time offset value from the user equipment. The received time offset value is based on a time difference between a moment when a frame of data was generated in the buffer at the user equipment and a moment when the scheduling request was sent from the user equipment. In further addition, the present base station comprises a determining unit. The determining unit is adapted to determine the moment when the frame of data was generated in the user equipment buffer, based on the received time offset value. The base station additionally comprises a predicting unit. The predicting unit is adapted to predict a buffer state of the user equipment buffer. The prediction is performed by using the determined moment<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> when the frame of data was generated in the buffer of the user equipment. The base station additionally comprises a granting unit. The granting unit is adapted to grant radio resources to the user equipment, based on the predicted buffer state of the user equipment buffer.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">By estimating the data generation time of data in the user equipment buffer, according to embodiments of the present methods, user equipment and base station, it is possible to predict the user equipment buffer status. By using knowledge about the user equipments service related behaviour, it may be determined which state the user equipment is transmitting in and at what point in time the user equipment has data to send. This information is according to embodiments of the present methods, user equipment and base station used for uplink scheduling, leading to higher capacity and coverage of the wireless communication system. Also better scheduling decisions may be made when delay is taken into account, which may be valuable in particular when scheduling delay sensitive traffic. Users will observe lower delays and resources on the physical downlink control channel PDCCH and the physical uplink shared channel PUSCH can be saved as uplink assignments will better match the current uplink buffer size.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The need for frequent explicit signalling related to buffer status, such as i.e., scheduling requests and buffer status reports, are also reduced. Thereby, as uplink radio resources are scheduled according to the predicted user equipment buffer status, less signalling has to be made between the base station to the user equipment. As the number of grants that are transmitted within the wireless communication system limits the number of user equipments that may use the system simultaneously, it is possible to increase the load within the system by letting more user equipments participate.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Further, the overall reduced signalling resulting from the present methods, user equipment and base station render higher capacity and better coverage within the system. Thereby an improved performance in a communication system is provided.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Other objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Even though the embodiments of the invention have been summarized above, the claimed embodiments are defined by the accompanying claims 1-11.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0030" num="0030">The present invention will now be described more in detail in relation to the enclosed drawings, in which:<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> -->
