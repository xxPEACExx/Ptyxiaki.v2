id="p0002" num="0002">To make input of a device more convenient, most portable devices such as a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a portable navigation device (PND), or any integrated portable device have equipped with a touch screen. Users can directly touch the touch screen with finger or an additional stylus to make the input or operate the portable device.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Devices equipped with a stylus usually have a container that matches the size of the stylus at the side. The stylus can be stored in the container when not in use. Most styluses or touch devices of other types at the market, however, are not bendable. On the other hand, these portable devices are not only held by a user but also placed on a flat surface (such as table). Currently, no suitable supporting frame that can support the portable device can be seen to incorporate into the portable device.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">This in mind, the present invention aims at providing a portable device that has a touch device including two bodies pivotally connecting to each other and allow the touch device to bend when partially drew out of a housing of the portable device.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">There have been a number of patents disclosing bendable touch device in the prior art described as followed.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">US patent application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2007117430A1"><text>US2007/117430 A1</text></patcit> discloses a stylus for a portable apparatus. The stylus comprises a main portion and a rotating portion. The main portion comprises a tip end and a pivot end, and at least one protruding rib is disposed on the pivot end. A positioning plate is disposed on one end of the rotating portion, and connects with the protruding rib. A bolt passes through the protruding rib and the positioning plate, so that the rotating portion could pivotably connect with the main portion. Furthermore, at least one positioning structure is formed on one end of the positioning plate. The cross-sectional shape of the positioning structure is an arc shape. The stylus further comprises an elastic component and a positioning ball. The elastic component presses the positioning ball in the positioning structure, so that the portable apparatus could stand on a table surface. In addition, at least one groove is disposed on the sidewalls of the stylus. An elastic tenon of the portable apparatus could cling to the grooves, so that the inclination of the portable apparatus could be adjusted on the table surface.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Another US patent application <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US2006044288A1"><text>US2006/044288 A1</text></patcit> discloses an electronic device, such as a tablet PC for example, designed with a housing and a cover configured for attachment to the housing. The housing includes a front panel and a back panel having a base unit with a recess to receive a stylus pen to operate as a leg to maintain the housing in an upright position. Alternatively, the housing may include a control button to receive a stylus pen so that the combination operates as an input device similar to a joystick.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">This is achieved by a portable device according to claim 1 and claim 4.

The touch device 1 can be a stylus or touch accessory used for a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a smart phone, a portable navigation device (PND), a global positioning system (GPS), or integrated portable electronic devices. Such portable devices generally equip with touch screen so that the touch device 1 can operate directly on the touch screen.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The touch device 1 includes a first body 11 and a second body 12. The second body 12 pivots to the first body 11 and is rotatable relative to the first body 11 and convertible between a straight position and a bending position. Please refer to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.2. Fig.2</figref> shows a schematic diagram of the cross-section view of the touch device 1 according to the first embodiment. The first body 11 includes an inner base 14 and an outer base 15. Both the inner base 14 and the outer base 15 are shallow columns according to this embodiment. The outer base 15 has a touch end 111, which is exemplified as a sharp pen head that is easy for clicking and controlling the touch screen. The inner base 14 is configured in the outer base 15 and has pivoting holes 141 at one end. The second body 12 also has pivoting holes 121 at a corresponding end facing the first body 11. The second body 12 is made rotatable to the first body 11 via passing a pivoting rivet 19 through the pivoting holes 141 and the pivoting holes 121. The touch device 1 further includes a restraining member 13 that can be a sleeve in the first embodiment and encloses around the inner base 14 of the first body 11. The restraining member 13 is also moveable relative to the inner base 14 of the first body 11. A second spring 18 also encloses around the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> inner base 14 and connects between the restraining member 13 and the outer base 15. The second spring 18 can be compressed by the restraining member 13 and the first body 11 and have bias for the restraining member 13 when the restraining member 13 moves on the first body 11.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">As for the touch device 1 in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.2</figref>, the second body 12 is retained at a straight position relative to the first body 11, and therefore the touch device I can be used as a stylus. When the touch device 1 is configured at a straight pen style as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.2</figref>, the restraining member 13 that encloses the first body 11 also encloses the second body's pivot end, which pivots to the first body 11, and at such state, the restraining member 13 engages both with the first body 11 and the second body 12, thereby restricting the second body 12 from rotating relative to the first body 11. Additionally, the restraining member 12 has a protrusion 132 that can have contact and be abutted by an abutting edge 122 of the second body 12 when the restraining member 12 encloses the second body 12, further preventing the restraining member 13 from overly sliding outward the first body 11.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The second body 12 of the touch device 1 can rotate relative to the first body 11 from the straight position as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.2</figref> to a bending position as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.3</figref> along a counterclockwise (CCW) direction, while the touch device 1 is positioned straight as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.2</figref> when the touch device 1 is totally contained in a container 21 of a housing 2 of a portable device. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.3</figref>, when the touch device 1 is partially drawn out of the container 21 from the portable device along the opposite direction of direction N until a resilient bump 22 inside the container 21 pushes the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> protrusion 132 of the restraining member 13 toward the first body 11 along direction N and disengages the restraining member 13 from the second body 12, the second body 12 is no longer restrained by the restraining member 13 and is rotatable relative to the first body 11. The second body can be rotated to the bending position as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.3</figref>. Meanwhile, a second spring 18 is further connected between the restraining member 13 and the first body 11 and is compressed to have bias for pushing the restraining member 13 toward the second body 12 as the restraining member 13 is pushed by the resilient bump 22 along direction N. Since the second body 12 is at the bending position relative to the first body 11, the second spring 18 may push the restraining member 13 to only abut against the side wall of the second body 12 and enclose the first body 11 only. The restraining member 13 can further retain the second body 12 at the bending position as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.3</figref> due to the second spring 18.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Please refer to <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig.4. Fig.4</figref> is a schematic diagram showing the touch device 1 functioning as a support frame for a portable device 100. The touch device 1 is configured to have a bending style at this state, with the first body 11 remaining in the container 21 of the portable device 100 and the second body 12 bending out of the container 21. In <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig.4</figref>, portion of the first body 11 further reaches out of the container 21 that causes the restraining member 13 to be free from the resilient bump 22 and biased by the second spring 18 to abut against the pivot end of the second body 12 such that the portable device 100 can be supported to stand straight or with an inclined angle by the touch device 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Please keep referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.3</figref>. The touch device 1 further includes a block 16 and a first spring 17. The block 16 can slide in the inner base 14 of the first body 11 and the first spring 17 is configured in the hollow portion of the inner base 14 and connected between the block 16 and the first body 11. The block 16 can be pushed by the first spring 17 to abut against the pivot end of the second body 12 when the second body 12 is either at the straight position in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.2</figref> or at the bending position in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.3</figref>. The block 16 can also retain the second body 1 2 at the straight position or the bending position and pushes the second body 12 to locate at the straight position or the bending position automatically while the touch device 1 is convertible between the straight pen style and the bending style.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Please refer to <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig.5</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig.6</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig.7</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig.5</figref> shows a schematic diagram of a touch device 3 according to a second embodiment of the application, <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig.6</figref> is a schematic diagram showing that the touch device 3 is pushed to release by a resilient bump 42 of a portable device, and <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig.7</figref> is a schematic diagram showing the touch device 3 in a bending style. The touch device 3 according to the second embodiment includes a first body 31 and a second body 32, which pivots to the first body 31 via a pivoting rivet 39 and is rotatable between a straight position as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig.5</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig.6</figref> and a bending position as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig.7</figref>. The touch device 7 further includes a hook-like restraining member 33 fixedly connected to a connecting point 38 of the second body 32. The restraining member 33 can engage with an engaging section 311 on the first body 31, which is a through hole that passes through the wall of the first body 31 in this embodiment, and restrain the second body 32 from rotating relative to the first body 31, thereby configuring the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> touch device 3 at a straight pen style for use as a stylus.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">When the touch device 3 is drawn out of a container of the portable device, the resilient bump 42 of the container pushes the restraining member 33 and disengages the restraining member 33 from the engaging section 311, which is shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig.6</figref>. Since the restraining member 33 in this embodiment can be a flexible thin clip spring, with fixed length and capable of restraining movement of the second body 32 when configured in the state in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig.5</figref>, the restraining member 33 is allowed to face lateral force and slightly deform, thereby allowing the second body 32 to rotate to the bending position relative to the first body 31. The touch device 3 can function as a support frame for a portable device when only the second body 32 is reaching out of the portable device. Additionally, the restraining member 33 can also be fixed to the second body 32 via a torsion spring 34 further configured at the connecting point 38. The restraining member 33 is securely engaged with the engaging section 311 of the first body 31 due to the spring force of the torsion spring 34.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The application discloses a touch device that can be used as a stylus or a support frame and includes a first body at the front end and a second body at the back end, where the second body pivots to the first body and is capable of rotating between a straight position and a bending position. The touch device further includes a restraining member selectively moving to engage between the first body and the second body such that the touch device can be retained at a straight pen style with buckling-proof capability,<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> or at a bending style for supporting a portable device. When the touch device is drawn out of the portable device, the restraining member can further be pushed to disengage the second body from the first body by a resilient bump inside the housing of the portable device, so that the touch device can be released from the straight pen style and bended accordingly.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">All combinations and sub-combinations of the above-described features also belong to the invention.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56978999" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Tragbares Gerät (100), umfassend:
