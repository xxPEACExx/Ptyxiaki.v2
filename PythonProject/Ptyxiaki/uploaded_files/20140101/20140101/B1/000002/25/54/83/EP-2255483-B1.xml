mxw-id="PDES63957175" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The field of the invention relates to a method and apparatus for managing transmission of data segments over an interface, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for managing the transmission of transmission control protocol (TCP) data segments over an air interface of a wireless communication network.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In the field of this invention, it is known for devices to communicate across networks by way of protocols, the protocols acting as a set of rules governing how information, data, etc. is to be sent and/or received. The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol suite has become the de facto standard for computer communications in today's networks. The TCP/IP protocol suite is so named for two of its most important protocols: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). Another name for it is the Internet Protocol Suite, which is the phrase used in official Internet standards documents.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As will be appreciated by a skilled artisan, in wireless systems, for example a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), the air interface suffers from a high-loss data rate. Thus, such systems involve some form ofre-transmission protocol, such as radio link control (RLC) in the data link layer, or HARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest) functionality at the MAC (Medium Access Control) layer, to provide re-transmission functionality. Due to the need to perform retransmissions, and the constantly changing air interface conditions, the round trip time (RTT) for data packets (namely a time taken from a transmission of a packet to the receipt of an acknowledgement for the packet) is variable. As a result, such air interfaces are known to suffer from a high and variable communication latency.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A problem caused by the high latency of wireless communication systems is that, when a TCP packet is transmitted, a timer is started. If the sender of a TCP packet does not receive an acknowledgement for that packet before the timer reaches the determined RTO (retransmission time-out) value, the TCP packet will be re-transmitted. The RTO value is determined by<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> measuring previous segment RTT values (a number of methods for determining RTO from previous measured segment RTT have been presented in [RFC793] and [<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>V. Jacobsen, 'Congestion avoidance and control, Computer communications review, 1988</text></nplcit>]). The TCP timer may therefore time-out, resulting in the re-transmission of the packet, whilst the RLC or HARQ is still in the process of trying to transmit the original instance of the packet over the air interface As a result, the RLC may end up with two, and maybe more, instances of the same TCP packet to transmit across the air interface Consequently, the same data packet may be effectively transmitted over the air interface twice or more. As will be appreciated by a skilled artisan, such duplication of data transmission is not only wasteful of air interface resources, but also further compounds the problem of the air interface suffering from a high latency,<br/>
<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6700871B"><text>US 6,700,871</text></patcit> discloses a scheme for increasing throughput though a network access server between a low-speed network and a high-speed network by identifying and dropping re-transmitted packets en route from the high-speed network to the low-speed network.<br/>
Thus there exists a need for an improved method and apparatus for managing the transmission of data segments over an interface that substantially alleviates the above mentioned problems.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Aspects of the invention are defined in the appended claims.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Thus, embodiments of the invention may allow improved use of interface resources, for example by discarding duplicate data segments, thereby substantially preventing unnecessary transmission of data segments over the interface.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">These and other aspects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from, and elucidated with reference to, the embodiment(s) described hereinafter.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">Embodiments of the invention will be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> -->

However, it will be appreciated that embodiments of the invention are not limited to a mobile telephone handset, but may be implemented within alternative communication devices or network elements with which data segments are transmitted over an interface.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, there is illustrated a block diagram of part of a wireless communication device 100, adapted to support embodiments of the invention. The communication device 100, in the context of the illustrated embodiment of the invention, is user equipment (UE) in a form of a mobile telephone handset comprising an antenna 102. As such, the communication device 100 contains a variety of well known Radio Frequency (RF) components or circuits 106, operably coupled to the antenna 102 that will not be described further herein. The communication device 100 further comprises signal processing logic 108. An output from the signal processing logic 108 is provided to a suitable user interface (UI) 110 comprising, for example, a display, keypad, loudspeaker, and/or microphone.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The signal processing logic 108 is coupled to a memory element 116 that stores operating regimes, such as decoding/encoding functions and the like and may be realised in a variety of technologies such as random access memory (RAM) (volatile), (non-volatile) read only memory (ROM), Flash memory or any combination of these or other memory technologies. A timer 118 is typically coupled to the signal processing logic 108 to control the timing of operations within the communication device 100.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In accordance with embodiments of the invention, the signal processing logic 108 is arranged to execute computer-readable code, for example stored within the memory element 116, and to perform the method of managing transmission of data segments over an interface, for example over an air interface via radio frequency (RF) components or circuitry 106 and antenna 102, as hereinafter described.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, there is illustrated transmission management logic 200 according to embodiments of the invention. For example, the transmission management logic 200 may comprise computer-readable code to be executed by signal processing logic, such as the signal processing logic 108 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The transmission logic 200 is arranged to receive data segments for transmission over an interface 210 to a peer device (not shown), for example over an air interface of a wireless communication network. For the illustrated embodiment, the transmission management logic 200 is operably coupled to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) logic 220, from which the transmission management logic 200 receives data segments. Accordingly, for the illustrated embodiments the received data segments are in the form of TCP data segments. As will be appreciated by a skilled artisan, the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol suite is well known in the art, and is defined in RFC 793. As such the TCP logic 220 will not be described further herein.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Also for the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, the management logic 200 is operably coupled to the interface 210 via interface control logic, which for the illustrated embodiment is in the form of Radio Link Control (RLC) logic 230. As will also be appreciated by a skilled artisan, the RLC logic 230 is a well known part of the data link layer within a UMTS network, and is defined<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> in the 3GPP TS25.322 specification. Consequently, the RLC 230 will also not be described further herein.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As will be appreciated by a skilled artisan, the TCP logic 220 may form a part of high layer functionality within, for example, the communication device. Alternatively, the TCP logic 220 may form a part of a separate device, for example a personal computer or the like, operably coupled to a communication device comprising the transmission logic 200. Alternatively still, the transmission logic 200 may be provided within, for example, a part of a Radio Access Network (RAN), whilst the TCP logic 220 may be located within a part of a core network.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The transmission management logic 200 further comprises, or for the illustrated is operably coupled to, a buffer 240, for example located in memory element 116 in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As previously mentioned, when a TCP segment is transmitted, a timer may be started. If the sender of the data segment does not receive an acknowledgement of the receipt for that data segment before the timer reaches the RTO value, the TCP segment will be re-transmitted. This process is TCP functionality defined in [RFC 793].</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">However, the transmission of a data segment may be delayed due to the latency of the interface 210, for example due to changing air interface conditions, resulting in a high loss rate, and thus, possibly, requiring the RLC 230 to provide such re-transmission functionality. As a consequence, the timer may expire, resulting in the retransmission of the packet while the RLC 230 is still in the process of trying to transmit the original instance of the packet over the interface 210.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, there is illustrated transmission manager logic functionality adapted according to an embodiment of the invention. In response to receipt of a data segment for transmission over the interface 210, for example a TCP data segment from the TCP logic 220 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, the transmission management logic 200 is arranged to compare a sequence number of the received data segment, such as the 32-bit sequence number located within the header section of a TCP segment, with pending sequence numbers of previously received data segments. In this manner, duplicate data segments comprising sequence numbers that match pending sequence numbers of previously received data segments may be identified.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">If the sequence number of the received data segment matches a pending sequence number, the transmission management logic 200 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> is further arranged to discard the received data segment. Alternatively, if the sequence number of the received data segment does not match a pending sequence number, the transmission management logic 200 is further arranged to add the sequence number of the received data segment to the pending sequence numbers and transmit the received data segment over the interface.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">For example, the pending sequence numbers may be stored as a list of pending sequence numbers within the buffer 240 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, and the sequence number of the received data segment matches a pending sequence number if the same sequence number is present within the list of pending sequence numbers.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Alternatively, the pending sequence numbers may be stored as a range of sequence numbers, wherein a first pending sequence number, say representing a lower limit of the range of pending sequence numbers, and a second pending sequence number, say representing an upper limit of the range of pending sequence numbers, are stored within the buffer 240, and the sequence number of the received data segment is considered as matching a pending sequence number if the sequence number of the received data segment is within the range of sequence numbers represented by the first and second sequence numbers stored in memory.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In this manner, duplicate data segments may be discarded, substantially preventing the RLC logic 230 from comprising a plurality of instances of the same data segment to transmit across the interface 210. Consequently, a data segment is not unnecessarily transmitted over the air interface. In this manner, employing the embodiments described herein enable a data communication system to utilising interface resources more economically.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As will be appreciated by a skilled artisan, prior to being transmitted, the data segment may need to be buffered, or otherwise held, until an interface resource is allocated to the data segment, or where air interface conditions are too poor for the transmission of data, until air interface conditions for the interface improve sufficiently for data to be transmitted over it. Furthermore, the data segment may be broken up into Protocol Data Units (PDUs) for transmission over the air interface.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The transmission management logic may be arranged to remove a sequence number from the pending sequence numbers in response to receipt of an acknowledgement that the data segment to which that sequence number relates has been successfully received by the peer device (not shown). For example, in the case of an 'uplink' data flow, with data flowing from a wireless communication device to a Node-B of a UMTS network, the peer device may comprise the RLC logic of the Node-B.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The transmission management logic may further be arranged to remove a sequence number from the pending sequence numbers in response to receipt of a transmission failure message for the data segment to which the sequence number relates (i.e. the RLC has tried to send the data segment for a fixed number of times but has not received an acknowledgement that the packet was received by the peer device for any of these attempts).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">For example, when all PDUs of a data segment have been successfully received by the peer (receiving) RLC entity, the RLC logic 230 may provide an acknowledgement of their successful transmission to the transmission management logic 200. Alternatively, where the RLC logic 230 fails to successfully transmit a data segment over the interface 210, the RLC logic 230 may provide a reset or Move Receiver Window (MRW) message to the transmission management logic 200, thereby indicating that the RLC logic 230 has discarded the data segment.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The sequence number of the data segment to which the received message relates, which in a case of a receipt of a reset message may be all pending sequence numbers, is/are removed from the list of range of pending sequence numbers stored in the buffer 240 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>. For example, if the pending sequence numbers are stored as a list of sequence numbers, the sequence number of the data segment to which the received message relates is removed from the list. Alternatively, if the pending sequence numbers are stored as a range of numbers, the range of numbers is amended accordingly to remove the sequence number of the data segment therefrom.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">As will be appreciated by a skilled artisan, by removing the sequence numbers of data segments that have either been successfully transmitted, or for which the transmission has failed, re-transmission mechanisms etc. within, for example, the TCP logic 220 are not disrupted.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Consequently, in a case of a failed transmission, a subsequent re-transmission of the data segment by the TCP logic will not be discarded, and thus allowed to be transmitted over the interface. Similarly, when a data segment is successfully transmitted across the interface, only to subsequently be lost or discarded prior to reaching its destination, a subsequent re-transmission of the data segment will not be discarded by the transmission management logic, and thus will be allowed to be transmitted over the interface.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>, there is illustrated transmission management logic 400 according to an alternative embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The transmission management logic 400 is arranged to receive data segments for transmission over an interface 410, for example an air interface of a wireless communication network.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">For the illustrated embodiment, the transmission management logic 400 forms a part of interface control logic 430, which for the illustrated embodiment is in the form of RLC logic, and is operably coupled to TCP logic 420, from which the transmission management logic 400 receives data segments. Accordingly, for the illustrated embodiments the received data segments are in a form of TCP data segments.

The flowchart 500 of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref> starts with a receipt of a data segment for transmission over the interface, in step 510, and moves to step 520, where a sequence number of the received data segment is compared with pending sequence numbers.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">If the sequence number of the received data segment matches a pending sequence number in step 520, the method moves to step 530, and the received data segment is discarded. The method then ends.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Alternatively, if the sequence number of the received data segment does not match a pending sequence number, in step 530, the method moves to step 540, and the sequence number of the received data segment is added to the pending sequence numbers. The method then moves to step 550, where the received data segment is transmitted over the interface.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The flowchart 600 of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 6</figref> starts with a receipt of a message acknowledging successful reception of a data segment at the peer RLC entity, or indicating data segment transmission failure, in step 610.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">For example, for the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, when all PDUs of a data segment have been successfully received by the peer RLC entity (not shown), the RLC 230 may provide an acknowledgement of their successful transmission to the transmission management logic 200. Alternatively, where the message indicates failure to transmit a data segment, step 610 may comprise receiving a reset or Move Receiving Window (MRW) message, indicating that the data segment has been discarded.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Next, in step 620, the sequence number of the data segment to which the received message relates, which in the case of a receipt of a reset message may be all pending sequence numbers, is/are removed from pending sequence numbers stored in memory, and the method ends. For example, if the pending sequence numbers are stored as a list of sequence numbers, the sequence number of the data segment to which the received message relates is removed from the list. Alternatively, if the pending sequence numbers are stored as a range of numbers, the range of numbers is amended accordingly to remove the sequence number of the data segment therefrom.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">For the various embodiments illustrated and hereinbefore described, the transmission management logic 200, 400 has been operably coupled to, or formed a part of, interface control logic in the form of RLC logic 230, 430. However, it is contemplated that the transmission management logic 200, 400 may be coupled to any interface control logic operating beneath, for example, a TCP protocol layer, and comprising a retransmission scheme in a high latency communication system. For example, the transmission management logic may alternatively be provided between the TCP protocol layer and interface control logic comprising HARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest) logic in a MAC (Medium Access Control) layer.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Although one embodiment of the invention describes a wireless communication device, potential applications are not restricted to this embodiment.
