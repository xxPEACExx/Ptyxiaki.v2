load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to patient access disconnection systems. More specifically, the present invention relates to the detection of patient access disconnection, such as the detection of needle or catheter dislodgment during dialysis therapy.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">A variety of different medical treatments relate to the delivery of fluid to, through and/or from a patient, such as the delivery of blood between a patient and an extracorporeal system connected to the patient via a needle or needles inserted within the patient. For example, hemodialysis, hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration are all treatments that remove waste, toxins and excess water directly from the patient's blood. During these treatments, the patient is connected to an extracoporeal machine, and the patient's blood is pumped through the machine. Waste, toxins and excess water are removed from the patient's blood, and the blood is infused back into the patient. Needles or similar access devices can be inserted into the patient's vascular access in order to transfer the patient's blood to and from the extracoporeal machine. Traditional hemodialysis, hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration treatments can last several hours and are generally performed in a treatment center about three to four times per week.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">During any of these hemo treatments, dislodgment of an access device can occur, such as dislodgment of a needle or access device inserted into the patient's vascular access including an arterio-venous graft or fistula. If not detected immediately, this can produce a significant amount of blood loss to the patient. The risks associated with a needle dislodgment or other suitable condition are considerable. In this regard, important criteria for monitoring blood loss include, for example, the sensitivity, specificity and response time with respect to the detection of needle dislodgment. With increased levels of sensitivity, specificity, and response time, the detection of needle dislodgment can be enhanced, and blood loss due to dislodgment can be minimized.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Typically, patients undergoing medical treatment, such as hemodialysis, hemofiltration or hemodiafiltration, are visually monitored in order to detect needle dislodgment. However, the needle may not be in plain view of the patient or medical staff (i.e., it may be covered by a blanket) such that it could delay detection and, thus, responsive actions to be taken in view of dislodgment, such as stopping the blood pump of the extracorporeal machine to minimize blood loss to the patient.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Moreover, in view of the increased quality of life, observed reductions in both morbidity and mortality and lower costs than in-center treatments, a renewed interest has arisen for self care and home hemo therapies. Such home hemo therapies (whether hemodialysis, hemofiltration or hemodiafiltration) allow for both nocturnal as well as daily treatments. During these self care and home hemo sessions, especially during a nocturnal home hemo session, when the patient is asleep, dislodgment risks are more significant because nurses or other attendants are not present to detect the dislodgment.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Although devices that employ a variety of different sensors are available and known for detecting and/or monitoring a variety of different bodily fluids, these devices may not be suitably adapted to detect needle dislodgment. For example, known devices that employ sensors including pH, temperature and conductivity have been utilized to detect bedwetting and diaper wetness. Further, devices that employ pressure sensors and/or flow sensing devices are known and used during medical treatment, such as dialysis therapy, to monitor fluid flow including blood flow to and/or from the patient. However, these types of detection devices may not provide an adequate level of sensitivity and responsiveness if applied to detecting blood loss from the patient due to needle dislodgment. Although venous pressure is known to be used to monitor needle dislodgment, it is not very sensitive to needle-drop out.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Additional other devices and methods are generally known to monitor vascular access based on the electrical conductivity of blood. For example, Australian Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="AU730338"><text>730,338</text></patcit> based on International Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO9912588A"><text>WO 99/12588</text></patcit> discloses an electronic device that induces a current in the extracorporeal blood circuit. The current is induced by a field coil placed around two points in the blood circuit thereby defining a closed conductor loop along the entire blood circuit. This can be problematic from both a patient health and safety perspective and the effective detection of needle-drop out or other vascular access conditions.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In this regard, the blood circuit is coupled to a blood treatment system that includes a number of high impedance components, such a blood pump, air bubble traps, pinch clamps and/or the like. Because of the large impedance of the conducting fluid-loop (due to the peristaltic pump and other components), the induction and detection of a patient-safe current requires an impractically complex design of the coil and system. Further, a high level of noise would necessarily result from the use of such levels of induced current. This can adversely impact the sensitivity of detection. If lower currents are used, the field coil would have to be increased in size to detect such low current levels. This may not be practical in use, particularly as applied during dialysis therapy.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO9929356A"><text>WO 99/29356</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="DE19739099"><text>DE 19739099</text></patcit> disclose methods and devices that monitor access during blood treatment comprising a monitoring circuit connected to or through a fluid source, dialyzer or other components of the treatment system.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO0147581A"><text>PCT Publication No. WO 01/47581</text></patcit> discloses a method and device for monitoring access to the cardiovascular system of a patient. The access monitoring employs an electrical circuit which can generate and detect a current at separate points along a blood circuit connected to the patient. Electrical current is injected into the fluid using capacitive couplers that each have a metal tube placed around the blood circuit tubing. In this regard, the metal tube defines a first plate of a capacitor; the blood circuit tubing defines the dielectric; and the blood inside of the blood circuit tubing defines the second plate of the capacitor.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The generator applies a potential difference between a pair of capacitive couplers to generate a current in a segment of the blood circuit. A detector utilizes an additional and separate pair of capacitive couplers to measure the current along at least one section of the venous branch between a first contact point and the venous needle. The change in voltage (dV) can then be determined based on a measured change in current and compared to a reference range (I) to monitor access conditions. In this regard, <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO0147581A"><text>PCT Publication No. WO 01/47581</text></patcit> requires a complex circuit design that utilizes multiple sets of capacitive couplers to maintain vascular access. This can increase the cost and expense of using same.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Further, the measure of capacitive coupling to inject and electric signal in the blood circuit and/or for detection purposes can be problematic. In this regard, the signal must pass through the tubing of the blood circuit as the tubing acts as a dielectric of the capacitor. This may cause an excess level of noise and/or other interference with respect to the detection of changes in vascular access conditions.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In this regard, it is believed that known devices, apparatuses and/or methods that can be used to monitor a patient's vascular access may not be capable of monitoring vascular access, particular the detection of needle-drop out during dialysis therapy, with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to ensure immediate detection of blood loss such that responsive measures can be taken to minimize blood loss. As applied, if twenty seconds or more of time elapses before blood loss due to dislodgment of the venous needle, over 100 milliliters in blood loss can occur at a blood flow rate of 400 ml/min, which is typical of dialysis therapy. Thus, the capability to respond quickly upon immediate detection of needle dislodgment is essential to ensure patient safety.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Accordingly, efforts have been directed at designing apparatuses, devices, systems and methods for detecting changes in access conditions, such as in response to needle dislodgment, wherein detection is sensitive, specific and immediate in response to such access changes such that responsive measures can be suitably taken to minimize blood loss from the patient due to same.</p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">The present invention provides an apparatus for detecting dislodgement of an access device according to Claim 1. There are also described improved devices, apparatuses, systems and methods for detecting access disconnection during medical therapy. In particular, the present invention can detect dislodgment or disconnection of an access device, such as a needle, catheter or the like, inserted in a patient through which fluid can flow during medical therapy, such as dialysis therapy.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In general, the present invention includes any suitable type of electrical circuit that can generate, measure and/or process an electrical signal as it passes along a conductive path defined within a fluid circuit, such as an extracorporeal blood circuit during medical therapy including dialysis therapy. The blood circuit can be coupled to a blood treatment system through one or more access devices inserted within the patient. The access device can include, for example, needles, catheters or the like. In this regard, blood can be circulated into, through and out of the patient along the blood circuit.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The present invention can include a number of electrical connections and/or contacts that are spaced apart along the blood circuit to monitor patient access conditions. In particular, this can be used to detect access disconnection with high<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> reliability. In this regard, the present invention can provide enhanced detection capabilities without requiring extensive modifications to the monitored therapy, such as to an extracorporeal blood circuit used during dialysis therapy. It is believed that the detection of access disconnection can also be achieved with the use of lower levels of current in contrast to known systems.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In an embodiment, the present invention includes a conductive connection or pathway along a fluid circuit, such as between an inflow fluid line and an outflow fluid line of the fluid circuit connecting a patient to a medical therapy system. This can defme at least a segment including, for example, a loop along the fluid circuit, such as a extracorporeal blood circuit, that can remain closed until access disconnection. The loop can be adapted such that an electric current or other signal passing therein can bypass one or more components of a medical system coupled to the fluid circuit, such as dialysis system including a dialysis machine, a blood pump, a drip chamber, other like components and combinations thereof. The vascular access of the patient can then be monitored by measuring a change in an electrical value in response to access disconnection, such as dislodgment of a needle or catheter from the patient through which fluid can flow.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In an embodiment, the present invention can utilize at least three electrical contact points spaced apart and positioned along the blood circuit or other suitable fluid circuit to monitor access conditions. For example an electrical signal or the like can be injected into the fluid circuit through a single contact point where changes in the electrical value in response to dislodgment can then be measured using the direct connection between the two remaining electrical contact locations.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The present invention also provides an inductive coupler device that can be more easily and effectively utilized to attach an induction coil to a fluid circuit for detection purposes. In an embodiment, the inductive coupler includes movable members attached at an end region. A coil member, such as an induction coil, is<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> placed around at least one of the movable members. This enables the induction coupler to move about the end region thus allowing it to be readily placed around and secured to a fluid conduit, such as a blood circuit. In this regard, the inductive coupler can be arranged in an open and closed position such that it can be readily secured to the fluid conduit. As used herein, the term "inductive coupler" or other like terms, such as "inductive coupling device" mean any suitable device which can be used to attach an induction coil to a fluid conduit, such as a blood circuit.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In an embodiment, the movable coupling members are composed of a material that has a high magnetic permeability. In this regard, the magnetic permeability of the movable coupling members is in an amount effective to converge or direct an electromagnetic field through the induction coil. This can enhance the electromagnetic flux through the induction coil such that an electromagnetic signal can be effectively injected and likewise measured in the blood circuit.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">An advantage of the present invention is to provide improved apparatuses, for detecting access disconnection.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A further advantage of the present invention is to provide improved apparatuses for monitoring connections to a vascular access during dialysis therapy.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Another advantage of the present invention is to provide improved apparatuses for access disconnection during selfcare and home hemo treatments, such as dislodgment of a needle, a catheter or the like.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Moreover, an advantage of the present invention is to provide improved apparatuses for monitoring access disconnection with enhanced accuracy, sensitivity and responsiveness with respect to the detection of same.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Still further, an advantage of the present invention is to provide an improved device that can readily and effectively attach an induction coil to a fluid conduit used for detection purposes, such as detection of access disconnection.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Additional features and advantages of the present invention are described in, and will be apparent from, the following Detailed Description of the Invention and the figures.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><heading id="h0003">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p0028" num="0028"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the present invention showing a conductive connection that can be used to bypass one or more components of a blood treatment system coupled to a patient along a blood circuit.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref> illustrates injection of an electrical signal into the blood circuit using a conductive connection.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2B</figref> illustrates measurement of a change in an electrical value in response to access disconnection using a conductive connection.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 3A</figref> illustrates an inductive coupler of an embodiment of the present invention in an open configuration as it is placed around a fluid conduit.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 3B</figref> illustrates an inductive coupler of an embodiment of the present invention in a closed configuration secured to the fluid conduit.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 3C</figref> illustrates an exploded view of an electrical contact coupling device in an embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 3D</figref> illustrates a side sectional view of the coupling device of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 3C</figref> in an embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 3E</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the coupling device of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 3F</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the coupling device of the present invention showing a threaded engagement between the components of same.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 3G</figref> illustrates a sectional view of <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 3F</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 4A</figref> illustrates a dialysis machine in an embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 4B</figref> illustrates a dialysis machine in another embodiment of the present invention.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0029" num="0029">The present invention relates to apparatuses, devices, systems, and/or methods for detecting access disconnection, such as dislodgment of a needle, catheter or other access device inserted in the vascular access of a patient undergoing medical therapy, such as dialysis therapy. In general, the present invention includes a suitable electrical circuit that provides any number and variety of suitable contact points spaced apart and<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> coupled to a fluid circuit, such as a blood circuit. The contact points can be utilized to inject an electric signal into the fluid (e.g., blood) flowing through the fluid circuit thereby defining a conductor loop along at least a portion of the fluid circuit. A change in an electrical value in response to changes in access conditions, such as access disconnection including needle-drop out.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">It should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to the detection of needle dislodgment but can be utilized to detect the dislodgment or disconnection of any suitable access device.
