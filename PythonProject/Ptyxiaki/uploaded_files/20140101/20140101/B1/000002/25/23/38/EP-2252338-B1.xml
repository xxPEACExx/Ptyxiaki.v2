The invention also relates to an applicator particularly useful for preparing and applying bone graft compositions.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">The rapid development of surgery allows carrying out bones and joints operations such as, for example, orthopedics or maxillofacial surgery including surgical removal of cysts, foci of suppuration and malignant bone tumors. These medical procedures often results in voids, gaps and other bone defects. Other examples of bone defects include those resulting, for example, from compression fractures, high-energy trauma, peri-articular fractures, cranial-maxillo facial fractures, osteoporotic reinforcement (i.e. screw augmentation) and periodontal reconstruction.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Dentistry is an exemplary field in which repairing bone defects is necessary in addition to dental implants, for replacing missing teeth. When a person experiences teeth loss due to trauma or other circumstances, or suffers from periodontal disease, loss of interproximal crestal alveolar bone is one of the conditions which the practitioner must deal with. This bone loss may further result in the loss of a person's interproximal or papillary oral tissue between the corresponding teeth and may cause a bone defect that is very unappealing aesthetically, as well as difficult to restore. Without the proper regeneration of this bone defect, any replacement tooth is likely to be mal-positioned, out of proportion, shape and form, and lack interproximal tissue for a natural appearance.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Depending on the cause and/or location of the various possible bone defects within the body, the volume of the defect can vary, but may, in some cases, reach more than 6 cubic centimeters</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Since natural bone healing is limited to small cavities and spans long time periods in terms of daily activity, larger bone defects often need to be filled by bone replacement materials which act as temporary fillers, offering a lattice or scaffold upon<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> which natural bone is slowly built. These materials may be liquid, pasty or solid, and are mostly classified by their source: natural or artificial, a feature which invariably influences the biocompatibility of these materials.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Natural bone replacement materials, known as transplants or grafts, include endogenous or exogenous bone fragments. In endogenous bone grafting (autograft), the graft is harvested from a "donor site" in the patient's own body. Autografts are generally the best grafting technique and usually result in the greatest regeneration of missing bone, since the bone is 100 % compatible with the patient's body. Although endogenous bone material is highly valuable due to its osteogenic (bone forming), osteoconductive (providing an inert scaffold on which osseous tissue can regenerate bone), and osteoinductive (stimulating cells to undergo phenotypic conversion to osteoprogenitor cell types capable of formation of bone) properties, it is only available in very limited amounts, and thus several surgical procedures are usually necessary to obtain the necessary bone mass from several donor sites. These repetitive surgical procedures pose severe disadvantages to this otherwise beneficial technique.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Exogenous bone graft may be derived from either a human donor (allograft), after undergoing rigorous tests and sterilization, or from an animal source (xenograft), most commonly bovine, after being specially processed to make it biocompatible and sterile. In both cases the exogenous bone acts as a "filler" until the patient's body replaces it with its own natural bone. Unfortunately, exogenous grafts have low or no osteogenicity, increased immunogenicity and a much faster resorption compared to autogenous bone. In clinical practice, fresh allografts are rarely used because of immune response and the risk of transmission of disease. The frozen and freeze-dried types are osteoconductive but are considered to be only weakly osteoinductive at best. Freeze-drying diminishes the structural strength of the exogenous graft and renders it unsuitable for use in situations in which structural support is required. In practice, exogenous bone transplant is often not successful.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Some of the most significant advances in biomaterial research over the last 30 years have been in the field of bone graft substitutes, also termed synthetic grafts or alloplastic grafts, which use inert, man-made synthetic materials that mimic natural bone. Examples of synthetic bone implant and/or bone filler materials include, but are not limited to, metals (for example, special steels, noble metals, platinum or titanium,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> often used in the replacement of joints) ceramic materials (for example, alumina, glass-ceramics or hydroxylapatite ceramics), calcium phosphate, calcium sulfate and more.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">While natural bone grafts are preferable in terms of biocompatibility, they are less practical, especially in the treatment of large cavities, and using synthetic grafts may in fact avoid the additional surgical operations needed to obtain enough natural bone mass.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The type of the synthetic bone replacement material of choice is often dictated by the size, type and location of the bone cavity.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Resorbable bone replacement materials (otherwise termed biodegradable, bioerodable, or bioabsorbable) include materials that are broken down and gradually absorbed or eliminated by various processes in the body. These materials are used as temporary support media or as osteoconductive bone grafts, temporarily filling bone cavities and allowing the body itself to compensate, in the course of time, the defect with living bone material. The exact degree of resorbability is preferably selected such that the rate of resorption at the recipient bone site will match the rate of natural bone growth.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Non-resorbable bone replacement materials are used in bone implantation or "bone augmentation" when the bone cavity is too large to be ever replaced naturally, for example following surgical operations, or when replacing lost teeth. These bone implants must themselves be secured to a supporting bone. Occasionally, the use of non-resorbable bone replacement materials has to be supplemented by the use of resorbable bone replacement materials. For example, in dentistry, when the loss of teeth or periodontal disease results in the loss of the root bone, the potential dental implant site in the upper or lower jaw does not offer enough bone volume or quantity to support the dental implant. Hence, before the placement of bridges or, more commonly, dental implants, supporting bone and/or tissue must be re-grown. This procedure, known as Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR), is accomplished using bone grafts and biocompatible membranes that prevent tissue growth on or around the implant. A bone graft normally takes at least four to six months to heal, before a dental implant can be placed thereon or therein.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">One of the most common substances utilized in repairing bone defects in general, and in dental applications, in particular, is hydroxylapatite (HA),<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(OH) or Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>. Hydroxylapatite is a mineral component found in bones and teeth, and is therefore characterized by the required biocompatibility. Hydroxylapatite, however, often causes irritation of the surrounding bone material. HA, having an approximate resorption time period of 18-36 months is used as a compromise between a highly resorbable and a poorly resorbable material.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Gypsum, for example, is a very soft mineral composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate, CaSO<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O. This form is referred to in the art as calcium sulfate. Heating gypsum at above approximately 150 °C partially dehydrates it to obtain calcium sulfate hemihydrate, CaSO<sub>4</sub>·½H<sub>2</sub>O, is a substance in which the molecular ratio of water molecules to anhydrous calcium sulfate is 1:2, commonly known as "calcined gypsum" or "Plaster of Paris". When calcium hemihydrate is mixed with water at ambient temperatures, it crystallizes into a strong gypsum crystal lattice in an exothermic reaction. Gypsum also has an anhydrous form, termed anhydrous calcium sulfate or calcium sulfate anhydrate, CaSO4, which is produced by further heating of the calcium sulfate hemihydrate to above approximately 180 °C. Anhydrous calcium sulfate reacts slowly with water to return to the dihydrate form.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In a pure water system, the solubility of these different types of calcium sulfate ranges from about 1.0 x 10<sup>-2</sup> M to about 4.0 x 10-2 M (at 25° C). The anhydrate form, however, is a very hard crystal (hardness rating of 3.5, according to the Mohs Hardness Scale, and a relative density of about 3.0, and has an extremely low dissolution rate in water, even when finely ground, rendering it impractical for <i>in vivo</i> applications. In practice, the anhydrate form is mainly used as a desiccant.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Calcium sulfate compositions are also widely used in bone treatment, and in GBR procedures. Calcium sulfate was first used by Dreesman to obliterate bone cavities caused by tuberculosis in 1893. In 1959, Peltier became the first American to report on the use of calcium sulfate as a bone-graft substitute. The strong crystal structure obtained upon a reaction of the calcium sulfate hemihydrate with water renders it highly suitable for casting into sheets, sticks and molds. This feature attributes to its wide spread use in various applications such as setting broken bones (see, for example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US3746680A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 3,746,680</text></patcit>), in dental GBR for filling small volume cavities (see, for example, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6224635B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,224,635</text></patcit>) or in the preparation of dental molds (see, for example, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US4526619A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,526,619</text></patcit>). Combined with natural or synthetic polymers,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> calcium sulfate hemihydrate is used for the controlled release of medicaments or pesticides (see, for example, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6030636A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,030,636</text></patcit>) or as an implant having a controlled resorption rate in vivo for stimulating bone growth (see, for example, <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US20040254259A"><text>U.S. Patent Application No. 2004/0254259</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US4192021A"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 4,192,021</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US4381947A"><text>4,381,947</text></patcit>). In addition, <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US20020110541A"><text>U.S. Patent application Nos. 20020110541</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US20020071827A"><text>20020071827 </text></patcit>and <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="US20030050710A"><text>20030050710</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="US7371408B"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 7,371,408</text></patcit>,<patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="US7371409B"><text> 7,371,409</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="US7371410B"><text>7,371,410</text></patcit>, teach bone graft substitute compositions based on various forms of calcium sulfate.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><patcit id="pcit0014" dnum="US6224635B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,224,635</text></patcit> teaches that when calcium sulfate hemihydrate <i>dissolves in vivo</i> it elevates the local calcium ion concentration in the surrounding tissue. Then, the newly formed calcium ions react with body fluids to cause local precipitation of calcium phosphate bone mineral in the new soft granulation tissue that is formed around the calcium sulfate as it dissolves and recedes. Since the calcium phosphate is stable in vivo, it provides a matrix for the formation of new in-growing bone tissue, although this process is quite unpredictable.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Unfortunately, the calcium sulfate hemihydrate form is not suitable for the treatment of large cavities due to its expansion properties during setting, which cause pain to the patients. Furthermore, it is characterized by a high dissolution rate and inherently by a fast resorption by the human bone, usually within two to seven weeks, depending upon the particular surgical site. Such a fast absorption renders the calcium sulfate hemihydrate impractical for use in the treatment of large bone cavities, since it cannot be retained at the bone site for long periods of time and is resorbed faster than it can be replaced by new bone, thereby reducing its value to both patient and practitioners in fields such as orthopedics or maxiofacial surgery [ArunK. Garg, D.M.D in Bones biology, Harvesting, Grafting for dental implant. Quintessence publication Ed-1].</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The calcium sulfate dihydrate form has acceptable expansion properties. However, its use in repairing bone defects is limited since it has no cementitious properties. Thus, while calcium sulfate dihydrate is often used as surgical cement, additional components are often required so as to achieve the desired cementitious effect. <patcit id="pcit0015" dnum="US5281265A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,281,265</text></patcit>, for example, teaches that a calcium ion can react with a citrate ion to form a less soluble calcium citrate salt, thus forming cement. Hence, while calcium sulfate dihydrate can theoretically fill large bone cavities, the obtained structures are not stable and invariably break. In fact, there is only limited<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> practical healing success when using calcium sulfate dihydrate in the treatment of large bone defects.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Clearly, the use of the currently available biocompatible synthetic compositions for filling large bone cavities suffer severe disadvantages, such as irritation of the surrounding bone material, poor resorbability, low stability and high expansion, which result in pain and discomfort to the patient and a possible leaking out of the filling material or even a loss of the implant.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><patcit id="pcit0016" dnum="WO2007046109A"><text>WO 2007/046109</text></patcit>, of which one of the present inventors is a co-inventor, teaches bone grafting compositions which comprise flakes made of a mixture CSH and CSD, which exhibit both the cementitious and binding properties of CSH and the strength and longer resorption period of the rigid CSD and tricalcium phosphate (TCP) granules.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><patcit id="pcit0017" dnum="WO2000045734A"><text>WO 2000/045734</text></patcit> describes a composite, which can be used for filling in bone voids, and which comprise various forms of calcium sulfate hemihydrate, calcium sulfate dihydrate, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><patcit id="pcit0018" dnum="US5281265A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,281,265</text></patcit> discloses a bone cement material comprising calcium sulfate components, wherein the interaction of a calcium-containing cementing component and a setting component produces a calcium-containing cement which has reduced solubility in water relative to the calcium-containing cementing component.

The invention also relates to an applicator particularly useful for preparing and applying bone graft compositions.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, the present inventors have designed and successfully prepared and practiced several novel unique compositions for bone augmentation, which include various specific combinations of calcium sulfate in different solid hydrate forms (also known as phases), which can, for example, harden in aqueous environment in a relatively short setting time without compromising patient comfort. For example, it has been shown that a particular calcium sulfate phase combination and a particular particle size distribution ratio provided a bone grafting composition characterized by a unique setting time, rigidity and resorption period of the resulting bone graft. In another example, a bone graft composition which includes reinforcing materials which are currently used as dental and orthopedic bone grafts together with a matrix of calcium sulfate as defined herein have been prepared. These compositions provide strong hybrid bone graft materials which are pliable, exhibit short setting times and a very rigid yet highly porous scaffold for bone grafts. These bone graft compositions produce structures which are less brittle than those produced by the known reinforcing materials due to the calcium sulfate matrix that provides the compositions with the desired rigidity.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, therefore relates to bone graft compositions, which utilize a mixture of a cementitious substance and a non-cementitious substance, and further utilize a unique particle size distribution of the particles of each of these substances, such that the composition comprises at least two different particle size ranges of the non-cementitious material. The unique particle size distribution of the compositions described herein, imparts to the compositions the desired properties demonstrated and described herein, and renders such compositions highly beneficial for bone augmentation procedures.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Thus, according to one aspect of embodiments of the present invention there is provided a bone graft composition which comprises a plurality of particles of a cementitious substance and a plurality of particles of a non-cementitious substance, said plurality of particles of said non-cementitious material being characterized by at least two non-overlapping ranges of particles size, the composition being characterized by a particle size distribution according to formula I: <maths id="math0001" num="Formula 1"><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">T</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">0</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">0</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">3</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">3</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">4</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">4</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mo>…</mo><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">i</mi></msub><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">i</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mo>…</mo><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">n</mi></msub><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">n</mi></msub></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="101" he="14" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>

invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to novel compositions, unit dosage forms, articles of manufacturing and methods of repairing bone defects and, more particularly, to bone graft compositions that are characterized by controlled, pre-determined setting, curing and bio-resorbability rates and hence can be beneficially utilized for repairing bone defects. The invention also relates to an applicator particularly useful for preparing and applying bone graft compositions.</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">The principles and operation of the present invention may be better understood with reference to the figures and accompanying descriptions.</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not necessarily limited in its application to the details set forth in the following description or exemplified by the Examples. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111">As discussed hereinabove, calcium sulfate is known in the art as an augmentation filler material for bone defects, however, its use in practice is limited, mostly due to its inappropriate mechanical properties and rapid resorption, leading to inconsistent results. This limitation is mitigated to some extent by use of rigid materials in the form of granules or plates, which provide slower resorption periods. Nevertheless, in practice, these materials do not provide the required binding properties, plasticity or pliability during application.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">Medical grade calcium sulfate is a biocompatible, bioresorbable, and a clinically versatile ceramic for use in bone repair, or cavitary bone defects. Due to its safety, formability and its complete resorption followed by new bone formation, calcium sulfate has been used as a filling material for bone defects in regenerative techniques.</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">The hemihydrate form of calcium sulfate (CaSO<sub>4</sub>•½ H<sub>2</sub>O; abbreviated herein as CSH), is derived from the common mineral gypsum, calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO<sub>4</sub>•2 H<sub>2</sub>O; abbreviated herein as CSD). Adding water in proper quantities to CSH causes CSD to form during setting while it crystallizes into a strong gypsum crystal lattice in a mild exothermic reaction (no tissue damage has been reported). Heating gypsum at above approximately 150 °C partially dehydrates it to obtain CSH. Calcium sulfate also has an anhydrous form, termed anhydrous calcium sulfate or calcium sulfate<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> anhydrate (CaSO<sub>4</sub>; abbreviated herein as CSA) which is produced by further heating CSH to above approximately 180 °C. CSA reacts slowly with water to afford CSD.</p><p id="p0114" num="0114">In typical bone regeneration techniques the bone cavity is filled by a mixture of CSH powder and water (or water solution) and a resulting paste, exhibiting good handling properties and formability, is left to harden in situ to the dihydrate form. Other practices use CSD pre-hardened grafting materials, presented in granule forms, or block forms, which are carried into the defected site. Calcium sulfate is rapidly and completely resorbed, creating a calcium-ion rich milieu in the area of implantation. These calcium ions may provide some stimulation to osteoblasts, which may account for some of the positive results reported with the material. It has been shown that calcium sulfate acts as more than a simple space filler that prevents soft tissue ingrowth; in fact, as it dissolved, calcium sulfate leaves a consistent latticework of hydroxylapatite calcium-phosphate mineral, which was found to be stable in the long term and to act as an osteoconductive trellis for new bone formation. It was also found to promote the formation of blood vessels, which is extremely important for bone formation.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">However, despite its efficiency, the potential applications are limited by the rapid <i>in vivo</i> resorption and the brittleness of calcium sulfate, thus, the use of calcium sulfate is associated with inconsistent results. CSD is not suitable in itself as a bone replacement material, since it does not adhere to the defected area. This form of calcium sulfate is characterized by a slow resorbability rate relative to the hemihydrate form. When it is present in the form of granules it is preferably used in repairing bone defects when combined with additional cementitious materials, for example polymeric materials. CSH is not suitable for the treatment of large cavities due to its expansion properties during setting, which are painful to the patients. In addition, CSH is characterized by a high dissolution rate and inherently by a fast resorption by the human bone, usually within two to seven weeks, depending upon the particular surgical site. Such fast absorption rates render CSH impractical for use in the treatment of large bone cavities, since it cannot be retained at the bone site for long periods of time and is resorbed faster than it can be replaced by new bone, thereby reducing its value to both patient and practitioners in fields such as orthopedics or maxiofacial surgery.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">The mineral phase of bone is mainly composed of natural hydroxylapatite (HA). Therefore bio-cements based on synthetic HA and other calcium salts, phosphates and<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> sulfates, are among the most investigated materials for dental and orthopedic applications in reconstructive surgery. Biological source of HA include bovine HA or coral HA. HA bio-ceramics are widely employed as bone substitute materials with good results, for example, in the treatment of periodontal osseous defects and alveolar ridge augmentation. Highly crystalline HA is resorbed slowly over decades, rather than years, hence, most HA implant materials are osteoconductive. However, when large blocks are used, the ability of osteoprogenitor cells to migrate may be compromised, and fibrous connective tissue may result. In addition, HA was found to be too brittle and difficult to handle.</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">Calcium phosphate cements are used in orthopedics as well as orbital bone support in plastic surgery. Calcium phosphate ceramics are biocompatible, bioactive materials generally available as blocks or granules of dense or porous ceramics. The material is soluble and gradually dissolves in the body, seeding new bone as it releases calcium and phosphate ions into the biological medium. Calcium phosphate bone substitutes, especially in macro-porous forms, show biodegradability and osteoconduction properties, and biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) ceramics, an association of HA and beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP), have proved to be efficient bone substitutes that respond well to material resorption/ bone substitution events. Tricalcium phosphate was first used as a bone graft substitute in 1920. It has two crystal forms, α-TCP and β-TCP that differ in their mechanism and kinetics of resorption. Whereas hydroxylapatite has calcium to phosphate molar ratio of 1.67, TCP has calcium to phosphate molar ratio of 1.5. TCP is less crystalline than hydroxylapatite, and therefore, more soluble. Implants that contain TCP are both biocompatible and osteoconductive, but because of its relative solubility it is used in situations where structural support is less important. Biphasic calcium phosphates of varying HA/β-TCP ratios can be prepared by mechanical mixing of b-TCP and HA powders in desired quantities or by chemical methods producing calcium-deficient apatite forms (CDA). The final macro-porous BCP ceramic depends on its HA/β-TCP ratio and the BCP obtained by sintering. Such BCP ceramics are now currently used for bone filling in spinal, tumoral, orthopedic and periodontal applications. Although the use of calcium phosphate cement and calcium phosphate pellet has been successful, handling of these forms of implants is quiet difficult. Macro-porous blocks have proved<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> brittle and difficult to sculpt and do not fit tightly to the surface of bone defects, and granules are difficult to handle and to keep in place after implantation.</p><p id="p0118" num="0118">Presently used pre-hardened grafting materials are presented in granule forms, or block forms, which are carried into the defected surgical site. This, in turn, presents poor manipulation characteristics which compromise the healing of the bone and requires a skilful clinician in most cases. The facts the granules are not interconnected to form stable cements are of great disadvantage. Many attempts have been made to solve the above noted problems for having the ability to shape, formalize and hardened it as needed <i>in situ.</i> Among the materials considered, plaster of Paris, collagen, different type of calcium phosphate groups, polylactates and polyacrylate cements; none of this materials offered an acceptable comprehensive solution.</p><p id="p0119" num="0119">The present inventors have envisioned that a hybrid material, which would exhibit both the cementitious and binding properties of CSH as well as the strength and longer resorption period of presently known calcium sulfate-based bone grafting products, could be efficiently utilized for forming bone graft compositions while overcoming the limitations associated with the currently available bone graft compositions. As discussed hereinabove, this concept was presented in <patcit id="pcit0028" dnum="WO2007046109A"><text>WO 2007/046109</text></patcit>, of which one of the present inventors is a co-inventor, where compositions comprising flakes made of a mixture of CSH, CSD and CSA are described.</p><p id="p0120" num="0120">While conceiving the present invention, it was suggested that a novel composite material or bone graft composition for repairing bone defects, and for bone augmentation in general, which can afford a strong yet porous solid having a relatively short resorption period compared to other bone grafting products, can be derived from a mixture of cementitious and non-cementitious substances, formulated in a particular distribution of particle size, so as to achieve a concrete, in a form of a cementitious paste, that allows a workable time frame for application, which is long enough to allow satisfactory positioning of the paste in the grating site, and at the same time has a short setting time resulting in a short curing period.</p><p id="p0121" num="0121">It was further conceived that an effective cementitious bone augmentation material, formed in a particular particle shape and size distribution, can be produced from CSH and CSD in unique combination thereof, with CSA or devoid of CSA, and<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> can also be reinforced by beta-TCP ceramic, HA, and other bone grating/augmentation materials currently available. Such compositions would be superior to presently used bone grafting compositions by being free of polymeric additives or special chemical accelerators. Such bone grafting compositions can be formulated and shaped so as to allow their packing into simple mechanical applicators. The bone graft compositions can be activated in the applicator prior to their application by pumping water, saline or other aqueous solutions into the applicator, and be ready for immediate use by means of a simple technique. The activated composition can then be applied by the practitioner into the surgical site, shaped and formed as required, and let harden <i>in situ</i> for several minutes.</p><p id="p0122" num="0122">While reducing the present invention to practice, the present inventors have prepared bone graft compositions according to a specific particle size distribution of cementitious and non-cementitious substances, which was found to posses highly beneficial combination of mechanical properties such as pliability, setting and curing time, and a highly porous cured (solid) structure, leading to desirable, predictable and reproducible optimal results.</p><p id="p0123" num="0123">While further reducing the present invention to practice, bone graft compositions that are basically composed of the hemihydrate and dihydrate forms of calcium sulfate, reinforced in some cases by more rigid and/or less resorbable bone grafting/augmentation materials, have been prepared and characterized.</p><p id="p0124" num="0124">Thus, according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a bone graft composition which includes particles of a cementitious substance as well as particles of a non-cementitious substance, which are provided in a characteristic particle size distribution, as further defined and detailed hereinbelow.</p><p id="p0125" num="0125">As used herein, the phrase "bone graft composition" describes an essentially dry mixture of substances, typically in the form of particulate matter (powder, particles, granules, aggregates, shavings and the likes), which can be mixed with a suitable liquid to form a viscous flowable matter that can be placed in a bone defect, such as a void, a gap or a crack, so as to fill the bone defect and let to set and cure. Bone graft compositions therefore include substances which are suitable for such medical procedures, as described herein.<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --></p><p id="p0126" num="0126">Herein throughout, the terms "material" and "substance" are used interchangeably.</p><p id="p0127" num="0127">According to embodiments of the invention, the cementitious substance and the non-cementitious substance are selected such that upon contacting a mixture thereof with an aqueous solution, a biocompatible concrete is formed.</p><p id="p0128" num="0128">The terms "cement" or "cementitious", as used herein, refer to a dry, granular and/or powdered substance or a mixture of dry, granular and/or powdered substances, which can act as a binder upon activation with a liquid, typically water or another aqueous solution. Upon activation of cement by contacting the cement with water or another aqueous solution, cement affords a cementitious paste, as defined hereinbelow. The cementitious paste sets (solidifies) and hardens (cures) to form a rigid mass as a result of a chemical process known as a hydration reaction. Thus, a cementitious substance can bind non-cementitious substances and materials, as defined herein, mixed therewith upon activation to form a rigid composite mass known as cured concrete.</p><p id="p0129" num="0129">An exemplary cementitious substance that is highly suitable for use in the context of embodiments of the invention includes CSH, as described herein.</p><p id="p0130" num="0130">Additional exemplary cementitious substances that can be suitable for use in the context of embodiments of the invention include, but are not limited to, calcium hydroxide, various forms of calcium silicates, various natural and fabricated pozzolans, fly ash, silica fume, various polymers and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p0131" num="0131">The term "non-cementitious" as used herein, describes a substance which does not set and hardens upon the addition of a liquid. Particles of non-cementitious substances are commonly mixed with cementitious substances and a solvent, typically water or other aqueous solutions, to form fortified or reinforced rigid composite mass, commonly known as concrete, as defined herein. For example, calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CSH) is a cementitious substance, while calcium sulfate dihydrate (CSD) is not. However, mixtures of CSH and CSD can set, harden and thus form rigid solid mass upon activation with water or other aqueous solutions.</p><p id="p0132" num="0132">An exemplary non-cementitious substance that is highly suitable for use in the context of embodiments of the invention includes CSD, as described herein.</p><p id="p0133" num="0133">Additional exemplary non-cementitious substances that can be suitable for use in the context of embodiments of the invention include, but are not limited to, various<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> minerals of calcium, hydroxylapatite, particulate glass ceramic and bioactive glass, various composites of polymer and calcium minerals and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p0134" num="0134">As used herein, the term "concrete" or the phrase "cementitious paste", which are used herein interchangeably, refer to a wet paste which comprises one or more cementitious substances (cement), such as calcium sulfate hemihydrate, one or more non-cementitious substances in a variety of particle sizes, water or another aqueous solution, and optionally other additives. As defined herein, a concrete can be substantially pliable and malleable between the time it starts to set (solidify) and the time it hardens (cures) after mixing with water and placement (rest). The setting or hydration reaction commences as a result of contact between cement and water. The setting process, characterized by a setting time, as defined herein, leads to the binding of all other non-cementitious components together, eventually forming a composite reinforced rigid mass, referred to herein as cured concrete.</p><p id="p0135" num="0135">As used herein, the phrase "aqueous solution" refers to a liquid mixture containing water as a major solvent, among other minor solvents and solutes.</p><p id="p0136" num="0136">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the aqueous solution can be water, purified water, medical grade water for injection or saline (0.9 % NaCl in water, typically purified and sterile).

The completion of a setting process produces a cured solid, or cured concrete, as defined herein.</p><p id="p0139" num="0139">The terms "malleability" or "pliability", as used interchangeably herein, refer to a mechanical property of a substance which can be deformed plastically without fracture. Specifically, these terms refer to a material's ability to deform under compressive stress, which is often manifested by the material's ability to be molded into<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> any shape without cracking or forming fractures. Accordingly, a pliable or malleable substance is one that exhibits the mechanical properties of malleability or pliability.</p><p id="p0140" num="0140">As used herein, the phrase "cured concrete" refers to the solid mass which forms by cements (e.g., cementitious material or paste) and optionally other components after setting and curing. A cured concrete can be characterized by its morphology or other internal macro- or micro-structure features (such as voids, cracks, porosity and crystallinity), and by its chemical and physical characteristics (such as hardness, compressive strength, elastic modulus, chemical stability, resorbability and degradability). A cured concrete is defined herein regardless of other substances which may be present in its voids and pores (such as unbound particles, water or other solvents).</p><p id="p0141" num="0141">According to some embodiments of the invention, the cementitious substance is calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CSH).

Typically, such procedures begin with the hydration of the composition with water, saline or other aqueous solutions, followed by a spontaneous setting stage (e.g., hydration reaction) which affords a transient pliable paste that allows good handling properties for enough time to complete the bone repair/augmentation procedure, and eventually ends in a well positioned rigid (cured) structure.

Formulation B, another exemplary bone grafting composition according to some embodiments of the invention, which includes particles of other bone graft minerals that slow the resorption process of the matrix, is recommended for systems which require longer bio-resorption periods.</p><p id="p0358" num="0358">Following its cementitious reaction, formulation A1 maintained both volume and rigidity properties, and thus may function as a scaffold for bone regeneration. The SEM images presented herein indicated that crystallization produced of needle-like particles increased the strength of the cement. The morphology of the resulting structure is characterized by porosity of about 50 %, made of a plurality of micro-pores which allow growth factor infiltration, and a plurality of macro-pores allow angiogenesis and bone tissue regeneration.</p><p id="p0359" num="0359">The compositions provided herein are characterized by an average bio-resorption rate that corresponds to bone generation rate at the selected bone defect. While osteoid formation occurs within the period of 6-10 weeks, bio-resorption period of existing bone grafting compositions is 4-6 weeks, whereas the resorption period of the exemplary formulation A1 is 4-10 weeks.</p><p id="p0360" num="0360">The exemplary formulation B described herein, is intended to produce a hybrid reinforced matrix material, or a composite bone grafting material, which combines good handling properties with short setting time and final rigidity, which is less brittle. This is achieved herein by coating currently known bone grafting materials with the unique calcium sulfate composition provided herein while maintaining a particular particle size distribution as defined herein. Achieving this goal was demonstrated by incorporating β-TCP particles with calcium sulfate particles. The reinforced calcium sulfate and β-TCP composites provided significantly high mechanical properties.</p><p id="p0361" num="0361">The reinforced calcium sulfate was also inspected using Cerabone®, which is a hydroxylapatite ceramic made of purely inorganic material that is supplied as a molding<!-- EPO <DP n="74"> --> block in different sizes and as granules of differing dimensions, and Bio-Oss®, which is a natural osteoconductive bone substitute that consists of the mineral portion of bovine bone. These combined compositions exhibited very good mechanical properties without any reinforcing additives, such as polymers.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56979032" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="78"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Knochengraftzusammensetzung, umfassend eine Vielzahl von Partikeln einer zementartigen Substanz und eine Vielzahl von Partikeln einer nicht zementartigen Substanz, wobei die nicht zementartige Substanz Calciumsulfatdihydrat (CSD) umfasst, und wobei die Vielzahl von Partikeln der nicht zementartigen Substanz durch zwei sich nicht überlappende Korngrößenbereiche gekennzeichnet ist, wobei die Zusammensetzung durch eine Korngrößenverteilung gemäß Formel I gekennzeichnet ist: <maths id="math0005" num="Formel I"><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">T</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">0</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">0</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">3</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">3</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">4</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">4</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mo>…</mo><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">i</mi></msub><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">i</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mo>…</mo><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">n</mi></msub><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">n</mi></msub></math><img id="ib0005" file="imgb0005.tif" wi="132" he="23" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
