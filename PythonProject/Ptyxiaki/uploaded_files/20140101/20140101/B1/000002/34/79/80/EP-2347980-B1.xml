immediately after deposition of ink thereon by a printing apparatus, due to differences in the amount of ink solvent in the image region. Deformation due to expansion and contraction of the paper as a result of variation in the amount of moisture in the paper is especially pronounced in systems which perform printing by depositing aqueous ink onto ordinary paper. Furthermore, in double-side printing, there are disparity in image size and position between the images which are formed on the front surface and the rear surface (front/rear image error), as a result of the deformation due to expansion and contraction of the paper after the deposition of ink for front surface printing and before the deposition of ink for rear surface printing. Therefore, immediately after printing, it is necessary to equalize the amount of moisture between the sheets and within the sheets so as to correct or alleviate expansion, contraction, and deformation of the paper, by passing air from the natural environment through the gaps between the respective sheets of paper.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2008290800A"><text>2008-290800</text></patcit> discloses a composition in which the intermediate portion of a stack of paper is gripped from front and rear sides by a pair of pressing members and air is blown onto end faces of the paper stack.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2006248771A"><text>2006-248771</text></patcit> discloses a composition in which a ridge is formed in a stacking surface that supports paper so as to create a peak shape (inverted V shape), in order to correct curl where the paper is curved with a concave shape toward the upper side.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP10297813A"><text>10-297813</text></patcit> discloses a composition in which a paper stack loading table designed to align paper is formed in a tiltable fashion, and furthermore air blowing ports are formed in an outer perimeter wall which surrounds this<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> paper stack loading table.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In a seasoning apparatus which blows air of the ambient temperature and humidity between sheets of paper, in contrast to a simple paper aligning apparatus or paper handling apparatus, it is necessary to blow air simultaneously and uniformly onto the whole stack of paper. In particular, in seasoning of a stack of paper on which images containing a large amount of ink have been printed, if there is a large amount of curl in the end portions of the stack of paper, then the stack of paper may incline toward one side due to the blowing of air, making it impossible to blow air with respect to each individual sheet of the stack of paper. More specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 13</figref>, if curl occurs which bends in the air blowing direction indicated by the arrow in a paper stack 32, then the air flow is not liable to enter into the gaps between the sheets of paper.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In a composition where the intermediate portion of a paper stack is pressed from the front and rear sides by a pair of pressing members, as in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2008290800A"><text>2008-290800</text></patcit> , as the curl of the paper stack in the air blowing direction becomes greater, there arises a portion of the paper stack which receives the air flow fully and a portion of the paper stack which hardly receives the air flow, and therefore it is difficult to equalize the amount of moisture in the paper stack, even if paper handling is possible. In a composition where an inverted V-shaped stacking surface having a ridge is used, as described in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2006248771A"><text>2006-248771</text></patcit> , it is difficult to equalize the amount of moisture in the paper stack, even if curl in a concave shape toward the upper side can be corrected in each individual sheet of paper.

A plurality of through holes is formed in the bottom surface so that a part of each lower edge of the plurality of paper sheets is exposed outside, and projecting parts continuous in the direction orthogonal to the bottom surface are formed on a surface abutted on a paper sheet surface out of inner surfaces in which the paper sheets are stored.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="JP9309624B"><text>JP9309624</text></patcit> discloses a sheet-feeding device for, for example, a printer. A mounting surface of a sheet tray is provided with a protrusion acting as a curl-correcting section at a central part in a width direction of a sheet. When a plurality of sheets is mounted on the mounting surface, the sheets are curved in an upward protruded shape. In the case where an extremity of a sheet is curled upward or downward due to this curve, the curl is corrected or reduced. As air is blown against the extremity of the sheet, the air smoothly flows into a clearance between the uppermost sheet and the next sheet so as to perform separation of the sheets.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention has been contrived in view of these circumstances, an object thereof being to provide an air blowing apparatus whereby the amount of moisture can be equalized reliably between sheets of paper and within sheets of paper, even in the case of a stack of paper having a large amount of curl.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In order to attain an object described above, the present invention is directed to an air blowing apparatus comprising: a paper stack accommodating section which forms a paper stack accommodating space for accommodating a stack of paper; and an air blowing device which blows air toward an edge of each sheet of paper of the stack of paper accommodated in the paper stack accommodating space, wherein the paper stack accommodating section includes a curved surface which faces a paper surface of the stack of paper, and the curved surface extends in an air blowing direction of the air blowing device and has a curvature in a direction perpendicular to the air blowing direction of the air blowing device.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">More specifically, since the paper stack accommodating section forming a paper stack accommodating space includes a curved surface which faces a paper surface of the paper stack and the curved surface extends in the air blowing direction of the air blowing device and has a curvature in a direction perpendicular to the air blowing direction of the air blowing device, then even in the case of a stack of paper having a large amount of curl, it is possible to introduce an air flow uniformly into the gaps between the sheets of paper and therefore the amount of moisture can be equalized reliably between the sheets and within each sheet.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to the invention, the paper stack accommodating section includes a plurality of curved surfaces which respectively face paper surfaces of the stack of paper and have a same direction of curve, the paper stack accommodating space being sandwiched between the plurality of curved surfaces.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to the invention, the plurality of curved surfaces may have mutually different curvatures. In other words, by adopting different curvatures for the curved surface which faces one paper surface (front surface) of the paper stack and the curved surface which faces the other paper surface (rear surface) of the paper stack, a composition is achieved in which non-uniform behavior of the paper stack is created during air blowing so that uniform passage of air is possible.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to another mode of the invention, the paper stack accommodating section has a ridge portion that connects with one of the curved surfaces, is situated on a paper input side, and is formed in a chamfered shape. In other words, a composition may be achieved in which the paper stack can be introduced readily into the paper stack accommodating space. the paper stack accommodating section has a ridge portion that connects with the curved surface, is situated on a paper input side, and formed in a chamfered shape.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to another mode of the invention, the curvature of the curved surfaces is substantially same in the air blowing direction.

In other words, the paper accommodating space 16 is a space sandwiched between the paper stack loading table 11 and the ceiling 12, the two side plates 13a and 13b, and the front plate 14 and the rear plate 15, the members of each of these pairs being arranged to opposite each other.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The upper face 11a of the paper stack loading table 11 (which is also referred to as "paper loading surface") and lower face 12a of the ceiling plate 12 (which is also referred to as "paper pressing surface") are surfaces which face the paper surfaces (namely, the front surface or rear surface of paper) of the paper stack accommodated inside the paper stack accommodating space 16. The paper loading surface 11a and the paper pressing surface 12a extend in the x direction (air blowing direction) in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, and also have a curvature in the y direction which is perpendicular to the x direction in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.

The paper loading surface 11a and the paper restricting surface 12a according to the present embodiment are both formed so as to curve upward in the vertical direction (the z direction in the drawing). In other words, the paper stack accommodating space 16 according to the present embodiment is formed as a substantially arc-shaped space which is faced on either side by a plurality of curved surfaces 11a and 12a that curve upwards in the vertical direction.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The paper stack loading table 11 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is shown in the perspective diagram in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>.

The air blowing devices 20 in the present embodiment blow an air flow toward the lengthwise direction edges of the respective sheets of paper 30 in the paper stack 32 which is mounted on the paper stack loading table 11 and accommodated in the paper stack accommodating space 16. In other words, the air blowing devices 20 perform blowing of air in terms of the x direction in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. In the present embodiment, the air blowing devices 20 are centrifugal fans, but they are not limited in particular and may be axial flow fans. Air blowing ports 17<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> (opening sections) are formed respectively at the positions of the outlet ports of the respective air blowing devices 20 of the front plate 14. The air blowing ports 17 are formed with an opening length substantially equal to the height of the paper stack accommodating space 16, in such a manner that an air flow can be blown simultaneously onto substantially the whole range of the height direction z of the paper stack accommodating space 16. Furthermore, air passage ports 18 through which the air flow output from the air blowing devices 20 can be expelled are formed in the side plates 13a and 13b.

By making the curvature of the paper loading surface 11a of the paper stack loading table 11 different from the curvature of the paper restricting surface 12a of the ceiling plate 12, it is possible to achieve non-uniform oscillation of the paper 30 of the paper stack 32 during air blowing in such a manner that the seasoning (air blowing) performance is improved.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">For example, the curvature of the paper loading surface 11a is made greater than the curvature of the paper restricting surface 12a.
