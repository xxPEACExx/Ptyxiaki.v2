directed to improved apparatus for the delivery of laser energy, including without limitation, to a laser delivery catheter.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Arteries are the primary blood vessels that are responsible for providing blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. Arterial disease occurs when arteries become narrowed or blocked by a buildup of plaque (as some examples, atherosclerotic plaque or other deposits). When the blockage is severe, the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle is reduced, causing chest pain. Arterial blockage by clots formed in a human body may be relieved in a number of traditional ways. Drug therapy, including nitrates, beta-blockers, and peripheral vasodilatator drugs to dilate the arteries or thrombolytic drugs to dissolve the clot, can be effective. If drug treatment fails, angioplasty may be used to reform or remove the atherosclerotic plaque or other deposits in the artery.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Traditional balloon angioplasty is sometimes used to address the blockage by inserting a narrow, flexible tube having a balloon into an artery in the arm or leg. The blocked area in the artery can be stretched apart by passing the balloon to the desired treatment site and gently inflating it a certain degree. In the event drug therapy is ineffective or angioplasty is too risky (often introduction of a balloon in an occluded artery can cause portions of the atherosclerotic material to become dislodged which may cause a total blockage at a point downstream of the subject occlusion thereby requiring emergency procedures), the procedure known as excimer laser angioplasty may be indicated.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Excimer laser angioplasty procedure is similar in some respects to conventional coronary balloon angioplasty. A narrow, flexible tube, the laser catheter, is inserted into an artery in the arm or leg. The laser catheter contains one or more optical fibers, which can transmit laser energy. The laser catheter is then advanced inside the artery to the targeted obstruction at the desired treatment site. After the laser catheter has been positioned, the laser is energized to "remove" the obstruction.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In many procedures, the lesion is often engaged similar to conventional balloon angioplasty by crossing the blockage with a guidewire. The laser catheter's thin, flexible optical fibers facilitate the desired positioning and alignment of the catheter. Using the excimer laser, the clinician performs a controlled blockage removal by sending bursts of ultraviolet light through the catheter and against the blockage, a process called "ablation." The catheter is then slowly advanced through the blockage reopening the artery. If there are multiple blockages, the catheter is advanced to the next blockage site and the above step is repeated. When the indicated blockages appear to be cleared, the catheter is withdrawn.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, due to the configuration of the optical fibers in most prior art laser<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> catheters, the clinician is able to ablate only material that is typically directly in front of the distal end of the catheter. Thus, the debulked tissue area is limited to an area approximately the size of the optical fiber area at the distal end of the catheter. Typically, follow-up angioplasty is recommended.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Thus, it would be desirable to provide an apparatus and methods that could bias the distal end of the laser catheter in a desired direction to enable the clinician to ablate an area larger than the area of the distal end of the catheter, Furthermore, because plaque may be eccentric in a blood vessel and require directional control to adequately ablate the target area, it would be advantageous to provide an apparatus that is sufficiently flexible to travel and rotate around the target area so that the clinician may control the area to be ablated.</p><heading id="h0002">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present teaching provides a catheter as detailed in claim 1.

Rather, the ensuing description of the embodiments will provide those skilled in the art with an enabling description for implementing an embodiment. It should be understood that various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the scope as set forth in the appended claims.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Embodiments described herein provide for an eccentric balloon catheter. A catheter is provided that includes an elongated catheter body with a cavity (or window) within a peripheral portion of the elongated catheter body near the distal end of the catheter. The cavity exposes a portion of the interior of the catheter body and/or extends along a portion of the periphery of the catheter body. A balloon is disposed within the catheter body within the cavity such that when the balloon is deflated or mostly deflated the balloon is contained within the radius of catheter body. When the balloon is inflated the balloon expands and extend through the cavity beyond a portion of the periphery of the catheter body. Moreover, in some embodiments, the balloon may eccentrically located within the catheter body, such that when inflated the balloon inflates generally outwardly in one direction from the axis of the catheter body. The balloon is coupled with the catheter body such that the balloon and the elongate housing may move relative to one another.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">An eccentric balloon catheter includes an eccentric guidewire tube that extends at least to the distal end of the catheter and have an aperture at the distal face of the catheter. The eccentric guidewire tube is positioned eccentric relative to the central axis of the catheter body. Moreover, the guidewire tube may include an inner lumen. The guidewire tube may also extend to the proximal end of the catheter or the guidewire tube may terminate anywhere along the elongated catheter body with a proximal aperture. The guidewire tube, for example, may have an outer diameter of 0.61 mm (0.024 inches) and an inner diameter of 0.46 mm (0.018 inches). The guidewire tube may generally be configured to accept a guidewire and allow the guidewire to slide within the guidewire lumen. The guidewire tube may also be eccentrically arranged within the catheter body. That is, the guidewire tube may not be aligned with the longitudinal central axis of the catheter body, instead, the guidewire tube may be offset between the catheter body central axis and the periphery of the catheter body. In some embodiments, the guidewire tube may be<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> eccentrically located near the same periphery as the cavity. That is, the guidewire tube may extend along a portion of the length of the catheter body parallel to the central axis of the catheter body but off axis with respect to the central axis. In some embodiments, the guidewire tube within the cavity may be exposed to the exterior of the elongate housing. The catheter body may also include one or more light guides, for example, such as a plurality of optical fibers arranged to conduct light from the proximal end of the catheter toward the distal end of the catheter.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In use, the eccentric balloon catheter may be inserted into a vessel within the human body by following a previously placed guidewire through the guidewire lumen (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9A</figref>). Once the distal end of the catheter is positioned near a target within the vessel, the catheter may ablate a portion of the target with laser light. The size of the resulting ablation will be at most the diameter of the distal aperture of the fiber optic bundle. In order to ablate a larger cross section within the target, the balloon may be inflated. As the balloon is inflated, the balloon may provide pressure against an inner vessel wall, which may move the catheter laterally within the vessel (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9B</figref>). After the catheter has moved laterally, the exit aperture of the light guide is now positioned to ablate a previously unablated portion of the target. The balloon may be deflated, the catheter twisted along the central axis, and the balloon inflated to position the exit aperture of the light guide near another unablated portion of the target. If the exit aperture of the light guide is not close enough to the target or too close to the target, the catheter may slide longitudinally relative to the balloon to move into a more ideal position.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> shows a eccentric balloon catheter 100 in use according to one embodiment of the invention. Laser 105 is shown coupled with user interface 110. Laser 105 and user interface 110, in other embodiments of the invention, may be coupled into one system. Laser 105 is connected with catheter 120 that may be inserted into a vessel within a human body 130. Laser 105 and catheter 120 may be coupled using a laser coupler. Catheter 120 may include an elongated tube that may include a number of elements. Catheter 120 may be of any suitable length A, with a length A between about 50 cm and about 390 cm. For example, the catheter may be 1.02 mm (0.04 inches) to 4.06 mm (0.16 inches) in diameter. Catheter 120 may include at least one optical fiber or a bundle of optical fibers that transmits light from laser 105 down at least a portion of the catheter. Some optical fibers may return reflected light back toward laser 105.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The fiber optics within the catheter may receive light from the laser and conduct the light from the proximal end of the catheter to a target from the distal end of the catheter. The catheter may also use liquid or a combination of liquid and optical fibers to conduct light toward the distal end. The light from the laser may be directed toward a target within a vessel using fiber optics within the catheter. The target may be within various biological vessels, for example, blood vessels, arteries, capillaries, organs, etc. In non medical applications, for example, the vessel may include any type a deep cavity within which non-destructive imaging is required, such as, tubes, chambers, pipes, etc.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> shows eccentric balloon catheter including a catheter body 200 with cavity 215 cut through a portion of the periphery of the catheter body. Catheter body 200 may also include distal end 225. Cavity 200 may extend longitudinally for about 1 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm or more along the periphery of the elongated body. Cavity 215 is simply cut from the periphery of the catheter body and may exposes portions of the catheter within catheter body 200. Cavity 215 is position on one side of catheter body 200. A guidewire tube 205 may include a guidewire lumen disposed therein and may be disposed within catheter body 200. Guidewire tube 205, for example, may extend to distal end 225 of catheter body 200. At distal end 225, guidewire tube 205 may have an exit port wherein a guidewire may be introduced and slid through the guidewire lumen. Distal end 225 also shows the distal ends of a plurality of fiber optics that extend through the catheter body from the proximal end toward the distal end. The fiber optics may be disposed within the catheter body opposite the guidewire tube. The fiber optics may be replaced with any material that transmits laser light from the proximal end toward the distal end. For example, a liquid light guide may be used singly or in combination with fiber optics.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Balloon 220 is shown inflated and extending from within cavity 215.

In some embodiments, balloon 220 may have an inflated diameter up to about 6 mm and as little as 1 mm. In some embodiments, balloon 220 may comprise tubing with a sealed distal end. In some embodiments, the distal end of balloon tubing may have thinner walls and/or a larger diameter such that the distal end inflates under pressure. Balloon 220, for example, may comprise any type of plastic, for example, balloon 220 may comprise nylon, Teflon, urethane, polyethylene, or a mixture thereof. Balloon 220, in some embodiments, may be 10 cm, 9 cm, 8 cm, 7 cm, 6 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 3 cm, 2 cm, or 1 cm in length. In some embodiments, balloon 220 may be partially inflated, completely inflated, completely deflated or any level of inflation/deflation in between. Moreover, in some embodiments, balloon 220 may be a compliant balloon which allows for varying inflation diameters without full inflation. In other embodiments, balloon 220 may be non-compliant.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Balloon 220 may also be coupled with a balloon lumen (or balloon tube with an inner lumen) that extends from the proximal portion of the balloon through the catheter body toward the proximal end of the guidewire housing. Balloon lumen may terminate at a balloon port. Balloon lumen may couple with a luer fitting at balloon port. In some embodiments, balloon lumen may bifurcate with the catheter body and be located a distance away from the catheter body. Balloon lumen may include a small diameter lumen. For example, the inner diameter of balloon lumen may be approximately 0.18 mm (0.007 inches). In some embodiments, the inner diameter of balloon lumen may be between 0.13 and 0.38 mm (0.005 and 0.015 inches). The outside diameter of balloon lumen, for example, may be 0.41 mm (0.016 inches). In some embodiments, the outside diameter of balloon lumen may be 1.27 to 0.18 mm (0.05 to 0.007 inches). At the balloon port or luer, balloon lumen may be coupled with a syringe or an indeflator. Balloon 220 may be inflated by injecting fluid through balloon lumen using either a syringe or an indeflator. In some embodiments, the balloon may be inflated using a contrast agent fluid or saline solution. Balloon lumen may include any<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> type of plastic tubing known in the art.

Balloon 220 inflation tube may then be coupled with an air or liquid pump. The balloon may be inflated by the pump by pumping air or liquid into the balloon. In some embodiments, balloon 220 may be deflated by removing the air or liquid from balloon 220 using the pump. In some embodiments, because balloon 220 is pressurized when inflated, balloon 220 may be deflated by purging the air or liquid from the balloon with or without using the pump. For example, a purge valve may be coupled with the balloon lumen that allows the air or liquid within an inflated balloon to be released when the purge valve is opened.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In some embodiments, balloon 220 may also surround guidewire tube 205.

Some steps may be omitted and others added to what is shown in <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 10</figref> and/or what is described herein. The proximal end of a guidewire is fed, for example, through a guidewire lumen starting at the guidewire port at block 1005. The guidewire may have been previously positioned within the vessel. The catheter may then be inserted into the vessel by feeding the catheter over the guidewire tube until the catheter is<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> positioned at or near a target at blocks 1010 and 1015. Once at the target, the laser may be activated at block 1016, and the eccentric balloon catheter may be advanced through the lesion ablating a portion of the target at block 1018, creating a pilot channel. Once the pilot channel has been ablated the laser catheter may be deactivated and/or repositioned. In order to ablate the periphery of the target and/or the pilot channel, for example, the eccentric balloon may be inflated causing the catheter to axially shift within the vessel at block 1020. Because of this axially shift, the distal end of the catheter may not be in position to ablate material near the vessel walls. Accordingly, at block 1025, a stiffening stylet may be inserted into the catheter to provide lateral support near where the balloon is exerting pressure. The stiffening stylet may inserted at anytime during the procedure. The laser may then be activated ablating target material at block 1030 and the catheter may optionally be advanced while the balloon is held relatively in place at block 1035.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56978468" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Laserkatheter, aufweisend:
