mxw-id="PDES63956999" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>Technical field</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a switching installation comprising a gas-filled enclosure. The invention also relates to method for use with such switching installation.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Medium and high voltage switching installations, for voltages of over 1000 V, are widely used with SF<sub>6</sub> insulation due to its good insulation properties, allowing to obtain compact installations. There is however a strong wish to move away from SF<sub>6</sub> as insulation medium, on account of the negative consequences of SF<sub>6</sub> for the environment -notably of its decomposition products HF, SOF<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>-. Therefore, air is used more and more as an insulation medium. As a consequence of the factor 2 to 4 less well insulation quality of air, the size of the installation needs to be increased to prevent electrical sparkover or arcing between the various voltage-carrying parts. This in turn leads to an increase in the amount of energy released upon occasional arcing, as the amount of energy is proportional to the size of the arc, which is proportional to the distance between the conductive parts.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Without further measures, the energetic arcing will continue until the voltage is taken of the voltage-carrying parts, which is generally done by switching the installation off of the grid with an external switch further up in the grid in a power supply line feeding the switching installation. Such external switching is generally done after about one second after the misbehaviour of the switching installation has been detected by an external monitoring system in the grid. One second of energetic arcing may however result in a significant danger and damage. The switching installation thus has to be equipped with a measure to take away the energetic arc that is sufficiently fast to reduce the effects to acceptable levels.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A switching installation with an air-filled enclosure with arc protection is described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1463172A1"><text>EP 1 463 172 A1</text></patcit>, in which the input conductor is automatically grounded upon the occurrence of an energetic arc in the enclosure, in order to stop the arcing. It relies on a pressure increase in the enclosure upon the occurrence of an energetic arc and the resulting heating of the air. The enclosure comprises a venting panel, which<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> opens upon an increase of the pressure in the enclosure and, via a flexible cable, acts on an earthing switch. The earthing switch short-circuits the conductor to ground, such that the arcing stops.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The known switching installation has the drawback that, although the arcing is stopped, hot gasses are released through the venting panel and may thus comprise a safety risk for operating personnel in the vicinity of the switching installation.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Another example of a switching installation in which pressure generated by an internal arc is used for actuating a grounding switch is shown in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP0235755A1"><text>EP 0 235 755 A1</text></patcit>. Also in this installation, actuation of the grounding switch causes the internal arc to disappear. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="DE102006033766A1"><text>DE102006033766A1</text></patcit> discloses a contact system for a short-circuiting device in a switchboard plant.A robust arc protection mechanism is also beneficial for systems using SF<sub>6</sub> insulation. Although an arc in such a system is shorter, hence less energetic, arcing may still cause damage to the switching installation, which may cause a unwanted release of hot gasses, such as the SF<sub>6</sub>-decomposition products, and more important a safety risk for operating personnel. Moreover, as SF<sub>6</sub> is a greenhouse gas, release of SF<sub>6</sub> is unwanted for environmental reasons.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">Therefore, the present invention aims to provide a switching installation comprising a gas-filled enclosure with an improved level of safety against the effects of the occurrence of arcing, with a large degree of robustness. This object is solved by a switching installation according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">For this purpose, the switching installation comprising the gas-filled enclosure comprises:
<ul><li>an input conductor arranged to carry an input voltage,<br/>
the input conductor and the enclosure being insulated from each other by a gas and solid insulation, and</li><li>an actuator and an arc initiator,<br/>
the actuator being arranged to actuate the arc initiator upon the occurrence of a first arc with a first length in the enclosure,<br/>
the arc initiator creating, upon being actuated, a path for a second arc of a second length, the second length being shorter than the first length.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">As soon as the path for the second arc is created, the first arc will extinguish and the second arc having a shorter length will appear. This second, shorter, arc will bring less energy into the enclosure compared to the first, longer, arc. The risk that the installation will be damaged is thus reduced. Moreover, if the enclosure would anyhow break, the release of hot gasses and possibly even fire will be less energetic and its effects less severe. As a result, the associated risk for the installation and the people in its vicinity, e.g. the operators, is reduced.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Also the second, shorter, arc will be at a well-defined position, i.e., with the arc initiator, whereas the position of the first energetic arc is unpredictable. This can be beneficially exploited when designing the enclosure, as there is less need to design the complete enclosure to be able to withstand an energetic arc at any position for a significant time.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The gas e.g. comprises substantially air or SF<sub>6</sub>.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In a further embodiment, the actuator is arranged to react on an increase in pressure in the enclosure upon the occurrence of the first arc.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The occurrence of an energetic arc will lead to an increase of the pressure in the enclosure, as the gas expands upon being heated. This pressure will be referred to as the arc pressure.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In one embodiment, the actuator comprises a mechanical link with the enclosure and the actuator is arranged to transfer an expansion of a part of the enclosure to the arc initiator using the mechanical link.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Upon the occurrence of an energetic arc, the arc pressure generates an expansion of the enclosure, or a section thereof. This expansion can be directly transferred by a mechanical link connected to the expanding section. The mechanical link will thus move with the expansion of the enclosure, and actuate the arc initiator.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The arc initiator may be mechanically connected to the actuator. The arc initiator may alternatively be positioned at a small distance from the actuator, such that the actuator can freely move over a small distance before actuating the arc initiator.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In an alternative embodiment, the actuator comprises a pressure box with a flexible input surface and a flexible output surface connected to the arc initiator, and<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the arc pressure generates an inward movement of the flexible input surface of the pressure box, generating an outward movement of the flexible output surface.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The arc pressure will act upon the pressure box, and will thus be transferred by the pressure box to a movement of the arc initiator.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In another alternative embodiment, the actuator comprises an arc detector sensing the occurrence of an arc.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The arc detector may detect a level of light originating from the first arc or a level of ionization originating from the first arc. Also, the arc detector may actively sense the pressure increase using a pressure sensor. Once the arc detector senses the occurrence of an arc, the actuator will be operated to drive the arc initiator.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In embodiments, the second length is at most half of the first length. In further embodiments, the second length is at most one quarter of the first length.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As arc energy is proportional to arc length, this reduction of the arc length will thus directly result in a reduction of the arc energy with the same fraction, i.e., a reduction of the arc length with a factor of two will reduce the arc energy with substantially the same factor of two.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The arc is thus effectively moved to a position where the length of the arc is much reduced. Moreover, the length and position of the arc are also well controlled, as they are determined by the well-defined path for the second arc.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In embodiments, the actuator and the arc initiator are situated inside the enclosure.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">This has the advantage that no additional space is required around the enclosure, so as not to increase the space required to fit the enclosure.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In a further embodiment, the solid insulation comprises a solid cable isolation for insulating the input conductor, and the arc initiator is arranged to create, upon being actuated, the path for the second arc through a section of the solid cable insulation.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The path for the second arc is thus created in an environment comprising solid insulating material in stead of an environment comprising a gas. The path of the second arc is thus well-controlled and located at a relatively safe location.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In a further embodiment, the arc initiator comprises a driving peg and an insulating plug with a first surface and an second surface,<br/>
the insulating plug being inserted in a hole in the solid cable isolation around the input conductor,<br/>
the driving peg being arranged to, when actuated by the actuator, perforate the insulating plug from the first surface to the second surface,<br/>
in order to create a channel for the path for the second arc.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The driving peg may be in contact with the enclosure, e.g., via a conductive mechanical connection to the enclosure. The driving peg may be conductive. The driving peg may be grounded, directly, via the enclosure or indirectly.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The insulating plug may be positioned in a hole in a solid insulation around the cable connector. The solid insulation and the insulating plug assure that the part of the switching installation where all high voltage parts are positioned at close distance to the enclosure and other parts is well insulated from the enclosure and other parts during normal operation. The insulation is broken once the arc initiator is actuated by the actuator upon an expansion of the expanding section of the enclosure when a high-energetic arc occurs.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The driving peg may be in substantially direct contact with the input conductor in operation shortly after having perforated the insulating plug, thus short-circuiting the cable connector to ground.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The driving peg will burn upon being in direct contact with the cable connector, as it is dimensioned such that it cannot withstand the short circuit current. This breaks the direct contact, and leaves a channel for the path for the second arc. The insulating plug may also burn, partly or completely.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In other words, once the peg will get in contact with the cable connector, or get very close to it, the peg will burn. After the peg has burned, the contact will be lost but an arc path will remain.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The arc protection thus does not rely on the presence of a non-interrupted, metallic grounding path, but in stead continues to work by providing the second arc path. This makes the arc protection more robust than a mechanism which relies on a non-interrupted, metallic grounding path as in the <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP1463172A1"><text>EP 1 463 172 A1</text></patcit> document discussed above.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Alternatively, the driving peg may perforate the insulating plug and come to a close distance to the input conductor, separated by a thin gap only. The thin gap may be sufficiently small to allow the current to flow from the input conductor to the driving peg, substantially immediately forming an arc between the input conductor and the driving peg. The driving peg may then burn, and an arc path may remain between the input conductor and ground.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The driving peg may be a metallic element with a sharp tip at its end.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The sharp tip allows an easy penetration of the insulating plug.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The arc initiator further may comprise a metallic plug with a guiding channel, the driving peg being arranged to, when actuated by the actuator, move through the guiding channel, and the metallic plug being grounded.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The guiding channel may be a cylindrical hole extending through the metallic plug.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The second arc path that is thus created then extends from the input conductor through the hole in the insulating plug (if still present), to the metallic plug. The metallic plug is designed such as to withstand the short short-circuit current pulse.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The driving peg may be grounded via the metallic plug.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The insulating plug may comprise a conductive layer at the first surface.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">This shields the driving peg dielectrically from the input conductor during normal operation of the switching installation.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The insulating plug may be a substantially solid plug made from an insulating material.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The insulating plug may comprise a rubber material.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The rubber allows easy penetration by the driving peg. Moreover, the rubber provides a good dielectric isolation between the voltage carrying input conductor at one side of the insulating plug and the grounded parts at the other side of the insulating plug.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In an embodiment, the insulating plug comprises a vacuum chamber and the first surface comprises a first end cap arranged to maintain a vacuum in the vacuum chamber when the first end cap is intact and to break the vacuum when the first end cap is perforated by the driving peg.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The vacuum chamber provides an insulation when it is intact, i.e. when the first end cap is intact and maintaining a vacuum in the vacuum chamber. Such vacuum provides a very good insulation.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">When the first end cap is perforated, the vacuum chamber fills with the gas from the enclosure and the good insulation provided by vacuum is removed. As a result, the driving peg comes into contact with the input conductor or at a sufficiently close distance to the input conductor, thus creating the channel for the path for the second arc.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In a further embodiment, the enclosure is grounded, so as to have a well-defined voltage reference and to minimize interference to and from the outside world.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The path for the second arc may be created, upon actuation of the arc initiator, between the input conductor and ground.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The gas in the enclosure may comprise a gas component selected from the group of air and SF<sub>6</sub>.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Both air and SF<sub>6</sub> can serve as an insulation between the enclosure, the input conductor and possible other conductive elements in the enclosure.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">As discussed above, air may be used because of, e.g., environmental reasons.

The switching installation 5 comprises a closed enclosure 30 made from metal, inside which the elements of the switching installation 5 are located. The enclosure 30 is mounted on a securing frame 34. In the example shown, the switching installation 5 is used to make or break an electrical connection between a power supply line 35, which is connected to a cable connection 33, and one of the rails 15 of a three-phase rail system. A conductor leads from the cable connection 33 to a bottom connection of a circuit breaker 12, in the form of a vacuum circuit breaker, which is actuated by a drive rod 16. In the switching installation 5, the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> circuit breaker 12 is used to switch currents on and off. The other connection of the circuit breaker 12 is connected, in the example shown, via a sliding electrically conductive connection, to a first side of a disconnector 14 which is actuated by a second drive rod 17. The sliding electrically conductive connection means that there is electrical contact between circuit breaker 12 and disconnector 14 irrespective of the position of the circuit breaker 12 and the disconnector 14. In the closed position, the other side of the disconnector 14 is in contact with a branch rail 18, which is connected to one of the rails 15 which extends perpendicular to the plane of the drawing. The disconnector 14 can also electrically disconnect the conduction path between cable connection 33 and rails 15 by means of the second drive rod 17. The disconnector 14 can also be brought into contact with a ground contact 29, so that the entire electric circuit from circuit breaker 12 can be grounded. The drive rod 16 and second drive rod 17 for the circuit breaker 12 and disconnector 14, respectively, are operated by a drive mechanism 11 which is located on the top side of the closed enclosure 30 indicated by a thick line in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. In addition to this mechanism 11, on the top side of the enclosure 30 there is also a space for secondary equipment 31 (such as safety, measuring and recording equipment) and a control panel 32.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> shows a cross-sectional view which only shows one phase section of a switching installation 5. It will be clear to the person skilled in the art that the other two phase sections of the switching installation 5 are located in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the drawing, the corresponding branch rail 18 then in each case being connected to a different rail 15 of the rail system. The three phase sections together form a functional unit, also referred to as a field. Therefore, for a complete switching installation 5, a plurality of functional units can be positioned next to one another.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">The top side of the circuit breaker 12, its drive rod 16, the disconnector 14 and its second drive rod 17 and the branch rail 18, ground contact 29 and sections of the rail 15 may be surrounded, as in the exemplary embodiment illustrated, by an electrically insulating barrier 10 which is used for dielectric separation (or insulation) with respect to the adjacent phases and with respect to the closed enclosure 30.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">The cable connection or input conductor 33 is equipped with a solid cable insulation 42 which is used for insulation with respect to other conducting elements and<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the closed enclosure 30. The solid cable insulation 42 comprises an insulating plug 43 fitting a hole in the solid cable insulation 42 close to the input conductor 33. The insulating plug 43 is for example manufactured from rubber or any other suitable material which has electrically insulating properties but which is pierceable at the same time. The upper surface 45 of the insulating plug 43 may be in contact with the input conductor 33, or at a close distance from it. A thin, metal driving peg 51 is located at the lower surface 44 side of the insulating plug 43. The lower surface 44 may be covered with a conductive layer 46 for shielding the driving peg 51 from the input conductor 33 during normal operation of the switching installation. The driving peg 51 is guided by a metal plug 52, also fitted in the hole in the solid cable insulation 42. In the shown example, the metal plug 52 is grounded. Alternatively, the metal plug 52 not grounded itself but provides, when the driving peg 51 is actuated as described below, an electrical contact to the enclosure 30. Instead of using a metal plug, it is also possible to implement a driving peg 51 that is capable of conducting a large current. In such alternative embodiment the driving peg itself may be grounded. The insulating plug 43, the driving peg 51, and possibly the metal plug 52 together form a arc initiator, the functioning of which will be described below.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The enclosure 30 comprises an actuator having a mechanical link 50 with the enclosure 30. The mechanical link 50 connects a section 60 of the enclosure 30 to the driving peg 51.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> shows the electrical switching installation 5 upon the occurrence of a first, energetic arc 62 between the disconnector 14 and the enclosure 30. This first arc 62 is so energetic that it generates a lot of heat, heating the air in the enclosure 30 and resulting in an expansion 64 of the section 60 of the enclosure 30. Due to the alternating current behaviour of the supply current, this energetic arc 62 may be maintained for a considerable time if no further measures would be applied, as it will ignite at each subsequent cycle of the alternating current. In this embodiment however, the expansion 64 of the enclosure acts on the mechanical link 50, which drives the driving peg 51 upward. The driving peg 51 perforates the insulating plug 43 all the way through the upper surface 45 thereof. In this way, a metallic and hence electrically conductive path is created from the input conductor 33 to ground. A large short-circuit current will run through the driving peg 51. As the driving peg 51 is too thin to be able<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> to withstand this large current, the driving peg 51 will burn almost instantly, or at least its tip, extending out of the metal plug 52, leaving one of the situations shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4a-4c</figref>. The insulating plug 43 may also vaporize as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4a-4b</figref>, or leave a channel as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig 4c</figref>. After the insulating plug 43 has been perforated or vaporized and the driving peg 51 has disappeared, a path is created for a second arc 68 between the input conductor 33 and the metal plug 52, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>. The second arc 68 thus has a short length, hence lower energy than the first energetic arc 62, and is created at a well-defined position. The first energetic arc 62 is now extinguished and the associated risks are removed. The second lower energetic arc 68 usually continues until the voltage is taken of the input conductor 33 with an external switch on the power supply line 35.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">An alternative embodiment is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5</figref>. Instead of the mechanical link, the actuator 50 in the enclosure 30 comprises a pressure box 70. The pressure box 70 has a flexible input surface 72 and a flexible output surface 74. The flexible output surface 74 is connected to a driving peg 51. The driving peg 51 is arranged to, upon being driven, perforate an insulating plug 43, like in the embodiment described above.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref> shows the behaviour of the pressure box 70 upon the occurrence of a first, energetic arc 62. The expansion of the air in the enclosure 30 will act upon the flexible input surface 72, causing an inward movement 76 of the flexible input surface 72. The air, diluted air or gas inside the pressure box 70 will transfer this inward movement 76 of the flexible input surface 72 to an outward movement 78 of the flexible output surface 74, thus actuating the driving peg 51 in the upward direction to perforate the insulating plug 43.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Another alternative embodiment is shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 7</figref>. The enclosure 30 comprises an arc detector AD and an active actuator 50. The arc detector AD detects a level of light originating from a first arc 62 in the enclosure 30. The arc detector AD may detect an absolute light level or a variation (increase) in light level. Alternatively, the arc detector AD could detect a level of ionization originating from the first arc 62. The arc detector AD may detect an absolute ionization level or a variation (increase) in ionization level. If the arc detector AD detects an energetic arc, the active actuator 50 will operate to drive the driving peg 51. The driving peg 51 is arranged to, upon being<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> driven, perforate an insulating plug 43, like in the embodiments described above. The active actuator 50 can be of many different nature. The active actuator 50 may be a motor, such as a linear motor, driving the driving peg 51. Alternatively, the active actuator 50 may release a pre-tensioned spring (not drawn) acting on the driving peg 51 upon being released.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">Another embodiment is shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 8a, Fig. 8b</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 9</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 8a</figref> shows a simplified cross-sectional view through an enclosure in a switching installation according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 9</figref> shows a cross-sectional view upon energetic arcing. <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 8b</figref> shows a detail of <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 8a</figref>.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">The embodiment differs from the embodiments shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">Fig. 1-7</figref>, in that the arc initiator 143, 151, 152 is arranged with the driving peg 151 in a horizontal arrangement. A mechanically-fixed reference plate 154 is mounted in between the insulating barrier 10 and the enclosure 30. The actuator comprises a hinged mechanical link 150, a hinge 156 and a connector 158. The hinged mechanical link 150 is connected to the reference plate 154 with the hinge 156 and connected to the enclosure with the connector 158. Upon energetic arcing, a pressure increase will cause an expansion 64 of the section 60 of the enclosure. The expansion 64 of the section 60 of the enclosure acts via the connector 158 on the hinged transfer link 150. The upper part 252 of the hinged mechanical link 150 in between the connector 158 and the hinge 156 will thus move to the left. This movement is transferred via the hinge 156 to a movement to the right of the lower part of the hinged mechanical link 150. This drives a driving peg 151 to the right. The driving peg 151 is guided by a metal plug 152. In this exemplary embodiment, the metal plug 152 is grounded. The driving peg 151 penetrates the insulating plug 143 in the solid cable insulation 42 around the input conductor 33 from the left surface 144 to the right surface 145, thus creating a path for the second, lower-energetic arc 68 from the input conductor 33 to the grounded metal plug 152.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073"><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 10</figref> shows a mechanical link for use in this fourth embodiment, when the embodiment is used in a three-field switching installation of a three-phase design. In this embodiment, the components (input conductor 33, circuit breaker 12, disconnector 14, drive rods 16, 17) inside the insulating barrier 10 and the solid cable insulation 142 of different phases are physically and electrically separated from one another within the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> enclosure 30. Each solid cable insulation comprises a respective insulating plug 143, associated with a corresponding arc initiator. The enclosure 30 is common to all phases and all fields.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">The hinged mechanical link 150 is a single, common element for all three fields and all three phases. The hinged mechanical link 150 connects via connectors 158 to the enclosure 30 for each phase and field, i.e. in this example with nine connectors 158 in total connected to the upper part 252 of the hinged mechanical link 150. The hinged mechanical link 150 further comprises a plurality of fingers 250 on the lower part. The plurality of fingers comprises one finger 250 for each arc initiator, each finger 250 being arranged for driving a corresponding driving peg 151 from a corresponding position 258 on the corresponding finger 250.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">The part 60 of the enclosure that may expand upon the occurrence of an energetic arc will thus affect the hinged mechanical link 150 to transfer the expansion of the part 60 of the enclosure to each of the driving pegs 151 of the arc initiators via the hinges 156 at positions along a hinge axis 256 and the fingers 250. The fingers 250 have a sufficiently large stiffness to transfer the movement of the hinged mechanical link 150 to the driving pegs 151 and to perforate the insulating plugs 143. Moreover, each of the fingers 250 is sufficiently resilient to allow the movement of the hinged mechanical link 150 to complete until also all other fingers have perforated the corresponding insulating plugs, hence until all fields and phases are provided with a respective current path to ground.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">In further embodiments, the insulating plug 43 or 143 is a substantially solid plug made from an insulating material, e.g. rubber.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">An alternative embodiment of the insulating plug is shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 11</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 12</figref>. In this alternative embodiment, the insulating plug 243 comprises a vacuum chamber 246 with a first end cap 244 and a second end cap 245. A driving peg 251 is arranged close to the first end cap 244 and is arranged to be guided by a metal plug 252 for perforating the first end cap 244 when an actuator 250 is activated upon the occurrence of an energetic arc 62 in the enclosure. The vacuum chamber 246 normally contains a vacuum, providing a strong insulation between the input conductor 33 and other conductive parts such as the driving peg 251. When the actuator 250 is activated however, the driving peg 251 perforates the first end cap 244, thus breaking the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> vacuum. In further embodiments, the movement of the driving peg 251 may continue until it is in contact with the second end cap 245 and in still further embodiments, the driving peg 251 may also perforate the second end cap 245.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Once the first end cap 254 is perforated and the vacuum is broken, the vacuum chamber 243 fills with the gas, e.g. the air, from the enclosure. As a result, the good insulation earlier provided by the vacuum is lost, and arcing with a second arc 268 occurs between the input conductor 33 and the driving peg 251. In alternative embodiments, arcing will occur between the input conductor 33 and the actuator 250 and/or the metal plug 252. This second arc 268 then carries away the current from the input conductor 33 to ground and the energetic arc 62 is extinguished. The second arc 264 has a smaller length and is lower-energetic than the energetic arc 62 in the enclosure, thus reducing the risk of harm to the installation and/or to operating personnel near the installation.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">The present invention has been illustrated on the basis of (simplified) embodiments illustrated in the figures.
