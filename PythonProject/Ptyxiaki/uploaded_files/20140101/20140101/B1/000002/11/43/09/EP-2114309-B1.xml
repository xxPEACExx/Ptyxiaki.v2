mxw-id="PDES63957611" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">Scope of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates generally to medical implant devices and, more particularly, to a biocompatible prosthetic device comprising a thin low friction spacer for location to overlie a bone member in an interpositional location between opposed bone joint articular surfaces.</p><heading id="h0002">Background of the Invention</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Mammalian, and notably human joints, are subject to damage notably from trauma and disease. Both repetitive micro-trauma with occurrency more frequently than a capacity for healing and macro-trauma with significant immediate damage which cannot be recoverable by healing can lead to advancing bone damage. Early stage joint trauma and disease which are not healed typically can lead to a spectrum of pathological conditions of minor joint damage, advancing bone damage, degenerative joint disease and osteoarthritis.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Mammalian joints characteristically join a first bone member to a second bone member and include diarthrodial joints particularly those in which load bearing contiguous bone surfaces of each of the first and second bone members are covered with articular cartilage forming a respective margin of each of the first and second bone members. The contiguous bony surfaces of the surfaces which are normally in contact during movement of the joint are to be contrasted with non-contiguous surfaces of the bone members being surfaces which are not normally in contact during movement of the joint. The articular cartilage is provided as an outer layer over the sub-chondral bone, that is, the bone underlying the cartilage on the condyle at the end of the bone member. A condyle is a round projection or rounded articular area which can generally be characterized as a load bearing surface of a bone member.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Articular cartilage is very poorly vascularized and, when damaged by trauma or disease, heals extremely slowly.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Most mammalian joints have, in addition to merely opposing bone members and their cartilage, synovial membranes which may provide synovial fluid proximate or intermediate the bearing surfaces and some joints are also provided with, to be divided completely or incompletely, by an articular disk or meniscus typically provided intermediate opposing articular cartilages.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Joint traumas and disease include damage and disease to the synovial membranes and the articular disk and meniscus if present which lead towards destruction and tearing away of the articular disks or meniscus and subsequent damage to the articular cartilage and subsequent bone to bone contact and damage to the sub-chondral bone.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Presently existing techniques for treating advancing bone damage include firstly biological resurfacing for early stages of the bone damage and, secondly, prosthetic replacement for late stages of bone damage. Biological resurfacing techniques for reconstituting the cartilage includes debridement, abrasion arthroplasty, drilling, microfracture techniques, autologous chondrocyte transplant techniques and stem cell seeded transplants. Biological resurfacing has numerous disadvantages and is often unsuccessful, notably due to the fact that cartilage is not vascularized, heals extremely slowly and due to the fact that loading to which the cartilage is subjected due to normal use of the joints destroys the cartilage. Thus, biological resurfacing techniques have a high failure rate. Dilemmas which face biological resurfacing include the requirement that joints must move to remain functional yet movement destroys the new cartilage and prevents new cartilage formation. Thus, only extensive protracted and functionally limited rehabilitation is available which results in significant health care and social costs.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Prosthetic replacement is a treatment technique in which, for example, the entire articular cartilage and sub-chondral bone is replaced by a synthetic member. Typically in prosthetic replacement, as for example in the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> hip which comprises a ball and socket type joint, the ball on one bone member is completely removed and replaced by the synthetic ball and the interior surface of the socket on the other bone member is completely replaced by a new synthetic socket. Prosthetic replacement suffers significant disadvantages that a patient suffers while its natural joint deteriorates to a sufficient extent that surgery is necessary; the surgery is expensive; and the surgery is biologically destructive and irreversible. Moreover, the new joint is destined to failure after a period of time. Huge health care and social costs are associated with prosthetic replacement.<br/>
Related prior art is, for instance, disclosed in the <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2006133711A"><text>WO 2006/133711</text></patcit>.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">To at least partially overcome these disadvantages of previously known devices, the present invention provides a thin spacing prosthesis with preferably at least one low friction surface, the prosthesis being adapted for location about a bone member in an interpositional location between opposed bone joint articular surfaces preferably about a margin of articular cartilage of a bone member's condyle, preferably without any modification of the articular surface of the condyle.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The invention also provides a biominetic technique and prosthesis for joints with menisci that have been removed such as the temporomandibular joint or knee joint and a meniscus-like biomimetic technique and prosthesis for joints that do not usually have menisci such as, for example, the hip joint.<br/>
The prosthesis according to the invention is defined in claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The prosthesis preferably is a thin sheet-like member to overlie contiguous bony surfaces of a first of the bone member. The joint preferably is a diarthroidial joint in which contiguous bony surfaces on each of the first bone member and the second bone member are covered in articular cartilage forming a respective margin of the first bone member and a respective margin of the second bone member. In a preferred embodiment, a thin sheet-like prosthesis is placed to overlie the margin of the articular cartilage of the first bone member with the sheet member conforming to the shape of the margin of the articular cartilage of the first bone member. The prosthesis is preferably coupled to the first bone member at a non-contiguous surface of the first bone member with the prosthesis disposed in between the margin of the articular cartilage of the first bone member and the margin of the articular cartilage of the second bone member. The contiguous bony surfaces of each of the first and second bone members are surfaces which are normally in contact during movement of the joint. The non-contiguous surface of a bone member is a surface which is not normally in contact during movement of the joint.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The sheet-like prosthesis preferably has an inner surface and an outer surface with the inner surface overlying the margin of the articular cartilage of the first bone member in engagement therewith and substantially corresponding in shape to the margin of the articular cartilage of the first bone member. The prosthesis may be a sheet-like member with uniform thickness and therefore the outer surface of the sheet member will also substantially correspond in shape to the margin of the articular cartilage of the first bone member. On the other hand, the prosthesis may have varying thicknesses.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Preferably, the margin of the articular cartilage of the first bone member forms a convexly rounded articular outer surface of the bone member as, for example, of a condyle of the first bone member. The prosthesis may form a cap-like member over such convexly rounded articular outer surface. The outer surface of the prosthesis is preferably smooth and has a coefficient of friction sufficiently low to facilitate movement relative thereto of the articular cartilage forming the margin of the second bone member in normal<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> movements of the joint and reduce friction without wear by engagement. Preferably, the prosthesis also has an inner surface which is smooth and also has a coefficient of friction sufficiently low to facilitate movement relative thereto of the articular cartilage forming the margin of the first bone member and reduce friction without wear by engagement. The inner surface preferably may resist bonding of the articular cartilage on the margin of the first bone member thereto. Preferably, both the outer surface and the inner surface are smooth.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In a possible method of manufacture, a scan such as a CT scan, is made of the body joint and a model, whether computerized and/or a three-dimensional physical model, is made of portions of the bone member to which the prosthesis is to be engaged. The model may either be a model in conformance with the exact shape of the bone member or may preferably be made to have an exterior surface similar to the margin of the articular cartilage but insofar as the articular cartilage may have depressions or the like, the model may be provided with a smooth surface as to eliminate any recesses in the margin due to pathology. Thus, the model may have an exterior surface similar to the expected margin of the articular cartilage of the first bone member prior to being deformed due to pathology.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In accordance with manufacture of the prosthesis of the present invention, scanning of the bone member about which the prosthesis is to be fitted, may be carried out by conventional technologies. The creation of a model and mechanically forming, for example, a sheet of tantalum about the model is one way of making the prosthesis. However, the manufacture of a model is not necessary and it is possible, for example, to scan the bone member about which the prosthesis is to be fitted and develop a computer generated version of the prosthesis, suitably adapted for example to adjust or avoid irregularities or depressions in the scanned bone and then to directly arrange for manufacture of the prosthesis. For example, where the prosthesis is to be made from metal, this may be accomplished in a variety of known techniques such as, for example, machining, casting, bending, thermoforming<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> and various other specialized metallurgical techniques. Other techniques may involve the use of complex models and moulds which can readily be made from the scan. Insofar as models or moulds are used, additional techniques for forming could include vacuum sputtering and the like. The particular manner of manufacture of the prosthesis is not limited.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The prosthesis may preferably be formed from metal and notably medically acceptable metals which are preferred because of their biocompatibility and of their ability to be selected to be relatively thin yet, to some extent, bear loads under some conditions and, to some extent, have some flexibility. The prosthesis need not be limited to being provided by metals and may, for example, comprise organic biocompatible materials, polymers, and plastic materials such as formed from a sheet or layer of low friction plastic or polymer materials. The material of the prosthesis could be biologic in origin as, for example, in vitro collagen which may be the patient's own cultured cells or biologically engineered product. The materials of the prosthesis may preferably be pliable, but may be rigid The sheet member may comprise a composite of plastic or polymer materials as, for example, with metals or other materials preferably providing a smooth low friction outer surface as, for example, of metal or a coating such as low friction nylon and the like. Preferably, coatings which may have an inherent low friction or lubricity and biocompatibility. The prosthesis preferably when in place between the bone members will not fold up upon itself, bunch up, or crumple up but will remain substantially unfolded, crumple free so as to present smooth surfaces to engage each of the bone members. Preferably, the material forming the prosthesis will inher-ently provide such properties although, of course, in use the manner by which the prosthesis may be maintained in place may also assist in providing such resultant characteristics.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In preferred embodiments, the prosthesis comprises a sheet-like member having a thickness of less than 0.127 cm (0.05 inches), more preferably, less than 0.0254 cm (0.01 inches) or less than 0.0127 cm (0.005 inches), or less than 0.00127 cm (0.0005 inches), at least where it spaces bone members.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In one preferred embodiment, the prosthesis may comprise metal and have a thickness in the range of 0.00127 cm (0.0005) inches to 0.127 cm (0.05 inches) and,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> preferably, in the range of 0.00254 cm (0.001 inches) to 0.0254 cm (0.01 inches) and, more preferably, in the range of 0.00254 cm (0.001 inches) to 0.00762 cm (0.003 inches). Preferred metals are selected from biocompatible metals including, for example, tantalum, zirconium and titanium and alloys thereof.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">One method of forming the prosthesis from sheet metal is to scan portions of the first bone member including the margin of the articular cartilage and non-contiguous surfaces of the first bone member approximate, thereto, then form a three-dimensional model of the scanned portions and, subsequently, form a planar sheet of material about the model substantially in conformance with the shape of the model. Where the prosthesis is to be metal, a thin sheet or foil of the desired metal may be mechanically placed over the model and formed to conform to the shape of the margin of the articular cartilage over the model.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In use, the prosthesis is positioned within the body so that portions of the prosthesis overlie contiguous bony surfaces of the first bone member. The prosthesis is retained positioned on the bone member against displacement from desired positions and preferably against displacement which may lead to removal. Preferably, the prosthesis is retained positioned on the bone member with some relative movement permitted between the prosthesis and the articular surface of the first bone member and it is believed that such relative movement may be advantageous and renders the prosthesis a preferred biomimetic.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">With many configurations of the prosthesis and with particular condyles of the first bone member, the complementary shape alone of the prosthesis and the condyle of the joint may be sufficient to retain the prosthesis on the margin of the articular cartilage of the first bone member in an acceptable relative position. For example, the prosthesis may also be secured to the first bone member by having a shape which sufficiently envelopes the first bone member to resist removal. The prosthesis may be secured to the first bone member by being engaged about a reduced circumference neck of the first bone member leading to larger circumference portions of the bone member.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> -->Accomplishment of such circumferential technique for securing the prosthesis may utilize some mechanism for reducing the circumference of the prosthesis on installation including folding, or an inherent resiliency or a ligature such as a wire or strap for engaging about the reduced circumference neck of the bone. Portions of the prosthesis to engage about a reduced circumference neck may have the ability to expand over the larger circumference portions yet return to a reduced circumference as by being elastic, or resilient or having a shape memory. The prosthesis may be capable of being one piece, folded or gathered upon itself to permit insertion arthoscopically to be uncollapsed and unfolded within the body.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">It is believed to be preferred that the prosthesis may need merely to be stabilized relative to the non-articular surface of the first bone member, that is, located thereon against removal but with some movement permitted between the prosthesis and the articular surface of the first bone member. Thus, the prosthesis is coupled, secured or stabilized relative the first bone member but preferably not fixated, cemented or glued to the first bone member in a manner which prevents at least some minor relative movement. The prosthesis may be fixedly secured, fixated, secured with fasteners, cemented or glued to the first bone member against any relative movement, however, this is generally not considered preferable.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The prosthesis may be characterized as comprising an interpositional sheath portion of a spacer member which spacer member further includes a coupling portion connected to the sheath portion for coupling the spacer member to the first bone member at the non-contiguous surface of the bone member. The coupling portion may extend from the interpositional sheath portion overlying the contiguous surface of the first bone member to overlie the non-contiguous surface of the bone member. The coupling portion may be secured to the non-contiguous surface of the bone member by various methods. A preferred method uses a circumferential technique and has the coupling portion engaged about a reduced circumference neck of the first bone member leading to a larger circumference<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> portion of the first bone member carrying the contiguous surface to be covered by the interpositional sheath portion. That is, the interpositional sheath portion may overlie contiguous surfaces including enlarged circumference bulbous portions of a bone condyle and the coupling portion may encircle a reduced circumference neck of the condyle.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The coupling portion may be secured to the non-contiguous surface of the bone member by mechanical fasteners such as known threaded surgical screws, preferably coupling or fastening the coupling portion to the non-contiguous surface of the bone member to permit relative movement between the coupling portion and the non-contiguous surface of the first bone member at least preferably between the interpositional sheath portion and the contiguous surface of the first bone member.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The prosthesis in its interpositional position preferably permits physiological loading of forces applied across the joint, that is, loading which is appropriate to healthy, normal functioning of the joint. Preferably, the prosthesis is adapted to distribute loading forces which may be applied to the sheet member on one of its surfaces over an increased area on the other opposite of its surfaces. This can be of assistance in distributing loading which might normally be applied to a damaged area of the bone member or its cartilage to areas adjacent of the bone member or its cartilage which are not damaged. This is believed to avoid continued damage to the damaged areas of the bone member as to its cartilage or underlying bone and will assist in protecting existing cartilage or underlying bone; preserving the same without further damage and facilitating healing. Preferably, the prosthesis assists in absorbing at least some of any load and distributing localized forces of any load over wider areas. The prosthesis may have a memory such that it returns to the shape of the model when deformed from such shape. The prosthesis may be a resilient member which has an inherent bias to return to the shape of the model when deformed from such shape and which resists deformation from the shape of the model. Some deformation of the prosthesis, whether resilient or permanent, in adapting to dynamic loading may be desirable, for<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> example, to avoid having a small surface area location or "high spot" where focused, increased loading may arise if there were no deformation.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The interpositional location of the prosthesis is advantageous since it requires no destruction of existing tissue of the bone member, preferably no modification of the bone member whatsoever. A preferred prosthesis in providing protection, particularly to the margin of the articular cartilage of the first bone member over which it is closely received provides a protective function in the sense that it protects and preserves the underlying cartilage or bone, halts the advance of pathology and provides a respite for cellular repair in the normal healing courses of the underlying articular cartilage and/or bone member.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In some instances, damage to the first bone member whether to the articular cartilage or underlying bone may advantageously be at least partially treated to promote healing, or, repaired as for example by providing grafts, that is, transplanted living tissue surgically implanted and the prosthesis provides a protective outer cover.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The prosthesis in accordance with the present invention has the advantage of being non-destructive in the sense that it preserves existing tissue necessary for healing. This is believed to assist in faster rehabilitation after surgically applying the prosthesis and providing the increased potential for return to normal function. Use of a prosthesis in accordance with the present invention retains future options including removal; resurfacing of the joint; and joint replacement. The prosthesis is useful for joints in younger, more active patients as a first preferred option and does not prevent the use in the future of other treatment processes.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The prosthesis may be preferably inserted in a surgical operation with open arthrotomy, that is, cutting an incision into a joint.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The prosthesis in accordance with the present invention preferably is for insertion in a joint and to be left inserted as for the life of the patient. Since it is believed that since the presence of the prosthesis will assist in permitting cellular repair of the underlying cartilage and bone, it is also<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> possible and appropriate to surgically remove the prosthesis after some period of time when the cartilage and/or bone member has sufficiently repaired itself.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The prosthesis of the present invention may be used in a wide variety of mammalian joints as for humans and, as well, for veterinary practice for animals. Preferred joints are diarthrodial joints which permit relatively free movement including ginglymus (hinge-type) joints; condyloid articulation joints; trochoid (pivot) joints; joints with articular reciprocal rotation; enarthrosis (ball-and-socket) joints; and arthrodia (gliding) joints, but not limited to these joints. The prosthesis may be advantageously used in humans in the temporomandiubular joint; ball and socket joints as in the shoulder joints, hip joints; knee joints; ankle joints; carpometacarpal joint of the thumb; wrist joints, carpal joints and most tarsal joints but not limited to use in such joints.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Insofar as the joints may have a synovial membrane, an articular disk or meniscus, the prosthesis of this invention may be utilized whether or not the membrane, articular disk or meniscus is present, intact or removed or altered. The prosthesis may also be used with joints that do not usually have menisci such as the hip joint and can provide, in effect, an artificial meniscus where none was previously.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">One preferred use of a prosthesis of the present invention is in a human temporomandibular joint as a thin cap-like member fitted closely over the mandibular condyle to be located intermediate of the mandibular condyle and the mandibular fossa of the temporomandibular joint.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The prosthesis in accordance with the present invention may be customized as to shape to fit a particular condyle of the bone member upon which it is to be placed. The prosthesis may also be customized so as to provide a desired functionality of the prosthesis for the bone member and joint in question. For example, the prosthesis may be customized as to the extent that it has sufficient strength to withstand forces to which it is subjected without any significant deformation or deflection. For example, in the case of a severely damaged bone member, almost no deflection of a central portion of<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> the prosthesis may be desired. The magnitude of the forces to be transferred through the prosthesis at any joint will vary, for example, with greater forces transferred through a knee joint than a temporomandibular joint and, therefore, different thicknesses of the prosthesis will be required to provide similar rigidity. Where a bone member has minimal damage, a thinner prosthesis may be preferred, possibly with increased resiliency.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Having regard to many factors such as to the nature of the material or materials from which the prosthesis is to be made, the nature of the joint and bone member onto which the prosthesis is to be applied;

Such central portions of increased thickness could, having regard to the material of the prosthesis, increase the extent that any forces are distributed over an enlarged area to reduce localizing forces on smaller areas of the articular cartilage.
