load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><u>Technical Field</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates generally to aircraft fuselage design. More particularly, it relates to aircraft fuselage designs that control the magnitude and direction of pressure disturbances or waves generated by an aircraft flying at supersonic speed so as to reduce sonic boom effects at ground level.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Background of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In flight, an aircraft produces pressure waves or disturbances in the air through which it is flying. These pressure waves propagate at the speed of sound. When the aircraft flies at subsonic speed, these pressure waves propagate in all directions around the aircraft, including ahead of the aircraft. When aircraft fly at supersonic speed, these pressure waves cannot propagate ahead of the aircraft because the aircraft is traveling faster than the propagation speed of the waves. Instead, the pressure waves generated by the aircraft typically coalesce into two shock waves, one associated with the nose of the aircraft and the other associated with the tail of the aircraft. These shock waves pressure differentials that propagate circurmferentially away from the aircraft. With respect to the shock wave associated with the nose (the "bow shock"), the pressure increases abruptly from about ambient to a pressure significantly thereabove. The pressure decreases down from this pressure significantly above ambient down to a pressure below ambient in the region between the bow shock and the shock wave associated with the tail (the "tail shock"). The pressure then increases abruptly from below ambient to about ambient at the tail shock.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">These shock waves can propagate great distances away from the aircraft and eventually those that are directed downwardly will reach the ground where they can produce significant acoustic disturbances called sonic booms. Sonic booms are so named because of the sounds created by the abrupt pressure changes when the shock waves pass a preference point on the ground. The acoustic signature of a sonic boom is commonly characterized as an N-wave because the pressure changes associated with the acoustic signature resemble the letter "N" when plotted as a function of position from the nose of the aircraft. That is, an N-wave is characterised by the abrupt pressure rise associated with the bow shock, commonly referred to as "peak overpressure," followed by a decrease to a pressure below ambient. This is followed by the abrupt rise back toward ambient pressure in association with the tail shock. Where perceivable, typically on the ground by a person, a sonic boom effect is caused by the two rapid-succession, high magnitude pressure changes. Strong sonic booms cause an objectionably loud noise, as well as other undesirable conditions at ground level. For these reasons, supersonic flight over some populated areas is restricted. A schematic representation of the phenomenon of aircraft produced sonic boom is provided in <figref idrefs="f0016">FIG. 20</figref>.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It should be appreciated that shock waves propagate in the form of a "Mach Cone" having a shape defined by a Mach angle (µ). The Mach angle µ is a function of the Mach number <i>M</i>, which is defined as the ratio of the speed of an object over the speed of sound. The Mach angle (µ) can be determined using the equation: <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mi>sin</mi><mfenced><mi mathvariant="normal">μ</mi></mfenced><mo>=</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn><mo>/</mo><mi>M</mi><mo>,</mo></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="23" he="8" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> or <maths id="math0002" num=""><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">μ</mi><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>sin</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mfenced separators=""><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mi>M</mi></mfenced></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="25" he="10" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The shape of the Mach cone produced by an aircraft in supersonic flight can be represented by rotating a line drawn from the aircraft's nose tip toward the tail of the aircraft and oriented at an angle (µ) with respect to the aircraft's direction of travel. Consequently, the tip of the Mach cone points in the direction of travel.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order for supersonic flight over land to be acceptable, the pressure disturbances that cause the sonic boom's acoustic signature must be controlled to avoid strong sonic boom effects caused by the abrupt pressure changes due to the bow and tail shock waves.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It should be appreciated that it is not only the magnitude of the created pressures that are radiated to ground level from an aircraft flying at supersonic speeds that causes persons to experience unpleasant sonic boom effects, but it is primarily the rate(s) of change in the pressures experienced at ground level (pressure differentials - ΔP) that produces the undesirable sonic boom effects. Therefore, one goal for minimizing audible sonic boom effects is to control pressure differentials caused at ground level by a supersonic flying craft.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Another characteristic of the pressure waves or disturbances generated by a supersonic flying aircraft is that the elevated pressures associated essentially with the forward portion of the craft have an effect that coalesces together as they travel toward the ground. As <figref idrefs="f0016">FIG. 20</figref> depicts, the lowered pressures associated essentially with the rearward portion of the craft also have an effect that coalesces together as they travel toward the ground. As described above, it is these two primary pressure changes that cause the sonic boom effects at ground level. Therefore, it can be a solution to the sonic boom problem to smooth the pressure differentials so that there are no abrupt changes. That is to say, the magnitude of the different pressures induced by a supersonic flying aircraft need not necessarily be altered, but it can be enough for some aircraft designs to smooth the abrupt pressure changes experienced at ground level to be more gradual.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Features of the aircraft that cause such abrupt changes in the induced pressures are also detrimental. As explained hereinabove, the pressure disturbances or waves radiate from the aircraft at a relationship based at least in part on the speed of the craft. The angle of radiation can also be affected by the magnitude of the caused disturbance. That is to say, and is best illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0016">FIG. 21</figref>, abrupt projections off of the fuselage of the aircraft (transverse to the direction of travel of the aircraft) will cause larger and higher angle disturbances than smooth transitions. In the case of <figref idrefs="f0016">FIG. 21</figref>, the outwardly projecting jet engines cause pressure waves; one at the top, forward projecting portion of the inlet, and another at the lower lip of the engine's inlet. The pressure disturbances induced by the engine of the aircraft in <figref idrefs="f0016">FIG. 21</figref> coalesce and thereby detrimentally create a combined pressure differential at the ground. Therefore, working toward the goal of minimizing differentials in the pressure profile or signature of a supersonic aircraft, a design challenge has been identified to keep transverse projections (to the direction of travel of the aircraft), and even surface disruption to a minimum. In this context, a surface disruption is considered to be any dimensional change along the length of the aircraft that is transverse to the axis of travel. Since it is pressure waves radiating from the bottom of the plane that most effects ground boom, it is to the extreme lower surfaces of the aircraft that this smoothing goal is most relevant.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As background to the present invention(s), it is known that attempts have been made to modify the design of supersonic aircraft in order to adjust the sonic boom signature. These modifications have included changes to wing design, as described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5934607A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,934,607, issued to Rising, et al.</text></patcit>, for a "Shock Suppression Supersonic Aircraft" Another approach involves incorporating air passages through the fuselage or wings of supersonic aircraft, such as the structures described in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US4114836A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,114,836, issued to Graham, et al.</text></patcit>, for an "Airplane Configuration Design for the Simultaneous Reduction of Drag and Sonic Boom"; <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US3794274A"><text>U.S. Patent No.3, 794,274, issued to Eknes</text></patcit>, for an "Aircraft Structure to Reduce<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Sonic Boom Intensity"; and <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US3776489A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 3,776,489, issued to Wen, et al.</text></patcit>, for a "Sonic Boom Eliminator." Further attempts at reducing the sonic boom caused by supersonic aircraft include the addition to the aircraft of structure arranged to disrupt the air flow patterns as the aircraft travels at supersonic speed. Examples include the structure described in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US3709446A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 3,709,446, issued to Espy</text></patcit>, for a "Sonic Boom Reduction" and <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US3647160A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 3,647,160, issued to Alperin</text></patcit>, for a "Method and Apparatus for Reducing Sonic Booms."</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Another attempt to control the sonic boom in a supersonic aircraft uses a blunt nose to increase the air pressure immediately adjacent to the nose of the aircraft, thus disrupting the normal formation of the pressure wave that causes the acoustic signature. This disruption results in a reduction of the abruptness of the pressure changes that develop after the initial pressure rise in the acoustic wave that strikes the ground. A blunt nose, however, does not reduce the initial overpressure rise in the resulting boom signature. Furthermore, a blunt nose creates a significant amount of drag on the aircraft, drastically decreasing its efficiency,</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US5740984A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,740,984, issued to Morgenstern</text></patcit>, for a "Low Sonic Boom Shock Control/Alleviation Surfaces" describes a mechanical device on the nose of the airplane which can be moved between a first position effecting a blunt nose when sonic boom reduction is desired and a second position effecting a streamlined nose when sonic boom reduction is not required, thereby removing (in the streamlined configuration) the drag penalty inherent in a blunt nose design.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US5358156A"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 5,358,156</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US5676333A"><text>5,676,333</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="US5251846A"><text>5,251,846</text></patcit>, all issued to Rethorst and all entitled "Supersonic Aircraft Shock Wave Energy Recovery System" (collectively "the Rethorst patents"), describe an aircraft with a modified wing design and a forward ring on the fuselage for eliminating the sonic boom of a supersonic aircraft. <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 19</figref> in each of the Rethorst patents shows a side elevation view of an aircraft whose nose coincides with the bottom of its fuselage.

An aircraft according to the present invention includes a spike that extends from the aircraft's nose in a direction substantially parallel to the aircraft's length to effectively lengthen the aircraft. A longer aircraft generally is expected to produce a sonic boom of lesser amplitude at ground level than a shorter aircraft of similar weight because the pressure disturbance is distributed over a greater length. Therefore, a sonic boom created by an aircraft accordingly configured will be of lesser intensity than a sonic boom created by a conventionally designed supersonic aircraft having similar characteristics.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The spike can include several sections of varying cross-sectional area. The foremost, or farthest upstream section of the spike preferably has a cross-sectional area that is characteristically small compared to that of the aircraft's full fuselage or fuselage forebody. Generally, subsequent (farther aft) downstream sections of the spike progressively increase in cross-sectional area. It is, however contemplated, that a particular downstream section can have a smaller cross-sectional area than one or more upstream sections.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Transitions between sections of the spike preferably occur through curved or generally conical transition surfaces. However, other transition region contours are possible, as well. The foremost portion of the spike preferably tapers to a relatively sharp tip at its leading end, as well as through curved, conical, or other shaped transitional regions.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In preferred embodiments, the spike can be retracted into the fuselage when sonic boom mitigation is not needed or desired. For example, it may be desirable to retract the spike into the fuselage when the aircraft is flying at subsonic speeds, or is on the ground (to facilitate taxiing and parking).</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The spike can be a single member, however it preferably includes two or more sections that can be collapsed telescopically to facilitate retraction of the spike into the fuselage. Such a telescoping feature also facilitates adjustment of the spike's overall length and the relative position of the transitions between multiple sections of varying cross-sectional area. For example, in the illustrated and exemplary embodiment, the spike includes a substantially cylindrical center section (which is the foremost section of the spike when the spike is fully or partially extended) surrounded by one or more overlapping, collapsible, annular sections. In other embodiments, the several sections can have other regular or irregular cross-sectional shapes. In such alternate embodiments, the spike can be a single member or it can be configured as two or more collapsible sections in a manner similar to that described above.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">When an aircraft embodying such a spike is flown at supersonic speed, the tip of the spike causes an initial shock wave to be formed. Because at least the foremost portion of the spike's cross-section is characteristically smaller than that of the full fuselage or fuselage forebody, this induced initial shock is of substantially weaker strength than the initial shock that would be generated by an otherwise unadapted fuselage or fuselage forebody of an otherwise similar aircraft not having a spike. Further weak shocks are caused by the cross-sectional area transitions between adjacent telescoping sections (or similar discontinuities in a one-piece spike's contour), as discussed above.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The position and shape of the foregoing transition regions define the strength and position of the weak shock waves created thereby. The position and shape of these transition regions are selected to reduce coalescence of the weak shocks into a strong sonic boom at the ground. The optimum position and shape of these transition regions are functions of several variables<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> and can be expected to vary from aircraft to aircraft, based on the particular aircraft's overall configuration. For example, the optimum position and shape of the transition regions may depend on the aircraft overall length, weight, fineness ratio, wing placement, engine placement, empennage design and the like. In some embodiments of this aspect of the present invention, the position of such transition regions relative to each other and/or the aircraft's fuselage can be adjusted on demand by incrementally extending or retracting particular sections of the spike.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">A spike according to the present invention can be used in connection with conventional fuselage designs. It also can be used in connection with other fuselage designs, for example, but without limitation, a fuselage configuration in which the nose of the fuselage lies on a line substantially defining the bottom of the fuselage; a characteristic that also described herein as an aspect or characteristic of a supersonic aircraft configured in conformance with the teachings of the present invention(s). As described herein, when an aircraft embodying this shaped fuselage design flies at supersonic speed, it creates an asymmetrical pressure distribution. The shock waves created by such an aircraft during normal supersonic flight propagate toward the ground with lesser intensity than in other directions. Detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations and propagation analyses have shown that such an aircraft can be expected to produce a characteristically weaker acoustic signature at the ground than conventional aircraft. Thus, the foregoing fuselage shaping technique provides an important ingredient for shaping the sonic boom signature to permit supersonic flight over land. In alternate embodiments, at least the forward portion of the spike itself can be shaped in a manner similar to the novel fuselage discussed above. A spike embodying such a configuration causes the portions of the shock waves that propagate toward the ground to be of lesser intensity than the corresponding portions of the shock waves produced by an axisymmetric spike.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Similar benefits can be realized from the placement of a spike as described above at the rear of a supersonic aircraft.

As an aspect of the present invention, multiple, or as otherwise referred to, a plurality of different-magnitude pressure disturbances 168 are generated below the aircraft 120 and which then radiate therebelow. Conceptually, these pressure disturbances are illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0009">Figs. 10 and 11</figref>. These aspects are graphically shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Figs. 12A, 12B</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0014 f0015">16-19</figref> by dashed lines, and comparison is made in certain of these drawings to conventional characteristics of traditionally configured supersonic aircraft which are represented by solid line traces. These generated disturbances below the craft 120 are of lesser magnitude than a plurality of pressure disturbances 170 simultaneously generated above the aircraft 120 and radiating thereabove. An important feature of this embodiment of the invention is that the structural design of the craft 120 enables this plurality of different-magnitude pressure disturbances 168 generated below the aircraft to be controlled so that differentials thereamong (across the several pressure disturbances) are sufficiently minimized that ground level sonic boom effects are minimized during supersonic flight.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Throughout the description of the invention, certain aspects are characterized with the qualifier "substantially." For interpretation purposes, this terminology should be taken to denote the fact that moderate variations may be made from the so described configuration,<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> orientation or relationship, but within limits that continue the prescribed effects associated with the so described aspect.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">An aspect of the above-described embodiment of the invention is that during supersonic flight, the aircraft 120 is preferably oriented so that its lower substantially linear profile is leveled to be substantially parallel with the direction of travel and onset airflow 166. This orientation is illustrated in at least <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 14</figref>, and can be compared to more traditional flying configurations such as that shown in <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 22</figref> where a wing reference plane is shown flying with an inclined angle of attack. It should be appreciated that such an inclined angle of attack tends to accentuate downwardly directed pressure disturbances, as opposed to minimizing them as is the case in the more horizontal flying orientation of the present invention. Regarding illustrations in the associated drawings in which supersonic aircraft are shown relative to the ground, it should be appreciated that these FIGS. are not to scale, especially with respect to the perception of the elevations at which the aircraft are flying.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Another aspect of the invention is that the aircraft 120 is configured so that during supersonic flightcoalescence of the different-magnitude pressure disturbances 168 is at least inhibited below the aircraft 120. This can be compared to traditional effects such as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0016">FIG. 20</figref> where bow shocks are shown to coalesce into a strong overpressure and the tail shocks are shown to coalesce into a drastic return toward ambient pressure. These coalescing effects contribute to the formation of traditional "N-wave" sonic boom signatures experienced at ground level below conventionally designed and flown supersonic aircraft.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In a particularly preferred aspect of the invention, and as illustrated in at least <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 14</figref>, the lower profile 160 of the aircraft 120 is configured so that none of the stronger pressure disturbances generated below the aircraft and behind the disturbance caused by the forward nose 163 of the craft 120 propagate at angles sufficient to result in their coalescence prior to<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> reaching ground level. This is schematically represented by the pressure lines stemming from features of the aircraft 120 behind the nose tip 163 in <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 14</figref>.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In the present context, the terminology of stronger pressure disturbances is used to identify those pressure disturbances of sufficient magnitude to have a potential for coalescing with disturbances in front or behind thereof, and thereby combining into a single, stronger disturbance instead of the previously distinct, weaker ones.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">A preferred embodiment of the present invention also shapes the nose portion 162 of the aircraft 120 so that vertical cross-sections oriented perpendicular to a long axis of the aircraft are substantially round-shaped. Schematically, this is shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 9B</figref> where a lower extremity of each circle 122 is coincident with the lower profile 160 (124) of the fuselage 121.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">It is also contemplated that these vertical cross-sections can be substantially elliptical-shaped, with long axis being either substantially vertical or substantially horizontal.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">In another aspect of the presently disclosed invention(s), the jet propulsion units 134 mounted upon the aircraft 120 are configured so that resulting pressure disturbances 168 created thereby and below the aircraft 120 are of lesser magnitude than any pressure disturbance caused by the apex 163 of the nose portion 162 below the aircraft 120. Still further, all inlets 135 of side-mounted jet propulsion units are positioned at above-wing locations thereby assuring that downwardly directed pressure disturbances 168 generated by the inlets 135 are substantially blocked from direct propagation below the substantially linear lower profile 160 of the aircraft 120.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">A primary method of the presently disclosed invention for controlling the plurality of different-magnitude pressure disturbances 168 generated below the aircraft 120 is by selective arrangement of discontinuities 165 in a lower exterior surface of the aircraft and thereby assuring that ground level sonic boom effects are minimized during supersonic flight.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> Discontinuities should be understood to be established by slope changes across features of the aircraft 120 that establish the profile thereof.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 15</figref>, an alternative embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in which the lower profile 160 of the aircraft 120 is uniquely mildly downwardly concave. As in <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 14</figref>, none of the stronger pressure disturbances generated below the aircraft and behind the disturbance caused by the forward nose 163 of the craft 120 propagate at angles sufficient to result in their coalescence prior to reaching ground level.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Another way of characterizing the present invention is that after configuring an apex 163 of a nose portion 162 of the aircraft 120 to be coincident with a lower profile 160 of the aircraft 120, the aircraft 120 is flown at supersonic speed and a majority of the generated different-magnitude pressure disturbances 168 are diverted above the aircraft 120 thereby establishing an asymmetrical distribution of the different-magnitude pressure disturbances 168, 170 thereabout. In conjunction therewith, a minority of the plurality of different-magnitude pressure disturbances 168 that are diverted below the aircraft 120 are controlled so that ground level sonic boom effects are minimized during supersonic flight.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In another aspect, the invention takes the form of a method for minimizing sonic boom effects caused at ground level by a supersonic aircraft. The method includes manipulating at least one sonic boom contributing characteristic of a supersonic aircraft to assure that a plurality of groundwardly radiating pressure disturbances do not coalesce, one with another, to form an objectionable sonic boom during supersonic flight by the aircraft.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">A related characterization of the invention entails manipulating at least one sonic boom contributing design characteristic of a supersonic aircraft to prevent coalescence of groundwardly radiating pressure disturbances, generated during supersonic flight, and thereby establishing a shaped sonic boom signature 180 of the aircraft, at ground level, that is humanly perceptible, but non-objectionable to a perceiving person located on the ground. An<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> example of such a design characteristic is found in the aspect described herein regarding the configuration of a lower profile of the supersonic aircraft so that an apex of a nose portion of the aircraft is coincident with a lower profile of the aircraft. This embodiment of the method further includes flying the aircraft at supersonic speed and diverting a majority of a plurality of generated different-magnitude pressure disturbances above the aircraft thereby establishing an asymmetrical distribution of the different-magnitude pressure disturbances about the aircraft such that the objectionable ground level sonic boom effects are minimized.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">In this regard, <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 23</figref> shows a comparison between a conventionally designed supersonic aircraft 20 at the left, including its N-sbaped sonic boom signature 50 which is unacceptable to persons located at ground level. On the right, an aircraft 120 configured according to the exemplary embodiment described immediately above, and which produces a non-offending shaped sonic boom signature 180 at ground level, is illustrated.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">It should be appreciated that presently regulations generally prevent civil supersonic flight over land. Studies conducted with human participants, however, show that sonic boom effects, at ground level, in and of themselves are not always found to be objectionable by a human receiver. Sonic boom effects are only bothersome to humans located on the ground when they are sufficiently loud and abrupt (strong ΔP and short rise time to peak overpressures) to be objectionable. A parallel may be drawn to noise level regulations instituted with respect to airports. That is to say, take-off noise levels are limited, not precluded by such regulations. Therefore, it is in this vein that the terminology used in characterizing the present invention is found; namely, that a shaped sonic boom signature 180 is established, via manipulation of characteristic(s) of a supersonic aircraft that influence sonic boom effects imposed at ground level, but with the qualifier that they be humanly perceptible and non-objectionable to a perceiving person located on the ground. Studies that quantify such sonic boom effects that are, and are not objectionable to people are known to<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> those persons skilled in these arts, and therefore may be readily applied, from a definitional standpoint, to such recitations found herein.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">In a second aspect, a supersonic aircraft can be configured to include a spike extending from the front thereof. For example, <figref idrefs="f0018">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates a supersonic aircraft 220 having a spike 223 extending forward from fuselage 221, generally in the direction of normal flight. Fuselage 221 can be otherwise conventional, similar to fuselage 21 described above, or it can be specially shaped, similar to fuselage 121 also described hereinabove. Alternatively, fuselage 221 can have other configurations.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Spike 223 preferably can be at least partially retracted into the fuselage of the aircraft on demand. For example, it may be desirable to retract spike 223 into fuselage 221 when the aircraft 220 is flown at subsonic speeds, flown at supersonic speed over areas where sonic booms are deemed acceptable (such as over an ocean), and/or on the ground (to facilitate taxiing and parking).</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">In a preferred embodiment, spike 223 has a forward section 223A and a rearward section 223B. With reference to <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 25</figref>, forward section 223A has a generally smaller nominal cross-sectional area than does rearward section 223B, which, in turn, has a generally smaller nominal cross-sectional area than does fuselage 221. Forward section 223A tapers toward (i.e., to, or substantially to) a point 223C through transition region 223D. In alternate embodiments, forward section 223A can taper toward other shapes. For example, but without limitation, forward section 223A can taper toward an edge, such as a knife-edge, which can be oriented vertically, horizontally, or in any other desirable manner.<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --></p><p id="p0071" num="0071">The transition from forward section 223A to rearward section 223B is through transition region 223E. Transition region 223D is shown as substantially conical and transition region 223E is shown as substantially frusto-conical. These transition regions, however, can have curved or other contours as well. In other configurations of this aspect of the invention, spike 223 can have one or more additional sections between rearward section 223B and fuselage 221. An additional transition region, as discussed above, would be associated with each such additional section. Generally, the nominal cross-sectional area of any such additional section would be greater than the nominal cross-sectional area of a section forward thereof, and smaller than that of a section rearward thereof. However, it is possible that such an intermediate section could have a nominal cross-sectional area smaller than that of a section forward thereof and/or larger than that of a section rearward thereof. Generally, the nominal cross-sectional area of any section of spike 223 is substantially smaller than the nominal cross sectional area of fuselage 221. Although the nominal cross-sectional area of each section of spike 223 is shown to be substantially uniform over the length thereof, the cross-sectional area of each section can vary over the length thereof.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072"><figref idrefs="f0018">FIGS. 24</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0019">25</figref> illustrate spike 223 as having substantially cylindrical cross-sections. In other embodiments, it is contemplated that spike 223 can have other regularly or irregularly shaped cross-sections.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">Spike 223 can be embodied as a single member. However, it is preferred that sections 223A and 223B (as well as any additional sections, as discussed above) be separate elements which are collapsible in a telescoping manner. <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 25</figref> shows a preferred embodiment of a telescopically collapsible spike 223 in an extended position A, a retracted position D, and two intermediate positions B and C.<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --></p><p id="p0074" num="0074">In alternative embodiments, the spike 223 could be of a single, tapered section. Alternatively, spike 223 can have several sections, one or more of which are tapered continuously over the length thereof. The several sections can be collapsible, or embodied as a single member.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">When an aircraft 220 that includes a spike 223 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0018">FIGS. 24</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0019">25</figref> is flown at supersonic speed, the tip of the spike causes an initial shock wave to be formed. Because the spike's cross-section (taken in a generally perpendicular orientation to a long axis of the aircraft 220), is substantially smaller than that of the aircraft's full fuselage or fuselage forebody, this initial shock is substantially weaker than the initial shock that would be created by the full fuselage or fuselage forebody of an otherwise similar aircraft not having a spike. The initial shock on the spike is also well in front of the shock caused by the fuselage forebody and therefore the spike is both weakening the initial shocks and also lengthening the sonic boom signature that is propagated to the ground. A further weak shock is caused by each further transition region (such as transition region 223E) between adjacent sections (such as sections 223A and 223B) of spike 223. As the number of sections of spike 223 increases, the number of transition regions increases, and the number of weak shocks created thereby increases.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">The position and shape of the transition regions define the strength and position of the weak shocks created thereby. The position and shape of these transition regions are selected to reduce coalescence of the weak shocks into a strong shock and thus reduce the intensity of a sonic boom at ground level resulting from these shocks. As discussed above, the optimum position and shape of these transition regions are functions of several variables and can be expected to vary from aircraft to aircraft, based on the particular aircraft's overall configuration. For example, the optimum position and shape of the transition regions may depend on the aircraft's overall length, weight, fineness ratio, wing placement, engine<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> placement, empennage design, altitude, Mach number (speed) and related characteristics. In some embodiments of this aspect of the present invention, the position of such transition regions relative to each other and/or the aircraft's fuselage can be adjusted on demand by incrementally extending or retracting particular sections of the spike. For example, referring to <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 25</figref>, it may be desirable under certain circumstances to operate the aircraft with spike 223 in position B, position C, or another intermediate position.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077"><figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 26</figref> illustrates graphically the effect of spike 223 on the shock created by an aircraft equipped therewith during supersonic flight. <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 26</figref> provides a plot 230 of the pressure rise associated with the bow shock created by an aircraft flying at supersonic speed that has been adapted to project a shaped signature to the ground as described herein, superimposed on a plot 240 of the pressure rise associated with the bow shock created by a similar aircraft having a spike 223 in an extended position and flying at supersonic speed. <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 26</figref> shows that an aircraft 220 having such a spike 223 and flown at supersonic speed produces a substantially lower initial pressure rise 242 than the initial pressure rise 232 created by a conventional aircraft of similar size under similar flight conditions. Further, the peak pressure rise resulting from supersonic flight of aircraft 220 having spike 223 is reached through a series of relatively small step increases in pressure 242, 244, 246, 248, whereas the peak pressure rise resulting from supersonic flight of conventional aircraft 220 is reached through a series of fewer, but larger, step increases in pressure 232,234,236 (not necessarily shown to exact scale in <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 26</figref>).
