Moreover, in accordance with a simple arrangement with few components, in which only the shapes of the pressure-receiving portion provided on the rotor and the pressing portion provided on the operating knob are designed, it is possible to prevent a large load from acting on tumblers even when a pushing-in operation of the operating knob is carried out when the rotor of the cylinder lock is at the locked position.</p><heading id="h0007">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1] FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view showing part of a scooter type motorcycle (first embodiment).</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2] FIG. 2</figref> is a front view of a cylinder lock and an operating knob (first embodiment).</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3] FIG. 3</figref> is a view from arrow 3 in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> (first embodiment).</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4] FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view along line 4-4 in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> (first embodiment).</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5] FIG. 5</figref> is an exploded perspective view of the cylinder lock, the operating knob, and a lid lock mechanism (first embodiment).</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6] FIG. 6</figref> is a sectional view along line 6-6 in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> in a state in which a rotor is at a locked position (first embodiment).</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7] FIG. 7</figref> is a sectional view, corresponding to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, in a state in which the rotor is at an unlocked position (first embodiment).<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8] FIG. 8</figref> is a sectional view, corresponding to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, in a state in which the rotor is at an open position (first embodiment).</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9] FIG. 9</figref> is a sectional view along line 9-9 in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> in a state in which the rotor is at the locked position (first embodiment).</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10] FIG. 10</figref> is a sectional view, corresponding to <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>, in a state in which the rotor is at the unlocked position (first embodiment).</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11] FIG. 11</figref> is a sectional view, corresponding to <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>, in a state in which the rotor is pivoted to the open position due to the operating knob being pushed in (first embodiment).</li></ul></p><heading id="h0008">EXPLANATION OF REFERENCE NUMERALS AND SYMBOLS</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009"><ul><li>17 Leg shield, which is a box-forming member</li><li>18 Lid</li><li>20 Cylinder lock</li><li>21 Operating knob</li><li>22 Lid lock mechanism</li><li>27 Body</li><li>28 Rotor</li><li>60 Pressure-receiving portion</li><li>62, 63 Pressing portion</li><li>P1 Locked position</li><li>P2 Unlocked position</li><li>P3 Open position</li></ul></p><heading id="h0009">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">A mode for carrying out the present invention is explained below by reference to one embodiment of the present invention shown in the attached drawings.</p><heading id="h0010">EMBODIMENT 1</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007 f0008 f0009 f0010 f0011">FIG. 1 to FIG. 11</figref> show one embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The fore-and-aft and left-and-right directions in the embodiment are with<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> respect to the traveling direction of a motorcycle.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">First, in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a body cover 15 of, for example, a scooter type motorcycle includes a leg shield 17 as a box-forming member rising from the front end of a step floor 16, and a box portion 17a projecting rearward is formed integrally with the leg shield 17. A lower end part of a lid 18 for closing a rear end opening of the box portion 17a so that it can be opened and closed is supported on the box portion 17a so that it can pivot in the fore-and-aft direction, and a recess 19 is provided in an upper middle part of the lid 18 so as to open on the upper edge side of the lid 18. Disposed in the recess 19 are a cylinder lock 20 and an operating knob 21, the operating knob 21 releasing a closed locked state of the lid 18 by being pushed in when the cylinder lock 20 is subjected to an unlocking operation.
