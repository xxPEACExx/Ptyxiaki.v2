mxw-id="PDES63957609" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention is directed to hermetically sealed packages that are suitable to protect thin film devices, particularly those sensitive to the ambient environment. Some examples of such devices are organic emitting light diode (OLED) displays, sensors, and other optical devices. The present invention will be discussed in the context of OLED displays.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">OLEDs have been the subject of a considerable amount of research in recent years because of their use and potential use in a wide variety of electroluminescent devices. For instance, a single OLED can be used in a discrete light emitting device or an array of OLEDs can be used in lighting applications or flat-panel display applications (e.g., OLED displays). Traditional OLED displays are known to be very bright, to have a good<sup>-</sup> color contrast, to produce true color, and to exhibit a wide viewing angle. However, traditional OLED displays, and in particular the electrodes and organic layers located therein, are susceptible to degradation resulting from interaction with oxygen and moisture leaking into the OLED display from the ambient environment. It is well known that the life of the OLED display can be significantly increased if the electrodes and organic layers within the OLED display are hermetically sealed from the ambient environment.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Unfortunately, it has been very difficult to develop a sealing process to hermetically seal the OLED display. Some of the factors that make it difficult to properly seal the OLED display include:
<ol><li>(i) that the hermetic seal should provide a barrier for oxygen (10<sup>-3</sup> cc/m<sup>2</sup>/day) and water (10<sup>-6</sup> g<sub>/</sub>m<sup>2</sup>/day);</li><li>(ii) that the size of the hermetic seal should be minimal (e.g., &lt;2 mm) so it does not have an adverse effect on size of the OLED display;</li><li>(iii) that the temperature generated during the sealing process should not damage the materials (e.g., electrodes and organic layers) within the OLED display (e.g., the first pixels of OLED which are located about 1- 2 mm from the seal in the OLED display should not be heated to more than 100°C during the sealing process);</li><li>(iv) that the gases released during sealing process should not contaminate the materials within the OLED display; and</li><li>(v) that the hermetic seal should enable electrical connections (e.g., thin-film chromium) to enter the OLED display.</li></ol></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Of the above challenges, one of the most difficult is the hermetic stealing due to the strong reactivity of organic molecules with oxygen and moisture.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Among the conventional techniques for sealing the OLED display is to use different types of epoxies, inorganic materials and/or organic materials that form the seal after they are cured by ultra-violet light. Vitex Systems manufactures and sells a coating under the brand name of Batrix<sup>™</sup>, which is a composite based approach where alternate layers of inorganic materials and organic materials can be used to seal the OLED display. Although these types of seals usually provide good mechanical strength, they can be very<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> expensive and there are many instances in which they have failed to prevent the diffusion of oxygen and moisture into the OLED display. Another conventional technique for sealing the OLED display is to utilize metal welding or soldering; however, the resulting seal is not durable in a wide range of temperatures because of substantial differences between the coefficients of thermal expansions (CTEs) of the glass plates and metal in the OLED display.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Another technique for sealing a glass package (such as an OLED display) is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6998776B"><text>U.S. 6,998,776</text></patcit>, assigned to Corning Incorporated. The technique involves a laser frit sealing technology, which compared to the conventional epoxy sealing method, demonstrates many advantages, such as much higher hermeticity, a high display density with a fixed size of substrate, and application to top emission devices. However, the use of a high power laser to melt the frit materials may lead to one or more ,disadvantageous results. Indeed, it is possible that the thermal cycle caused by the heating process can cause thermal damage in OLED devices.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the laser frit sealing technique, the frit is bonded to various device materials such as cathode metal-leads, indium tin oxide (ITO) and other protective materials. Each material on the device side has different thermal properties (e.g., CTE, heat capacity and thermal conductivity). The various thermal properties on the device side can cause a significant variation of the bonding strength between the frit and the device boundary after completing the laser sealing process. In addition, the cathode metal-leads can be delaminated after laser frit sealing. Since the cathode usually consists of multiple layers of two or three different<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> metal elements, each with potentially different CTEs, the relatively fast process of heating and cooling employed in laser frit sealing can occasionally cause damage on the metal cathodes, such as "winkle" effects. The high thermal conductivity of metal leads is also a possible origin of lowering the bonding strength. This is due to the relatively fast heat dissipation during the process of heating the frit with a high power laser.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Accordingly, there are needs in the art to address the aforementioned problems and other shortcomings associated with known techniques of sealing glass packages, such as OLED displays.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20050248270A"><text>US 2005/0248270</text></patcit> describes an OLED package sealed with a frit.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INTENTION</b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">In accordance with the invention, sealed package, including: a first plate including inside and outside surfaces; a second plate including inside and outside surfaces; frit material disposed on the inside surface of the second plate; and at least one dielectric layer disposed directly or indirectly on at least one of: (i) the inside surface of the first plate at least opposite to the frit material, and (ii) the inside surface of the second plate at least directly or indirectly on the frit material..

The first and second substrate plates 102, 104 may be transparent glass plates, such as those manufactured and sold by Corning Incorporated under the brand names of Code 1737 glass or Eagle 2.000<sup>™</sup> glass, or other companies, such as Asahi Glass Co. (e.g., OA10 glass and OA21 glass), Nippon Electric Glass Co., NHTechno and Samsung Corning Precision Glass Co.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The first and second substrate plates 102, 104 include respective inside and outside surfaces 102A, 102B. At least one device 103 (e.g., electronic devices, such as an array of OLEDs) that is to be hermetically sealed between the plates 102, 104 is disposed on the inside surface 102A of the first substrate plate 102 (action 204, <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>). A typical OLED 103 includes an anode electrode (or lead) 110A, one or more organic layers, and a cathode electrode (or lead) 110B; however, it should be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that any known OLED 103 or hereinafter developed OLED may be used in the glass package 100.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">A frit material 106 is disposed on the inside surface 104A of the second substrate plate 104 (action 206, <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>). The frit 106 may advantageously be deposited along edges of the second substrate plate 104, e.g., approximately 1 mm away from free edges of the plate 104. The frit material may be dispensed at a width of about 0.3 - 3 mm (0.7 - 1.0 mm being preferred), and height of about 10-20 µm, 14 - 16 µm being preferred. In one or more embodiments, the frit 106 may be a low temperature glass frit that contains one or more absorbing ions chosen from the group including iron, copper, vanadium, and neodymium. The ions are selected to absorb energy (e.g., light energy or other radiation) at specific wavelengths (or ranges thereof) such that use of an energy source at such wavelength may be used to heat the frit 106. The frit 106 may also be doped with filler (e.g., inversion filler, additive filler, etc.) which lowers the coefficient of thermal expansion of the frit 106 so that it matches or substantially matches the coefficient(s) of thermal expansion of the two substrate plates 102 and 104. The compositions of several exemplary frit materials 106 may be found in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6998776B"><text>U.S. 6,998,776</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Optionally, the frit 106 may be pre-sintered to the second substrate plate 104. To accomplish this, the frit 106 is deposited onto the second substrate plate 104 (action 206) and then heated so that it adheres to the second substrate plate 104. A more detailed discussion regarding the optional step of pre-sintering may be found in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6998776B"><text>U.S. 6,998,776</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Next, a dielectric layer 108 is disposed directly or indirectly on the inside surface 102A of the first substrate plate 102 at least opposite to the frit material 106 (action<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> 208, <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>). The dielectric layer 108 acts as a passivation layer, which protects the components of the package 100, e.g., the OLED devices, from mechanical and chemical abuse and potential damage. As illustrated, the dielectric layer 108 is disposed on the leads 110. With reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>, the dielectric layer 108 may include a single layer of material, such as silicon nitride (example not forming part of the invention), or according to the invention is a multi-layer structure, such as a layer of silicon oxide 108B over an initial layer 108A (e.g., the silicon nitride).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The dielectric layer 108 may be deposited in any number of ways. For example, the dielectric layer 108 may be deposited only on the sealing boundary, opposite to the frit material 106 (as is depicted), such that the dielectric layer 108 does not cover the one or more devices 103. Alternatively, the dielectric layer 108 may be deposited also within the frit boundary such that the dielectric layer 108 at least partially covers the one or more devices 103. In the case of an OLED device 103, additional advantages may be obtained when the dielectric layer 108 at least partially covers at least one of the anode and cathode electrodes 110, as is illustrated.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The dielectric layer 108 layer may be deposited by any thin film deposition technique, such as sputtering, physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), or plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The thickness of the dielectric layer 108 layer may be between about 10 to 600 nm. In one or more embodiments, it has been found that a thickness of about 10 to 50 nm may lead to better sealing. In accordance with other embodiments, the thickness of the dielectric layer 108 may be between about 100 to 500 nm. For example, when the dielectric layer 108 is a multi-layer structure, the layer of silicon oxide 108B may have a thickness<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> of about 10 - 100 nm, and the layer of silicon nitride 108A may have a thickness of about 200 - 500 nm, where 400 nm is preferred. The coating uniformity of dielectric layer 108 can provide some compensation for height fluctuations in the frit material 106 which may improve hermetic sealing.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The compressive strength of the dielectric layer 108 may be a significant characteristic of the package 100, particularly when the dielectric layer 108 is formed of ceramic materials (such as the aforementioned SiNx/SiO). By way of example, the dielectric layer may exhibit a compressive stress of about 0.01 - 700 MPa, about 200 - 500 MPa, or preferably about 400 - 500 MPa. The material(s) used to form the dielectric layer 108, such as ceramic, may absorb large compressive stresses, but not necessarily tensile stresses. Thus, if there are any tensile stresses when the substrate plates 102, 104 heat (during the sealing process), which may result from a higher CTE of the substrate plates 102, 104 as compared with the frit 106 and/or the dielectric layer 108) the inherent compressive stress of the dielectric layer 108 will provide compensation by neutralizing the adverse effects of tensile stresses generated by expansion of the glass frit 106 and/or substrate plates 102, 104.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">While the above discussion of the deposition of a multi-layer the dielectric layer 108 (e.g., silicon nitride plus silicon oxide) implies discrete layers 108A, 108B, the present invention contemplates a gradient (gradual transition) in the interface of silicon nitride to silicon oxide. The gradient may be rapid or gradual, depending on the exigencies of the situation. The gradient may be achieved, for example, by changing the coating atmosphere gradually during deposition from NH<sub>3</sub> (nitrogen source) to O<sub>2</sub>.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">At action 210, the first and second substrate plates 102, 104 are brought together via the frit-to-dielectric interface. At action 212, the frit 106 is heated by an irradiation source (e.g., a laser, infrared lamp, etc.) such that the frit 106 forms a hermetic seal. The seal connects and bonds the first substrate plate 102 to the second substrate plate 104. The hermetic seal protects the OLEDs 103 (and/or other devices) by preventing oxygen and moisture in the ambient environment from entering into the package 100.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Due to the dielectric layer 108, the heat from the melting frit 106 transmits to a lesser degree to the device(s) 103, such as the metal electrodes 110. Thus, heat damage is expected to decrease significantly.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The dielectric layer 108 layer should have a very high melting point because it should exhibit thermal stability during the frit sealing process. As discussed above, the dielectric layer 108 layer may be formed from silicon nitride (SiNx) in the form of very thin film, where x may be about 0.1 to 3. The properties of silicon nitride include low density, high temperature strength, superior thermal shock resistance, excellent wear resistance, good fracture toughness, high mechanical fatigue and creep resistance, excellent oxidation and corrosion resistance, and high thermal conductivity compared to the glass (particularly, Eagle 2000™) on which the OLED devices 103 are disposed. The high thermal conductivity of the dielectric layer 108 (e.g., ceramic) compared to the frit 106 and substrate plates 102, 104 (e.g., glass) helps in the sealing process, because heat developed in the frit 106 does not concentrate in localized areas; rather, the heat dissipates via the higher conductivity in other areas. Concentrated heat (without good dissipation), which occurs in<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> materials of low thermal conductivity, may result in melted or otherwise damaged leads 110 and/or other critical components. Another advantage of using silicon nitride as the dielectric layer 108 is the resultant compensation in the differences in the CTEs of the frit 106 and the substrate plates 102, 104. The CTE of SiNx falls in the range of about 3 to 4 x 10 <sup>-6</sup>/°C. This buffers the significant differences of the CTEs of the frit 106 and the substrate plates 102, 104, such as glass, and avoids cracking and/or delamination of the seal.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">It is noted that CTE mismatches between the substrate plates 102, 104 and the other components, such as the frit material and the dielectric 108. Such considerations are complicated by use of specific materials for the substrate plates 102, 104, such as metals, alloys, glass, ceramics, quartz, and/or polymers.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The layer of dielectric material on the device side can provide very uniform thermal properties as a counter to the frit materials during the laser sealing process. The dielectric layer may prevent corrosion of the electrical lead materials on the OLED device prior to sealing. Since the counter-part frit material is a single material (the dielectric), material compatibility between the frit and the dielectric layer can be improved and potentially optimized. With the dielectric material on the OLED device side, the laser sealing process complexity (due to variations in customer materials) can be greatly reduced. The thin dielectric layer protects electrical leads from thermal damage during the laser sealing process.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The thin dielectric layer also exhibits another advantage when it does not absorb light (e.g., laser light or other irradiation) at the wavelength used for sealing the glass<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> package by heating the frit material. In this way, the dielectric material does not interfere with melting the frit material as it does not lower the efficient transfer of laser energy to the frit material. By way of example, some frit material may be heated using laser light at a wavelength of about 810 nm. Thus, advantages are obtained when the dielectric material does not absorb light energy at 810 nm.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">As the thin layer provides a buffer between the frit material and the device, some frit thickness fluctuation can be compensated for. Deposition of low dielectric materials is easily implemented at the end of OLED manufacturing processes because an additional thin film deposition system is not require.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> (example not being part of the invention), which a side view illustrating alternative features of a glass package 100A, which again may be a hermetically sealed OLED display. As common numerals indicate like elements in comparison with <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, a recitation of already discussed elements will not be repeated. The package 100A may include a dielectric layer 108A directly and/or indirectly disposed on the internal surface of the second substrate plate 104. The dielectric layer 108A may be deposited only on the sealing boundary, covering the frit material 106 and directly only a portion (or none) of the second substrate plate. Alternatively, the dielectric layer 108A may be deposited (as is depicted) on the frit material 106 and also directly (or indirectly) on the inside surface of the second substrate plate 104.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The above features result in further design alternatives. Specifically, the dielectric layers 108 and 108A may be used in combination, or either layer 108, 108A may be used alone.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><heading id="h0005"><b>EXPERIMENTS</b></heading><p id="p0040" num="0040">A number of structures were prepared using the techniques described above. For example, one such structure included a 400 nm SiN<sub>x</sub> dielectric layer over an OLED array, with an overcoat of 10 nm SiO<sub>x</sub>. The dielectric layer was deposited such that it exhibited 493 MPa of compressive residual stress after annealing at 400°C. The dielectric layer (SiNx + SiOx) was coated on half of the backplane architecture of an OLED. array, including all electrical leads. Thereafter, the structure was placed an 85/85 humidity chamber. After about 73 hours of exposure, an examination of the structure revealed a combined advantage: (i) the dielectric prevented corrosion of the backplane architecture and did not absorb light energy intended for heating the frit material. Specifically, the region which did not have the dielectric layer corroded extensively whereas the other half coated with the dielectric remained intact and did not show any sign of corrosion. Monitoring of the delivery of laser energy at 810 nm to the frit material revealed that there was very little absorption in the dielectric layer.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980316" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Organische Licht emittierende Einheit (OLED), umfassend:
