load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b><u>Field of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to telecommunications, in particular to wireless telecommunications.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>Description of the Related Art</u></b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Wireless telecommunications systems are well-known. Many such systems are cellular, in that radio coverage is provided by a bundle of radio coverage areas known as cells. A base station that provides radio coverage is located in each cell. Traditional base stations provide coverage in relatively large geographic areas and the corresponding cells are often referred to as macrocells.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It is possible to establish smaller sized cells within a macrocell. Cells that are smaller than macrocells are sometimes referred to as microcells, picocells, or femtocells, but we use the term picocells generically for cells that are smaller than macrocells. One way to establish a picocell is to provide a picocell base station that operates within a relatively limited range within the coverage area of a macrocell. One example of use of a picocell base station is to provide wireless communication coverage within a building.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The picocell base station is of a relatively low transmit power and hence each picocell is small compared to a macrocell.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Picocell base stations can use broadband Internet Protocol connections as "backhaul", in other words they are connected via picocell base station gateways to a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) core network, specifically each gateway is connected via the operator's Internet Protocol (IP) network to core network components such as to a UMTS Mobile Switching Centre (MSC) and a Signalling Gateway Support Node (SGSN).<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Picocell base stations are intended primarily for users belonging to a particular home or office. Picocell base stations may be private access or public access. In private access picocell base stations, access is restricted only to registered users, for example family members or particular groups of employees. In public access picocell base stations, other users may also use the picocell base station, subject to certain restrictions to protect the Quality of Service received by registered users.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">There can be a large number of picocells within an area roughly equivalent to the size of a macrocell. Accordingly, there can be a large number of picocells in an operator's coverage area, such that conventional cell planning, as done to optimise location of base stations in macrocell networks, becomes impractical. This is particularly so as picocells are usually deployed by end-users or unskilled individuals installing picocell base stations where they choose in their offices and homes, for example in what is sometimes called a "plug-and-play" manner.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Where picocells are deployed, there is an increase in the number of cells that a mobile user terminal detects and interacts with. For example, a macrocell user moving along a road may often move in and out of range of picocell base stations, causing a sequence of handover attempt processes to and from the picocells. This disadvantageously produces an increase in the core network signalling and an increase in the risk that a call will be dropped due to the higher number of handover attempts. This can be to the detriment of data handling performance of the picocells. As the number of picocell base stations increases within a network, more network resources are required to handle handovers to or from picocell base stations. This gives rise to a practical limit on the number of picocell base stations that can be deployed within a macrocell area.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Handover attempts are one type of mobility procedure, and mobility procedures become more frequent in a network including picocells as compared to one with just macrocells. As such mobility procedures were designed for macrocell networks, telecommunications standards can require that multiple network elements are involved, for example, such as MSCs and SGSNs in UMTS core networks to which picocell base stations are connected. Although appropriate in macrocell<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> networks, in a network including picocells, a high number of such resource-intensive mobility procedures between multiple network elements is disadvantageous.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As described in the paper by <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>L.T.W. Ho, H. Claussen entitled "Effects of User -Deployed, Co-Channel Femtocells on the Call Drop Probability in a Residential Scenario", The 18th Annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Radio Communications (PIMRC'07), 2007</text></nplcit>, if a picocell base station provides coverage in public spaces, there is a large increase in mobility procedures such as handover attempts and idle mode mobility. In addition to a significant increase in core network signalling, an unacceptably large increase in call drop probability may result.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Accordingly, it is important to seek to optimise the radio coverage from picocell base stations, such that the building in which the picocell base station is located is largely or fully covered, but, on the other hand, little coverage extends outside, for example to where unregistered users may pass by the building.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> (PRIOR ART), ignoring effects due to reflection and attenuation by walls, a known picocell base station 14 having a single antenna (not shown), namely a dipole, has a radiation pattern (i.e. radio coverage area) that is essentially circular in cross-section. This pattern is disadvantageous when the building 16 is an "awkward" shape, such as being long and thin. For example, a typical English terraced house (e.g. 13.5 metres long by 4.5 metres wide) is such an awkwardly-shaped building 16. There are areas of the building 16 lacking radio coverage whist the radio coverage "spills" into neighbouring houses 18 and onto the street 20.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">One known approach to improving this situation is to use multi-antenna arrays in picocell base stations, such that it becomes possible to adjust the gain (i.e. power) and hence the coverage area in selected directions. This improves the ability to provide good coverage within the building, without greater coverage outside the building that would cause an undesirable increase in mobility procedures.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">One problem with using multi-element antennas is that, due to cost constraints, conventional receivers in picocell base stations have only one receive signal processing path ("receive chain") of RF receiver, detector and decoder, such that signals from different directions cannot be processed separately. This means the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> receiver cannot differentiate between signals on the basis of the direction from which they were received As the receiver lacks the information to decide in what direction(s) gain should be increased or decreased, it is difficult to adapt coverage in a useful way.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">One known approach used in some Wireless Local Area Network access points having multiple antennas is to try randomly vanous predefined antenna gain configurations and select the one that provides the best coverage. This approach can improve the link quality for a current transmission As it can be considered a "trial and error" approach, it cannot be relied on to quickly provide good coverage within an awkwardly shaped building.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Another known approach used in macrocellular base stations having multiple directional antennas, and corresponding sectors (also known as "cells"), is that each antenna of the array has a separate receive chain. In other words, a separate RF receiver, detector and decoder is provided for each sector In consequence, the signals from different directions can be differentiated. Using this approach, radio coverage optimisation becomes possible, but there is increased complexity because signals from each sector are processed separately.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">It is known from International patent application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2004114460A"><text>WO2004/114460</text></patcit> to provide a method, in a base station for wireless telecommunications having multiple directional antenna elements each providing a corresponding radio coverage lobe, of identifying which subset of the lobes covers a user terminal,<br/>

This is explained in more detail below.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><heading id="h0009"><u>Determination of the best lobe</u></heading><p id="p0036" num="0036">The determination of the best lobe to a user terminal in the building is made by a series of gain modifications to the lobes and uses the measurement reporting capability of the user terminal. The user terminal frequently provides feedback to the picocell base station unit 30 of received pilot signal strength. This feedback is in measurement reports.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Measurement reporting by a user terminal is known to the skilled reader in the art, for example being defined in Standards such as Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS).</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">An example of this lobe determination process is shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref>. In the determination, measurement reports from a user terminal indicating either that an increase in received pilot signal gain was detected or no increase in received pilot signal gain was detected, are used by the picocell base station unit 30.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref>, as a first step (denoted a in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref>) transmitted pilot signal gain is temporarily increased by a predetermined amount in each of a set of four adjacent lobes 1, 2, 3, 4. In this example, the user terminal (denoted UE in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref>) sends a measurement report indicating that an increase in received pilot signal gain was detected. Accordingly the lobe detector 62 in the picocell base station unit 30 determines that the user terminal is covered by one of these four lobes 1,2,3,4.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">As a second step (denoted b in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref>), the picocell base station unit 30 refines the search by temporarily increasing the gain of two of the four lobes 1,2,3,4. In this example, the gain of lobes 1 annd 2 are increased. In this example, the user terminal is not covered by those two lobes, so the user terminal reports that no increase in received pilot signal gain was detected. Accordingly the lobe detector 62 in the picocell base station unit 30 determines that the user terminal is covered by one of the other two lobes 3,4.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">As a third step (denoted c in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref>), the picocell base station unit 30 refines the search yet further by temporarily increasing the pilot signal gain of one of the remaining two "candidate" lobes 3,4. In this example, this was done for lobe 3, in<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> other words the "correct" lobe was chosen such that the user terminal sends a measurement report indicating that an increase in received pilot signal gain was detected. According, the lobe detector 62 of the PCBSU 30 has detected the lobe that serves the user terminal in its current location best.</p><heading id="h0010"><u>Coverage Optimisation</u></heading><p id="p0042" num="0042">After the correct lobe serving the user terminal is identified using the above-described process, a coverage improvement process is performed based on the number of mobility events as explained below.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 7</figref> shows, referring back to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>, how the coverage optimiser 64 of the auto-configuration controller 60 of the PCBSU 30 acts to control the pilot signal gain of the lobe in question generated by the pilot signal generator.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 7</figref>, for the lobe, when transmitting (step 205) pilot signals using a default pilot signal gain, handover events are monitored (step 210) to detect and determine the rate of unwanted handover events (step 212). The rate of unwanted handover events, in other words, unwanted mobility events, is the number of such events per unit time from mobiles not registered to use the PCBSU or from passing macrocell users who briefly, i.e. within a certain time period, handover to the PCBSU 30 then handback immediately to the macrocell network as they pass by. Registered mobile user terminals can include both "home" user terminals and permitted "visitor" user terminals.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The aim is to maximise indoor coverage for the identified lobe without increasing the number of such unwanted handover events to an unacceptable level.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Accordingly, a determination is made (step 215) whether the number of unwanted events reaches a first threshold of n1 events for a time t1. If No, then pilot signal gain is increased (step 220) by a predetermined increment Delta1 Accordingly the lobe expands in size. The count of unwanted events (steps 210,212) is restarted.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">If the first threshold is reached then a determination is made (step 225) whether the number of unwanted events reaches a second threshold of n2 events for a time t2. The second threshold is less stringent than the first threshold. If Yes, then the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> pilot signal gain is decreased (step 230) by a predetermined decrement Delta2. Accordingly the lobe shrinks in size. If No, the pilot signal gain is not reduced.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The counting of unwanted events (steps 210,212) is then restarted.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Both the measurement times t1,t2 and the gain increment Delta1 and gain decrement Delta2, are adapted over time. This is to improve the speed to reach a stable state having appropriate lobe sizes such that there is good coverage inside the building but little coverage outside. This is also to prevent frequent flipping between increasing and decreasing pilot signal gain. For example, at first t2 is low so that rapid lobe size increase is possible until a first unwanted mobility event is detected, in which case t2 is then increased significantly so as to slow down the rate of increase.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050"><figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 8</figref> shows an example of the resulting coverage, in which various user terminals in various lobes have been identified and so the sizes of the lobes adjusted. It will be seen that the eight lobes 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 (defined by pilot signal gains) have taken various sizes that practically maximise coverage within the building 16' without increasing the number of unwanted handover events to an unacceptable level. Significant radio coverage by the PCBSU in the street 20' and into neighbouring buildings 18' is avoided.</p><heading id="h0011"><u>Some variants</u></heading><p id="p0051" num="0051">In some otherwise similar examples, predictive testing of lobes and/or enhanced testing can be undertaken as described below.</p><heading id="h0012"><u>Predictive "Testing" of lobes</u></heading><p id="p0052" num="0052">One option to increase the speed to reach a stable lobe pattern is to use statistics on in which lobe, or lobes, frequent unwanted handovers have happened in the past, in order to select which lobe or lobes to temporarily increase the gain of first, in a test cycle.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">For example, if past testing, using the method of determination of best lobe described above, has revealed that 90% of the handovers occur in one particular lobe, this lobe can be tested first, on its own before step (a) shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref> and described<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> above. In most cases the user terminal entering the building will be located within that lobe which has a temporary increase in pilot signal gain so will provide a measurement report indicating a consequential increase in received pilot signal gain. In that case, as the correct lobe covering the user terminal is identified, there is then no need to undertake steps (a), (b) and (c) as described above in relation to <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref>.</p><heading id="h0013"><u>Enhanced Testing</u></heading><p id="p0054" num="0054">Within some buildings, signal reflections by walls can contribute to a received signal. This can mean that, in determination of the best lobe, temporarily increasing the pilot signal gain of a lobe in which the user terminal is not located could nevertheless result in the user terminal detecting and so reporting a consequential received pilot signal gain. This can result in unreliable identification of the best lobe for a user terminal in a particular location.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">This can be addressed by basing the determination of the best lobe not only on whether an increase in received signal gain is detected.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In this case, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 9</figref>, as a first step (denoted a in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 9</figref>) four adjacent lobes are tested first. Specifically, transmitted pilot signal gain is temporarily increased by a predetermined amount in each of a set of four adjacent lobes 1, 2, 3, 4. In this example, the user terminal (denoted UE in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 9</figref>) sends a measurement report indicating that an increase in received pilot signal gain was detected. As a second step (denoted b in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 9</figref>) the other four lobes are tested. Specifically, transmitted pilot signal gain is temporarily increased by a predetermined amount in each of a set of four adjacent lobes 5,6,7,8, and the user terminal sens a further measurement report. The group of lobes that provides the highest increase in pilot power detected by the user is selected as that within which the user terminal is located, say lobes 1 to 4 in this example.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The picocell base station unit refines the search by further testing the group of lobes (lobes 1,2,3,4 in this example) determined as giving the higher increase of in pilot signal detected. Specifically as a third step (denoted c in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 9</figref>), the gain of a sub-group consisting of two lobes, namely lobes 1,2, is temporarily increased; and<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> then as a fourth step (denoted d in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 9</figref>) the gain of the other subgroup consisting of two lobes, namely lobes 3,4, are temporanly increased.

Specifically, as a fifth step (denoted e in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 9</figref>), by the pilot signal gain is temporarily increased of one of the lobes (lobe 3 in this example) then the other (lobe 4 in this example). The lobe in respect of which the higher increase in pilot signal received by the user terminal is detected is taken to be the lobe in which the user terminal is located, in other words, the lobe that serves the user terminal in its current location best</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">It will be understood that although this doubles the number of gain modification steps required, compared to the approach described in relation to <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref> above, it provides more reliable results.</p><heading id="h0014"><u>Another Variant</u></heading><p id="p0060" num="0060">This vanant is similar to that described in relation to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>, basically except that it receives signals from selected lobes that are gain-adjusted rather than signals for transmission in the selected lobes</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 10</figref>, the picocell base station consists of an array 46' of eight antenna-elements 48' each connected to a gain controller 50' The gain controller 50' enables the gain that is applied to receive signals from each antenna to be adjusted The PCBSU 30 includes a receive chain 56' including a radio frequency signal receiver (not shown), a receive signal detector 57 and a decoder (not shown).
