New York, U.S.A., 2004</text></nplcit>). The disclosure of the foregoing is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition, the entirety of the disclosures of each of the publications cited herein are also incorporated herein by reference. A retrovirus designated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the etiological agent of the complex disease that includes progressive destruction of the immune system (acquired immune deficiency syndrome; AIDS) and degeneration of the central and peripheral nervous system. This virus was previously known as LAV, HTLV-III, or ARV. A common feature of retrovirus replication is the extensive post-translational processing of precursor polyproteins by a virally encoded protease to generate mature viral proteins required for virus assembly and function. Inhibition of this processing prevents the production of normally infectious virus. For example, Kohl (1988) demonstrated that genetic inactivation of the HIV encoded protease resulted in the production of immature, non-infectious virus particles. These results indicate that inhibition of the HIV protease represents a viable method for the treatment of AIDS and the prevention or treatment of infection by HIV.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The introduction of protease inhibitors (PIs) into highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a combination therapy based on co-administration of PIs with reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, marked the beginning of a new era in HIV/AIDS chemotherapy. HAART treatment regimens have led to a significant decline in the number of deaths due to HIV infection in the developed World (Sepkowitz, 2001). The disclosure of the foregoing is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition, the entirety of the disclosure of each of the publications cited herein is also incorporated herein by reference. Unfortunately there are a number of factors that severely limit current HAART treatment regimens. High frequency of dosing, heavy pill burden and issues of tolerability and toxicity can lead to poor adherence to treatment (Waters, 2007). The need for more potent, less toxic drug regimens is quite apparent.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Currently available combination chemotherapy typically using two reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) and boosted protease inhibitors (PIs) or an integrase inhibitor or highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and AIDS has been shown to suppress the replication of HIV-1 and significantly extend the life expectancy of HIV-1-infected individuals. Indeed, several recent analyses have revealed that mortality rates for HIV infected persons have become much closer to general mortality rates since the introduction of HAART, and that first line HAART with boosted PI-based regimens resulted in less resistance within and across drug classes.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, the ability to provide effective long-term antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 infection has become a complex issue since those who initially achieved favorable viral suppression to undetectable levels have experienced treatment failure. In addition, it is evident that even with these anti-HIV-1 drugs, only partial immunologic reconstitution is attained in patients with advanced HIV-1 infection and it is likely that HIV-1 will eventually acquire resistance to virtually any antiviral agents. Thus, it appears that the development of potent and drug-resistant-deferring antiviral agents will continue to be required for successful long-term control of HIV-1 infection and AIDS.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is the rapid emergence of drug resistance however, that is proving to be a most formidable problem. Mutations causing drug resistance are thought to occur spontaneously, through the recombination of mixed viral populations, and also due to drug pressure, particularly when administered at sub-standard doses (Pillay, 2006; Grabar, 2000; Wainberg, 1998; Harrigan, 2005). A growing number of patients are developing multi-drug-resistant HIV-1 variants (Hertogs, 2000; Yerly, 1999). There is ample evidence that these viral<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> strains can be transmitted. Thus, the development of antiretroviral agents able to maintain potency against resistant HIV strains has become an urgent priority.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The proteolytic enzyme, HIV-1 protease is essential for viral assembly and maturation (Roberts, 1990; Meek, 1990; McQuade, 1990). As a consequence, design of specific inhibitors for HIV-1 protease has become the subject of immense interest. In 1996, protease inhibitors (PIs) were introduced in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors to become highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (Flexner, 1998; Cihlar, 2000). This treatment regimen significantly increased life expectancy, improved quality of life and decreased mortality and morbidity among HIV/AIDS patients. Despite these notable advances, the emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants is severely limiting the efficacy of HAART treatment regimens. Therefore, development of new broad spectrum antiretroviral drugs that produce minimal adverse effects remains an important therapeutic objective for the treatment of HIV/AIDS (Wainberg, 2000; Hertogs, 2000).</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Recently, structure-based design of inhibitors maximizing interactions within the active site protease back-bone were described, as was the development of nonpeptide inhibitors (1-2) that have shown picomolar enzyme affinity and exceptional antiviral activity against both wild-type and drug-resistant HIV-1 strains (Ghosh, 1998; Koh, 2003; Ghosh, 2002; Surleraux, 2005; Yoshimura, 2002; Koh, 2003). The X-ray crystallographic studies revealed that backbone conformation of mutant protease is minimally distorted compared to wild-type HIV-1 proteases. Without being bound by theory, it is believed herein that maximizing 'back-bone binding' may be an important design strategy to combat drug-resistance (Ghosh, 2008). Inhibitor 1 (Daraunavir, TMC-114) was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of drug resistant HIV strains (on June 23, 2006, the FDA approved new HIV treatment for patients who do not respond to existing drugs). More recently, it has been approved for all HIV/AIDS patients including pediatric AIDS patients (On October 21, 2008, FDA granted traditional approval to Prezista (darunavir), co-administered with ritonavir and with other antiretroviral agents, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced adult patients. In addition to the traditional approval, a new dosing regimen for treatment-naïve patients was approved).</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Ghosh A.K. et al, "Design and synthesis of novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors incorporating oxyindoles as the P'2 -ligands", Bioorg, Med.

Similarly, extension of the ether carbon chain by three methylene groups resulted in a 17 fold loss in activity (<b>13h</b> <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 0.10 nM versus <b>13e</b> <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 1.7 nM).</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">For example, the 14 membered macrocyclic inhibitors <b>14b</b> and <b>15b</b> have <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> values less than 0.7 nM and IC<sub>50</sub> values less than 49 nM whereas their corresponding acyclic inhibitor <b>13b</b> had a <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> of 11 nM and IC<sub>50</sub> value of &gt;1000 nM (greater than 15-fold and 20-fold change, respectively). Without being bound by theory, Another trend observed is a preference of the S2' subsite for macrocylic rings of size 10 and 13. Indeed, the most potent compound of the series, inhibitor <b>14c</b> incorporating a 13 membered ring, showed a <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> of 45 pm and IC<sub>50</sub> of 2 nm. Increasing the ring size to 14 or 15 as well as decreasing the ring to 12 or 11 resulted in reduced enzymatic inhibitory and antiviral activity. Similarly, inhibitors incorporating a 10-membered ring <b>(14g</b> and <b>15f</b>) were also very potent <b>(14g</b> <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 51 pm; <b>15f</b> <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 86 pm and IC<sub>50</sub> = 5.5 nm).</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">The improvement in the <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> and IC<sub>50</sub> values for the unsaturated cyclic inhibitors <b>14a-h</b> compared to their saturated analogs <b>15a-g</b> is described. For the 13-membered ring series, the presence of a double bond results in a 10-fold increase in both <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> and IC<sub>50</sub> (<b>14c</b> <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 45 pM and IC<sub>50</sub> = 2 nM compared to <b>15c</b> <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 470 pM and IC<sub>50</sub> = 22 nM). Similar differences in potency are observed for the 11, 14, and 15-membered macrocycles although for the smaller rings 9, 10, and 12 the effect is less pronounced. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that this may result from a restricted conformation in the molecule that results from the presence of the double bond and leads to a better fit in the hydrophobic pocket of the S2 subsite. The importance of the stereochemistry of the double bond in the olefinic compounds is described.. As shown in Table 3, only minor variations in activity (less than 5 fold) were observed between the E and Z isomers of the 13, 14, and 15-membered. For the 13-membered ring system the Z isomer was favored over the E configuration.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">In another embodiment, possible substitutions that can be made across the macrocylic ring system that further enhance biological activity are described. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that a single methyl substitution β to the macrocylic amine atom could fill a hydrophobic pocket filled by a methyl group of darunavir's isopropyl moiety. The design and synthesis of a series of mono and dimethylated 14-membered macrocylic ring systems and evaluation of the impact of this substitution on the biological activity is described. Geminal dimethyls at this location <b>(19a</b> through <b>22a)</b> decreased (10-fold) enzyme inhibition and reduced antiviral activity. Addition of a single methyl group to the ring reduced biological activity as compared to <b>14b</b> and <b>15b,</b> although results varied depending upon the<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> stereochemistry of the ring systems. <b>20c</b> and <b>21b</b> were the most potent compounds from this series with <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 0.31 and 2.8 nM and IC<sub>50</sub> = 9.0 and 6.3 nM, respectively.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">In another embodiment, compounds of formulae

High resolution mass spectra were recorded on a FinniganMAT XL95 mass spectrometer calibrated against PPG. Column chromatography was performed with Whatman 240-400 mesh silica gel under low pressure of 3-5 psi. TLC was carried out with E. Merck silica gel 60-F-254 plates. Visualization was carried out with short-wave UV or staining with phosphomolybdic acid (PMA), iodine, or ninhydrin. HPLC data was collected using a system composed of an Agilent 1100 series degasser, quaternary pump, thermostatable column compartment, variable wavelength detector, and Agilent 1200 series autosampler and fraction collector controlled by Chemstation software. All chromatographic reagents used were HPLC grade. The reported inhibitors were found to be &gt;95% pure by reversed-phase gradient HPLC (see supporting information for specific method conditions).</p><heading id="h0007">EXAMPLE 1</heading><p id="p0116" num="0116">1-(Hex-5-enyloxy)-3-methoxybenzene (5a): To a stirred solution of 3-methoxy phenol (1.24 g, 10 mmol), 5-hexen-1-ol, 4a (1.4 mL, 12 mmol) and Ph<sub>3</sub>P (3.14g, 12 mmol) in THF (20 mL) at 0 °C was added diisopropylazodicarboxylate (2.3 mL, 12 mmol) dropwise.

Briefly, CFP- and YFP-tagged HIV-1 protease constructs were generated using BD Creator™ DNA Cloning Kits (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). For the generation of full206 length molecular infectious clones containing CFP- or YFP-tagged protease, the PCR207<!-- EPO <DP n="58"> --> mediated recombination method was used (<nplcit id="ncit0012" npl-type="s"><text>Fang et al.1999 Nat Med 5:239-42</text></nplcit>).

When the effect of each compound was analyzed by FRET, test compounds were added to the culture medium simultaneously with plasmid transfection. Results of FRET were determined by quenching of CFP (donor) fluorescence and an increase in YFP (acceptor) fluorescence (sensitized emission), since part of the energy of CFP is transferred to YFP instead of being emitted. The changes in the CFP and YFP fluorescence intensity in the images of selected regions were examined and quantified using Olympus FV500 Image software system (OLYMPUS Optical Corp). Ratios of intensities of CFP fluorescence after photobleaching to CFP fluorescence prior to photobleaching (CFP<sub>A/B</sub> ratios) were determined. When the CFP<sub>A/B</sub> ratios were less than 1, it indicated that the association of the two subunits did not occur and it was interpreted that protease dimerization was inhibited.<!-- EPO <DP n="59"> -->

Determination of nucleotide sequence of the protease-encoding region disclosed that the variants resistant to APV (5 µM: passage 20) had acquired previously reported mutations such as L10I, V32I, M46I, and I84V. By passage 5 with GRL-216 exposure, the wild-type protease gene sequence in the virus was seen. However, by passage 10 and beyond, the virus was seen to contain V82I substitution. As the passage proceeded, more amino acid substitutions were acquired. By passage 30, the virus had acquired L10I and I84V substitutions. By passage 50 (0.16 µM GRL-216: HIV<sub>216-P50</sub>), the virus had further acquired L24I and M46I substitutions. By passage 60, the virus had gained L63P substitutions as well. HIV-1 exposed to GRL-246 had acquired L10F, M46I, and T91S in the protease362 encoding region by passage 33 (1 µM GRL-246). HIV-1 exposed to GRL-286, by passage 37 (1 µM), had acquired L10F, M46L, I50V, and A71V in the protease-encoding region. The HIV-1 selected against GRL-396 had acquired, by passage 33 (1 µM GRL- 396), L10F, M46I, Q61K, V82I and I84V in the protease-encoding region. We also examined whether the virus acquired mutations in the Gag region at several passages of GRL-216 selection. It was found that by passage 10, the virus had acquired the E107D substitution. By passage 25 and beyond, V35I, R275K and the p1/p6 cleavage site substitution, L449F, had emerged. By passage 50, V390D emerged and persisted (data not shown). We also determined the amino acid sequences of the gag region of each of the selected HIV variants with direct base-sequencing. Two amino acid substitutions were seen in common: V35I substitution was identified in GRL-216-, -246-, and - 286-selected variants (by 25, 10, and 20 passages, respectively) and L449F substitution (<nplcit id="ncit0016" npl-type="s"><text>Doyon et al. 1996 J Virol 70:3763-9</text></nplcit>) in GRL-216- and -286- selected variants (by 25 and 20 passages, respectively).

The bis-THF component of GRL-216 forms hydrogen bonding interaction with D29 and D30 of the protease. Hydrogen bond interactions with D25, D25', and a water molecule-mediated hydrogen bond interactions with I50 and I50' were also observed. These hydrogen bond interactions were also observed for DRV. The P2' ligands of DRV and GRL-216 were different and both of them formed hydrogen bond interactions with different backbone atoms of D30'. The oxygen atom in the methoxybenzene of GRL-216 formed hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of D30', while the aniline nitrogen of darunavir hydrogen bonds to the oxygen of the backbone carbonyl. While the polar interactions of these molecules were similar, there appear to be subtle difference in the non-polar interaction due to the presence of the macrocyclic ring in GRL-216. The macrocyclic ring occupied more volume at the S1'-S2' binding cavity of the protease, and formed more van der Waals interactions with V82 and I84 than the corresponding isopropyl group of the structurally related <i>bis</i>-THF-containing DRV. Without being bound by theory, it is believed herein that the binding of GRL-216 to V82 and V84 along with the polar interactions described herein significantly contribute to its activity against HIV-1 protease.

The X-ray structure and modeling studies of PI A-77003 indicated that the V82A mutant results in decreased van der Waals interaction with the phenyl rings in both S1 and S1'-subsites (Kempf, 1991; Baldwin, 1995). There is also evidence of repacking of inhibitor side chain and enzyme atoms in the S1-subsite exhibited by the compounds described herein. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that enzyme flexibility in accommodating alternate packing, allows a flexible macrocycle between the P1'-side chain and the P2'-sulfonamide ring to fill in the S1' and S2'-subsites (Baldwin, 1995). In particular, 12-16-membered saturated and unsaturated macrocycles are described that effectively fill in the S1'-S2' hydrophobic pocket of the enzyme active site while retaining all major interactions of PIs 1 and 2 with the protein backbone. Herein described are examples of such inhibitors that maintain potency against both wild-type and mutant strains. PIs that incorporate various macrocycles to effectively fill in the enzyme active site are described.<!-- EPO <DP n="69"> --></p><p id="p0201" num="0201">EXAMPLE Biological Evaluation: The inhibitory potencies of acyclic and cyclic inhibitors were measured by the assay protocol of Toth and Marshall (<nplcit id="ncit0017" npl-type="s"><text>Toth, M.
