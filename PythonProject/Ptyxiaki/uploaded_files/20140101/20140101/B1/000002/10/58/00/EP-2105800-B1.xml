load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><u>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a processing solution for preparing a lithographic printing plate and a processing method of a lithographic printing plate precursor, particularly, to a processing method of a lithographic printing plate precursor which has an excellent function for preventing printing stain due to readsorption of a photosensitive layer component (particularly, a binder) dispersed in a processing solution to a substrate.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In general, a lithographic printing plate is composed of an oleophilic image area accepting ink and a hydrophilic non-image area accepting dampening water in the process of printing. Lithographic printing is a printing method which comprises rendering the oleophilic image area of the lithographic printing plate to an ink-receptive area and the hydrophilic non-image area thereof to a dampening water-receptive area (ink unreceptive area), thereby making a difference in adherence of ink on the surface of the lithographic printing plate, and depositing the ink only to the image area by utilizing the nature of water and printing ink to repel with each other, and then transferring the ink to a printing material, for example, paper.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In order to produce the lithographic printing plate, a lithographic printing plate precursor (PS plate) comprising a hydrophilic support having provided thereon an oleophilic photosensitive resin layer (photosensitive layer or image-recording layer) has heretofore been broadly used. Ordinarily, the lithographic printing plate is obtained by conducting plate making according to a method of exposing the lithographic printing plate precursor through an original, for example, a lith film, and then removing the unnecessary portion of the image-recording layer by dissolving with an alkaline developer or an organic solvent thereby revealing the hydrophilic surface of support to form the non-image area while leaving the image-recording layer for forming the image area.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Thus, in the hitherto known plate making process of lithographic printing plate<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> precursor, after exposure, the step of removing the unnecessary portion of the image-recording layer by dissolving, for example, with a developer is required. However, in view of the environment and safety, a processing with a developer closer to a neutral range and a small amount of waste liquid are objectives to be achieved. Particularly, since disposal of waste liquid discharged accompanying the wet treatment has become a great concern throughout the field of industry in view of the consideration for global environment in recent years, the demand for the solution of the above-described problems has been increased more and more.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">On the other hand, digitalized technique of electronically processing, accumulating and outputting image information using a computer has been popularized in recent years, and various new image outputting systems responding to the digitalized technique have been put into practical use. Correspondingly, attention has been drawn to a computer-to-plate (CTP) technique of carrying digitalized image information on highly converging radiation, for example, laser light and conducting scanning exposure of a lithographic printing plate precursor with the light thereby directly preparing a lithographic printing plate without using a lith film. Thus, it is one of important technical subjects to obtain a lithographic printing plate precursor adaptable to the technique described above.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As described above, the decrease in alkali concentration of developer and the simplification of processing step have been further strongly required from both aspects of the consideration for global environment and the adaptation for space saving and low running cost. However, since the development processing ordinarily comprises three steps of developing with an aqueous alkali solution having pH of 10 or more, washing of the alkali agent with a water-washing bath and then treating with a gum solution mainly comprising a hydrophilic resin as described above, an automatic developing machine per se requires a large space and problems of the environment and running cost, for example, disposal of the development waste liquid, water-washing waste liquid and gum waste liquid still remain.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In response, for instance, a developing method using an alkali solution having pH of 10 to 12.5 and containing a nonionic surfactant is proposed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2002091016A"><text>JP-A 2002-91016</text></patcit> (the term "JP-A"· as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application"). However, since the photosensitive layer containing an alkali-soluble polymer is used, there is a problem in that the development can not be performed with a solution having pH lower than the above-described range. Also, a lithographic printing plate precursor comprising a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> hydrophilic support having provided thereon an image-forming layer containing hydrophobic thermoplastic polymer particles dispersed in a hydrophilic binder is described in Japanese Patent <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2938397B"><text>2,938,397</text></patcit>. The lithographic printing plate precursor can be exposed imagewise using an infrared laser to agglomerate the hydrophobic thermoplastic polymer particles by heat thereby forming an image, and mounted on a cylinder of a printing machine to carry out on-machine development by supplying dampening water and/or ink.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Although the method of forming image by the agglomeration of fine particles only upon thermal fusion shows good on-machine development property, it has a problem in that the image strength (adhesion property to a support) is extremely weak and printing durability is insufficient.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">As described above, the system including development with an alkali agent has a problem of supplying a replenisher for compensating the decrease of pH due to absorption of carbon dioxide and an apparatus therefor and of increase in the amount of waste liquid involved and a problem of the running cost of developer as well as the problem of environment.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Also, according to the development in an acidic to neutral range, ordinarily, it is difficult to ensure developing property and the components of the photosensitive layer removed once in the non-image area are difficult to be stably dispersed in the developer. As a result, the components of the photosensitive layer are precipitated in a developing bath and when running processing is carried out, a problem may occur in that the precipitates adhere as development scum on the lithographic printing plate precursor during the processing to be apt to cause image defect.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP0923001A1"><text>EP 0 923 001 A1</text></patcit> relates to a developer composition for the development of exposed, photosensitive recording material which contains water and a least one compound which is alkaline in aqueous solution, characterized in that said composition contains at least one copolymer acting as an emulsifier and comprising units of (I) at least on hydrophobic vinyl compound which has alkyl radicals having up to 30 carbon atoms and (II) at least one hydrophilic, ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, some of the carboxyl groups in these units being esterified with reaction products of (A) (C1-C30)alkanols, (C8-C25)alkanoic acids, (C1-C12)alkylphenols or di(C1-C20)alkylamines with (B) (C2-C4)alkylene oxides or tetrahydrofuran, the molar ratio (A):(B) being in the range from 1:2 to 1:50.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP1085381A1"><text>EP 1 085 381 A1</text></patcit> relates to a developer for exposed, photosensitive recording materials which contains water and at least one compound which is alkaline in aqueous solution, which developer contains at least one copolymer acting as an emulsifier and comprising units of (I) at least one hydrophobic vinyl compound which has at least one optionally substituted mono- or bicyclic (C6-C14)aryl radical and (II) at least one hydrophilic, ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, some of the carboxyl groups in these units being esterified with reaction products of (A) (C1-C30)alkanols, (C8-C25)alkanoic acids, (C1-C12)alkylphenols or di(C1-C20)alkylamines with (B) (C2-C4)alkylene oxides or tetrahydrofuran, the molar ratio (A):(B) being in the range from 1:2 to 1:50.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="EP1752828A1"><text>EP 1 752 828 A1</text></patcit> relates to a rinse solution for lithography capable of, by being brought into contact with a resist after an image-forming light exposure followed by a development treatment, decreasing the defects after the rinse treatment, preventing pattern falling in the water rinse, and being effective in suppression of the shrinkage of the pattern caused by electron beam irradiation by improving the electron beam resistance as well as to a resist pattern forming method by using the same.

More specifically, an object of the present invention is to provide a processing solution for preparing a lithographic printing plate and a processing method of a lithographic printing plate precursor, both of which exhibit an excellent developing property in a development processing with an aqueous solution having pH of 3 to 7 and prevent adsorption of an<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> image-recording layer component (particularly, a binder) removed by development and present in the processing solution to a support and generation of printing stain.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As a result of the intensive investigations, the inventors have found that the above-described object can be achieved by conducting development processing of a lithographic printing plate precursor comprising a support on a surface of which a hydrophilizing treatment and/or an undercoat layer has been provided and an image-recording layer after imagewise exposure, with an aqueous solution having pH of 3 to 7 and containing a specific polymer to complete the present invention.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Specifically, the present invention includes the following items.
<ol><li>(1) A processing solution for preparing a lithographic printing plate for conducting development processing after exposing imagewise a lithographic printing plate precursor comprising a support on a surface of which at least one of a hydrophilizing treament and an undercoat layer has been provided and an image-recording layer to cure an exposed area of the image-recording layer, which is an aqueous solution having pH of 3 to 7 and containing a surfactant as a developing agent and a first polymer having a weight average molecular weight of from 1,000 to 100,000 and comprising a nitrogen atom, wherein the first polymer comprises an ammonium group.</li><li>(2) The processing solution for preparing a lithographic printing plate as described in (1) above, which contains a water-soluble polymer compound and at least one member selected from a phosphate and a phosphoric acid.</li><li>(3) A processing method of a lithographic printing plate precursor comprising exposing imagewise a lithographic printing plate precursor comprising a support on a surface of which at least one of a hydrophilizing treatment and an undercoat layer has been provided and an image-recording layer to cure an exposed area of the image-recording layer and then conducting developing processing using the processing solution for preparing a lithographic printing plate as described in any one of (1) to (2) above.</li><li>(4) The processing method of a lithographic printing plate precursor as described in (3) above, wherein the hydrophilizing treatment is a silicate treatment of the support.</li><li>(5) The processing method of a lithographic printing plate precursor as described in (3)<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> or (4) above, wherein the undercoat layer contains an acid group or a salt of an acid group.</li><li>(6) The processing method of a lithographic printing plate precursor as described in (5) above, wherein the undercoat layer contains a sulfonic acid group or a sulfonate group.</li></ol></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to the present invention, a processing solution for preparing a lithographic printing plate and a processing method of a lithographic printing plate precursor, both of which exhibit an excellent developing property in a development processing with an aqueous solution having pH of 3 to 7 and prevent adsorption of an image-recording layer component (particularly, a binder) removed by development and present in the processing solution to a support and generation of printing stain can be provided.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the processing solution for preparing a lithographic printing plate and processing method of a lithographic printing plate precursor, a system conducting development processing with an aqueous solution having pH of 3 to 7 is adopted. In the system, since a mechanism of dissolving an image-recording layer with strong alkali can not be employed, it is necessary that a layer, particularly, a binder component makes hydrophilic in comparison with the strong alkali development system. Thus, it is difficult to increase printing durability. In order to increase the printing durability, one means is to enhance adsorption between the binder component and a support. For example, a method of electrostatically adsorbing the binder component with the support (including an undercoat layer) is known. However, a problem arises in that the binder component dissolved (dispersed) in the developer at the development processing step adsorbs again on the non-image area of the image-recording layer to cause stain at the printing. According to the invention, a mechanism in which the binder component dissolved does not adsorb on the non-image area can be constructed by using the specific polymer in the processing solution for development as described above. Specifically, the development of image-recording layer progresses not as layer removal but in the form of dispersion development close to dissolution development and the image-recording layer is finely dispersed in the developer during the development. According to the invention, the polymer containing an ammonium group previously contained in the processing solution interacts with a support subjected to a hydrophilizing treatment or an undercoat layer to prevent interaction between the component of image-recording layer (particularly, the binder component) dispersed in the developer and the surface of support, thereby enabling inhibition of the readsorption of the component of image-recording layer (particularly, the binder component) to the surface of support (non-image area).

For the selection of sensitizing dye, the molar absorption coefficient thereof at the emission wavelength of the light source used is an important factor in addition to the photosensitivity. Use of the dye having a large molar absorption coefficient is profitable, because the amount of dye added can be made relatively small. Also, in case of using in a lithographic printing plate precursor, the use of such a dye is advantageous in view of physical properties of the image-recording layer. Since the photosensitivity and resolution of the image-recording layer and the physical properties of the exposed area of the image-recording layer are greatly influenced by the absorbance of sensitizing dye at the wavelength of light source, the amount of the sensitizing dye added is appropriately determined by taking account of these factors.</p><p id="p0119" num="0119">However, for the purpose of curing a layer having a large thickness, for example, of 5 µm or more, low absorbance is sometimes rather effective for increasing the curing degree.

Any of these known techniques can be applied to the protective layer according to the invention.

Synthetic smectite is also useful.</p><p id="p0213" num="0213">Of the inorganic stratiform compounds, fluorine based swellable mica, which is a synthetic inorganic stratiform compound, is particularly useful in the invention. Specifically, the swellable synthetic mica and an swellable clay mineral, for example, montmorillonite, saponite, hectolite or bentonite have a stratiform structure comprising a unit crystal lattice layer having thickness of approximately 10 to 15 angstroms, and metallic atom substitution in the lattices thereof is remarkably large in comparison with other clay minerals. As a result, the lattice layer results in lack of positive charge and in order to compensate it, a cation, for example, Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup>, is adsorbed between the lattice layers. The cation existing between the lattice layers is referred to as an exchangeable cation and is exchangeable with various cations. In particular, in the case where the cation between the lattice layers is Li+ or Na<sup>+</sup>, because of a small ionic radius, a bond between the stratiform crystal lattices is week, and the inorganic stratiform compound greatly swells upon contact with water. When share is applied under such condition, the stratiform crystal lattices are easily cleaved to form a stable sol in water. The bentnite and swellable synthetic mica have strongly such tendency and are useful in the invention. Particularly, the swellable synthetic mica is preferably used.</p><p id="p0214" num="0214">With respect to the shape of the inorganic stratiform compound used in the invention, the thinner the thickness or the larger the plain size as long as smoothness of coated surface and transmission of actinic radiation are not damaged, the better from the standpoint of control of diffusion. Therefore, an aspect ratio of the inorganic stratiform compound is ordinarily 20 or more, preferably 100 or more, particularly preferably 200 or more. The aspect ratio is a ratio of thickness to major axis of particle and can be determined, for example, from a projection drawing of particle by a microphotography. The larger the aspect ratio, the greater the effect obtained.</p><p id="p0215" num="0215">As for the particle size of the inorganic stratiform compound used in the invention, an average major axis is ordinarily from 0.3 to 20 µm, preferably from 0.5 to 10 µm, particularly preferably from 1 to 5 µm. An average thickness of the particle is ordinarily 0.1 µm or less, preferably 0.05 µm or less, particularly preferably 0.01 µm or less. For example, in the swellable synthetic mica that is the representative compound of the inorganic stratiform<!-- EPO <DP n="97"> --> compounds, thickness is approximately from 1 to 50 nm and plain size is approximately from 1 to 20 µm.</p><p id="p0216" num="0216">When such an inorganic stratiform compound particle having a large aspect ratio is incorporated into the protective layer, strength of coated layer increases and penetration of oxygen or moisture can be effectively inhibited so that the protective layer can be prevented from deterioration due to deformation, and even when the lithographic printing plate precursor is preserved for a long period of time under a high humidity condition, it is prevented from decrease in the image-forming property thereof due to the change of humidity and exhibits excellent preservation stability.</p><p id="p0217" num="0217">The content of the inorganic stratiform compound in the protective layer is preferably from 5/1 to 1/00 in terms of weight ratio to the amount of binder used in the protective layer.

The dispersing machine used include, for example, a variety of mills conducting dispersion by directly applying mechanical power, a high-speed agitation type dispersing machine providing a large shear force and a dispersion machine providing ultrasonic energy of high intensity.

A dispersion containing from 5 to 10% by weight of the inorganic stratiform compound thus prepared is highly viscous or gelled and exhibits extremely good preservation stability. In the formation of a coating solution for protective layer using the dispersion, it is preferred that the dispersion is diluted with water, sufficiently stirred and then mixed with a binder solution.</p><p id="p0219" num="0219">To the coating solution for protective layer can be added known additives, for example, a surfactant for improving coating property or a water-soluble plasticizer for<!-- EPO <DP n="98"> --> improving physical property of coated layer in addition to the inorganic stratiform compound.

By the heating, the image-forming reaction in the image-recording layer is accelerated and advantages, for example, improvement in the sensitivity and printing durability and stabilization of the sensitivity are achieved.

Occasionally, both or one of these two steps are omitted.</p><p id="p0358" num="0358">The development is described below. In case of the treatment with hand, for example, a method is used wherein the treatment is performed by rubbing the entire surface of lithographic printing plate precursor with a sponge or absorbent cotton sufficiently impregnated with the processing solution and after the treatment the lithographic printing plate precursor is thoroughly washed with water. In case of the immersion treatment, for example, a method is used wherein the lithographic printing plate precursor is immersed in a vat or deep tank containing the processing solution for about 60 seconds with stirring and then thoroughly washed with water while rubbing with an absorbent cotton or sponge.</p><p id="p0359" num="0359">In the development processing, a device simplified in the structure or simplified in the process according to the developing method of the invention is used. Since the influence of carbon dioxide in the air is small in comparison with a conventional alkali development system, the closeness degree between the air and solution can be decreased. Further, when the oil-desensitization treatment is performed simultaneously with the development, the water washing step and oil-desensitization treatment step after the development as in a conventional method are not indispensable and provision of one bath or at most two baths is sufficient. Even when the aqueous solution containing no oil-desensitizing agent, for example, a water-soluble resin is used, the performance same as in the conventional system can be obtained by omitting the water washing and then conducting the oil-desensitization treatment with a conventional gum solution or the like. Moreover, by using only one bath of a one-solution developer containing no oil-desensitizing agent, for example, a water-soluble resin, a lithographic printing plate can be obtained so that it is possible to construct a simple processing system although the protecting property of the surface and oil-desensitizing property are inferior to the lithographic printing plate obtained according to the conventional system. Specifically, in such a case, the system can be constructed by providing two baths. Thus, a device cost can be decreased and a device can be placed in a space much smaller than the space necessary for placing the conventional device. The lithographic printing plate precursor can also be applied to an automatic development processor (including pre-heat step, pre-water washing step, development step, water washing step, finishing (gum coating step) conventionally used in the processing. In such a case, although the same processing solution<!-- EPO <DP n="137"> --> can be used in the development step and finishing step, a processing solution for use in the development step can be designed in a simpler manner. Specifically, a construction including one bath of a one-solution developer containing no oil-desensitizing agent, for example, a water-soluble resin and employing a conventionally used finishing solution (gum solution) in the finishing bath is provided. By constructing as described above, the processing solution can be applied to an automatic development processor conventionally used so that the facilities can be effectively employed.</p><p id="p0360" num="0360">Since a rubbing member is ordinarily indispensable for the development processing, the rubbing member, for example, a brush is provided in the developing bath for removing the non-image area of the photosensitive layer.</p><p id="p0361" num="0361">The processing solution for use in the invention can remarkably reduce the load against the rubbing member, for example, a brush. In case of using a developer of a low alkaline to acidic region, the non-image area is ordinarily not removed without conducting development under strong rubbing conditions for removing the non-image area of the photosensitive layer. On the contrary, the processing solution for use in the invention enables to conduct development using a rubbing member comparable with the rubbing member used in a conventional alkali development and under rubbing conditions (rotation number, brush pressure) similar to the rubbing conditions used in a conventional alkali development.</p><p id="p0362" num="0362">Needless to say, gum coaters or automatic development processors known for conventional PS plates or CTP plates can be used in the system according to the invention.

gumming step using an automatic development processor (LP-850P2, produced by Fuji Film Co., Ltd.) to conduct water washing and gumming.</p><p id="p0395" num="0395">In Example 14, the plate surface exposure amount was changed to 0.2 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> and the development processing was performed according to Development Processing 1 except for eliminating the pre-heat.</p><p id="p0396" num="0396">From the results shown in Table 4, it can be seen that while the processing method of a lithographic printing plate precursor according to the invention is characterized by processing with the processing solution containing the specific polymer, when the processing<!-- EPO <DP n="151"> --> solution not containing the specific polymer is used as shown in Comparative Example 1, the printing stain occurs. In Comparative Example 1, the reflection density of the non-image area is an equivalent level to that of the aluminum support. However, the fact of the matter is that when a certain amount or more of the photosensitive layer component is dissolved in the processing solution as in the fatigued solution, readsorption of the binder component on the surface of support from the processing solution occurs simultaneously with removal of the photosensitive layer by the development Thus, since only the binder component adsorbs on the surface of support without the pigment component, the printing stain occurs even when the reflection density of the non-image area is an equivalent level to that of the support.</p><p id="p0397" num="0397">On the contrary, it is apparent that in Example 1, the printing stain in the processing with the fatigued solution is improved in the acceptable level by adding the specific polymer to the processing solution. Further, in Example 2 wherein the amount of the specific polymer is increased, the greater effect is obtained and the printing stain is not recognized even just after the initiation of printing. This is because that the readsorption of the binder component on the surface of support in the processing with the fatigued solution is prevented.</p><p id="p0398" num="0398">It can be seen as shown in Example 3 that the good results are similarly obtained when the amount or kind of the specific polymer is changed. It is also understood as shown in Examples 12 and 13 that the good results are similarly obtained when the component of the photosensitive layer or the support is changed.</p><p id="p0399" num="0399">On the contrary, when a polymer other than the specific polymer is used, the desired results can not be obtained as shown in Comparative Example 2. Further, when the specific polymer having the enlarged molecular weight is used, the viscosity of the processing solution increases and roller slip in the automatic processor or increase in the amount of processing solution taken out may arise as shown in Comparative Example 3. From these results, it can be understood that the processing solution containing the specific polymer according to the invention attains the processing of a lithographic printing plate precursor which is excellent in the developing property and does not cause the printing stain.</p><p id="p0400" num="0400">As shown in Examples 9 and 11 the good results are also obtained even when the aqueous solution which does not contain the water-soluble resin is used.</p><p id="p0401" num="0401">As shown in Example 10, the good printed materials are obtained without the occurrence of printing stain in the processing with the fatigued solution even when the horizontal transportation system is used.<!-- EPO <DP n="152"> --></p><p id="p0402" num="0402">Furthermore, as shown in Example 14, the good results are obtained in the case where the image drawing is conducted with the high exposure amount and the pre-heating is eliminated.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980352" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="155"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Verarbeitungslösung für die Herstellung einer Lithografiedruckplatte zum Durchführen einer Entwicklungsverarbeitung nach dem bildweisen Belichten eines Lithografiedruckplattenvorläufers, umfassend einen Träger, bei dem auf einer Oberfläche hiervon mindestens eines von einer Hydrophilisierungsbehandlung und einer Unterzugsschicht bereitgestellt worden ist, und eine Bildaufzeichnungsschicht, um einen belichteten Bereich der Bildaufzeichnungsschicht zu härten, welche eine wässrige Lösung mit einem pH-Wert von 3 bis 7 ist und ein Tensid als ein Entwicklungsmittel und ein erstes Polymer umfasst, das ein gewichtsgemitteltes Molekulargewicht von 1.000 bis 100.000 aufweist und ein Stickstoffatom umfasst, worin das erste Polymer eine Ammoniumgruppe als Stickstoffatom umfasst.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0002" num="0002"><claim-text>Verarbeitungslösung zur Herstellung einer Lithografiedruckplatte gemäß Anspruch 1, die eine wasserlösliche Polymerverbindung und mindestens eine Komponente, ausgewählt aus einem Phosphat und einer Phosphorsäure, umfasst.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0003" num="0003"><claim-text>Verarbeitungslösung zur Herstellung einer Lithografiedruckplatte gemäß Anspruch 1 oder 2, worin der Gehalt des Stickstoffs in dem ersten Polymer von 0,01 bis 40 Gew.% beträgt.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0004" num="0004"><claim-text>Verarbeitungslösung zur Herstellung einer Lithografiedruckplatte gemäß irgendeinem der Ansprüche 1<!-- EPO <DP n="156"> --> bis 3, worin die Menge des ersten Polymers in der Verarbeitungslösung von 0,5 bis 4 Gew.% beträgt.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0005" num="0005"><claim-text>Verarbeitungsverfahren für einen Lithografiedruckplattenvorläufer, umfassend:
