lasers are becoming well-known. A core of an optical fibre is doped with a rare earth element to become an active gain medium and pump radiation is applied via a cladding layer. The pump radiation is normally produced by a plurality of semiconductor laser diodes, and a means is provided for coupling their output into the cladding of the rare earth doped fibre. Bragg gratings formed in the core of the optical fibre may be employed as mirrors to form a laser cavity.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Some pump diodes are sensitive to optical feedback from the laser and can be damaged, particularly if the laser is operating in a pulsed mode. In general, the amount of feedback experienced by the pump diodes depends upon the means of coupling between the pump diodes and the cladding pumped fibre. This invention is a cladding pumped fibre laser structure that has improved confinement of the laser signal to the core region and a lower level of optical feedback to the pump diodes. The invention makes the laser more robust and reliable than previous fibre laser designs.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The main features of previous cladding-pumped fibre laser designs are a multi-clad optical fibre having a rare-earth-doped core, a pump source which is usually a semiconductor laser diode, a means of coupling the pump radiation into the cladding of the multi-clad fibre, and a means of coupling a laser signal into or out of the core of the fibre. As used in the following summary, detailed description, and appended claims the words "pump and signal multiplexing", "de-multiplexing" and the like generally refer to methods of coupling pump radiation into or out of a cladding layer of the multi-clad fibre and coupling signal radiation into or out of the core of the multi-clad fibre will henceforth be referred to as "pump and signal multiplexing" and it is to be understood that this term might be applied to a device which is "de-multiplexing" one or a plurality of the beams.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">One feature that differentiates previous cladding pumped fibre lasers from each other is the means of pump and signal multiplexing.

These fibres typically have a core doped with a rare earth element such as ytterbium, erbium, neodymium, or thulium and at least two cladding layers surrounding the core having successively decreasing refractive indices. These fibres are referred to as double-clad: see for example <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="US04829529A"><text>US04829529 (1987</text></patcit>), <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="US4815079A"><text>US 4,815,079 (1989 Polaroid</text></patcit>). The first cladding layer functions both as a cladding for the core waveguide and as the core of a larger multimode waveguide concentric with the core which guides pump radiation. The second cladding serves as a cladding for the first cladding waveguide. Rare earth doped multi-clad fibres having more than two cladding layers with successively decreasing refractive index are also known, for example <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="US20020191928A1"><text>US2002/0191928-A1 (Jun 2001</text></patcit>). These are sometimes known as triple-clad, quadruple-clad etcetera. Multi-clad optical fibres are also known for other applications such as high power laser beam delivery <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="US4974932A"><text>US 4,974,932 (1990</text></patcit>), <patcit id="pcit0014" dnum="GB2379279A"><text>GB2379279 A (2001</text></patcit>), or single-mode optical fibres with special dispersion properties used in optical telecommunications <patcit id="pcit0015" dnum="JP2001051147B"><text>JP2001051147 (2001</text></patcit>) or attenuation properties <patcit id="pcit0016" dnum="EP0783117A2"><text>EP0783117 A2 (1997</text></patcit>).<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A recent development in multi-clad optical fibre design is known as large mode area fibre (LMA). An early example of such a fibre was demonstrated by <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Taverner et al, "158-µJ pulses from a single-transverse-mode large-mode-area erbium-doped fibre amplifier", Optics Letters, 1997, Vol. 22, No. 6, pp. 378-380</text></nplcit>. The principal features of large mode area fibres are increased core diameter and reduced core numerical aperture compared to standard single-mode fibres. One advantage of such fibres is higher power handling due to the larger core and correspondingly smaller power density. Such fibres have become commercially available in the last five years or so and current embodiments are sometimes truly single mode and sometimes support multiple modes in the core. As an example, one commercially available fibre has a core diameter of 20 microns and a core numerical aperture of less than 0.07. It is sometimes desirable to construct a laser out of multi-mode LMA fibre that emits light only in the fundamental mode, see for example "<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Efficient laser operation with nearly diffraction-limited output from a diode-pumped heavily Nd-doped multimode fibre", Optics Letters, 1996, Vol. 21, No. 4, pp. 266-268</text></nplcit>. A known technique for suppressing laser oscillation in the high order modes is to coil the fibre at a specific bend radius as demonstrated by <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Zawischa et. al. "All-solid-state neodymium-based single-frequency master-oscillator fiber power-amplifier system emitting 5.5W of radiation at 1064nm", Optics Letters, 1999, Vol. 24, No. 7, pp. 469-471</text></nplcit>.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A drawback of some previous fibre laser designs is the susceptibility of the semiconductor pump lasers to damage caused by radiation that enters the pump laser diode cavity. This problem is exacerbated when the laser operates in a pulsed mode, and the peak output power of the laser is much higher than the average. A mechanism for pump diode damage is feedback of stray signal radiation back to the pump diodes; a relatively small fraction of such stray radiation may cause spurious diode outputs or damage the diodes. Stray signal light may occur at splice points and due to macro-bending loss if one or more of the fibres is coiled. Macro-bending loss is typically more significant in LMA fibres due to their increased bend sensitivity.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">There is a need to improve the reliability of high power, diode pumped lasers and<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> amplifiers.

Such problems may be diode damage or spurious outputs from a pump diode that affect system performance and stability.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to the invention there is provided an optical fibre amplifier system, comprising: one or more multimode pump laser diodes, a multiplexor for a laser signal and pumping radiation, a rare-earth-doped multi-clad optical fibre having at least two cladding layers, and characterised by a passive multi-clad optical fibre having at least three cladding layers, one of the layers being an intermediate cladding layer, the passive multi-clad optical fibre being provided in line in a signal path for the laser signal between the multiplexor and rare earth doped multi-clad optical fibre; and means for capturing a fraction of stray signal light originating within the optical fibre amplifier system by said at least one intermediate cladding layer of the passive multi-clad fibre and guiding this out of the optical fibre amplifier through the multiplexor resulting in a reduction in the amount of stray signal light impinging upon the pump laser diodes system is provided. The amplifier system further includes at least one laser diode to pump the amplifier. Stray radiation originates within the device. The stray radiation may be emitted at or near an interface between surfaces, caused by partial reflection at a curved surface, or from other interactions. The amplifier system includes a waveguide having at least three claddings that confines and guides at least a portion of the stray radiation and causes the radiation to exit the amplifier system along a path that avoids impingement upon the at least one diode. The fraction of stray radiation that impinges the at least one laser diode is thereby reduced and improves the reliability of the system.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">An aspect of the invention is to confine the stray signal light to the core region and guide it out of the fibre laser structure without allowing it to impinge on the pump diodes.

Typically the gain block has two ends; the signal is coupled into the gain block via an optical fibre input at the first end, port 1, and the amplified signal exits the gain block via another optical fibre at the second end, port 2; the pumping radiation may be coupled into the gain block from one or both ends via optical fibre inputs, ports 3 and 4. The gain block may operate bi-directionally with signals propagating in both directions through the device simultaneously or with external signal feedback to form a laser.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> shows a block diagram illustrating the main elements of the gain block. These are the multiplexer, the gain fibre, and the de-multiplexer. Sections of passive optical fibre, known as <i>"relay fibre"</i>, connect the multiplexer and de-multiplexer to the gain fibre. The gain fibre provides a gain medium operates as a laser amplifier. It is a rare earth doped optical fibre that absorbs the pumping radiation and provides optical gain to the signal. The purpose of the multiplexer is to couple the input signal and the forward-traveling pump from ports 1 and 4 into the relay fibre, port 6. The purpose of the de-multiplexer is to couple the backward-traveling pump radiation from port 3 into the relay fibre, port 5, and to couple the amplified forward-traveling signal out of the relay fibre from port 5 to port 2. When the signal propagates in the opposite direction through the device, the roles of multiplexer and de-multiplexer are reversed. A multiplexer may simultaneously multiplex and demultiplex when signals propagate in both directions. For brevity, the process of coupling pump radiation into or out of a cladding layer of the multi-clad fibre and coupling signal radiation into or out of the core of the multi-clad fibre will henceforth be referred to as "pump and signal multiplexing" and it is to be understood that this term might be applied<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> to a device which is "de-multiplexing" one or more of the beams.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> (not to scale) shows several details of an exemplary gain block that illustrates the problem of pump diode damage due to stray signal light. The main elements: multiplexer, gain fibre, demultiplexer, are labeled above the figure. A typical mechanism for diode damage is that a small fraction of the laser signal escapes from the core of the optical fibre into the cladding at a splice point (a join between two fibres). This stray light then propagates back to the pump diodes via the cladding. The device comprises a plurality of semiconductor pump laser diodes 301, a length of rare-earth-doped double-clad optical fibre 302 that might be a few metres or tens of metres in length, two lengths of passive double-clad relay fibre 303 each of which might be several metres long, two un-doped signal feed-through fibres 304, and a plurality of multimode pump delivery fibres 305 arranged in a bundle around the signal feed-through fibre as illustrated by section A-A.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The fibres are joined together by splicing, a thermal process, to form a monolithic glass structure.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The operating principle of the gain block is illustrated by the rays in the diagram. A ray of pump laser light 306 is coupled into the core 307 of one of the multimode pump fibres. The pump fibre has a tapered section 308 and the tapered end is joined to the first cladding 309 of one of the relay fibres in such a way that the output of the tapered pump fibre couples into said first cladding and is guided by total internal reflection at the interface with the second cladding 310. The pump light is transmitted through the relay fibre to the first cladding 311 of the rare earth doped double clad fibre and absorbed by the rare earth doped core 312. The absorption of the pump laser light by the rare earth doped ions in the core excites them to a higher atomic energy level creating a population inversion which forms the basis for light amplification. A laser signal 313 propagates in the core of the rare earth doped fibre and is amplified by the excited rare earth ions. The laser signal is guided into or out of the core of the rare earth doped fibre via the cores of the relay fibres 314 and the signal feed-through fibres 315.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The structure shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> is operating as an amplifier.

The refractive index n is plotted as a function of radial distance in microns from the fibre axis. The waveguide aspects of an optical fibre structure are characterised by the refractive index and geometry. In this idealized example, the fibre consists of three regions: a core 501 having a refractive index n<sub>1</sub>, a first cladding 502 having a refractive index n<sub>2</sub>, and a second cladding 503 having a refractive index n<sub>3</sub>. By way of example, the core diameter might be 5 microns, the first cladding diameter 200 microns and the second cladding diameter 300 microns.

<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> -->where n<sub>1</sub> is the refractive index of the core and n<sub>2</sub> is the refractive index of the cladding, λ is the free space wavelength of the light that is being guided, and <i>a</i> is the radius of the core. The numerical aperture is closely related to the maximum ray angle in the core that will be totally internally reflected at the core cladding interface. Typically, a higher NA will guide steeper ray angles. There is also a connection between the fibre parameter V and the number of transverse radiation modes guided by the core. Higher V values correspond to a larger number of guided modes, and at V value of less than 2.405 just one transverse mode is guided by the core. In this case the fibre is known as "single-mode". Fibres supporting more than one transverse mode are known as "multi-mode". The numerical aperture of the core waveguide in the above example prior art laser is 0.12 and the numerical aperture of the pump waveguide is 0.46. Referring to equation 2 it can be inferred that the rare earth doped core is single moded and the pump waveguide defined by the first and second cladding layers is multi-moded.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In some embodiments, the core size may be preferably between 10 and 50 µm. The core NA may preferably be between about 0.6 and 0.10. The first cladding may have a diameter between 50 µm and 200 µm and a NA of 0.1 to 0.12, The third cladding may have a diameter of between 200 and 1,000 µm and a NA of 0.40 and 0.46.

The values are illustrative only and non-limiting.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Stray radiation may originate at various locations within the system.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Referring to the example of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, four splice points are shown between the pump fibres marked 316, 317, 318, and 319. In general, a fraction of the signal light may escape from the core at a splice point due to the inevitable discontinuity at the join. For the purpose of illustration, a ray of signal light 320 is shown escaping from the core at splice point 318. The angle of the ray is exaggerated for clarity. This stray signal ray may propagate in the first cladding of the double clad fibres and eventually propagate back to a pump laser diode via one of the multimode pump fibres. If the power of the signal is<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> sufficiently high, it may damage the pump laser causing it to fail.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Another mechanism that causes stray signal radiation is macro-bending loss from the core. <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref> illustrates this process. A laser signal 701 propagates in the core 702 of a multi-clad optical fibre 703. This fibre is coiled at a bend radius such that the light in the core experiences a macro-bending loss. This causes a fraction of the light in the core to escape into the cladding and is illustrated by the ray 704, although in reality the power will be shed from the core in a distributed fashion along its length. An implication of this approach is that even in the absence of splices, stray light may escape into the cladding due to bending and damage the pump diodes as previously described.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8</figref> shows one embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">8</figref> show several common features. Some of the parts are common to the laser shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> and are described in the earlier discussion surrounding that figure. The operating principle of the laser of <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8</figref> is therefore also broadly similar to the laser of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>. However, a feature of the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8</figref> <i>is</i> an additional cladding layer 801 running through the doped, relay, and feed-through fibres. One purpose of this additional cladding layer is to confine stray signal light to a region around the core and prevent it from propagating back to the pump diodes.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 9</figref> shows the refractive index profile of such a fibre. It has four distinct regions: the core 901, a first cladding (sometimes referred to as a "pedestal") 902, a second cladding 903, and a third cladding layer 904. By way of an example, the diameters of these regions might be are 20, 100, 400, and 500 microns respectively. The refractive indices of these regions are denoted n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, n<sub>3</sub>, and n<sub>4</sub> respectively and the refractive index decreases successively from layer to layer from the centre of the fibre. The core has a numerical aperture NA<sub>core</sub> defined by n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub>. The first cladding has a numerical aperture NA<sub>clad1</sub> defined by n<sub>2</sub> and n<sub>3</sub> and the second cladding has a numerical aperture NA<sub>clad2</sub> defined by n<sub>3</sub> and n<sub>4</sub>. The core, first and second cladding layers are of glass construction and the third<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> cladding layer consists of a low refractive index polymer. By way of example, values of the numerical apertures might be: NA<sub>core</sub> = 0.07, NA<sub>clad1</sub> = 0.1. NA <sub>clad2</sub> = 0.46. By way of example, the cross-section of the second cladding layer might be shaped in some way, for example octagonal, although this is not essential for the operation of a cladding-pumped fibre laser.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Referring again to <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8</figref>, the passive relay fibre 803 has a similar refractive index profile to the doped optical fibre, consisting of a core and three cladding layers as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 9</figref>. It is normally circular in cross-section. The diameters of the core, first, second, and third claddings and the corresponding refractive indices of these four regions might be the same or similar to those of the corresponding regions in the doped fibre shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 9</figref>.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The refractive index profile of the signal feed-through fibre is shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Figure 10</figref>. It has a core 1001, a first cladding 1002, a second cladding 1003, and (outside the multiplexer) a third cladding 1004. The core, first, and second claddings are of glass construction and the third cladding is a low refractive index polymer. Inside the multiplexer the third cladding is removed prior to assembly of the device since the feed-through and pump fibres are subjected to high temperatures during fusion that a polymer would not withstand. The dimensions of the core, and first cladding layers and the refractive indices of the core, first, and second cladding layers are broadly similar to those of the relay and doped fibres. The second cladding layer is typically smaller in diameter, for example 200 microns.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The operation of the laser is further illustrated by <figref idrefs="f0008">Figures 8</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0011">11</figref>. The two main sources of stray signal that were identified previously are the splice points and macro-bending loss. The role of the first cladding layer is to capture and guide the stray signal light and confine it to the core region. The continuation of this layer through the doped, relay, and feed-through fibre provides a path for guiding the stray signal out of the laser without damaging the pump laser diodes. <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8</figref> shows a stray ray of signal light 813<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> escaping from the core at splice point 812. This ray is totally internally reflected at the boundary between the first and second cladding layers 814 and subsequently guided out of the laser in the first cladding. <figref idrefs="f0011">Figure 11</figref> shows a bent section of multi-clad optical fibre. A signal 1101 propagates in the core 1102 of the fibre. A ray of signal light 1103 is shown coupling out of the core at point 1104 and totally internally reflecting at the boundary between the first and second cladding layers 1105. The ray is subsequently guided in the first cladding layer out of the laser structure through the relay fibre and the feed-through fibre as described above. In a real situation, the light that couples out of a bent fibre does so in a distributed fashion along the length of the fibre not at a single point as shown in <figref idrefs="f0011">Figure 11</figref>. However, the mechanism of capturing and guiding the stray light in the first cladding is the same.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">There are a number of constraints on the refractive index structure. It was previously stated that n<sub>1</sub> &gt; n<sub>2</sub> &gt; n<sub>3</sub> &gt; n<sub>4</sub>. Furthermore, it is preferable that the first cladding should have a numerical aperture equal to and ideally greater than that of the core (NA<sub>clad1</sub> ≥ NA<sub>core</sub>) if it is to guide stray light from a splice point. However, this constraint is not strong enough to get the full benefit of the first cladding waveguide. Specifically, when light is coupled into a bent multimode waveguide, the rays that propagate on the outside of the bend are incident on the core cladding interface at a higher angle than the angle at which they were launched due to the curvature of the waveguide. This is illustrated by <figref idrefs="f0012">Figure 12</figref>. A ray 1201 is shown being launched into the core of a bent multimode waveguide at an angle <i>α</i> to the axis. This multimode waveguide represents the pedestal in the fibre laser; the core of the pedestal waveguide is taken to have a refractive index n<sub>2</sub>; the cladding is taken to have refractive index n<sub>3</sub>; the diameter of the pedestal is r; the radius of curvature is R. Due to the curvature, the ray angle <i>γ</i> at the point where the ray is incident upon the core-cladding boundary is generally not equal to <i>α</i>. In one limiting case, where the ray propagates towards the outside of the curve <i>γ</i> may be significantly larger than α. It can be shown using a geometrical argument that for this case: <maths id="math0003" num="(3)"><math display="block"><mi>γ</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mi>π</mi><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mo>-</mo><msup><mi>Sin</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo>⁢</mo><mfenced separators=""><mfrac><mi>R</mi><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>⋅</mo><mi>Sin</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mfenced separators=""><mfrac><mi>π</mi><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mi>α</mi></mfenced></mfenced></math><img id="ib0003" file="imgb0003.tif" wi="95" he="19" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Equation (3) is plotted in <figref idrefs="f0013">Figure 13</figref>.

However, partial benefit of the inventive concept may be achieved with a slightly lower <i>NA</i><sub><i>clad</i>1</sub> than is theoretically optimal.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Another aspect of the invention is the relationship between the pump light and the pedestal waveguide. It is considered undesirable for the pedestal waveguide to capture and guide any of the pump radiation launched into the end of the multi-clad fibres. This is because of the effect of skew rays. In a multimode waveguide with circular cross-section, pump light in skew modes can propagate through the waveguide in a spiral path without intersecting the core and is therefore only weakly absorbed. This lower rate of pump absorption may reduce the efficiency of the laser. One solution is to use a non-circular cladding in the pump waveguide, which scatters the skew rays into modes that do intersect<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> the core. However, light guided by the pedestal will not strike the polygonal cladding of the pump waveguide and will not be scattered. The extension of the pedestal through the un-doped multi-clad fibre and the feed-through fibre in this invention prevents the pedestal from capturing pump light launched from the multimode pump fibres since light will not couple into the pedestal from the side and be guided by it. In this way the invention avoids the problem of pump guiding by the pedestal.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In practical situations it is recognised that there will be tolerances on the dimensions of the fibres and the cladding layers within the fibres. There will also be tolerances on the refractive indices of these layers. The embodiments described here assume that it is generally not possible to exactly the geometry and refractive indices of the pedestals in different fibres.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>Embodiment as an amplifier</b></heading><p id="p0042" num="0042">One application of practical interest is the use of the inventive structure as a uni-directional amplifier. Optical fibre amplifiers may be constructed with a wide range of operating parameters. By way of example the output power may range from a few Watts to thousands of Watts average power. The laser signal used an input to the amplifier may be pulsed or CW. In the pulsed case, the pulse width may range from seconds down to tens of femtoseconds and the repetition rate from a few Hz to GHz.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">When operating such an amplifier, a laser signal 1401 is coupled into the core of the structure from one side (the left in <figref idrefs="f0014">Figure 14</figref>) and an amplified signal is output from the other side (the right in <figref idrefs="f0014">Figure 14</figref>). It may be that the laser signal travelling in the reverse direction is very much smaller than the forward-travelling signal. In this case, the maximum pump protection may be achieved by successively increasing the pedestal diameter from the doped fibre 1402 to the relay fibre 1403 and into the feed-through fibre 1404 on the output side of the amplifier. This step up has the effect of increasing the pump isolation because the coupling efficiency between two multi-mode waveguides with slightly different diameters is directional, and higher when the power flows from the smaller to the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> larger waveguide. This may be preferable to specifying the pedestal parameters as identical when in practise they may be slightly smaller or larger within the specified tolerances. In an analogous way, the numerical aperture of the pedestal in the doped fibre, the un-doped multi-clad and the feed-through fibres may also be specified as increasing towards the output to achieve the maximum pump isolation when there is a tolerance on the refractive indices of the manufactured fibres. Other variations along similar lines are also possible.</p><heading id="h0006"><b>Embodiment as a laser</b></heading><p id="p0044" num="0044">When operating the structure as a laser with feed-back from Bragg grating reflectors as shown in <figref idrefs="f0015">Figure 15</figref>, it may be desirable to increase the pedestal diameter and numerical aperture in both directions away from the central rare earth doped fibre.

The optimisation of the diameters and numerical apertures depends on the precise operating mode of the laser, the reflectivity of the Bragg reflectors and the losses in the pump combiners.</p><heading id="h0007"><b>Using a Cladding Layer of the Pump fibres as a Second Cladding of Feedthrough</b></heading><p id="p0045" num="0045">In another embodiment, a cladding layer of the tapered pump fibres may also act as the second cladding layer of the feed-through fibre.
