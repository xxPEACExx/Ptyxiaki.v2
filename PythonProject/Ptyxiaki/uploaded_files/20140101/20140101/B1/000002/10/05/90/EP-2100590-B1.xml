More particularly, the present invention relates to oral hygiene compositions, particularly dentifrice compositions, which contain microcrystalline cellulose which is surface-treated with a water-soluble substance and display excellent shape retention and dispersibility in the oral cavity.</p><heading id="h0003">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">It is required for a dentifrice composition to have not only utility as an auxiliary cleaning agent for a toothbrush, but also utility as a preparation for oral cavity health, to have positive effects of prevention/treatment of diseases in the oral cavity, prevention of malodor of the oral cavity and whitening exerted by blending ingredients having various actions. However, even if such ingredients having various actions are blended, the utilities are not sufficiently exerted unless the ingredients are immediately dispersed throughout the oral cavity when the dentifrice composition is applied to the oral cavity, and thus the object cannot be<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> achieved.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In general, the dosage form of a composition suited to disperse such ingredients throughout the oral cavity is a liquid oral hygiene composition. However, a liquid oral hygiene composition entails the problem that it is difficult to physically remove dental plaques and stains since an abrasive is not usually blended.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In contrast, a toothpaste can be easily blended with an abrasive to form a formulation suited to physically remove dental plaques and stains when used together with a toothbrush (<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004010576A"><text>JP-A No. 2004-10576</text></patcit>). However, since a large amount of a thickener is blended so as to prevent solid-liquid separation of the abrasive, and the resultant toothpaste has comparatively high viscosity, a level of brushing time is required so as to disperse the blended ingredients throughout the oral cavity.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Therefore, there is a problem that the expected action of the blended ingredients is not sufficiently exerted when the brushing time by users of the toothpaste is short, or the brushing technique is poor. Since most dentifrice ingredients are washed away after cleaning, it is desirable that pharmacologically active ingredients acting on biotissues are immediately dispersed throughout the oral cavity when the toothpaste is used so as to make the contact<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> time with the target tissues as long as possible. In order to stably place a dentifrice on a toothbrush and use it in a preferred manner, it is required to have high shape retention and low stringiness, which conflict with high dispersibility.<br/>
Therefore, there is a need for a dentifrice composition which is blended with an abrasive, particularly a dentifrice composition in which various ingredients are immediately dispersed throughout the oral cavity after the dentifrice composition is applied while maintaining physical properties such as high shape retention and low stringiness, allowing for sufficient realization of their action.<br/>
It is usually considered that the amount of a thickener blended is decreased to form a composition having low viscosity so as to prepare a composition having high dispersibility. However, a composition having low viscosity has a problem that ingredients such as an abrasive become sedimented thereby causing deterioration of stability of the composition and sinking between bristles when placed on a toothbrush, and also spinning occurs and thus a feeling for use deteriorates.<br/>

The feature according to aforementioned [8] of the present application can provide an oral hygiene composition which can always eject a given amount of the composition without varying the amount depending on individuals, and also can exert the expected effects of the composition since the composition is applied by ejecting onto a toothbrush from a pump container.</p><heading id="h0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">Microcrystalline cellulose which is surface-treated with a water-soluble substance (hereinafter may be referred to as "surface-treated microcrystalline cellulose") to be used in the oral hygiene composition of the present invention is originally treated by coating the surface of microcrystalline cellulose having low affinity with water with a water-soluble substance, so that the microcrystalline cellulose is dispersed in a colloidal form in water by<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> stirring in water as a result of swelling and dissolution of the water-soluble substance, although microcrystalline cellulose by itself is precipitated in water. Surface-treated microcrystalline cellulose can be produced, for example, by hydrolysing a high-purity pulp to extract crystalline regions and wet-mixing with the water-soluble substance, followed by drying, and usually has a granular form.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Microcrystalline cellulose of surface-treated microcrystalline cellulose is produced by extracting crystalline regions of cellulose which is obtained by acid hydrolysis or alkali hydrolysis of pulp fibers of plants, followed by purification. When surface-treated microcrystalline cellulose is dispersed in water, the average particle diameter thereof is within a range from 1 to 50 µm, preferably from 1 to 12 µm, and more preferably from 3 to 10 µm.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The water-soluble substance to be used in the surface treatment of the microcrystalline cellulose is sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, used alone or in combination of two or more. Other water-soluble substances are polymers and sugar alcohols, for example, cellulose derivatives such as hydroxyethylcellulose; microbiological polymers such as xanthan gum, natural polymers such as Sterculia urens gum, dextrin and carrageenan, and sugar alcohols such as sorbitol,<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> xylitol, erythritol and isomalt.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The ratio of microcrystalline cellulose and the water-soluble substance (sodium carboxymethyl cellulose) constituting surface-treated microcrystalline cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose:water-soluble substance (total amount of one or more), is within a range from 4:1 to 15:1 (weight ratio), preferably from 5:1 to 15:1. When the ratio of microcrystalline cellulose is more than the above range, dispersion of microcrystalline cellulose becomes insufficient when contacted with water, resulting in low shape retention. In contrast, when the ratio of microcrystalline cellulose is less than the above range, viscosity increases and it becomes impossible to provide an oral hygiene composition having high dispersibility.<br/>
As surface-treated microcrystalline cellulose, for example, those with various grades such as Ceolus<sup>®</sup> RC series (average particle diameter: 8 to 10 µm) and SC series (average particle diameter: 7 to 9 µm) commercially available from Asahi Kasei Chemicals Corporation, etc. can be used. Also, Avicel<sup>®</sup> RC series, CL series and SG series, commercially available from FMC Corporation and Neocel<sup>®</sup> commercially available from Mingtai Chemical Co., Ltd. can be<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> used.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The amount of surface-treated microcrystalline cellulose to be blended in the oral hygiene composition of the present invention is within a range from 0.5 to 10% by weight, preferably from 1 to 8% by weight, and more preferably from 3 to 7% by weight, based on the total amount of the composition. When the amount of surface-treated microcrystalline cellulose is less than 0.5% by weight, since it becomes impossible to impart favorable shape retention to the oral hygiene composition, it becomes difficult to determine an appropriate use amount as a result of sinking when it is placed on a toothbrush, and also dispersion in the oral cavity is delayed. In contrast, when the amount of surface-treated microcrystalline cellulose is more than 10% by weight, viscosity of the oral hygiene composition increases and dispersibility in the oral cavity deteriorates.<br/>
It is also possible to use two or more kinds of surface-treated microcrystalline cellulose in combination, each having a different raw material ingredient or composition.<br/>
Viscosity at 20°C of a 1 wt% aqueous solution of the surface-treated microcrystalline cellulose is usually within a range from 5 to 100 mPa·s when measured at a rotating speed of 20 rpm/min. using a Brookfield rotary viscometer and a rotor No. 1.<br/>
Usually, the average particle diameter after dispersion<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> of surface-treated microcrystalline cellulose is preferably within a range from 3 to 10 µm when measured by a laser diffraction/scattering type particle size distribution analyzer.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Examples of ingredients which are used in combination with the aforementioned surface-treated microcrystalline cellulose in the oral hygiene composition of the present invention, and are favorably dispersed throughout the oral cavity, include pharmacologically active ingredients, abrasives, surfactants, flavors, sweeteners, etc. When these ingredients can be favorably dispersed throughout the oral cavity, it is possible to exert the action of these ingredients at more sites for a longer time.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Among these ingredients, examples of the pharmacologically active ingredient include cationic antimicrobial agents, for example, quaternary ammonium salts such as cetylpyridinium chloride, benzethonium chloride, Distearyldimonium chloride, Stearalkonium chloride, Steartrimonium chloride, Steartrimonium chloride, laurylpyridinium chloride, etc., and biguanide-type antimicrobial agents such as chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, chlorhexidine acetate, chlorhexidine digluconate, alexidine hydrochloride, alexidine acetate, alexidine gluconate, etc.; anionic antimicrobial agents such as sodium n-lauroyl sarcosinate; nonionic antimicrobial agents such as triclosan,<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> O-cymen-5-ol, etc.; enzymes such as dextranase, amylase, mutanase, lysozyme, lytic enzyme, protease, etc.; zinc compounds such as zinc oxide, zinc chloride, etc.; vitamin A such as retinol, vitamin B2 such as riboflavin, vitamin B6 such as pyridoxine, and vitamin B12 such as cyanocobalamin; vitamin E derivatives such as tocopheryl acetate, tocopheryl nicotinate, tocopheryl succinate, etc.; fluoride compounds such as sodium monofluorophosphate, potassium monofluorophosphate, sodium fluoride, potassium fluoride, ammonium fluoride, stannous fluoride, etc.; amino acids, collagens, 6-aminocaproic acid, allantoin and derivatives thereof, dihydrocholesterol, glycyrrhizates, glycyrrhetinic acid, glycerophosphate, chlorophyll, potassium nitrate, sodium chloride, etc. These pharmacologically active ingredients can be used alone or in combination of two or more, and the amount thereof is an amount which is usually considered that each pharmacologically active ingredient exerts the objective pharmacological effect.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Examples of the abrasive include abrasive silicas such as abrasive precipitated silica, abrasive gel silica, etc., dicalcium phosphate dihydrate and anhydrous, calcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, calcium pyrophosphate, calcium silicate, aluminum hydroxide, alumina, aluminum silicate, pumice, insoluble sodium metaphosphate, trimagnesium phosphate, magnesium carbonate, calcium sulfate, poly(methyl methacrylate), bentonite, zirconium silicate,<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> hydroxyapatite, synthetic resins, etc. Among these abrasives, abrasive silica, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate and anhydrous, calcium carbonate, calcium pyrophosphate, aluminum hydroxide, alumina and hydroxyapatite are preferred, abrasive silica, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate and anhydrous, and alumina are more preferred, and abrasive silica is most preferred. These abrasives can be used alone or in combination of two or more, and the amount thereof is usually within a range from 4 to 40% by weight based on the total amount of the oral hygiene composition.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Examples of the surfactant include higher alkyl sulfate salts having alkyl groups including 8 to 18 carbon atoms, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium myristyl sulfate, etc.;

As long as the effects of the present invention are not deteriorated, the oral hygiene composition can be formulated into forms such as dentifrice including toothpaste, gel, paste for oral cavity, cream, etc., and can be filled in containers such as tube, pump and squeeze bottle according to the form.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">When the oral hygiene composition of the present invention (particularly toothpaste composition) is used in a<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> pump container, viscosity at 30°C is preferably adjusted within a range from 5 to 20 Pa·s. The dentifrice composition having viscosity within the above range belongs to a dentifrice composition having low viscosity. Although a conventional toothpaste composition has viscosity of more than 20 Pa·s, dispersibility of the active ingredients can be improved by adjusting viscosity within a range of 20 Pa·s or less in the present invention. In an existing dentifrice composition, desirable shape retention cannot be imparted to the dentifrice composition only by decreasing viscosity. However, according to the present invention, dispersibility is improved by blending surface-treated microcrystalline cellulose while accomplishing shape retention in a low viscosity region. However, when viscosity is less than 5 Pa·s, sufficient shape retention cannot be obtained.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As the container for the toothpaste, for example, tube containers such as laminate tubes and aluminium tubes are commonly used. These tube containers have a mechanism in which contents are ejected through a container outlet when a compressive force is applied to the body by users using their hands. However, the used amount varies with each user, or varies with the time even when it is used by the same user. In a dentifrice, particularly a dentifrice containing a pharmacologically active ingredient, it is important that the effective amount of the dentifrice is applied to the oral cavity. However, there is a problem that it is difficult to<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> uniformly adjust the amount of the dentifrice per application in the tube container and therefore problems arise with respect to an insufficient amount being used for brushing when there is a small amount of dentifrice and conversely economy problems caused by use of an amount of dentifrice above the effective amount when there is a large amount of the dentifrice.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">A pump container has an advantage that a uniform amount of the dentifrice is ejected by a single extrusion operation and the above problem such as non-uniform amount per one time can be solved. However, even if the toothpaste is contained in a general-purpose pump container such as a shampoo container, an inconvenience arises in that the pumping portion does not smoothly return the toothpaste, or it becomes impossible to eject it using a pump. Furthermore there is the a problem that a large amount of the toothpaste remains, resulting in poor economy since the toothpaste has adhesion and viscosity and also has characteristics that it contains a large amount of a powder. Therefore, it is not easy to use a pump container as the container for toothpaste compositions at present.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">However, the dentifrice compositions of the present invention can be favorably stored in or ejected from a pump container. A dentifrice composition of the present invention has low viscosity and an appropriate thixotropic nature and<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> is therefore easily ejected by pumping, and also causes neither collapse of the shape nor sag from a toothbrush when it is placed on the toothbrush, and causes less adhesion of a powder due to drying in a pump delivery portion. Also in the pump container, the dentifrice composition is favorably accumulated to a pump suction port and is easily ejected from a pump. In pump containers, there often arise an inconvenience that a suction pressure enables a dentifrice as contents to cause reverse suction of a piston in the pump and the pumping portion does not smoothly return, or an inconvenience that the contents are partially solidified in the container or the pump mechanism and thus it becomes impossible to eject by means of pumping. However, a dentifrice composition of the present invention has low viscosity and favorable slipperiness and is therefore free from these inconveniences.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Although there is no particular limitation on the kind of the pump container, the pump container preferably has a structure comprising at least two layers of an inflexible outer layer and a flexible inner layer in which the inner layer is compressed as contents are ejected, thus preventing air from entering into the content sealed portion (delaminated structure). With such a structure, the contents can be easily ejected by pressing using hands and fingers and a pharmacologically active ingredient can be stably maintained even after sealing since it scarcely comes into<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> contact with the air.<br/>
