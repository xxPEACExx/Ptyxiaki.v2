mxw-id="PDES63957127" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>BACKGROUND</b></heading><heading id="h0002"><b>Field</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to phase locked loops (PLL), and in particular, to a system and method of controlling power consumption in a digital phase locked loop (DPLL).</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Background</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Communication devices typically include a local oscillator (LO) for synchronously transmitting and receiving signals to and from other remote communication devices. Often these signals are sent or received via defined frequency channels. For selecting a particular frequency channel, the frequency of the LO is typically changed in order to properly transmit or receive the signal via the selected channel. Often a phase locked loop (PLL), such as a digital PLL (DPLL), is used to perform the change in the LO frequency.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A typical DPLL includes several digital devices, such as an input accumulator, a low pass filter (LPF) (often referred to as a "loop filter"), a digital controlled oscillator (DCO), a DCO accumulator, a time-to-digital converter (TDC), and other digital devices. Some of these digital devices use a reference clock to perform their intended function. For example, the input accumulator uses the reference clock to generate a signal indicative of the phase and frequency of an input signal to the DPLL. Also, the DCO accumulator and TDC use the reference clock to generate a signal indicative of the phase and frequency of the output signal of the DCO.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The power consumption of such digital devices is generally proportional or directly related to the frequency of the reference clock. Thus, the DPLL consumes more power when the frequency of the reference clock is relatively high, and less power when the frequency of the reference clock is relatively low. Often, communication devices that employ such DPLLs are portable devices that use limited power supplies, such as a battery, to operate on a continuous basis. In order to extend the continuous operation of such communication devices, it is preferred that the devices be operated in a low power mode whenever possible. One way this can be accomplished is by lowering the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> frequency of the reference clock when the communication device does not need to operate in a high performance model.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">One issue with changing the frequency of the reference clock is that it should be done without significantly affecting the loop control of the DPLL. Prior approaches have been developed that allow for changing the frequency of the reference clock without significantly affect the loop control of the DPLL. However, these approaches typically take a substantial amount of time to perform the frequency change and the relocking operation, which in many applications may not be acceptable.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Attention is drawn to document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6121816A"><text>US 6 121 816 A</text></patcit> which relates to a slave clock generation system and method suitable for use with synchronous telecommunications networks generating one or more slave clocks from a selected reference clock using a direct digital synthesis technique. A multiplexer selects a reference clock from a number of available sources, each of which can be at its own spot frequency, based on a predetermined selection order. Toggle detectors monitor each of the available clock sources, and block the selection of any that are not within a specified frequency range. A local oscillator establishes short-term and long-term measurement periods; the cycles of the selected reference clock are counted over consecutive short-term measurement periods to determine the relative frequency of the selected clock with respect to the frequency of the local oscillator. The cycle counts are fed to a phase-to-clock converter, which produces a slave clock output having a frequency that varies with the relative frequency measured for the selected clock.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Further attention is drawn to document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP1467488A"><text>EP 1 467 488 A</text></patcit> which relates to a clock generation circuit generating a clock that is synchronized with a reference signal. This document describes to provide stable clocks by controlling phase jitter in a generated clock upon change of the reference signal, eliminate a stable-state phase difference between the reference signal and the generated clock so that control is eliminated, and allow the clock generation circuit to be integrated. The clock generation circuit is configured with multiple stages of PLL circuits such that PLL circuits 2 are provided for reference signals 1, respectively, and one of outputs from the PLL circuits 2 is selected to be fed to a PLL circuit 5 provided in a next stage. The phase fluctuation of a signal inputted to the PLL circuit 5 upon change of the reference signal 1 is reduced to control the phase jitter of the generated clock 6, thus allowing high loop gain in both the PLL circuit 2 and the PLL circuit 5.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Furthermore attention is drawn to document <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US2007116164A"><text>US 2007116164 A</text></patcit> which relates to a data communications system comprises two clock domains. Each of the clock domains are coupled to receive a source clock signal. The first clock domain includes a first clock signal and the second clock domain includes a second clock signal, each of the first clock signal and the second clock signal are derived from the source clock signal. The first clock signal has a frequency which is different from that of the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> second clock signal, and which is not an integer multiple of the frequency of the second clock signal. The first clock domain includes circuitry which is configured to generate both the first clock signal and a reference clock signal derived from the source clock signal. The first clock domain is further configured to utilize the first clock signal to sample the reference clock signal, and assert an aligned signal responsive to detecting an edge of the reference clock signal, wherein the aligned signal indicates an edge of the first clock signal is aligned with an edge of the second clock signal.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Finally, attention is drawn to document <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6429707B1"><text>US 6 429 707 B1</text></patcit> which relates to a clock output controller using a digital frequency synthesis minimizing the clock output disturbance due to input reference signal switchover. The controller includes a first and a second accumulator where the Most Significant Bit (MSB) of the first accumulator output generates the clock output signal and the MSB of the second accumulator generates a feedback signal. A reset control signal is generated by the transition edge detector/switchover controller and it is coupled to the register block of the second accumulator in order to reset the feedback signal at an appropriate time so as to match the phase of the new reference signal. A hold control signal is also generated to keep the clock output locked on the old reference signal until the feedback signal is locked to the new signal. The hold signal is then reset once locking to the new reference signal is accomplished and the clock output is fully switched over with minimal disturbance.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">In accordance with the present invention, a method of providing an output reference clock, as set forth in claim 1, and an apparatus, as set forth in claim 7, is provided. Further embodiments are claimed in the dependent claims.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">An aspect of the disclosure relates to an apparatus comprising a programmable frequency device adapted to generate a reference clock selected from a set of distinct frequency clocks, wherein the programmable frequency device is further adapted to maintain the same temporal relationship of the triggering edges of the reference clock when switching between distinct frequency clocks. The apparatus further comprises a phase locked loop (PLL), such as a digital PLL (DPLL), that uses the selected reference clock to establish a predetermined phase relationship between an input signal and an output signal. By maintaining substantially the same temporal relationship of the reference clock when switching between distinct frequency clocks, the continual and effective operation of the phase locked loop (PLL) is not significantly disturbed while changing the frequency of the reference clock. This may be used to control the power consumption of the apparatus.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In yet another aspect of the disclosure, the programmable frequency device comprises a source of the distinct frequency clocks, which may comprise a cascaded chain of flip-flops adapted to be driven by a raw reference clock. In yet another aspect, the programmable frequency device comprises a circuit adapted to asynchronously receive an input frequency selection control signal that indicates a selection among the distinct frequency clock for the reference clock, and synchronously generate an output frequency selection control signal that causes the selection of the reference clock at a particular time. In still another aspect, the output frequency selection control signal is generated once a period of one of the distinct frequency clocks, such as the clock having the longest period. In another aspect, the output frequency selection control signal is<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> generated in response to the distinct frequency clocks being at predetermined logic levels, such as all highs or all lows.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Other aspects, advantages and novel features of the present disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description of the disclosure when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an exemplary digital phase locked loop (DPLL) in accordance with an aspect of the disclosure.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of an exemplary programmable frequency device in accordance with another aspect of the disclosure.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a timing diagram of exemplary signals generated within the exemplary programmable frequency device in accordance with another aspect of the disclosure.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an exemplary communication device in accordance with another aspect of the disclosure.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a flow diagram of an exemplary method of controlling power consumption in the exemplary communication device in accordance with another aspect of the disclosure.</p><heading id="h0006"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b></heading><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an exemplary digital phase locked loop (DPLL) 100 in accordance with an aspect of the disclosure. In summary, the DPLL allows for the programmability of the frequency of a reference clock for power consumption purposes without significantly affecting the loop control of the DPLL. The DPLL performs this by ensuring that the timing of the triggering edges of the reference clock does not substantially change as the reference clock frequency is changed. As previously discussed, the DPLL may be placed in a low power mode when the frequency of the reference clock is substantially decreased. Conversely, the DPLL may be placed in a high power mode when the frequency of the reference clock is substantially increased.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In particular, the DPLL comprises a programmable frequency device 102, an input accumulator 104, a first summing device 106, a low pass filter (LPF) or loop filter<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> 108, a digital controlled oscillator (DCO) 110, a time-to-digital converter (TDC) 112, a DCO accumulator 114, a latch 116, a second summing device 118, and a frequency controller 120.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The programmable frequency device 102 receives an raw reference clock REF_IN and generates an output reference clock REFOUT based on input control signals ENABLE and DIVIN &lt;1:0&gt;. The ENABLE signal enables the function of changing the reference clock frequency based on the frequency selection control signals DIVIN_&lt;1:0&gt;. If, for example, the ENABLE signal is deactivated or not-asserted, the programmable frequency device 102 merely passes the raw reference signal REF_IN to its output (e.g., REFOUT ≅ REF_IN). If, on the other hand, the ENABLE signal is activated or asserted, the programmable frequency device 102 generates the output reference clock REFOUT having a frequency related to the frequency the raw reference clock REF_IN and based on the frequency selection control signal DIVIN_&lt;1:0&gt;.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">For example, if DIVIN_&lt;1:0&gt; is 00, the programmable frequency device 102 divides the frequency of the raw reference clock REF_IN by a factor of one (1) to generate the output reference clock REFOUT (e.g., <i>f</i><sub>REFOUT</sub> ≅ <i>f</i><sub>REF</sub>_TN). If DIVIN&lt;1:0&gt; is 01, the programmable frequency device 102 divides the frequency of the raw reference clock REF_IN by a factor of two (2) to generate the output reference clock REFOUT (e.g., <i>f</i><sub>REFOUT</sub> ≅ <i>f</i><sub>REF_IN</sub>/2). If DIVIN_&lt;1:0&gt; is 11, the programmable frequency device 102 divides the frequency of the raw reference clock REF_IN by a factor of four (4) to generate the output reference clock REFOUT (e.g., <i>f</i><sub>REFOUT</sub> ≅ <i>f</i><sub>REF_IN</sub>/4). And, if DIVIN_&lt;1:0&gt; is 10, the programmable frequency device 102 divides the frequency of the raw reference clock REF_IN by a factor of eight (8) to generate the output reference clock REFOUT (e.g., <i>f</i><sub>REFOUT</sub> ≅ <i>f</i><sub>REF</sub>_<sub>IN</sub>/8).</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As previously discussed, the programmable frequency device 102 performs the change in frequency in a manner that the timing or temporal relationship of the triggering edges do not substantially change with changes in the frequency. This prevents or reduces the likelihood of a disruption in the loop control of the DPLL 100. The programmable frequency device 102 is also adapted to asynchronously receive the input frequency selection control signal DIVIN_&lt;1:0&gt;, and to synchronously generate an output frequency selection control signal DIVRO_&lt;1:0&gt; that instructs other modules of the DPLL 100 of the selected frequency for the output reference clock REFOUT.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The input accumulator 104 receives a PLL input and the output reference clock REFOUT, and generates an input phase signal. In essence, the input accumulator 104 comprises a counter that counts periods of the output reference signal by a number dictated by the PLL input. For example, if the PLL input is 10, then the counter counts by 10 (e.g., 0, 10, 20, 30, etc.) The PLL input dictates the ratio of the frequency of the DCO output to the frequency of the output reference clock REFOUT. For example, if the frequency of the output reference clock REFOUT is 100 MHz and the PLL input is 10, then the frequency of the DCO output (when the loop is locked) is at approximately 1GHz. If the frequency selection control signal DIVRO_&lt;1:0&gt; is 00, the input accumulator 104 counts the periods of the output reference clock REFOUT by 1x the PLL input (e.g., because <i>f</i><sub>REFOUT</sub> ≅ <i>f</i><sub>REF_IN</sub>). If the frequency selection control signal DIVRO_&lt;1:0&gt; is 01, the input accumulator 104 counts the periods of the output reference clock REFOUT by 2x the PLL input (e.g., because <i>f</i><sub>REFOUT</sub> ≅ <i>f</i><sub>REF_IN</sub>/2). If the frequency selection control signal DIVRO_&lt;1:0&gt; is 11, the input accumulator 104 counts the periods of the output reference clock REFOUT by 4x the PLL input (e.g., because <i>f</i><sub>REFOUT</sub> ≅ <i>f</i><sub>REF_IN</sub>/4). And, if the frequency selection control signal DIVRO_&lt;1:0&gt; is 10, the input accumulator 104 counts the periods of the output reference clock REFOUT by 8x the PLL input (e.g., because <i>f</i><sub>REFOUT</sub> ≅ <i>f</i><sub>REF_IN</sub>/8).</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The first summing device 106 receives the input phase signal from the input accumulator 104, and feedback phase signal from the second summing device 118, and generates a phase error signal indicative of the phase difference between the input phase signal and the feedback phase signal. For timing and error correction purposes, the first summing device 106 may receive the output reference clock REFOUT and the frequency selection control signal DIVRO_&lt;1:0&gt;. For example, the first summing device 106 may generate the phase error signal one (1) clock period of the output reference clock REFOUT after it has received the phase signals from the input accumulator 104 and the second summing device 118. Since the frequency, i.e., the clock period, of the REFOUT clock may be changed by the programmable frequency device 102, the first summing device 106 receives the frequency selection control signal DIVRO_&lt;1:0&gt; and the output reference clock REFOUT for the purpose of setting the proper delay for outputting the phase error signal.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The LPF or loop filter 108 filters the phase error signal from the first summing device 106 to generate a frequency control signal for the DCO 110. The transfer<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> function of the loop filter 108 may be dependent on the frequency of the output reference clock REFOUT. Accordingly, the loop filter 108 also receives the output reference clock REFOUT and the frequency selection control signal DIVRO_&lt;1:0&gt; to inform it of the current frequency of the reference clock REFOUT.

The DCO accumulator 114 generates a signal indicative of a coarse measurement of the phase of the PLL output signal. In essence, the DCO accumulator 114 comprises a counter that incrementally counts periods of the PLL output signal. The latch 116 outputs the coarse phase information in response to a triggering edge of the output reference clock REFOUT.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The TDC 112 generates a signal indicative of a fine measurement of the phase of the PLL output signal. In particular, the TDC 112 comprises a chain of delay elements that receives the PLL output signal. The outputs of the delay elements are respectively coupled to the data inputs of flip-flops. The flip-flops are clocked by the output reference clock REFOUT. The Q-outputs of the flip-flops are coupled to a thermometer decoder, which generates a signal indicative of the fractional difference between the phase of the PLL output signal and the reference clock REFOUT. It shall be understood that a frequency divider may be situated between the output of the DCO 110 and the inputs of the DCO accumulator 114 and the TDC 112.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The second summing device 118 receives the coarse and fine phase signals respectively from the latch 116 and the TDC 112, and generates the feedback phase signal related to the phase of the PLL output signal. For timing and error correction purposes, the second summing device 118 may receive the output reference clock REFOUT and the frequency selection control signal DIVRO_&lt;1:0&gt;. For example, The second summing device 118 may generate the feedback phase signal one (1) clock period of the output reference clock REFOUT after it has received the phase information from the latch 116 and the TDC 112. Since the frequency, i.e., the clock period, of the output reference clock REFOUT may be changed by the programmable frequency device 102, the second summing device 118 receives the output reference<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> clock REFOUT and the frequency selection control signal DIVRO_&lt;1:0&gt; to inform it of the current frequency of the output reference clock REFOUT. The second summing device 106 uses this information to select the proper delay for outputting the feedback phase signal.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The frequency controller 120 generates the input frequency selection DIVIN_&lt;1:0&gt; and ENABLE control signals for the programmable frequency device 102. Based on a specified power saving algorithm, the frequency controller 120 may cause the frequency of the reference clock REFOUT to decrease, for example, by a factor of two (2), four (4), or eight (8), in order to place the DPLL 100 in a specified power consumption mode. The frequency controller 120 may perform this reduction in the frequency of the reference clock REFOUT when the DPLL need not be operated in a high performance mode, and reduced power consumption resulting from the frequency decrease would prolong the continual operation of the device when being operated by a limited power supply, such as a battery. When high performance is needed by the DPLL 100, the frequency controller 120 may increment the frequency of the reference clock REFOUT so that better loop control is achieved. The frequency controller 120 may also disable altogether the frequency change function by deactivating or not asserting the ENABLE signal.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an exemplary programmable frequency device 200 in accordance with another aspect of the disclosure.

And, the final graph illustrates the output reference clock REFOUT.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The ENABLE control signal is used to enable or disable the frequency division function of the programmable frequency device 200. If the ENABLE control signal is not asserted, meaning that the programmable frequency division function is disabled, a low logic level appears at the ENABLE input of the AND gate 202. This basically disables the timing signals REF_D, REF_DB, and REF_D1. This in effect disables virtually all of the programmable frequency device 200. Also, the ENABLE control signal not being asserted causes the MUX 248 to output the raw reference clock REF_IN as the output reference clock REFOUT. Thus, by having the ENABLE control signal not asserted, the frequency division function may be bypassed.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">On the other hand, if the ENABLE control signal is asserted, the AND gate 202 allows the raw reference clock REF_IN to be applied to the input of the delay chain 204, thereby allowing the generation of the timing control signals REF_D, REF_DB, and REF_D1. Additionally, the ENABLE control signal being asserted causes the MUX 248 to select the signal at the Q output of the two-clock D flip-flop 246 as the output reference clock REFOUT.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In this exemplary timing diagram, the initial values (prior to time T1) of the input frequency selection control signals DIVIN_&lt;1:0&gt; are set to 00, which, in turn,<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> causes the D flip-flops 240 and 242 to set the output frequency selection control signals DIVRO_&lt;1:0&gt; to 00 when these flip-flops 240 and 242 are clocked. This causes the MUX 244 to output the raw reference clock REF_IN. Since the two-clock D flip-flop 246 is clocked by both timing signals REF_D and REF_DB, the Q output is essentially the raw reference clock REF_IN except that it is substantially timely aligned with the timing control signal REF_D. In this configuration, the timing control signal REF_D is used to clock out one-half period of the raw reference clock REF_IN, and the timing control signal REF_DB is used to clock out the other half period of the raw reference clock REF_IN.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The input frequency control signals DIVIN_&lt;1:0&gt; from the frequency controller 120 may be received by the programmable frequency device 200 asynchronous with the signals REF_IN, REF_D, REF_DB, etc. generated in the programmable frequency device 200. In this example, the DIVIN_0 control signal transitions from a logic low level to a high logic level at time T1, as noted in the timing diagram. This makes the control signal DIVIN_&lt;1:0&gt; to be 01, which instructs the programmable frequency device 200 to output the half-frequency clock DIV2 as the output reference clock REFOUT.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">When the distinct frequency clocks DIV2, DIV4, and DIV8 are all at a low logic level, the D flip-flops 222, 224, and 226 clock out a high logic level at their respective QB outputs at substantially the triggering edge (e.g., rising edge) of the timing control signal REF_DB, e.g., at time T2 as indicated in the timing diagram. At this time T2, the inputs to the three-input AND gate 234 are at the high logic level, thereby causing the AND gate 234 to generate a high logic level. Similarly, when the distinct frequency clocks DIV2, DIV4, and DIV 8 are all at the high logic level, the D flip-flops 228, 230, and 232 clock out a low logic level at their respective QB outputs at substantially the triggering edge (e.g., rising edge) of the timing control signal REF_D1, e.g., at time T3 as indicated in the timing diagram. At this time T3, the inputs to the three-input NOR gate 234 are at the low logic level, thereby causing the NOR gate 236 to generate a high logic level.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Accordingly, at time T3, both the AND gate 234 and the NOR gate 236 generate a high logic level at their respective outputs. Consequently, the inputs to the AND gate 238 are also at the high logic level, causing the AND gate 238 to transition its output from a low logic level to a high logic level. This produces a triggering edge at the clock<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> inputs of the D flip-flops 240 and 242. Since the input frequency selection control signal DIVIN_&lt;1:0&gt; is now at 0 1, the D flip flops 240 and 242 also clock out the output frequency selection control signal DIVRO_&lt;1:0&gt; as a 01. This is shown in the timing diagram as a rising edge of DIVRO_0 at time T3. The output frequency selection control signals DIVRO_&lt;1:0&gt; becoming 01 at time T3 causes the MUX 244 to output of frequency divided clock DIV2. At time T4 as indicated in the timing diagram, the timing control signal REF_DB causes the two-clock D flip-flop 246 to clock out the selected clock DIV2. It is noted that at time T4, the output reference clock REFIN and clock DIV2 are at the high logic level, thus the logic level of the output reference clock REFOUT does not change at that time. However, at time T5, the triggering edge (e.g., rising edge) of timing control signal REF_D causes the two-clock D flip-flop to output a low logic level because the DIV2 clock is at a low logic level at such time.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In summary, when enabled, the programmable frequency device 102 generates an output reference clock REFOUT that has substantially the same triggering edges as that of timing signal REF_D. This is sown in the diagram where the triggering edges of the output reference clock REFOUT at times T6-T9 substantially line up with the timing edges of the timing control signal REF_D. This is due to the timing control signal REF_D being used to clock out the selected REF_IN, DIV2, DIV4, or DIV8 clock. Thus, when changing between the clocks REF_IN, DIV2, DIV4, and DIV8, the triggering edges substantially line up, and thus does not significantly disturb the operation of the control loop of the DPLL.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Additionally, the circuit comprising the D flip-flops 222, 224, 226, 228, 230, and 232, the three-input AND gate 234, the three-input NOR gate 236, and the AND gate 238 generate a triggering edge to cause the output frequency selection control signals DIVRO_&lt;1:0&gt; to change at the selection inputs of the MUX 244 so as to cause the frequency change at a particular time. In this example, the triggering occurs every eight (8) cycles of the raw reference clock REF_IN or once per cycle of the clock DIV8. The circuit comprising the D flip-flops 218, 220, 240, 242 allows the input frequency selection control signals DIVIN_&lt;1:0&gt; to be received asynchronous, and generate the output frequency selection control signals DIVRO_&lt;1:0&gt; synchronously to effectuate the frequency change at the specified time.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The circuit comprising the AND gate 202, delay chains 204, and inverters 206, and 208 operate to generate the timing signals REF_D, REF_DB, and REF_D1 when<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> the ENABLE control signal is asserted, and effectively disable the frequency division function of the programmable frequency device 200 when the ENABLE control signal is not asserted.

The antenna 402 serves to receive radio frequency (RF) signals from one or more remote communication devices via a wireless medium, and to transmit RF signals to one or more remote communication devices via the wireless medium. The TX/RX isolation device 404 serves to route the received signal to the receiver 406, and route transmit signal to the antenna 402 while substantially isolating the input of the receiver 406 from the transmit signal. The receiver 406 serves to down convert the received RF signal to an intermediate frequency (IF) or baseband signal. The transmitter 412 serves to up convert an IF or baseband outbound signal to an RF signal. The local oscillator (LO) 408 including the DPLL as discussed above provides a received local oscillating source LO<sub>R</sub> for the receiver 406 so it can perform its down converting function.

As an example, when high performance of the DPLL is required, the power management device 410 may set the frequency of the output reference clock REFOUT to be substantially the same as that of the raw reference clock REFIN (e.g., frequency division = 1). As another example, when low performance of the DPLL is acceptable and conservation of power is desired, the power management device 410 may set the frequency of the output reference clock REFOUT to substantially the frequency of the DIV8 clock (e.g., frequency division = 8). As yet another example, when medium performance of the DPLL is acceptable and power consumption is desired as well, the power management device 410 may set the frequency of the output reference clock REFOUT to substantially that of the frequency of the DIV2 or DIV4 clock (e.g., frequency division = 2 or 4).</p><p id="p0052" num="0052"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a flow diagram of an exemplary method 500 of controlling power consumption in the exemplary transceiver 400 in accordance with another aspect of the disclosure.
