mxw-id="PDES63957128" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a concrete element for protecting an underwater installation, such as a cable or pipeline. The invention also relates to a mould and a method for manufacturing such concrete elements. Furthermore, the invention relates to an arrangement and a method for laying concrete elements from a ship.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Underwater installations, such as cables and pipelines without any overlying protection, are at great risk of being damaged or displaced out of position by sea currents, or fishing implements, e.g. trawls, which are dragged over them. Accordingly, it has become more and more common to cover underwater installations with suitably designed protective elements, which are laid in a long row over the underwater installation. The protective elements are advantageously laid at the same time as the underwater installation itself.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Different types of protective elements for underwater installations are previously known. Examples of previously known types of such protective elements are described in the patent publications <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2005078325A1"><text>WO 2005/078325 A1</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6349808B1"><text>US 6 349 808 B1</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US4242010A"><text>US 4 242 010</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Another protective element is described in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="GB2345198A"><text>GB2345198</text></patcit>, where a cable is protected by being placed in a grove, open to the top.<br/>
A mould and a method to produce curved concrete shells is presented in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO2008083835A"><text>WO2008/083835</text></patcit>. The mould has cover shells that can be opened. Before curing the concrete, the mould is turned to remove air bubbles from the top surface of the shell.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Some of the previously known protective structures have to be covered with gravel or sand or bottom sediment, in order to provide sufficient stability and protection for the underwater installation. This requires more working steps and larger material consumption, and increases the cost of the protective structure. Furthermore, underwater digging and filling operations often often result in a loose bottom structure, which is susceptible to influence from sea currents and to be washed away.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Elements of reinforced concrete are advantageous with respect to stability and protecting ability, and generally do not require any covering with gravel or the like. However, the previously known concrete elements have certain disadvantages. Such a disadvantage is that concrete elements with a larger length than about a metre will produce a row with a relatively large radius of curvature, for downward deflection of the row, during the laying operation, and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> thus require the use of lifting cranes or hoisting devices which are relatively high, or at least placed high up, in order not to cause the laying operation to become very inexact due to an excessively large distance to the landing spot of the concrete elements on the bottom surface. The large radius of curvature, in its turn, requires the use of a relatively large ship, which can be a disadvantage for laying operations in narrow passages or in shallow waters. This problem can be reduced by making the concrete elements shorter in the laying direction than in the width direction, but this results in a larger number of concrete elements per unit of length unit and thus a more expensive protective installation. Another problem with the previously known concrete elements is that the laying operation requires the use of a long laying cable, which is removed after the laying operation. The length of the laying cable has to be larger than the length of the protective structure which is to be laid, and the long cable is very heavy and cumbersome to handle. Still another disadvantage of the prior art is that the previously known concrete elements, when laid in a long row after each other, have a continuous lateral surface which is rather large, and which therefore is subjected to large forces from sea currents and other water movements. This can cause bottom sediment to be washed away underneath the concrete elements, so that they are undermined or displaced out of position. This, in its turn, results in gaps and level differences between the laid-out concrete elements, which implies a reduced protection for the underwater installation and an increased risk of fishing implements and the like getting stuck on the concrete elements.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly, a first object of the present invention is to provide a concrete element which provides a safe protection for an underwater installation without any additional covering, and which does not require any high cranes or hoisting devices for the laying operation.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">This first object is achieved by means of a concrete element according to claim 1, which is shaped as an elongated, curved shell segment having two gable ends, a bottom side between the gable ends which is designed with a longitudinal cavity for receiving the underwater installation when laying the concrete element, a top side between the gable ends, and at least two through-going apertures from the top side to the cavity, wherein the projection of the gable ends is inclined so that the top side<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> becomes longer than the bottom side, and the concrete element is provided with, at least one connecting member for interconnection with a corresponding connecting member of another concrete element and the connecting members are of a design such that the distance between the outer edges of the gable ends of two interconnected concrete elements becomes smaller than 30 centimetres after the laying operation, where the top side (6) decreases in height from the centre towards the sides (16, 17) and describes a smooth curve shape and/or that the top side has bevelled edges at the transition to the gable ends, such that low frictional resistance against a trawl dragged over the element after the laying operation is obtained.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The design of the gable ends of the concrete element according to the invention results in a smaller radius of curvature, for downward deflection of a row of interconnected such concrete elements, and therefore eliminates the need of high cranes or hoisting devices during the laying operation. Furthermore, the sloping gable ends create openings for free water flow between laid-out concrete elements, which makes the concrete elements less sensitive to forces from water currents and reduces the risk of them being undermined or displaced out of position. Furthermore, the openings between the concrete elements provide passages into the underlying cavity which are suitable for larger marine organisms, such as fish and lobsters. The connecting members enable two or several concrete elements to be interconnected and laid without any laying cable with a larger length than the row of concrete elements which is to be laid. Furthermore, the interconnection gives better stability to the row of laid concrete elements and reduces the risk that the concrete elements are displaced relative to each other. The small distance between the gable ends, enabled by the connecting members, reduces the risk of a trawl or other fishing implement getting stuck on the row of interconnected concrete elements.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A second object of the present invention is to provide a mould for efficient manufacturing of concrete elements which provide the advantages described in the foregoing.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">This second object is achieved by means of mould according to claim 6, which comprises bottom and cover parts which, in a closed position, enclose a mould cavity having an opening for concrete filling, and which, in an open position, allow removal of a casted concrete element, wherein at least one cover part is<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> The pivoting cover part(s) of the mould according to the invention results in a faster manufacturing process since it is easy to open the mould to lift out the casted concrete elements.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A third object of the invention is to provide an efficient method of manufacturing concrete elements which provide the advantages described in the foregoing.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">9 This third object is achieved by means of a method according to claim 9, which makes use of a mould comprising bottom and cover parts which, in a closed position, enclose a mould cavity having an opening for concrete filling, and which, in an open position, allow removal of a casted concrete element, wherein at least one cover part is pivotally arranged relative to the bottom part so that the cover part can be pivoted to the side to an open position or back to a closed position, wherein the method comprises the steps of closing the cover parts of the mould against the bottom part of the mould, injecting a concrete composition into the mould via an opening, vibrating the concrete composition in the mould when necessary, causing the concrete composition in the mould to cure at least partially, opening the cover parts of the mould, and removing an at least partially cured concrete element from the mould, wherein the mould cavity of the mould being used in the method, as seen in the transverse direction of the mould, describes a substantially rectilinear, horizontal upper contour and two opposite gable end contours connected to the upper contour at acute angles, and the method further comprises the step of arranging longitudinal reinforcement elements to bridge the mould cavity between the opposite gable ends of the mould, in a step before the concrete composition is caused to cure, and the step of applying at least one connecting member, for interconnection with a corresponding connecting member of another concrete element, on the concrete element by partial embedding into the concrete composition before curing, or fixing at least one connecting member, for interconnection with a corresponding connecting member of another concrete element, to the concrete element after the curing.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The method according to the invention enables an efficient production of concrete elements according to the invention, since it is easy to apply longitudinal reinforcement elements in a suitable position in the mould cavity, for example by supporting the reinforcement elements on supporting legs<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> standing on the bottom part, since casted concrete elements rapidly and easily can be lifted out of the opened mould, and since connecting members easily can be partially embedded into the concrete element before curing when this is desired.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A fourth object of the present invention is to provide an arrangement for cost efficient and reliable laying of concrete elements, which provide the advantages described in the foregoing, from a ship.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">This fourth object is achieved by means of an arrangement according to claim 11, which comprises at least one tool for interconnecting the concrete elements before the laying operation, wherein the concrete elements are designed such that the projection of the gable ends is inclined so that the top side becomes longer than the bottom side and so that a first concrete element exhibits a first connecting member for interconnection with a second connecting member of a second concrete element and said connecting members are designed to provide a distance between the gable ends of the two concrete elements, after the interconnection, which is smaller than 30 centimetres, and the tool comprises positioning means for bringing the first connecting member substantially flush to and next to the second connecting member in the correct position for interconnection by means of at least one connecting element, and wherein the connecting tool has an output end for interconnected concrete elements and the output end is connected to a laying device for the interconnected concrete elements.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The arrangement according to the invention enables concrete elements according to the invention to be interconnected and laid in a protective structure of a desired length over an underwater installation, such as a cable or pipeline.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Finally, a fifth object of the present invention is to provide a method for laying concrete elements, which provide the advantages described in the foregoing, from a ship.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">This fifth object is achieved by means of a method according to claim 16, which comprises to interconnect concrete elements, which are designed such that the projection of the gable ends is inclined so that the top side becomes longer than the bottom side and so that a first concrete element exhibits a first<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> connecting member for interconnection with a second connecting member of a second concrete element and wherein said connecting members are designed to provide a distance between the gable ends of the concrete elements after the interconnection which is smaller than 30 centimetres, and wherein the method further comprises to lay a row of the interconnected concrete elements with a radius of curvature, for downward deflection of the row, which is smaller than 25 metres, in order to form a protective structure over an underwater installation after the laying of the row onto a bottom surface.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The method according to the invention enables the laying operation to take place without any laying cable of a larger length than the protective structure and without any use of high cranes or hoisting devices. Furthermore, the method minimizes the risk that the concrete elements are displaced relative to each other after the laying operation. This will provide a safer protection for the underwater installation and less risk that fishing implements get stuck on the concrete elements.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the following, the invention will be described with a number of different embodiments with reference to the attached drawings, in which

Furthermore, the concrete element has a top side 6, between the gable ends, which is designed for low frictional resistance against a trawl dragged over the element after the laying operation. In this context, "trawl" should be construed as if the expression also includes other dragged fishing implements which might damage a protective structure of laid concrete elements and the underlying underwater installation. The concrete element further comprises at least two through-going apertures 7, 8 from the top side 6 to the cavity 5. The through-going apertures can influence the flow-through of water and serve as passages for relatively small marine organisms.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to the invention, the concrete element is characterized in that the projection of the gable ends 2, 3 is inclined so that the top side 6 becomes longer than the bottom side 4. This is schematically illustrated by the two arrows L1 (the length of the top side) and L2 (the length of the bottom side), respectively, in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1B</figref>, wherein it is evident from the figure that L1 &gt; L2. The design of the gable ends, according to the invention, enables a smaller radius of curvature, for downward deflection of a row of such concrete elements, during the laying operation. If one imagines that the two concrete elements shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 2</figref> are in the process of being laid from a ship, it will be appreciated that the sloping gable ends, according to the invention, allow a larger downward deflection during the laying operation than what otherwise would be possible. Thereby, the concrete element according to the invention eliminates the need for the high cranes or hoisting devices which become necessary when the radius of curvature for downward deflection of a row of concrete elements is excessively large, as is often the case in the prior art. Another advantage is that the slope of the gable ends according to the invention creates openings for free flow-through of water between laid concrete elements. This makes concrete elements according to the invention less sensitive to forces from water currents after the laying operation, and reduces the risk of them being undermined or displaced out of position. Furthermore, the openings between the concrete elements provide passages into the underlying cavity which are suitable for larger marine organisms, such as fish and lobsters.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to the invention, the concrete element 1 is further provided with (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 2</figref>), or prepared for attachment of, at least one connecting member 18, 19 for interconnection with a corresponding connecting member 18' of another concrete element 1'. This feature is very advantageous, since it enables interconnection of several concrete elements for a laying operation without any laying cable with a larger length than the row of concrete elements which is to be laid. Furthermore, the interconnection gives better stability to a laid row of concrete elements and reduces the risk of the concrete elements being displaced relative to each other. According to the invention, the connecting members 19, 18' (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>) are of a design such that the distance between the outer edges of the gable ends of two interconnected concrete elements 1, 1' becomes smaller than 30 centimetres after the laying operation. Such a small distance between the gable ends reduces the risk of a trawl board getting stuck<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> between the concrete elements. Even more advantageously, the connecting members 18, 19 extend less than 20 centimetres outside the gable ends 2, 3 and are designed such that the distance between the outer edges of two interconnected gable ends becomes smaller than 20 centimetres. This embodiment reduces the risk of a trawl board getting stuck even further.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the concrete element 1 has connecting members 18, 19 at both gable ends. This enables interconnection and laying of an optional number of concrete elements in a protective structure of a desired length, without using any long cable for the laying operation. When laying first 1 and second 1' interconnected concrete elements, the connecting members 19, 18' are designed such that they allow a relatively large downward deflection of the first concrete element 1 relative to the second, subsequent concrete element 1', at the same time as the connecting members 19, 18' only allow a relatively small lateral deflection and only an insignificant rotation between the interconnected concrete elements 1, 1'. Such a design gives the smallest possible laying radius, and an facilitates a precise laying of a long row of concrete elements in a desired position on a bottom surface.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As has become evident in the foregoing, it is advantageous with concrete elements allowing a radius of curvature which is as small as possible when laying a row of such concrete elements. Thus, in the preferred embodiment, the concrete element 1 exhibits bevelled and preferably rounded corners 9, 10 at the transition between the bottom side 4 and at least one of the gable ends 2, 3 (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1B</figref>). This allows an even smaller radius of curvature during the laying operation. Another advantage is that bevelled, and preferably rounded corners, preferably at both ends of the concrete element, allow the concrete element to slide more easily over an edge of a laying platform, railing, or the like, during the laying operation.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In the preferred embodiment, the bottom side 4 of the concrete element is further designed with longitudinal support runners 11, 12 at the sides of the cavity 5 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 1C</figref>), wherein the support runners have a concave outer contour 13 in the longitudinal direction of the concrete element. Such a concave design can allow an even smaller radius of curvature during the laying operation (the bottom side of the concrete element is "curved inward"). Furthermore, the support runners facilitate the sliding over a laying platform, railing, or the like. A further advantage with the concave outer contour 13 of<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the support runners is that it creates relatively large, longitudinal openings and enables an increased flow-through of water between the concrete element and the bottom surface on which the concrete element is supported. Another advantage is that the large longitudinal openings are suitable as passages for larger marine organisms, such as bottom-living fish and lobsters.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">It is advantageous if the bottom side 4 of the concrete element exhibits portions designed as substantially smooth support surfaces 14, 15. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 1C</figref>, the support surfaces are constituted of smooth portions of the support runners. With suitable positioning and dimensioning, such smooth support surfaces can further facilitate the sliding over a laying platform during the laying operation. The smooth support surfaces can also be designed to locally achieve a tight and stable contact between the concrete element and the bottom surface after the laying operation (not shown in the Figures) to thereby create a larger number of separate chambers for marine life underneath a row of laid concrete elements. Furthermore, the bottom side of the concrete element can advantageously exhibit exposed portions of a low friction material (not shown in the Figures). Such a design can further facilitate the sliding ability of the concrete element across a laying platform or the like. The bottom side can also exhibit exposed portions of a plastic material or metallic material at the corners and/or along a longitudinal support runner (not shown in the Figures). Such an embodiment can be advantageous to reduce the risk that the concrete element is scratched or otherwise damaged during the laying operation or other handling.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In the preferred embodiment of concrete element according to the invention, the top side 6 decreases in height from the centre towards the sides 16, 17 and describes a smooth curve shape, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 1E</figref>. Such a design reduces the risk of a trawl or other fishing implement getting stuck on the concrete element, and also reduces the force exerted on the concrete element by a water current. However, it is also possible with embodiments of the invention where the concrete element has a cross-sectional shape which substantially describes half a rectangle (not shown in the Figures). Such a cross-sectional shape can be advantageous since it facilitates the fabrication of a mould for casting the concrete element.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In one embodiment of the invention, the top side of the concrete element has bevelled edges at the transition to the gable ends (not shown in the Figures).<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> This embodiment is advantageous since it allows a smaller radius of curvature "upwards" of a row of concrete elements which are in the process of sliding over a railing or about to "land" on the sea bottom. With a suitably adapted bevelling, it is also possible to reduce the risk of fishing implements getting stuck in the gaps between two adjacent concrete elements and, furthermore, to reduce the force exerted on the concrete element in a lateral direction by a sea current.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The concrete element 1 preferably exhibits a pattern of through-going apertures 7, 8 across the major portion of its surface, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1A</figref>. Such an aperture pattern provides maximum through-flow of water and reduces the risk of undermining of the concrete element. Furthermore, the large number of apertures serves as passages for smaller marine organisms. The concrete element advantageously exhibits a local interruption in the aperture pattern close to the highest point of the top side of the concrete element. Such an interruption in the aperture pattern is advantageous since it leaves space for longitudinal reinforcement which is cast into the concrete element.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The concrete element 1, 1' and the connecting members 19, 18' are preferably of a design which enables laying of a row of interconnected concrete elements with a radius of curvature, for downward deflection of the row, which is smaller than 25 metres. Even more advantageously, the concrete element and the connecting members are of a design which enables laying of a row of interconnected concrete elements with a radius of curvature, for downward deflection of the row, which is about 5 metres. Such a small radius of curvature ensures that the laying operation can be executed without any high cranes or the like. The connecting members 18', 19' are preferably constituted of, or attached to, ends of a longitudinal reinforcement element 20' extending between the gable ends of the concrete element 1' (as indicated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>). This ensures that concrete element does not break during the laying operation, and also makes it possible to fabricate inexpensive connecting members from protruding ends of reinforcement bars or to attach separate connecting members to such ends. Advantageously, the connecting members comprise lugs 19', 18" (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>) which can be interconnected by means of connecting elements 21, such as dowels, bolt-nut connections, pins, or other suitable elements. Such a connecting system enables rapid interconnection of the concrete elements during the laying operation. Two interconnected connecting members 19, 18', between two interconnected concrete elements,<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> can preferably support a load of at least 1000 kilograms. Such a dimensioning ensures that the connecting members do not break when laying normal sized elements without any special laying cable passing through the entire row of concrete elements. The connecting members 19, 18', 19', 18" (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>) are advantageously of a design which allows a portion of the underwater installation 22 to be suspended from and/or fixed to them when laying a plurality of concrete elements 1, 1', 1" in a row. Such a design makes it possible to fix a portion of the underwater installation 22 in position relative to the overlying protective structure at regular intervals. The connecting members 19', 18" are preferably adapted to be enclosed by a sling 23. This makes it possible to suspend a portion of the underwater installation, such as a cable, from the sling, in a simple, inexpensive and rapid way. Another advantage with such a flexible sling suspension is that the cable can move sufficiently after the suspension to avoid that the cable is damaged by excessive tensile or bending forces, or by jerks from the concrete elements, during the laying operation. The connecting members of the concrete element according to the invention advantageously comprise, or are designed for receiving, resilient bushings (not shown in the Figures). Such resilient bushings are advantageous since they can absorb shocks during the laying operation and other handling, so that the connecting members or the concrete element do not break.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The concrete element according to the invention can advantageously be provided with a quick connection element on the bottom side (not shown in the Figures). The quick connection element can, for example, be constituted of a cast-in or screwed-in lug from which the underwater installation can be suspended by means of snap hooks or the like. Such a quick connection element can enable a faster and easier suspension of the underwater installation underneath the concrete elements and increase the laying speed.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The concrete element 1, 1' according to the invention is advantageously of a design which enables simple attachment of a chafe guard 24 on the bottom side, in the vicinity of the gable end (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>). Such a chafe guard can be constituted of plastic or rubber plates which are thread on each sling to avoid damages on a cable, pipeline, or other underwater installation during the laying operation. It is also conceivable with embodiments of the invention where the chafe guard is attached to the bottom side of every second concrete element, for example to a bracket intended for this purpose, close to the gable end of the concrete element.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The concrete element 1' according to the invention preferably encloses a reinforcement structure 20' which is continuous in the longitudinal direction of the concrete element. In this way, it is ensured that the concrete element does not break when laying a long row of concrete elements without any special laying cable with a larger length than the laid row of concrete elements. The concrete element can also enclose a reinforcement structure in the form of a continuous netting (not shown in the Figures). Such a reinforcement structure can be advantageous in applications where the concrete element needs high strength in all directions. Furthermore, the concrete element can enclose a reinforcement structure in the form of a torsional reinforcement. Torsional reinforcement refers to a reinforcement structure which is specially designed to prevent the concrete element from being damaged by torsional forces during the laying operation.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Advantageously, the concrete element according to the invention can be made of so called dry concrete. The use of dry concrete results in a shorter curing time and a faster production of concrete elements. The concrete element advantageously contains a light-weight material as a concrete aggregate. The light-weight material can consist of so-called Leca granules or other light materials which make it possible to reduce and control the weight and buoyancy of the concrete element. The concrete element can also contain a fibre material as an additional reinforcement, in order to obtain higher strength and toughness. In certain cases, such an addition of fibre material can be sufficient as the only reinforcement for lighter concrete elements. Furthermore, the concrete element can comprise a polymer composition. Such an addition of one or several suitable polymer compounds can improve various properties of the concrete element, such as toughness, salt water resistance, etc. Advantageously, the concrete element according to the invention can contain completely or partially cast-in rails, strips, plates, boards or pieces of low-friction material, metal, plastic or rubber (not shown in the figures). This embodiment makes it possible to create local sliding surfaces with low friction for the connecting and/or laying of the concrete element, or to create local areas with high strength which reduce the risk of the concrete element cracking or being scratched. Such cast-in elements can also be utilized to provide suitable material for a stable screw-attachment of connecting members on the concrete element after the curing.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In the following, different embodiments of a mould for manufacturing concrete elements according to the invention will be described in greater detail with reference to the schematic illustrations in the attached <figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">5</figref>. The mould 40; 40' comprises bottom and cover parts 41, 42, 43; 41', 42', 43' which, in a closed position, enclose a mould cavity having an opening for concrete filling, and which, in an open position, allow removal of a casted concrete element. Furthermore, at least one cover part 42, 43; 42', 43' is pivotally arranged relative to the bottom part 41; 41' so that the cover part can be pivoted to the side to an open position or back to a closed position. Such a design of the mould gives a faster and easier manufacturing process since the pivoting cover part(s) makes it easy to open the mould, to lift out a casted concrete element, and to thereafter prepare the mould for the next casting.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Preferably, the mould 40; 40' has first 42; 42' and second 43; 43' cover parts which both are pivotally arranged 44, 45; 44', 45' relative to the bottom part 41; 41', whereby the advantage is obtained that two smaller pivoting cover parts are easier to handle than a single, larger cover part. Advantageously, the cover parts 42, 43; 42', 43' of the mould 40; 40' are attached to the bottom part 41; 41' by means of hinges 51; 52; 51', 52' at the long sides of the mould. Such a design gives a stable mould with cover parts which can be opened quickly and easily. Advantageously, the first and second cover parts create the opening 46; 46' for concrete filling between themselves when they are in a closed position (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">5</figref>). Such an embodiment makes it easy to provide a filling opening of a desired size and shape. The opening 46; 46' for concrete filling is preferably placed close to the highest point of the mould, to make it possible to fill the mould with concrete without any pressurization. Furthermore, the opening 46; 46' is advantageously placed near the centre of the mould 40; 40' in the horizontal plane, this in order to make it easier to achieve an even distribution of concrete throughout the entire mould cavity. The opening for concrete filling is advantageously designed as a slit 46; 46' or a funnel. Such a design facilitates the filling of concrete and minimizes the risk of spillage. An opening designed as a longitudinal slit across the entire mould can in an advantageous way be used for inserting a concrete vibrator after the filling and/or for lowering down longitudinal reinforcement elements from above.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">According to the invention, the mould cavity, as seen in the transverse direction CD (as indicated by the arrows in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">5</figref>) of the mould 40; 40',<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> describes a substantially rectilinear, horizontal upper contour and two opposite gable end contours connected to the upper contour at acute angles. This mould geometry produces concrete elements according to the invention which can be laid in a row with a small radius of curvature. In the preferred embodiment of the mould according to the invention, the mould cavity, as seen in the transverse direction CD (as indicated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">5</figref>) of the mould 40; 40', describes a curved lower contour which is concave inwards toward the centre of the mould cavity and which is connected to said gable end contours via rounded corners. This mould geometry produces concrete elements which provide suitable passages for larger marine organisms and which enable improved water circulation underneath the concrete elements. In the preferred embodiment, the mould 40; 40' according to the invention comprises a removable curing plate 47; 47' adapted to be placed on top of the bottom part 41; 41'. Such a removable curing plate makes it possible to manufacture concrete elements faster. The curing plate serves as a support for an overlying concrete element which is not completely cured. The concrete element and the curing plate can thus be lifted out after a shorter curing time and be brought to a separate station for post-curing, at the same time as another curing plate is placed in the mould and casting of the next concrete element starts. In the preferred embodiment of the mould, the upper side of the bottom part 41 and/or the curing plate 47', as seen in the longitudinal direction of the mould, substantially describe(s) an inverted U with two horizontal shanks extending outwards from the inverted U towards the long sides of the mould 40; 40'. This mould geometry produces concrete elements according to the invention with a longitudinal cavity for the underwater installation to be protected, and with support runners at the sides of the cavity to facilitate the movement, connection, laying, and abutment contact against a bottom surface. In the preferred embodiment, the bottom side of the cover parts 42, 43; 42', 43' in a closed position, as seen in the longitudinal direction of the mould 40, 40', substantially describes an inverted U. This mould geometry produces a smooth curve shape of the top side of the finished concrete element, which reduces the risk of a trawl or other fishing implement getting stuck and the forces exerted on the concrete element by a sea current after the laying operation.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In one advantageous embodiment (not shown in the drawings) the mould has an opening from the interior of the mould cavity to the outside of the mould, at least at one of said gable end contours, for enabling insertion of one end of a<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> connecting member therethrough. This embodiment enables the connecting member to be partially cast-in inside the concrete element.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In a first embodiment of the mould according to the invention, shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>, the curing plate 47 has a plurality of spaced apart protrusions 48, 49 on its upper side which substantially bridge the space between the bottom part 41 and the cover parts 43. Such a design of the curing plate makes it easy to achieve through-going apertures in the concrete element in a desired pattern. Variants of the invention where the mould has protrusions which are only temporarily attached to the curing plate during the casting (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>) or protrusions which are permanently attached to or integrated with the curing plate (not shown in the Figures) are also possible.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In a second, preferred embodiment of the mould according to the invention, shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref>, the bottom part 41' has a plurality of spaced apart protrusions 48', 49' on its upper side which substantially bridge the space between the bottom part 41' and the cover parts 42', 43', wherein the curing plate 47' is designed with a number of through-going apertures 53', 54', and wherein the protrusions and the apertures are designed such that the protrusions 48', 49' protrude through the apertures 53', 54' when the curing plate 47' is in the mould 40' and so that the protrusions can slide out through the apertures when the curing plate is removed from the mould. The curing plate 47' and the protrusions 48', 49' in the preferred embodiment of the mould makes it possible to manufacture concrete elements with a desired pattern of through-going apertures. The protrusions are preferably permanently attached to or integrated into the bottom part of the mould, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref>, but embodiments with temporarily attached protrusions are also possible.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Protrusions 48, 49 which are temporarily attached to the curing plate (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>) and/or to the bottom part (not shown in the Figures) can be advantageous since they facilitate the removal of the concrete element from the curing plate and/or the bottom part after the curing. Furthermore, temporarily attached protrusions make it possible to achieve aperture shapes and patterns which otherwise would be impossible, for example such shapes and patterns which would lead to a jamming preventing the release of the concrete element from the curing plate with attached protrusions after the curing. Temporary attachment can, for example, be achieved by clamping tubular protrusions to suitably designed brackets or holders (not shown in the<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> Figures) which, depending on the embodiment in question, either are fixed to the curing plate or to the upper surface of the bottom part. The protrusions 48, 49; 48', 49' are preferably arranged in a pattern with a longitudinal interruption 50, 50' in the pattern extending continuously between two short sides of the mould 40, 40'. This interruption in the pattern is dimensioned to leave space for a continuous, longitudinal reinforcement structure between the gable ends of a casted concrete element. Such a longitudinal reinforcement structure ensures that the concrete element does not break or rupture during the laying operation. The protrusions 48, 49; 48', 49' are preferably tapering inward from the curing plate 47; 47' and upwards, wherein "upwards" should be construed as upwards relative to the bottom part of the mould. Such a design facilitates the release of the protrusions from the concrete element after the curing. However, it is also conceivable with embodiments of the invention where the protrusions have other shapes, e.g. a cylinder shape. The protrusions can also have a cornered shape, which can make it easier to fabricate the protrusions. Alternatively, the protrusions can have a bevelled or rounded cross-section, which can facilitate the release of the protrusions from a cured concrete element, and which, furthermore, produces through-going apertures with a shape which reduces the risk of cracking during the curing and results in a stronger finished concrete element. In one embodiment, the protrusions are constituted of sheet metal pieces applied by welding. This is an economically advantageous way of achieving protrusions in a desired pattern on a curing plate or bottom part of weldable metal.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In the following, different embodiments of a method of manufacturing concrete elements according to the invention will be described in greater detail, when applicable with reference to the attached <figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">5</figref>. The manufacturing method according to the invention makes use of a mould comprising bottom and cover parts which, in a closed position, enclose a mould cavity having an opening for concrete filling, and which, in an open position, allow removal of a casted concrete element, wherein at least one cover part is pivotally arranged relative to the bottom part so that the cover part can be pivoted to the side to an open position or back to a closed position. The method comprises the steps of closing the cover parts 42, 43; 42', 43' of the mould 40; 40' against the bottom part 41; 41' of the mould, injecting a concrete composition into the mould via an opening 46; 46', vibrating the concrete composition in the mould when necessary, causing the concrete composition in the mould to cure at least partially, opening the cover parts 42, 43; 42', 43' of the mould, and removing<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> an at least partially cured concrete element from the mould. According to the invention, the mould cavity of the mould, as seen in the transverse direction CD of the mould 40; 40', describes a substantially rectilinear, horizontal upper contour and two opposite gable end contours connected to the upper contour at acute angles. According to the invention, the method further comprises the step of arranging longitudinal reinforcement elements to bridge the mould cavity between the opposite gable ends of the mould, in a step before the concrete composition is caused to cure, and the step of applying at least one connecting member, for interconnection with a corresponding connecting member of another concrete element, on the concrete element by partial embedding into the concrete composition before curing, or fixing at least one connecting member, for interconnection with a corresponding connecting member of another concrete element, to the concrete element after the curing. The manufacturing method enables an efficient production of concrete elements shaped according to the invention, providing the advantages described in the foregoing, since it is easy to apply longitudinal reinforcement elements in a suitable position in the mould cavity, for example on support legs standing on the bottom part, and since it goes quickly and easily to lift casted concrete elements out of the opened mould.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In one advantageous embodiment of the manufacturing method (not shown in the drawings), at least one end of a connecting member is brought through an opening in at least one of the gable ends of the mould before the curing. This enables one end of the connecting member to be partially enclosed in the concrete composition before the curing. Such an embodiment makes it possible to partially embed connecting lugs with dowels, plates or other corresponding members, which advantageously are attached to the longitudinal reinforcement in a suitable way, before the casting. Alternatively, at least one connecting member can be fixed to the concrete element after the curing. Such an embodiment makes it possible to attach a lug or the like to a protruding reinforcement bar of a concrete element, or to screw a lug bolt into a cast-in plate or the like.

In an alternative embodiment, the longitudinal reinforcement elements are lowered down into the concrete composition through the opening for concrete injection.
