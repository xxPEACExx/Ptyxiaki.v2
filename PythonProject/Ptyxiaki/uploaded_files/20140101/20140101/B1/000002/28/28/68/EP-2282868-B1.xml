<ul><li>a support for a spindle that accommodates coaxially a boring bar that can slide therein,</li><li>means for joint rotation of the spindle and of the boring bar about a main working axis,</li><li>means for the translational motion of the boring bar with respect to the spindle along the main axis.</li></ul></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A first model of this type of machine has the spindle connected to the support by means of radial and axial rolling bearings and accommodates the boring bar, which can slide therein on plain bearings.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">This type of machine tool has a motor for the joint rotation of the spindle and of the boring bar and a motor for the sliding of the boring bar in the spindle.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In order to ensure reliability and precision of the machining performed, the need is felt for a coupling between the boring bar and the spindle that has a high precision and can be obtained by reducing the coupling play to the minimum value that is technologically essential for the free sliding of the boring bar.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">This entails complex and expensive machining to adapt the plain bearings, which require the use of specialized labor.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Further, one drawback of this type of machine consists of the degradation of the precision of such coupling, which is due to the progressive wear and corrosion of the plain bearings, to the full<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> disadvantage of the quality of the operations that can be performed with such machines.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Another drawback of this type of machine is constituted by the fact that the possibility for dynamic balancing in rotation of the boring bar/spindle system is limited by the play between the boring bar and the plain bearings, which is necessary for mutual sliding.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A further drawback of this type of machine tool is that due to the thermal variations that occur during operation, the coupling play between the boring bar and the sliding bearings changes, to the full disadvantage of the centering and balancing stability of the boring bar in the spindle, with respect to the common main working axis, and to the disadvantage of the easy sliding of the spindle in the plain bearings.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">One currently known solution aimed at obviating these drawbacks is constituted by a second model of machine tool that has a structure that comprises a single boring bar-spindle element, which is accommodated in a support and performs a rotary and translational motion therein on hydrostatically supported bearings.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In this manner, the boring bar-spindle element rotates and slides within the support, spaced from it by a film of fluid that is injected between them in the hydrostatically supported bearings.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Although this solution is appreciated in that it does not require extreme precisions in coupling between the boring bar-spindle element and its support, it has some drawbacks, which include causing high power dissipation due to the fluid drag opposed by the film of oil that is interposed between the bearings and the boring bar-spindle element and is entrained thereby during its rotation.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Moreover, for some machinings such as the boring of frames of hydraulic turbines, which can reach a few meters in diameter, it is necessary to use tools that have equally extensive diameters and may weight even hundreds of kilograms.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Machining with such tools, therefore, can be performer with the required precision and reliability only by fixing the tool to an element that has a high rigidity and torsional strength.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In machines of the first described model, i.e., with the boring bar supported in the spindle by means of plain bearings, therefore, the stresses generated during such machinings force the fixing of the tool directly to the spindle, whose diameter and stiffness of its connection to the support are such as to ensure reliable machining.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The second machine model, with the boring bar-spindle element supported by hydrostatically supported bearings, has the boring bar-spindle element that has a smaller diameter than the spindle of the first described machine model.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">This is done in order to contain fluid losses at the hydrostatically supported bearings, which as is known increase as the relative speed of the mutually moving elements increases and therefore, for an equal angular velocity, increase as their diameter increases.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Therefore, the boring bar-spindle element currently does not have characteristics of stiffness that allow its use for machinings with very large tools.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US3058559A"><text>US 3 058 559 A</text></patcit> discloses a spindle mounting for machine tools having a combination of elements as set forth in the pre-characterizing portion of the appended claim 1.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Disclosure of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">The aim of the present invention is to provide a machine tool that obviates these drawbacks, by allowing a coupling of the boring bar in the spindle that is simple to industrialize, so as to not require complex and expensive adaptation machinings thereof.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Within this aim, an object of the invention is to provide a machine tool that has high stiffness of the coupling of the spindle with its support and allows to have a spindle whose diameter is such as to allow effective use of tools of considerable sizes and weights that are fixed directly to the spindle.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Another object of the invention

<ul><li>first means 22a for connection of the second ducts 21 to the first ducts 18 and</li><li>second means 22b for connection of the second ducts 21 to the distribution unit 20.</li></ul></p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The connection means 22a and 22b are adapted to transmit fluid from the distribution unit 20 to the hydrostatically supported bearings 14.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The second ducts 21 are provided conveniently through a first end 23 of the boring bar 13 that lies opposite a second end 24 thereof that is equipped to support a tool.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The first connection means 22a preferably comprise at least one tubular element 25 that connects the second ducts 21 to the first ducts 18.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Conveniently, the tubular element 25 has at least one portion 25a that is wound spirally around the boring bar 13 and makes the tubular element 25 elastically deformable.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The transmission means 19 advantageously comprise means 26 for preventing the loosening of the spirally wound portion 25a on the boring bar 13, which conveniently comprise
<ul><li>at least one slot 27, which is formed on the boring bar 13 and has a helical arrangement along the main axis X,</li><li>an annular flange 28, which surrounds the boring bar 13 and is</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> -->
connected to the spindle 12 so that it can rotate with respect to it about the main axis X.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The annular flange 28 has at least one tooth 29 that engages the slot 27.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Thus, when the boring bar 13 slides within the spindle 12, the tooth 29 slides within the slot 27.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The boring bar 13 is guided in its sliding within the spindle 12 by the entrainment keys 17, which prevent the mutual rotation of the elements 12 and 13 about the main axis X.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Therefore, since the slot 27 lies helically on the boring bar 13, during the sliding of the boring bar within the spindle 12 it imparts to the annular flange 28 a rotation that depends on the angle of the helix of the slot 27.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">One end 30 of the spirally wound portion 25a is connected to the annular flange 28, so that when the annular flange 28 is rotated by way of the action of the sliding of the boring bar 13 in the spindle 12, it turns the end 30, winding or unwinding onto the boring bar 13 the spirally wound portion 25a.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Such angle of the helix is conveniently predefined so that during the sliding of the boring bar 13 in the spindle 12 the winding diameter of the spirally wound portion 25a on the boring bar 13 remains substantially constant.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Conveniently, the boring bar 13 is axially symmetrical and therefore there is advantageously a complementary slot 27a formed thereon in a position that is diametrically opposite with respect to the slot 27.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The spindle 12 advantageously comprises monolithically a male connector 31, which is crossed by the first ducts 18 and is inserted axially in the annular flange 28.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Inside the annular flange 28 there is conveniently an annular recess 32 that faces ports 33 of the first ducts 18 and is connected by means of at least one radial passage 34 to the end 30 of the tubular element 25 to receive<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the fluid from it.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Preferably, lateral gaskets 35 are provided which are arranged at both sides of the annular recess 32 to prevent seepage of fluid between the male connector 31 and the annular flange 28.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Advantageously, the second connection means 22b comprise an assembly with male-female coupling 36, which is composed of a stator 37 that is associated with the distribution unit 20 and of a rotor 38 that is associated with the boring bar 13.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Conveniently, third ducts 39 are provided which pass through the assembly with male-female coupling 36 and connect the second ducts 21 to the distribution unit 20.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In this manner, the stator 37 and the rotor 38, when coupled, form a device that is generally known as a rotary manifold and is adapted to transmit from the

comprising at least one connecting duct 65 that passes through the slider 64.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">moreover, conveniently there is a guide 66 that is associated with the support 11 and supports the slider 64 so that it can slide along the main axis X, jointly with the boring bar 13.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">Advantageously, the distribution unit 20 comprises a first component that is fixed to the support 11 and a second component that is connected to the first component and can be adapted to the position of the slider 64 during the operation of the machine.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">Such second component conveniently comprises a flexible distribution hose 20a, which is supported for example by a guiding chain, not shown in the accompanying figures, which controls its position with respect to the slider 64 to which it is connected.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">The operation of the machine tool 10 according to the invention is as follows.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">In conditions for use, the spindle 12 rotates jointly with the boring bar 13, which can slide therein in order to extend inside it, being supported by the film of fluid that is interposed between them at the hydrostatically supported bearings 14.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Such fluid is sent through the boring bar 13 to the spindle 12 and from the boring bar 13 it is received by the annular element 46 by means of the rotor 38, which is formed at the part 45 of the appendage 40, which rotates inside the stator 37.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">Conveniently, the rotor 38 has a much smaller diameter than the spindle 12, so that its perimetric speed, with which it entrains the film of fluid that penetrates in it through the third ducts 39, is greatly reduced with respect to the perimetric speed of the spindle 12.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">The machine tool 10 according to the invention allows to obtain the rotation rates of the tool that are required by ordinary machinings and at the same time to obtain peripheral rotation speeds of the rotor 38 that are compatible with the use of the sliding gaskets 50 and of the fluid retention<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> gaskets 51, which thus cause limited leaks, respectively due to friction and due to fluid drag.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">During the sliding within the spindle 12 of the boring bar 13, said boring bar entrains with it the slider 64 that supports the stator 37, which supplies with fluid the rotor 38 and the appendage 40.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 4 and 5</figref>, during the extension of the boring bar 13 from the support 11, the turns of the tubular element 25, wound around the boring bar 13, are compacted between the spindle 12 and the first end 23 of the boring bar 13; vice versa, during the retraction of the boring bar 13, through the spindle 12, the winding turns of the tubular element 25 are spaced further apart along the boring bar 13, adapting to the distance modulation between the first end 23 of the boring bar 13 and the spindle 12, the winding diameter of said turns around the boring bar remaining constant thanks to the winding and unwinding by the annular flange 28, as already described.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">In practice it has been found that the invention achieves the intended aim and objects, providing a machine tool that allows a structurally simple coupling of the boring bar in the spindle that does not require complex and expensive adaptation machinings.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">Moreover, a machine tool according to the invention has a high stiffness of the coupling of the spindle, even of large diameter, with its support, since said coupling is provided by means of packs of rolling bearings.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">A machine tool according to the invention also allows to use hydrostatic bearings for supporting the boring bar in the spindle, thus allowing plays between the boring bar and the spindle that are greater than in currently known machines with sliding bearings, to the full advantage of the simplicity and cheapness of the corresponding machinings.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">Further, the feeding of the hydrostatically supported bearings is achieved with a power dissipation due to fluid drag that is much lower than<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> that generated by currently known machine tools that use this type of bearing.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">These power dissipations in fact depend on the relative speed of the elements that compose the rotary manifold for feeding working fluid to the bearings, such speed depending, for an equal angular speed of the rotor with respect to the stator, on the diameter of their coupling.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">Moreover, a machine tool according to the invention has fluid losses due to the translational motion of the boring bar in the spindle that are much lower than those of currently known machines that use a boring bar-spindle that performs a combined rotary and translational motion in a fixed support.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">The invention thus conceived is susceptible of numerous modifications and variations, all of which are within the scope of the appended claims; all the details may further be replaced with other technically equivalent elements.</p><p id="p0098"
