The longitudinal members 2 are substantially parallel to the area of ground S. On the lower face of the longitudinal members 2 there is fitted or provided a respective guide 4. Supported between the guides 4 are cross-members 5, the first and the last of which, indicated respectively by 5a and 5b, respectively define a rear face and a front face of the awning 1.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The cross-member 5a is fixed, while the cross-members 5, 5b are movable along the guides 4 between a first, gathered, position (<figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>)<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> and a second, extended, position (<figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>). The awning 1, in general, may also be used in a semi-extended intermediate position, comprised between the first and the second position.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Secured to the cross-members 5, 5a, 5b is a sheet 6 delimited by a rear face edge 7a in the region of the cross-member 5a, a front edge 7b in the region of the cross-member 5b, and two lateral edges 8 in the region of the guides 4.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The sheet 6 is divided into portions (five portions 10a,b,c,d,e in the exemplary embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>), each of which extends between a pair of consecutive cross-members and is secured to the latter.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Each of the portions 10a,b,c,d,e comprises two drainage sections 11a,b, extending respectively from a central region of the sheet 6 to each of the lateral edges 8. In each drainage section 11a,b, the length of the sheet 6 in a plane XY transverse to the cross-members 5, 5a, 5b (plane of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>) is greater than the distance between two consecutive cross-members 5,5a,5b, so as to form a drainage channel 12 between each pair of consecutive cross-members 5, 5a, 5b.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The drainage channel 12 is bounded by two folds 13a,b of each portion 10a,b,c,d,e of the sheet 6, which are joined to each other by means of stitching, or by adhesive means, or by thermowelding in the region of a bottom line 16 of the drainage channel 12. The bottom line 16 is curved, with the concavity facing towards the area of ground S, and comprises two ends 14 in the region of the lateral edges 8 and a high point 15, in a central area of the sheet 6, which separates the two drainage sections 11a,b from each other.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Each portion 10a,b,c,d,e of the sheet 6, in the region of the bottom line 16, comprises a slot 17 extending along said drainage channel 12 from one of the lateral edges 8 to the other. Each portion 10a,b,c,d,e of the sheet 6 comprises a rod-like elongate stiffening element 18 for the bottom line 16, inserted into the slot 17.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to an alternative embodiment of the invention, the sheet 6 comprises a single drainage section, with a drainage channel inclined from one of the lateral edges to the other, in a similar manner to the known awning 100 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. In the latter case the bottom of the drainage channel is rectilinear.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The awning 1 comprises tensioning means 20 secured to the sheet 6 at at least one securing point 21 in the region of the drainage channel 12 so as to place the sheet 6 under tension when it is in the second, extended position or, according to an alternative embodiment of the invention, when it is any position between the semi-extended position and the extended position.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The tensioning means 20 are located in the region of both the lateral edges 8, as shown in the appended drawings, or in the region of only one of the lateral edges, as in the version similar to that of the awning 100 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. Alternatively, in an alternative version which is not shown, the tensioning means 21 may be located in an intermediate position between the lateral edges 8.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The tensioning means 20 comprise a kinematic mechanism 22, located in the region of the lateral edge 8, movable in the plane XY, and secured to both of a pair of consecutive cross-members 5, 5a, 5b. The<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> kinematic mechanism 22 is of the quadrilateral type comprising a pair of cranks 23, each of which is hinged at one of its ends 23a to a respective cross-member of a pair of consecutive cross-members 5, 5a, 5b and a connecting rod 24 secured to the cranks 23 by means of a pair of respective hinges 25. Each of the portions 10a,b,c,d,e of the sheet 6 is secured to the connecting rod 24 at the securing point 21, located on the elongate element 18, in the region of one end of the bottom line 16 of the drainage channel 12.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Between the securing point 21 and the connecting rod 24 a resilient element, formed by the spring 26, is interposed.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In the gathered position (<figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref>) the spring 26 is slackened, while in the extended and/or intermediate position the spring 26 is tensioned.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">According to other alternative embodiments of the invention, as an alternative to the presence of the spring 26, the kinematic mechanism 22 comprises a resiliently deformable element. Between the resiliently deformable elements it is possible to use a telescopic crank 23 with springing between the two mutually slidable parts, or a crank divided into two parts which are connected to each other by means of a resilient hinge.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">According to other alternative embodiments, as an alternative to the use of resilient elements, the securing point 21 is connected directly to the connecting rod 24 (portions 10d,e of the sheet 6 in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>) and the sheet 6 is made of elastic fabric.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">When passing from the gathered position to the extended position, the sheet 6 is tensioned as a result of the connection between the securing point 21 and the tensioning means 20. Any excess tension on the sheet<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> which could lead to its breakage are avoided as a result of the presence of the spring 26 or of another resiliently deformable element of the tensioning means 20 or of the use of an elastic sheet.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The invention thus solves the problem of ensuring the correct tensioning of the sheet and in particular of the drainage channel in all operating conditions.
