load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to a new and improved user interface (UI) for a telephone handset. The UI of hand portable phones for cellular or cordless systems does not just support the call handling alone. In the recent generations of hand portable phones more and more new applications have been integrated in the phones. One of the latest applications is web browsers, e.g. the one offered by Unwired Planet.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Navigation among the menu items, handling of the individual applications and editing of text as input for the applications are very difficult to perform, because the most commonly used type of navigation is carried out by an up/down scroll key. When pressing the key three times, the cursor moves three steps. Scrolling in this way through the menu or through the phone book is very time-consuming.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP463856B"><text>EP 463856 B</text></patcit> suggests to substitute the scroll key with a roller ball or a thumb wheel. However, it is difficult to implement a roller ball known from a computer mouse into a hand portable phone. Today, the size of hand portable phones is comparable with the size of a mouse device for a computer.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, a thumb wheel has now been implemented in a small portable phone, and this is described in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP679003A"><text>EP 679003 A</text></patcit>. This thumb wheel is placed in the upper left corner of the phone. The wheel is quite small, but the diameter still prohibits a more user-friendly positioning. In general, the user wants to operate the phone by using only one hand, but the position of the thumb wheel forces the user to use a two-hand grip - the right thumb for operating the keys on the front cover and the left thumb for operating the thumb wheel. This means that the user is not able to make a call from the phone book when he is carrying a bag or just writing with the other hand. Left-handed users are compelled to use a right-handed grip.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Document <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP0531829A1"><text>EP0531829 A1</text></patcit> discloses a hand-held remote control housing (1) comprises a roller (7) to be manipulated by a finger. A movable bearing member (8) has a receiving portion (8a) to support a rotary shaft (7a) of the roller (7) and a pressing portion (8c) held in abutment against a push button switch (10). The bearing member (8) is angularly movable with respect to the case 1, around the axis of subs (8b). The axis of stubs (8b) and the axis of the rotary shaft (7a) are offset from each other. The rotary shaft (7a) and a rotary shaft (5a) of an encoder (5) are provided with respective pulleys (11,12) which are coupled to each other using a belt (13). In order to prevent water that can enter the housing (1) via the roller (7) to cause short circuits, the roller (7) is surrounded by a water receiving member (14) comprising a drainage passage (14b)</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In accordance with the invention there is provided a telephone handset having a front surface with a display and a keypad, wherein said keypad includes a group of<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> keys for entering alphanumeric signs and a key for navigating a cursor in the display, said navigation key is placed in the front surface of the phone between the display and the group of alphanumeric keys, said navigation key includes a roller body which extends partly though an opening in the front surface of the phone, and which is essentially cylindrical with a length and diameter of the same size as the width of the keys in said group of keys for entering alphanumeric signs. With the roller concept according to the invention the roller body will have a well-defined axis of rotation, and by providing the roller body with a cylindrical shape a part of the micro mechanics may be placed internally in the roller.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The invention provides a new and improved user interface for a telephone handset, said user interface including a roller body for scrolling though the items in the display and allowing the user to handle it by a one-hand grip.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">When the axis of rotation of the roller is provided such that it extends perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the phone, the scrolling through the items in the menu will be performed like the traditional scrolling, but the scrolling will be much faster. The user is allowed to slow down the speed of the scrolling when he is near the desired item.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">When the keys are arranged such that the navigation key is placed as an extension of the central column of the group of keys for entering alphanumeric signs, the navigation key is positioned in the resting point for the thumb. This is ergonomically a very good solution.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The phone is provided with means for detecting the rolling and depression of the navigation key, and the output from the detection means is fed to the controller which moves the cursor between items displayed in the display in dependence on the signal generated by the rolling and selects an item pointed out by the cursor in dependence on the signal generated by the depression.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The invention furthermore relates to a telephone handset having a front surface with a display and a keypad, wherein said keypad includes a key for navigating a cursor in the display controlled by a control unit. The navigation key is provided as a depressable roller body, and the control unit receives a first input signal representing the rolling of the roller body and a second input signal representing the pressing of the roller body for moving the cursor between items in the display and for selecting an item pointed out by the cursor, respectively. According to the invention the processor displays a list of available operations in the display upon pressing the roller body when the handset is in idle mode. Hereby it is possible to integrate a hot key or a power soft key functionality into the navigation key and to perform many of the most common operations by pressing and rolling this single navigation key. The power soft key list may be specified by the user.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The navigation key is very small according to the preferred embodiment, i.e. the length of said navigation key is of the order of 6-14 mm, and the maximum diameter of the roller body is of the order of 6-12 mm, thereby allowing the navigation key to be placed between the front cover of the phone and the main printed circuit board.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to the preferred embodiment of the handset according the invention, the structure of the navigation key for providing control signals in dependence on the operation thereof comprises a roller body acting as a navigation key, a carrier for carrying said roller body, a supporting means supporting said carrier, said carrier being hinged relative to the supporting means by cooperating hinging parts, biasing means for urging the carrier and the supporting means away from each other at a distance from said hinging parts, and detection means for detecting a force counteracting the biasing force provided by said biasing means and for providing a second control signal in dependence thereon. Hereby it is ensured that the depression movement at the return movement is well-defined without any risk of the structure being locked unintentionally due to friction.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The carrier furthermore carries an encoder means aligned with the roller body for detecting the rotation of said body and for providing a first control signal in<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> dependence thereon. According to the preferred embodiment of the invention the encoder means interacts with an electrical readable pattern provided on one end face of the roller body - actually the end face is protected by a surrounding collar partly protecting the engagement between the sliding shoe of the encoder and the electrical areas in said pattern.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The invention furthermore relates to a navigation key structure. The navigation key structure provides control signals in dependence on the operation of a roller body acting as a navigation key in the structure. The structure furthermore comprises a carrier for carrying said roller body, supporting means supporting said carrier, said carrier being hinged relatively to the supporting means by cooperating hinging parts. Biasing means is provided for urging the carrier and the supporting means away from each other at a distance from said hinging parts. Detection means is provided for detecting a force counteracting the biasing force provided by said biasing means and for providing a control signal in dependence thereon. Hereby it is ensured that the depression movement at the return movement is well-defined without any risk of the structure being locked unintentionally due to friction. Due to the architecture of the navigation key structure the overall size may be so small that the navigation key may be integrated in an existing UI concept for a phone, giving the user easy and substantially improved access to the functionality of the phone.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The roller body is arranged rotatably on a shaft part of the carrier, said shaft part being retained between two plate-shaped end parts, said end parts being furthermore adjoined by at least one beam-shaped leg part extending along the shaft part. Hereby the carrier is connected with the front cover/printed circuit board (the supporting means) via a hinged connection, and the roller is pivotally connected with the carrier. Hereby two pivotal movements are used, while the state of the art in general uses one pivotal movement and one linear movement. The two axes of rotation may advantageously be parallel.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The two plate-shaped end parts and said at least one beam-shaped leg part provide a stiff structure for the carrier. Preferably, the carrier comprises two leg parts in<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> parallel with the shaft part, and the hinge part of the carrier extends outwardly from one of said leg parts.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The roller body is formed as a barrel having a through bore for receiving said shaft part. Internally, the diameter of the through bore of the roller member expands at one end of the member for providing the roller body with a cavity containing a cam-shaped disc member for cooperation with a spring member fixed to said shaft part, thereby defining a number of discrete positions allowable during the revolution of the roller body. The cam-shaped disc member acts as an end wall for the chamber and is provided with a central opening for the shaft part.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The carrier furthermore carries an encoder means aligned with the roller body for detecting the rotation of said body and for providing a control signal in dependence thereon. The encoder means interacts with a pattern readable by the encoder means, and said pattern is provided on the outer surface of the disc-shaped member.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The encoder unit according to the invention is adapted for use in a telephone handset having a navigation key which is provided as a roller body. The roller body is provided with a pattern which is readable by the encoder unit, and said roller body is allowed to adopt a predetermined number of valid states. Upon detection of a change of state for said roller body, the encoder unit actively checks whether the detected change of state is valid. Advantageously this is done by successively testing the contact between the sliding shoes and the pattern one by one, said testing being performed by applying a signal to one of the sliding shoes and detecting the response on the other sliding shoes.

The phone 1 according to the preferred embodiment is adapted for communication via a cellular network, but could have been designed for a cordless network as well. The keypad 2 has a first group 7 of keys as alphanumeric keys, by means of which the user can enter a telephone number, write a text message (SMS), write a name (associated with the phone number), etc. Each of the twelve alphanumeric keys 7 is provided with a figure "0-9" or a sign "#" and "*", respectively.

The preferred embodiment of the phone of the invention is adapted for use in connection with the GSM network, but, of course, the invention may also be applied in connection with other phone networks, such as cellular networks and various forms of cordless phone systems. The microphone 6 records the user's speech, and the analog signals formed thereby are A/D converted in an A/D converter 15 before the speech is encoded in an audio codec unit 14. The encoded speech signal is transferred to a physical layer processor 17, which e.g. supports the GSM terminal software. The processor 17 also forms the interface to the peripheral units of the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> apparatus, including the memories (RAM, ROM), the display 3 and the keypad 2 (as well as SIM, data, power supply, etc.). The processor 17 communicates with the RF part 19 via a baseband converter 18 and a channel equalizer 16. The audio codec unit 14 speech-decodes the signal, which is transferred from the processor 17 to the earpiece 5 via a D/A converter 13. The units 13-18 are usually integrated in a chip set - either a commercially available one or in a set of specially designed chips (ASIC's).</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The processor 17, which serves as the controller unit in a manner known per se in the preferred embodiment, is connected to the user interface.

The carrier 23 comprises a beam 29 carrying the stub shaft 28 as hinge parts, a beam 30 and a shaft 24 carrying the roller body 20. The two beams 29, 30 and the shaft 24 are parallel and are interconnected by bearings 31, 35 at each end.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">A part of the roller body 20 extends through a close fitting opening (no contact) of the front cover 21 of the phone. The rear side of the front cover 21 is provided with two gripping arms 27 having U-shaped recesses 34 for receiving stub shafts 28, thereby, as a supporting means, defining a hinge axis for the carrier 23. The gripping arms 27 act as spacer members between the front cover 21 of the phone and the printed circuit board (PCB) 25.

The coil 26 urges the carrier 23 towards the stop legs 32. When the user depresses the roller with a force greater than the coil force (e.g. 3 N corresponding to appox. 300 g), the carrier will be urged against the micro switch 33 giving an output signal in dependence thereon.

It should for instance be possible to define the power soft key to be an easy dial key, entering a certain menu, toggling ringing on/off, etc. Compared with the generally used UI concept of the applicant known from Nokia 2110, Nokia 8110 and Nokia 3810, the power soft key will replace the up/down scroll key and act as a central soft key.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p id="p0064" num="0064">According to the preferred embodiment of the invention the power soft key will only be present in idle mode, which means not in menu, memory, etc. Hereby the power soft key will not be available during dialogue - either speech or data.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">In idle mode of the phone, pressing the roller key 20 is used for accessing a so-called "roller menu". The "roller menu" is an improvement of the "power soft key" or "hot key" known per se, and, according to the preferred embodiment, contains important functions as well as a number of user-defined favorite operations.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The "roller menu" hence has some main advantages. First of all the "roller menu" provides very easy access to re-dial list, phone book and menu functions - solely using the roller. Furthermore, the user is allowed to personalize his phone, which means offering an easy accessible list e.g. containing his favorite menus, web addresses, name entries or user-friendly access to voice dialing.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Furthermore, the "roller menu" makes it easier for the user to understand that the roller key 20 contains access to voice dialing, just as it makes the addition and the deletion of favorite items more obvious and thereby the menu more dynamic.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">When the cellular phone according to the invention is in idle mode, the display 3 may advantageously look as the upper image of <figref idrefs="f0007">fig. 10</figref>. An upper row in the display contains predefined icons indicating certain conditions of the phone, e.g. the envelope indicates that the phone has received an SMS message not yet read. Other icons may indicate the reception of voice mail, status of alphanumeric keypad, data transmission, etc. Time is displayed in the top right corner.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">The display has two vertical status bars - the left one indicates the signal strength and the right one indicates the battery level. The name or logo of the present network operator is displayed in the central part of the display. At the bottom of the display two fields 68 display the present functionality of the soft keys 8, and between these two fields a separate icon 69 indicates that pressing the navigation key 10 gives access to the power key functionality.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></p><p id="p0070" num="0070">When the power soft key functionality is placed in the roller navigation key 10 just below the display 3, the user gets a superb indication by the icon 69 that the navigation key 10 contains the power key functionality known per se. The use of the roller key having scrolling and selection functionality as a power soft key gives the user a superb opportunity to handle the major part of the activities with only one button. The use of a roller key as a navigation key just below the display gives the phone extraordinarily good qualities for one-handed use.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">It should be noted that the power soft key icon 69 and functionality is only present in idle mode, while the navigation key 10 is used for navigation and selection purposes in the other modes.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">Upon pressing of the navigation key 10, the phone enters the power soft key mode, and a user-defined list 70 containing the favorite operations of the user is displayed. The list is named "favorites", and the name is displayed at the top of the list. The first item in the list is marked by a cursor 72, which can be moved by rolling the navigation key 10, and the item pointed out may be selected by depressing the same key 10.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">The user can scroll in the list and select a certain item by pressing the roller. Selection of the "menu" item will for instance enter the normal menu structure. The power soft key defines links or short-cuts to operations in the phone book or in the menu.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">The power soft key menu may contain some user-defined favorite operations, and may advantageously contain three further items "re-dial", "names" and "menu".</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>Re-dial</u></b></heading><p id="p0075" num="0075">This item allows the user to re-dial the last dialed number, and/or to view the complete re-dial list.

The option key accesses a list when selected, and this list allows the user to handle operations on the highlighted power soft key menu item, and it allows the user to add new favorite/bookmark items to the power soft key menu. The options list is a standard selection list, and the different options are described in the following.
<ul><li><b>Select/Call</b><br/>
The first option on the left soft key 9 in the power soft key menu depends on what item is currently highlighted in the roller menu. If e.g. "menu", "names" or another selectable item is highlighted, the first option is "select". If a specific number, or the "re-dial" item is highlighted, the first option will be "call".</li><li><b>Add favorite</b><br/>
This item allows the user to add one of his own favorite functions to the power soft key menu. The added favorite will be added after the currently highlighted item in the power soft key menu.</li><li><b>Re-define</b><br/>
This item allows the user to re-define the current power soft key menu item to another one. This is basically handled in the same way as adding a new favorite to the power soft key menu, except that the selected item will replace the currently highlighted item.<br/>
When "re-define" is selected, the type of the currently highlighted power soft key menu item will be suggested as default in the favorites selection list. This<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> means that if e.g. the user re-defines an easy dial number, then the default highlighted favorite option type will be "easy dial".</li><li><b>Move to top</b><br/>
This item allows the user to customize the ordering of the power soft key menu. When the "move to top" item is selected, the currently highlighted power soft key menu item will be moved to the very top of the power soft key menu.<br/>
By doing this repeatedly for several items, the user can customize the power soft key menu.</li><li><b>Remove</b><br/>
This item allows the user to remove an item from the power soft key menu. Preferably, the user will be asked to confirm the removal. The user can also remove the "standard" items in the power soft key menu, e.g. "re-dial", and add them again, if needed.</li><li><b>Re-name</b><br/>
The "re-name" item allows the user to customize the power soft key menu, too. This is handled using the normal text editing windows, with the previous name as default, the editor limiting the maximum text to be entered to the screen width. The user can of course also re-name the "standard" items in the power soft key menu, e.g. "re-dial".</li></ul></p><heading id="h0009"><b><u>Assigning favorites to the power soft key menu</u></b></heading><p id="p0084" num="0084">The user is allowed to add a certain number (e.g. 20) of his own personal favorite features, numbers and bookmarks to the power soft key menu.
