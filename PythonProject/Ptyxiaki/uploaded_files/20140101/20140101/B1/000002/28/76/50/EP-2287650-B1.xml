invention relates to a zoom lens and an image pickup apparatus equipped with the same. The present invention can suitably be applied to broadcast television cameras, video cameras, digital still cameras, and film cameras.</p><heading id="h0003">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In recent years, zoom lenses having a high zoom ratio, a wide angle of view, and high optical performance have been demanded for use in image pickup apparatuses such as television cameras, film cameras, digital cameras, and video cameras. As zoom lenses having a high zoom ratio and a wide angle of view, positive-lead type, four-unit zoom lenses that have four lens units in total including a lens unit having a positive refractive power disposed closest to the object side have been known. A known four-unit zoom lens of this type comprises, in order from the object side to the image side, a first lens unit for focusing, a second lens unit having a negative refractive power for zooming, a third lens unit having a negative refractive power for correcting image plane variations during zooming, and a fourth lens unit having a positive refractive power for imaging. Four-unit zoom lenses of this type having a high zoom ratio and a wide angle of view have been known from <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6124982A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,124,982</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5966246A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,966,246</text></patcit>, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JPH09258102B"><text>H09-258102</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6545818B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,545,818</text></patcit>. These patent documents disclose zoom lenses having a zoom ratio of approximately 10 to 12, an angle of view of approximately 80° to 100° at the wide angle end.<br/>
The positive-lead type four-unit zoom lens can relatively easily designed to have a high zoom ratio and a wide angle of view. However, if it has a zoom ratio as high as 10 and an angle of view as wide as 80° or wider, large variations of aberrations will occur during zooming, making it difficult to achieve high optical performance throughout the entire zoom range. In particular at zoom positions near the telephoto end, large magnification chromatic aberration and on-axis chromatic aberration occur. Therefore, in order to achieve performance that provides high quality images, it is important to achieve good correction of chromatic aberration in terms of not only first-order spectrum but also second-order spectrum. In order to achieve good correction of chromatic aberration and high optical performance while achieving a high zoom ratio of approximately 10 and a wide angle of view of 80° or wider in the four-unit zoom lens of this type, appropriate lens configuration of the first lens unit is an important factor. Inappropriate lens configuration of the first lens unit lead to large variations in aberrations such as chromatic aberration, spherical aberration, halo, and coma, making it difficult to achieve high performance with a high zoom ratio and a wide angle of view. In particular, when a zoom lens is designed to have a high zoom ratio of approximately 10 and a wide angle of view<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> of approximately 100° at the wide angle end, large on-axis chromatic aberration tends to occur at the telephoto end. Furthermore, large residual aberrations with respect to second-order spectrum tend to remain. It is difficult to correct these aberrations satisfactorily.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Prior art which is related to this field of technology can be found e.g. in document <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="EP1052535A1"><text>EP 1 052 535 A1</text></patcit> disclosing a zoom lens, document <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>SMITH W J ED - SMITH W J: "Modern optical engineering: the design of optical systems", 1 January 1966 (1966-01-01), MODERN OPTICAL ENGINEERING, MCGRAW-HILL, NEW YORK, NY, US, PAGE(S) 145-150, 248</text></nplcit> discussing secondary spectrum contribution, document <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>LONGHURST R S ED - LONGHURST R S.

The partial unit 1b (movable partial unit) in the first lens unit is a unit having a positive refractive power that is used for focusing. The partial unit 1c (rear side partial unit) in the first lens unit F is a fixed unit having a positive refractive power.

In <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 13</figref>, the image pickup apparatus 125 has a zoom lens 101 according to any one of the first to fourth embodiments and a camera 124. The zoom lens 101 is detachably mounted on the camera 124. The image pickup apparatus 125 is composed of the camera 124 and the zoom lens 101 mounted thereon. The zoom lens 101 includes a first lens unit F, a magnification changing section (magnification changing lens unit) LZ, and a fourth lens unit R for imaging. The lens unit F includes a focusing lens unit. The magnification changing section LZ includes a second lens unit V that moves along the optical axis for magnification changing (zooming) and a third lens unit C that moves along the optical axis for compensating variations of the image plane during magnification changing.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">The image pickup apparatus 125 has an aperture stop SP. The fourth lens unit R includes a front lens unit 4F and a rear lens unit 4B, and a lens unit IE that can be inserted/retracted into/out of the optical path. The lens unit IE provides a shift of the focal length range of the entire system of the zoom lens 101. The zoom lens 101 is provided with drive mechanisms 114 and 115 including helicoids and cams that drive the lens unit F and the magnification changing section LZ respectively in the direction along the optical axis. There are also provided motors (drive units) 116 to 118 that electrically drive the<!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --> drive mechanisms 114, 115 and the aperture stop SP. There are also provided detectors 119 to 121 such as encoders, potentiometers, or photo sensors that detect or sense the positions of the first lens unit F and the magnification changing section LZ on the optical axis and the stop diameter of the aperture stop SP. The camera 124 has a glass block 109 such as an optical filter or color separating prism provided and a solid state image pickup element (or photoelectric transducer element) 110 such as a CCD sensor or a CMOS sensor that receives an object image formed by the zoom lens 101. The image pickup apparatus 125 also has a CPUs 111 and 122 that control various operations of the camera 124 and the zoom lens 101.
