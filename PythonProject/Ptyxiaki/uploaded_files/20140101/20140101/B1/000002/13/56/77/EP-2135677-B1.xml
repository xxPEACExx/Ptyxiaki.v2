Further, a toggle plate 82 is installed on both ends of a bottom between the adjusting base 81 and the moving base 60, and a pull rod 83 of the moving base 60 installs a compression spring for tightly pressing the toggle plate 82. Since the fixed end of the toggle plate 82 is disposed at the bottom and the moving end of the toggle<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> plate 82 is disposed at the top, therefore most of the inertia effects is provided by the moving base 60 during the crushing process, and the inertia effect of a belt pulley and a flywheel is smaller than the conventional one, so as to reduce the weight of the belt pulley and the flywheel. Since the crushing travel distance and angle at the bottom of the moving base 60 are moved repeatedly from the moving die 62 to the lower side of the fixed die 71, therefore the life of the fixed die 71 is generally longer than the traditional one. The present invention is a breakthrough, particularly at the time when the price of raw materials is high. In the crushing process of the structure of the toggle plate 82, the moving die 62 is moved repeatedly with respect to the lower side of the fixed die 71. Compared with the traditional structure of repeatedly moving the moving die 62 towards the upper side of the fixed die 71, the crushing effect of the invention is better, and the production capacity is higher. However, a pull rod 83 of the moving base 60 is connected to the first link rod 84, and an end of the first link rod 84 is pivotally coupled to a stop plate 94 of the automatic crush gap adjusting mechanism 90, and another end of the first link rod 84 is coupled to an end of a second rod 85, and another end of the second rod 85 is coupled to the moving base 60.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0005">Figs. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">6</figref>, the automatic crush gap adjusting mechanism 90 arranges and fixes a steel slot 91 of a stop plate 94 and a pair of triangular wedge-shaped lumps 92 to a position adjusting base 93 of the machine 50 and installs the stop plate 94 between the steel slot 91 of the stop plate 94 and the middle section of the crush travel adjusting base 81. A pull rod 95 of the adjusting base having a compression spring tightly presses the stop plate 94 to<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> adjust the position of the pair of triangular wedge-shaped lumps 92 to change the position of the steel slot 91 of the stop plate 94, such that the crush gap W between the moving die 62 and the fixed die 71 can be set by the stop plate 94, the crush travel adjusting base 81, the toggle plate 82 and the moving base 60. Unlike the traditional structure that requires loosening the spring and securing the spring after the adjustment is made, the present invention provides a more convenient way of adjusting the crush gap without the need of loosening the spring and securing the spring.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In addition, the triangular wedge-shaped lump 92 is connected to a moving end of a pushing rod 96, and a fixed end of the pushing rod 96 is pivotally connected to a support stand 97 of the position adjusting base 93, wherein the pushing rod 96 can be a hydraulic cylinder. However, if an unintended crushing object such as a shovel bucket or a tungsten carbide drill of a rock borer enters into a crushing chamber, the crushing pressure will become very large and exceed the safety setting of a hydraulic circuit, and the triangular wedge-shaped lump 92 will retreat quickly to increase the crush gap and allow the unintended crushing object to pass through the crushing chamber quickly, so as to achieve the effects of preventing a damage to components, protecting the machine, and eliminating an abnormal too-large load.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Further, a blanking shock absorption mechanism 100 installed at a lower lateral side of a blanking opening includes a shock absorption base 102 with an impact plate 101 pivotally coupled to a lower lateral side of the blanking opening, and the shock absorption base 102 is connected to a vibration absorption spring 103 in an opposition direction of the impact plate 101 for<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> absorbing an impact force when crushed substances drop to prevent a direct impact onto the receiving components or a damage to the components.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0007">Figs. 7 and 8</figref>, the angle of installing the eccentric sleeve 812 to the machine 50 can be adjusted to change the angle of the toggle plate 82 or the crush travel distance. For a crushing substance with a smaller compressive strength, a larger crush travel distance can be chosen to improve the production capacity. For a crushing substance with a higher compressive strength, a smaller crush travel distance can be chosen to lower the load of each component, avoiding damages to components, and enhancing the life of components. Obviously, the effect of adjusting the crush travel distance by an eccentrically set angle is applicable for all kinds of crushing substances.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0008">Figs. 9</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">10</figref>, the way of installing an eccentric shaft 61 of the moving base 60 to the machine 50 is to fix the bearing housing 51 into a bearing housing hole 53 of an integral sideboard 52 on both sides, and along the periphery of the bearing housing hole 53, and a plurality of support rods 54 are secured uniformly between the two sideboards 52 for providing a uniform support to the bearing housing and improving the rigidity of an frame. However, the machine 50 is comprised of two sideboards 52 installed to the moving base 60 and other sideboards (not shown in the figure) installed at other positions, and the design comes with a modular block installation, so that the components of the machine 50 can be transported separately to a site for its installation, and thus lowering the transportation cost and providing a convenient way of transporting the machine 50.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Based on the aforementioned structure, the automatic crush gap adjusting<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> mechanism 90 of the invention uses the pushing force of the pushing rod 96 to operate together with the pulling force of the pull rod 83 of the moving base and the pull rod 95 of the adjusting base, such that the lateral component force produced by sliding the triangular wedge-shaped lump 92 pushes the steel slot 91 of the stop plate 94 and the stop plate 94, and the deflection of the crush travel adjusting base 81 and the pushing of the toggle plate 82 onto the moving base 60 can be used for setting the crush gap W between the moving die and the fixed die. With such arrangement, the pair of triangular wedge-shaped lumps 92 can be moved to set the crush gap in 1-2 minutes without requiring any other procedure. The invention provides a simple, easy and quick way of setting the crush gap.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">7</figref>, the crush travel adjusting base 81 is comprised of a transverse beam and a slab connected between two arc I-beams, and the position pressed by its corresponding toggle plate 82 is a force exertion point, and the position pressed by the stop plate 94 and disposed between its pivotal shaft and force exertion point is a fixed point. The flexibility of the I-beam allows the crush travel adjusting base 81 to produce a curvature at sections below the fixed point to offset any abnormal load and provide an effect of absorbing an abnormally too-large load.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Many changes and modifications in the above-described embodiments of the invention can, of course, be carried out without departing from the scope thereof.
