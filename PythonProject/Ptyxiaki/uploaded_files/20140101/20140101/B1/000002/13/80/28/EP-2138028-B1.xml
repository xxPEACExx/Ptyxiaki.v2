load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a beating apparatus, particularly for beating olives and the like.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Beating is a historically known operation aimed at causing the fruits of a plant to fall in order to pick them.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Beating methods generally provide for an operation for shaking the branches of the plant in order to cause the separation of the fruits from them.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">This shaking is performed with the aid of tools that can be simple sticks or rakes or equipment dedicated to this, such as modem beating units.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">These units have, at an active end of an elongated handle, devices provided with rods moved by a motor.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The operator inserts the moving rods among the branches of the tree, so such rods shake the branches and optionally strike them, causing the fruits to fall from them.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Various types of beating apparatus are currently known, some of which have a circular head that is supported by the working end of the handle and support perimetrically rods which rotate according to a conical path.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Another currently known apparatus has, at the working end of the handle, a pair of oscillating sectors that are shaped like a rake and are pivoted symmetrically on opposite sides of the working end.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Motor means actuate the symmetrical oscillation of the oscillating sectors, which, when inserted among the branches of a tree, shake them, further allowing, by way of their rake-like configuration, a combing operation thereof, to the full advantage of rapid and effective beating of the fruits.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In one currently known model of beating apparatus, such motor means comprise an electric motor, which is supported at the end of the handle that lies opposite its working end, and a mechanical transmission,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> passing within the handle functionally connects the motor to a piston device that actuates the symmetrical oscillation of the oscillating sectors.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Although it is currently greatly appreciated, this apparatus has some aspects that can be improved.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In fact, when both oscillating sectors act on a branch simultaneously, due to their symmetrical oscillation the action of one of them is antagonist with respect to the other one, so as to inhibit the shaking effect on the branch.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the field of beating, therefore, the need is felt currently for apparatuses that allow effective shaking of the branches while simultaneously avoiding damage thereof b friction or percussion.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="ES1067051U"><text>ES 1067051-U</text></patcit> discloses a beating apparatus as defined in the preamble of claim 1.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The aim of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for beating, particularly for beating olives and the like, that meets this requirement, allowing more effective shaking of the branches on which it acts with respect to currently known apparatuses.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Within this aim, an object of the invention is to provide a beating apparatus that is easy to use and maneuverable as well as reliable over time.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Another object of the invention is to provide a beating apparatus that is structurally simple and easy to use and can be manufactured with relatively low costs.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">This aim and these and other objects, which will become better apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a beating apparatus, particularly for beating olives and the like, as defined in claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will

reference numeral 10 generally designates a beating apparatus, particularly for beating olives and the like, which comprises an elongated handle 11 that has, at a working end 12, a supporting body 13 to which at least one oscillating sector 14 provided with beating rods 15 is articulated.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Advantageously, the rods 15 are made of carbon fibers, have a tubular structure and mutually diverge so as to define a large region of action during use.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A particularity of the beating apparatus 10 is that it comprises a linkage element 16, which functionally interconnects a crank element 17 to the oscillating sector 14 in order to impart thereto, during use, an oscillating motion.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The crank element 17 is functionally connected to motor means 18 in order to be actuated by them during use.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the embodiment described here by way of non-limiting example, the beating apparatus 10 advantageously has two oscillating sectors 14, which are functionally connected by way of two linkage elements 16 to the crank element 17.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In particular, the crank element 17 conveniently has an eccentric pivot 17a, to which a first one 16a and a second one 16b of the linkage elements 16 are rotatably connected, such linkage elements being respectively connected rotatably to a first one 14a and a second one 14b of the oscillating sectors 14, thus interconnecting them functionally to the crank element 17.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The kinematic structure thus defined, during use of the beating apparatus 10, imposes an oscillation to the first oscillating sector 14a that is phase-shifted with respect to the oscillation of the second one 14b of the oscillating sectors 14.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The first one 14a and the second one 14b of the oscillating sectors 14 preferably comprise elongated bodies 19 for supporting the rods 15, which are pivoted by means of corresponding fulcrums 20 to arms 21 of the supporting body 13, which is fork-shaped.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Moreover, the first linkage element 16a and the second linkage element 16b are functionally rotatably connected, by way of corresponding articulation pivots 22, to the respective elongated bodies 19, substantially at<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> first longitudinal ends 23 thereof.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Moreover, the oscillating sectors 14 are conveniently laterally adjacent and have facing first longitudinal ends 23, the rods 15 comprising first rods 15a that protrude obliquely from the first longitudinal ends 23 so as to cross each other at an angle during use, so as to define interfering areas of action.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In this manner, the branches which, during use of the beating apparatus 10, are substantially in an intermediate position with respect to the oscillating sectors 14 are shaken by them by the combined and opposite action of the first rods 15a.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Advantageously, the motor means 18 comprise an electric motor 24, which is conveniently associated with the supporting body 13, and a speed reduction unit 25, preferably of the gear train type, which functionally interconnects the electric motor 24 and the crank element 17.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Moreover, the motor means 18 conveniently have a cable 26 for the supply of electric power to the electric motor 24, the handle 11 having a telescopic tubular structure that accommodates internally a spiral portion 26a of the cable 26, which by divarication and compaction of its turns makes the cable 26 adaptable to the extension of the handle 11.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">At one actuation end 27 of the handle 11 that lies opposite the working end there is conveniently a knob 28, which can be gripped by the user and is equipped with a switch button 29 that is functionally connected to the cable 26 in order to control the activation of the electric motor 24.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Moreover, an alternative embodiment of the beating apparatus 10 comprises a handle 11 composed of two tubular bodies 30 and 31 which are able to slide telescopically inside each other. The first one 30 of the tubular bodies 30 and 31 is provided with a key 32, which is inserted slidingly in a longitudinal slot 33 provided on the second one 31 of the tubular bodies 30 and 31, to contrast their mutual rotation about an axis that is longitudinal with respect to them.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Thus, since mutual rotation of the tubular bodies 30 and 31 of the handle 11 is prevented, the cable 26, which passes within them, is not twisted during the handling of the beating apparatus 10, to the full advantage of its durability over time.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Likewise, in alternative embodiments, not shown in the accompanying figures, the handle comprises more than two tubular bodies, which are provided for example with keys that protrude internally and with external slots in which the keys slide for the telescopic extension of the handle.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Likewise, in substantially equivalent embodiments the keys are replaced with longitudinal ribs.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">According to a further embodiment of the beating apparatus 10 the oscillating sectors 14 comprise an elongated body 19 that is provided with substantially conical through seats 34, which are designed to receive by insertion complementarily shaped conical heads 35 that are fixed to ends of the rods 15, the conical heads 35 having
<ul><li>means 36 for preventing the extraction of the conical heads 35 inserted in the seats 34,</li><li>longitudinal rotation-preventing fins 37, which are inserted in corresponding recesses 38 provided in the seats 34, when the conical heads 35 are inserted in the seats 34, to contrast their mutual rotation.</li></ul></p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Conveniently, the extraction-preventing means 36 comprise screws 39 for tensioning the conical heads 35 in the seats 34, such tension screws abutting against a perimetric edge 40 of an exit hole 41 of the seats 34.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In this manner, the conical heads 35 are retained in the seats 34 by the tension screws 39 and cannot rotate thanks to the engagement of the longitudinal fins 37 in the recesses 38.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The rotation of the conical heads 35 in the seats 34 and the consequent wearer and loosening of the rods 15 with respect to the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> elongated bodies 19 is thus avoided.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In an alternative embodiment, illustrated by way of non-limiting example in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 7</figref>, the oscillating sectors 14 comprise an elongated body 19, which is provided with substantially conical through seats 134, which are designed to receive by insertion complementarily shaped conical heads 135 that are fixed to ends of the rods 15.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The conical heads 135 have
<ul><li>means 136 for preventing the extraction of the conical heads 135 that are inserted in the seats 134, which conveniently comprise pawl-shaped heads 142 provided at the ends of the conical heads 135 inserted in the seats 134, and are adapted to engage a perimetric edge 140 of their exit hole 141 in order to retain thereat the conical heads 135</li><li>rotation-preventing longitudinal fins 137, which are inserted in corresponding recesses 138 provided in the seats 134, when the conical heads 135 are inserted in the seats 134, to contrast their mutual rotation.</li></ul></p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The operation of the beating apparatus 10 according to the invention is as follows.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The operator adjusts the extension of the handle 11 by acting on its telescopic structure.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Then, by acting on the switch button 29, he/she activates the electric motor 24, which by means of the speed reduction unit 25 turns the crank element 17.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The oscillating sectors 14a and 14b are thus made to oscillate by the respective linkage elements 16a and 16b, which make them oscillate with different phases.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In this manner, the branches on which the rods 15 of both the oscillating sectors 14 act simultaneously are not subjected by the first oscillating sector 14a to an action that is antagonist with respect to the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> action that they receive simultaneously from the second oscillating sector 14b.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">This leads to an effective shaking of the branches, to the full advantage of efficient beating of the fruits that they carry.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In practice it has been found that the invention achieves the intended aim and objects, providing a beating apparatus, particularly for beating olives and the like, that allows effective shaking of the branches on which it acts, preventing on them an antagonist action of the beating rods by way of their phase-shifted oscillating motion, which is ensured by the actuation by means of the two linkage elements that are moved simultaneously by the crank element.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Further, a beating apparatus according to the invention is structurally simple and compact, since the electric motor is arranged directly at the working end of the handle, so that devices for transmitting motion through the handle, as in currently known beating apparatuses, are not needed.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The absence of such transmission devices with respect to the ones that comprise them allows to obtain beating apparatuses which, provided according to the invention, are lighter and therefore easier to handle and use.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">A beating apparatus according to the invention is further reliable and durable over time, since it has a speed reduction unit with a gear cascade which, as is known, is a highly reliable mechanical transmission means.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The invention thus conceived is susceptible of numerous modifications and variations, all of which are within the scope of the appended claims.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In practice, the materials used, as well as the contingent shapes and dimensions, may be any according to requirements and according to the state of the art.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Where technical features mentioned in any claim are followed by reference signs, those reference signs have been included for the sole purpose of increasing the intelligibility of the claims and accordingly such reference signs do not have any limiting effect on the interpretation of each element identified by way of example by such reference signs.</p></description><claims
