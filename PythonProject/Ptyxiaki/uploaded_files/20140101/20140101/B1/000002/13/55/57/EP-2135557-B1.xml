load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus for extracting and displaying a minute structure in a living body organ from an echo signal of tissue.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In ultrasonic diagnosis, heart beats and fetal movements can be displayed in real time through a simple operation of placing an ultrasonic probe over the surface of a body. Since ultrasonic diagnosis has a high level of safety, ultrasonic diagnostic tests can be performed repeatedly. Further, an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus is smaller than other diagnostic apparatuses employing X-rays, CT, and MRI, for example. Thus, ultrasonic diagnosis is a simple and easy diagnostic scheme, allowing the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus to be easily moved to the bedside for diagnosis, for example.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Ultrasonic diagnostic apparatuses vary greatly depending on the kind of functions equipped therein. Among compact types, ultrasonic diagnostic apparatuses which can be carried with one hand have been developed. Unlike the use of X-rays, for example, ultrasonic diagnosis is free from the influence of exposure to radiation, and can be used in obstetrics or home medical care, for example.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">One of ultrasonic diagnoses offering various advantages as described above is early diagnosis for<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> breast cancer. It is known that microcalcifications occur in breast tissue with a high frequency as a sign of breast cancer. One or more microcalcification lesions are topically scattered. Since calcium is higher in hardness than body tissue, calcium reflects ultrasound well. Microcalcification lesions should therefore have high brightness on an image. In actuality, however, when an image is observed by the eye, it is said that microcalcification lesions even with the size of approximately several hundred microns are difficult to be detected.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">On an ultrasonic image, interference fringes called a speckle pattern, which is caused by random interference of ultrasound, may occur. A speckle pattern is used for diagnosis of cirrhosis.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A speckle pattern closely resembles microstructures which are often overlooked in a diagnosis for breast cancer, and can be confusing image information for diagnosis in some cases. Thus, in a diagnosis for breast cancer, there is a need for removal of a speckle pattern.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In view of the above-described circumstances, techniques such as spatial compounding, a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) process, and similarity filtering. The spatial compounding is a process of superimposing transmission and reception signals from different directions and smoothing speckles. The CFAR process is a process of subtracting a neighboring average of brightness from the target pixel, and uses the subtracted result to extract high-brightness portions. The similarity filtering is a process of removing speckles using its statistical properties. As well as the above-described techniques for removal of speckle patterns, in fields other than the ultrasonic diagnosis, various attempts to automatically recognize microcalcifications have been reported mainly as applications of X-ray diagnosis images.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The mammary gland, which is a target of a diagnosis, has a complex structure especially in the lactiferous duct, for example, and is not a homogenous organ in nature. Thus, according to the conventional filtering process, upon detection of microcalcifications, the mammary gland structure is also extracted as a structure, and the two cannot be distinguished sufficiently.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Since structures such as the lactiferous duct are clearly larger than microcalcifications, the two can sometimes be distinguished by the eye even if the lactiferous duct remains after the filtering process. However, the inventors have often experienced difficulties in making such a distinction in research. In particular, when only a part of the mammary gland structure remains, the remaining mammary gland structure may look similar to microcalcifications, since the mammary gland structure is shown as dots on an image after the filtering process.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Furthermore, a speckle pattern on an image may vary randomly. In such a case, even after performing a predetermined speckle reduction process, speckles remain, which makes it difficult to distinguish between the remaining speckles and calcified parts.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In view of such circumstances, Japanese Patent KOKAI Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2007313114A"><text>2007-313114</text></patcit> discloses the following technique. That is, Japanese Patent KOKAI Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2007313114A"><text>2007-313114</text></patcit> discloses an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus for image processing of extracting a microstructure using a first ultrasonic image and a second ultrasonic image determined based on the position of the first ultrasonic image, comprising an image processing means for generating a microstructure-extracted image by performing a microstructure extraction process of calculating a difference from a maximum pixel value of a reference region in the second ultrasonic image including a spatially corresponding<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> pixel, with respect to each pixel in the first ultrasonic image, and display means for displaying the microstructure-extracted image in a predetermined form.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent KOKAI Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2007313114A"><text>2007-313114</text></patcit>, by using spatial three-dimensional information instead of a slice of a tomogram in signal processing, continuous structures such as the mammary gland and microstructures such as microcalcified parts are accurately distinguished, and the microstructures can be extracted.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">An ultrasonic probe used in the technique disclosed in Japanese Patent KOKAI Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2007313114A"><text>2007-313114</text></patcit> is capable of ultrasonically scanning a three-dimensional region of a test body. Accordingly, ultrasonic probes used in the technique disclosed in Japanese Patent KOKAI Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2007313114A"><text>2007-313114</text></patcit> include an ultrasonic probe (referred to as a mechanical 4D ultrasonic probe) with a configuration in which a vibrator mechanically vibrates in an orthogonal direction of its arranging direction and a three-dimensional region is ultrasonically scanned, and an ultrasonic probe (referred to as a real-time 3D ultrasonic probe) with a configuration in which a three-dimensional region is ultrasonically scanned by electric control using two-dimensional vibration elements arranged two-dimensionally.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the mechanical 4D ultrasonic probe, the test body is three-dimensionally scanned by the vibrator circuit. The tester can therefore automatically acquire a plurality of two-dimensional tomograms only by making the main body of the ultrasonic probe contact the test body. Further, an accurate distance between the cross-sections can also be detected from the controlled vibration rate. In the real-time 3D ultrasonic probe, on the other hand, a three-dimensional region can be ultrasonically scanned in<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> principle in a time same as that required for acquiring the conventional two-dimensional tomograms.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Because of the size and weight, however, the mechanical 4D ultrasonic probe has problems of difficulty in scanning for capturing a minute structure and insufficiency in real-time properties. Further, the real-time 3D ultrasonic probe conceivably requires further time for development.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO2007114375A1"><text>WO 2007/114375 A1</text></patcit> discloses an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus comprising<br/>

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus 1 comprises an ultrasonic probe 12, an apparatus main body 11, an input device 13, and a monitor 14.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The ultrasonic probe 12 generates ultrasound based on a driving signal from an ultrasonic transmission unit 21, and comprises a plurality of piezoelectric vibrators for converting a reflection wave from a test body into an electrical signal, a matching layer provided in the piezoelectric vibrator, and a packing material for preventing propagation of ultrasound from the piezoelectric vibrator to the rear side, for example. When ultrasound is transmitted to a test body P from the ultrasonic probe 12, the transmitted ultrasound is reflected off a discontinuous surface of an acoustic impedance of body tissue in turn, and received by the ultrasonic probe 12 as an echo signal. The amplitude of the echo signal depends on differences in acoustic impedance in the discontinuous surface, off which the reflection occurs. Further, an echo received when a transmitted ultrasonic pulse is reflected off the surface of the moving bloodstream or heart wall depends on velocity components of the moving body in the ultrasonic transmission direction by the Doppler effect, and receives a frequency shift.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The apparatus main body 11 comprises the ultrasonic transmission unit 21, an ultrasonic reception unit 22, a B-mode processing unit 23, a Doppler processing unit 24, an image generation unit 25, an image memory 26, an image synthesis part 27, a control processor (CPU) 28, an internal memory part 29, and an interface part 30.

The pulser circuit repeatedly generates a rate pulse for forming transmission ultrasound at a predetermined rate frequency of fr Hz (period: 1/fr second). In the delay circuit, a delay time required to make ultrasonic waves converge into a beam in each channel and determine transmission directivity is given to each rate pulse. The trigger generating circuit applies a driving pulse to the ultrasonic probe 12 in a timing based on the rate pulse.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The ultrasonic transmission unit 21 has a function of instantly changing transmission frequencies, transmission drive voltages, and so forth, in order to perform a predetermined scan sequence according to instructions from the control processor 28. In particular, the change in transmission drive voltage is provided by an oscillator circuit of a linear amplifier type capable of switching the value instantly, or by a mechanism of switching a plurality of power supply units electrically.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The ultrasonic reception unit 22 includes, for example, an amplifier circuit, an analog-to-digital converter, and an adder, not shown. The amplifier circuit amplifies an echo signal captured through the ultrasonic probe 12 in each channel. The analog-to-digital converter supplies the amplified echo signal with a delay time required to determine reception directivity, and then the adder performs an adding process. This addition emphasizes reflection components from a direction according to the reception directivity of the echo signal, and the reception directivity and the transmission directivity form a general beam for ultrasonic transmission and reception.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The B-mode processing unit 23 receives an echo signal from the ultrasonic reception unit 22, subjects the echo signal to logarithmic amplification and an<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> envelope detection process, and generates data whose signal intensity is expressed by brightness. This data is transmitted to the image generation unit 25, and displayed as a B-mode image, in which intensity of a reflected wave is expressed by brightness, on the monitor 14.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The Doppler processing unit 24 performs a frequency analysis for velocity information on the echo signal received from the ultrasonic reception unit 22, extracts echo components of the bloodstream, tissue, and a contrast agent by the Doppler effect, and obtains bloodstream information such as average velocity, dispersion, and power with respect to many points.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In general, the image generation unit 25 converts (scan-converts) a scanning line signal string of an ultrasonic scan into a scanning line signal string of a general video format as represented by television, for example, and generates an ultrasonic diagnostic image as a display image.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Further, the image generation unit 25 performs various kinds of image processing other than scan conversion.
