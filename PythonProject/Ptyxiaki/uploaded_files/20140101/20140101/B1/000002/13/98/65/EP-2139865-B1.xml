BACKGROUND</b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">Different solid forms of the same compound can have substantially different properties. For example, the amorphous form of a drug may exhibit different dissolution characteristics and different bioavailability patterns than its crystalline form(s), properties which can affect how the drug must be administered to achieve optimal effect. Amorphous and crystalline forms of a drug may also have different handling properties (<i>e.g.,</i> flowability, compressibility), dissolution rates, solubilities and stabilities, all of which can affect the manufacture of dosage forms. Consequently, access to multiple forms of a drug is desirable for a variety of reasons. Moreover, regulatory authorities (<i>e.g.,</i> the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) may require the identification of all solid (<i>e.g.,</i> polymorphic) forms of a new drug substance before approving products containing it. <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>A. Goho, Science News 166(8):122-123(2004</text></nplcit>).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Compounds may exist in one or more crystalline forms, but the existence and characteristics of those forms cannot be predicted with any certainty. In addition, no standard procedure exists for the preparation of all possible polymorphic forms of a compound. And even after one polymorph has been identified, the existence and characteristics of other forms can only be determined by additional experimentation. <i>Id.</i></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The compound <i>(E)</i>-1-(4-((1R,2S,3R)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroxybutyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)ethanone oxime affects the sphingosine-1-phosphate pathway, and is believed to be useful in the treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and type I diabetes.

The terms encompass modulating the threshold, development and/or duration of the disease or disorder, or changing the way that a patient responds to the disease or disorder.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Unless otherwise indicated, the terms "prevent," "preventing" and "prevention" contemplate an action that occurs before a patient begins to suffer from the specified disease or disorder, which inhibits or reduces the severity of the disease or disorder. In other words, the terms encompass prophylaxis.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Unless otherwise indicated, a "prophylactically effective amount" of a compound is an amount sufficient to prevent a disease or condition, or one or more symptoms associated with the disease or condition, or prevent its recurrence. A prophylactically effective amount of a compound means an amount of therapeutic agent, alone or in combination with other agents, which provides a prophylactic benefit in the prevention of the disease. The term "prophylactically effective amount" can encompass an amount that improves overall prophylaxis or enhances the prophylactic efficacy of another prophylactic agent.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Unless otherwise indicated, a solid that is "substantially amorphous" is substantially free of crystalline compound. Examples of a substantially amorphous solid compound contain less than about 20, 15, 10, 5, 3 or 1 weight percent crystalline compound.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Unless otherwise indicated, a solid that is "substantially crystalline" is substantially free of amorphous compound.

Examples of dosage forms include, but are not limited to: tablets; caplets; capsules, such as soft elastic gelatin capsules; cachets; troches; lozenges; dispersions; suppositories; ointments; cataplasms (poultices); pastes; powders; dressings; creams; plasters; solutions; patches; aerosols (<i>e.g.,</i> nasal sprays or inhalers); gels; liquid dosage forms suitable for oral or mucosal administration to a patient, including suspensions (<i>e.g.,</i> aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspensions, oil-in-water emulsions, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsions), solutions, and elixirs; liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient; and sterile solids (<i>e.g.,</i> crystalline or amorphous solids) that can be reconstituted to provide liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The formulation should suit the mode of administration. For example, oral administration requires enteric coatings to protect the compounds of this invention from degradation within the gastrointestinal tract. Similarly, a formulation may contain ingredients that facilitate delivery of the active ingredient(s) to the site of action. For example, compounds may be administered in liposomal formulations, in order to protect them from degradative enzymes, facilitate transport in circulatory system, and effect delivery across cell membranes to intracellular sites.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The composition, shape, and type of a dosage form will vary depending on its use. For example, a dosage form used in the acute treatment of a disease may contain larger amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than a dosage form used in the chronic treatment of the same disease. Similarly, a parenteral dosage form may contain smaller amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than an oral dosage<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> form used to treat the same disease. These and other ways in which specific dosage forms encompassed by this invention will vary from one another will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="b"><text>Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed., Mack Publishing, Easton PA (1990</text></nplcit>).</p><heading id="h0010"><b>5.4.1. Oral Dosage Forms</b></heading><p id="p0035" num="0035">Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as, but are not limited to, tablets (<i>e.g.,</i> chewable tablets), caplets, capsules, and liquids (<i>e.g.,</i> flavored syrups). Such dosage forms contain predetermined amounts of active ingredients, and may be prepared by methods of pharmacy well known to those skilled in the art. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="b"><text>Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed., Mack Publishing, Easton PA (1990</text></nplcit>).</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Typical oral dosage forms are prepared by combining the active ingredient(s) in an intimate admixture with at least one excipient according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. Excipients can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such dosage forms can be prepared by conventional methods of pharmacy. In general, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredients with liquid carriers, finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then shaping the product into the desired presentation if necessary. Disintegrants may be incorporated in solid dosage forms to facility rapid dissolution. Lubricants may also be incorporated to facilitate the manufacture of dosage forms (<i>e.g.,</i> tablets).</p><heading id="h0011"><b>5.4.2. Parenteral Dosage Forms</b></heading><p id="p0038" num="0038">Parenteral dosage forms can be administered to patients by various routes including, but not limited to, subcutaneous, intravenous (including bolus injection), intramuscular, and intraarterial. Because their administration typically bypasses patients' natural defenses against contaminants, parenteral dosage forms are specifically sterile or capable of being sterilized prior to administration to a patient. Examples of parenteral dosage forms include, but are not limited to, solutions ready for injection, dry products ready to be dissolved or<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle for injection, suspensions ready for injection, and emulsions.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Suitable vehicles that can be used to provide parenteral dosage forms of the invention are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to: Water for Injection USP; aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection; water-miscible vehicles such as, but not limited to, ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate.</p><heading id="h0012"><b>5.4.3. Transdermal, Topical and Mucosal Dosage Forms</b></heading><p id="p0040" num="0040">Transdermal, topical, and mucosal dosage forms include, but are not limited to, ophthalmic solutions, sprays, aerosols, creams, lotions, ointments, gels, solutions, emulsions, suspensions, or other forms known to one of skill in the art. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="b"><text>Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th and 18th eds., Mack Publishing, Easton PA (1980 &amp; 1990</text></nplcit>); and <nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="b"><text>Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, 4th ed., Lea &amp; Febiger, Philadelphia (1985</text></nplcit>). Transdermal dosage forms include "reservoir type" or "matrix type" patches, which can be applied to the skin and worn for a specific period of time to permit the penetration of a desired amount of active ingredients.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Suitable excipients (e.g., carriers and diluents) and other materials that can be used to provide transdermal, topical, and mucosal dosage forms are well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts, and depend on the particular tissue to which a given pharmaceutical composition or dosage form will be applied.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Depending on the specific tissue to be treated, additional components may be used prior to, in conjunction with, or subsequent to treatment with active ingredients of the invention. For example, penetration enhancers may be used to assist in delivering active ingredients to the tissue.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The pH of a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form, or of the tissue to which the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form is applied, may also be adjusted to improve delivery of one or more active ingredients. Similarly, the polarity of a solvent carrier, its ionic strength, or tonicity can be adjusted to improve delivery. Compounds such as stearates may also be added to pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms to advantageously alter the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of one or more active ingredients so as to improve delivery.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> In this regard, stearates can serve as a lipid vehicle for the formulation, as an emulsifying agent or surfactant, and as a delivery-enhancing or penetration-enhancing agent. Different salts, hydrates or solvates of the active ingredients can be used to further adjust the properties of the resulting composition.</p><heading id="h0013"><b>6.
