Thus direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) using methanol fuel become of greater interest.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">DMFC has the advantage of possible size reduction since they can utilize liquid fuel directly without converting it into hydrogen or the like. Research efforts have been made thereon toward commercial use. However, the problems that the electrolyte membrane has a high methanol permeability and the anode catalyst has a low methanol oxidation activity arrest the commercial application of DMFC.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Most often PtRu catalysts are used as the anode catalyst. While efforts are made to search for high activity catalysts other than PtRu, no other catalysts have overtaken PtRu. Means for enhancing the activity of PtRu catalysts include use of a supported catalyst in which PtRu nano-particles having a small particle size and a large surface area are dispersed on a carbon support. Notably, commercially available supported catalysts, for example, TEC61E54 (54 wt% PtRu/C, Tanaka Kikinzoku Group, PtRu size 4 nm) still have an insufficient activity, with a further enhancement of activity being needed. To this end, it is<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> desired that PtRu particles be further reduced in particle size (less than 4 nm) and more richly and uniformly supported on a carbon support (high loading and high dispersion).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Catalysts are prepared, for example, by a technique that involves admitting support carbon into an aqueous solution of a platinum or other metal precursor, impregnating the carbon with the metal precursor, separating the impregnated carbon, and chemically reducing with hydrogen or the like, whereby the reduced metal is loaded on the support carbon. <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Y. Takasu et al., Journal of Electrochemical Society, 147 (12), 4421-4427, 2000</text></nplcit> (Non-Patent Document 1) describes high-dispersion PtRu-laden carbon prepared by the immersion technique, which has a metal loading of 30 wt%. A reducing temperature of 200 to 450°C is necessary, and PtRu particles have an average particle size of 3 to 4 nm. An attempt to further increase the metal loading by the immersion technique results in PtRu particles having a larger average particle size and hence a smaller active surface area. That is, the immersion technique is difficult to achieve a high loading of fine size PtRu particles in a good dispersion.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Another catalyst preparation method is a colloidal method. In this method, PtRu colloids are prepared in solution and then loaded on support carbon. This method has advantageous abilities to control the size of PtRu particles and reduce the particle size distribution. Preparation of PtRu-laden catalyst by the Bonnemann method is described in <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>T.J. Schmidt et al., Journal of Electrochemical Society, 145 (3), 925-931, 1998</text></nplcit> (Non-Patent Document 2). Using PtCl<sub>2</sub> and RuCl<sub>3</sub> as reactants in THF solvent, a monohydride as a reducing agent, and tetraoctyl ammonium as a protective agent in a dry Ar atmosphere, colloids of 1.7±0.5 nm are prepared. In this document, however, the loading on support carbon is as low as 20 wt%. Further, since heat treatment at high temperature is necessary to remove the protective agent, the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> heat treatment causes agglomeration of PtRu particles to reduce the specific surface area of PtRu, which is problematic even if a high loading of PtRu is possible. Namely, even if PtRu colloids having a small average particle size are prepared, it is difficult to accomplish higher loading and higher dispersion while maintaining the particle size.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><tables id="tabl0001" num="0001"><table frame="none"><tgroup cols="2" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="40mm"/><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="112mm"/><tbody><row><entry>Non-Patent Document 1:</entry><entry><nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Y.

Although a catalyst having a methanol oxidation activity 2.5 times higher than<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> commercially available TEC61E54 can be prepared by this two-stage loading process, a further improvement in catalyst activity is desired for higher power capacity so that the catalyst may be actually used in fuel cells.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Continuing further investigations, the inventors have found that while formation of metal nuclei on support carbon is conventionally performed by alcohol reduction in a solution containing carbon and metal salt, formation of metal nuclei by the technique disclosed herein is successful in providing the catalyst with a greater specific surface area even at the same loading. Particularly when Ru is used as the metal species, a significantly large specific surface area is available, and a highly loaded/highly dispersed PtRu/C catalyst resulting from PtRu growth thereon has a large specific surface area and an improved methanol oxidation activity per PtRu weight (weight activity). It has also been found that when the catalyst is further treated in a hydrogen-containing atmosphere at a temperature below 100°C, it is improved in methanol oxidation activity per active surface area (specific surface area activity) while maintaining a large active surface area, and also improved in the weight activity of PtRu. The present invention is predicated on these findings.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Accordingly, the invention provides a process for producing an electrode catalyst for fuel cells, as defined in the appended claims.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><heading id="h0006"><u>Advantageous Effects of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">The process of the invention is successful in producing a fuel cell electrode catalyst having a high loading, a high dispersion, and an improved methanol oxidation activity per catalyst weight. A further treatment in a hydrogen-containing atmosphere at a temperature below 100°c is effective in improving the methanol oxidation<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> activity per active surface area without detracting from the active area.</p><heading id="h0007"><u>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">The process for producing an electrode catalyst for fuel cells according to the invention comprises (i) a first loading step of providing metal nano-particles on an electroconductive carbon support, the metal nano-particles having a particle size of 0.1 to 1.5 nm and being distributed at a controlled spacing therebetween, and (ii) a second loading step of growing the same metal or another metal on the metal nano-particles as nuclei.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the first loading step, metal nano-particles are loaded on a conductive carbon support by mixing a solution containing a compound of a metal to be loaded (precursor metal compound) with a conductive carbon support, allowing the conductive carbon support to be impregnated with the solution (allowing the solution to infiltrate into pores in the porous carbon support), distilling off the solvent from the solution-impregnated conductive carbon support in the solution, followed by drying, or separating the solution-impregnated conductive carbon support from the solution by such means as filtration, followed by drying, and heating the support in a reducing atmosphere. As used herein, the term "loading" or "loaded" is interchangeable with "supporting" or "supported."</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Examples of the conductive carbon support which can be used in the first loading step include acetylene black, furnace black, channel black, activated carbon, graphite, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, and carbon nanocoils. The conductive carbon support preferably have an average primary particle size of 10 to 200 nm, and more preferably 10<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> to 50 nm. With an average particle size of less than 10 nm, it may be difficult in some cases to uniformly disperse the carbon and have metal nano-particles with an average particle size of up to 1.5 nm loaded thereon. An average primary particle size of more than 200 nm may correspond to a reduced amount of metal per unit volume, raising the risk that a catalyst layer must be thicker to incorporate a predetermined amount of catalyst in a fuel cell during its fabrication, and such a thick catalyst layer may interfere with effective fuel supply. It is noted herein that the average particle size may be determined by taking a photographic image (for example, an image of X2,000,000 magnification) under a transmission electron microscope (TEM), measuring particle diameters and computing an average thereof, for example, measuring diameters of about 300 particles and computing an average thereof.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Examples of the metal to be loaded on the carbon support include Pt, Au, Ag, Ir, Os, Pd, Rh, Ru, Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cr, V, Ti, Mo, W, Ta, Bi, Sn, etc. Inter alia, Pt or Ru, especially Ru is preferred because a higher active surface area is available from a loading of the same weight. The metal is provided and loaded as nano-particles having an average particle size of 0.1 to 1.5 nm on the carbon support at a controlled spacing between particles.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As used herein, the term "a controlled spacing between nano-particles" means that nano-particles are uniformly dispersed on carbon surfaces without agglomeration. The means for controlling the spacing between nano-particles may be by impregnating carbon with a metal source at a loading of up to 30 wt%, specifically less than 30 wt%, preferably up to 15 wt%, followed by chemical reduction in a gas phase. In particular, an impregnation-gas phase reduction procedure of impregnating carbon with metal source and reducing in a gas phase is preferable because the active surface area of metal nano-particles can be increased.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Also, nucleation by metal nano-particles in the first loading step is limited to a particle size of up to 1.5 nm as described above. With a particle size of more than 1.5 nm, final catalyst particles resulting therefrom have a large particle size and tend to agglomerate, failing to provide a highly dispersed catalyst. Formation to a particle size of up to 1.5 nm ensures firm bond to the support and uniform dispersion on carbon. Most preferably the metal nano-particles in the first loading step have a particle size of up to 1.0 nm.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The means for forming and loading metal nano-particles in the first loading step is, for example, by first adding a solution containing a compound of a metal to be loaded (precursor metal compound) to a dispersion of carbon support in a solvent, followed by mixing. When it is desired to form and load Pt nano-particles, for example, a platinum compound is added to a dispersion of the carbon support in a solvent in a concentration of 0.01 to 2 wt%, more specifically 0.1 to 1 wt%, followed by mixing, with exemplary platinum compounds including chloroplatinic acid, platinum(II) chloride, platinum(IV) chloride, diamminedinitroplatinum(II), bisacetylacetonatoplatinum, dichlorotetramineplatinum, platinum tetraminesulfate, ammonium platinum(II) chloride, ammonium platinum(IV) chloride, and diamminedichloroplatinum. When Ru nano-particles are formed, a ruthenium compound is added to the above-described carbon dispersion, followed by mixing, with exemplary ruthenium compounds including ruthenium chloride, ruthenium nitrosyl nitrate, ruthenium nitrate, potassium ruthenium chloride, sodium ruthenium chloride, tris(acetylacetonato)ruthenium, triruthenium dodecacarbonyl, and potassium ruthenium nitroso chloride. Note that the dispersion generally contains the metal compound in a concentration of 0.001 to 5 wt%, and more preferably 0.01 to 1 wt%.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In these embodiments, the amount of metal compound is preferably at least 0.1 wt%, more preferably at least 1 wt%, even more preferably at least 5 wt%, and up to 30 wt%, more preferably less than 30 wt%, even more preferably up to 15 wt% of the metal in the metal compound, based on the total of the conductive carbon support and the metal in the metal compound. If the amount of metal compound is too small, less nuclei may grow on the carbon surface. If the amount of metal compound is too large, coarse particles may develop, failing to produce a highly dispersed catalyst having a high loading. The solvent used in dispersion may be water, water and a water-soluble organic solvent, or an organic solvent, and a choice may be made among those solvents in which the metal compound used is dissolvable. Mixing may be performed at room temperature (e.g., 10 to 30°C) for 1 to 24 hours, preferably 2 to 16 hours. A time of less than 1 hour may fail to achieve thorough mixing whereas more than 24 hours of mixing may incur no difference.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">From the liquid mixture thus obtained, the solvent is removed, for example, on a rotary evaporator at a temperature near room temperature (e.g., 20 to 50°C), followed by drying. Drying is preferably effected at 40 to 150°C, more preferably 60 to 120°C for 3 to 48 hours, more preferably 8 to 24 hours. The dried sample is then transferred to a tray, for example, and placed in a reducing furnace, where it is chemically reduced into metal particles. As the atmosphere within the furnace, a reducing gas such as hydrogen or carbon monoxide may be used in neat form or in diluted form with an inert gas such as nitrogen, He or Ar. The temperature is preferably 200 to 900°C, especially 200 to 500°C. Temperatures below 200°C may fail to facilitate complete reduction whereas temperatures above 900°C may cause metal particles to become coarse. The treatment time is preferably 1 minute to 6 hours, especially 1 to 3 hours. A time of less than 1 minute<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> may fail to achieve full reduction whereas more than 6 hours may bring no substantial change.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">At the end of reduction, a loading of metal nano-particles is preferably at least 0.1 wt%, more preferably at least 1 wt%, even more preferably at least 5 wt%, and up to 30 wt%, more preferably less than 30 wt%, even more preferably up to 15 wt%. With too low a loading, an insufficient number of nuclei grow on the carbon surface. With too high a loading, metal nano-particles may become larger in size, failing to produce a highly dispersed catalyst having a high loading. Note that the loading (loading of metal nuclei) is determined by the following equation (1). <maths id="math0001" num="(1)"><math display="block"><mi>Loading</mi><mspace width="1em"/><mfenced separators=""><mi>wt</mi><mo>%</mo></mfenced><mo>=</mo><mfenced open="[" close="]" separators=""><mi mathvariant="normal">A</mi><mo>/</mo><mfenced separators=""><mi mathvariant="normal">A</mi><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi></mfenced></mfenced><mo>×</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">100</mn></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="106" he="6" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
A: weight of metal nano-particles<br/>
C: weight of carbon support</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">After metal nano-particles are loaded on the carbon support as described above, the same metal or another metal (catalytic metal) is grown on the metal nano-particles serving as nuclei. Suitable catalytic metals for the anode catalyst (methanol oxidizing catalyst) include PtRu (platinum-ruthenium), PtSn, PtMo, PtW, PtRh, PtPd, PtAu, PtRuSn, PtRuRh, PtRuPd, PtRuIr, PtRuAu, PtRuMo, and PtRuW, with PtRu being preferred for high methanol oxidation activity.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The fuel cell electrode catalyst of the invention is advantageously used as the anode catalyst (methanol oxidizing catalyst). The anode catalyst (methanol oxidizing catalyst) assists in deriving a current flow by methanol oxidation reaction. Most often PtRu has heretofore been used, and the reaction takes place on surfaces of PtRu particles. Therefore, the smaller the PtRu particle size, the larger becomes the surface area per PtRu weight, and the higher<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> becomes the activity per PtRu weight. In the case of a catalyst supported on carbon, since the carbon has a substantial volume, the thickness of a catalyst layer being formed depends on the amount of carbon used. To facilitate diffusion of fuel and reaction product, a catalyst layer of reduced thickness is preferred. It is then desired that the catalytic metal such as PtRu be supported on carbon particles in a possible maximum amount (a high loading). If catalytic metal particles such as PtRu particles are supported in agglomerated form at this point, the interior of agglomerates is not accessible to the reaction. It is then desired that catalytic metal particles such as PtRu particles be supported in a highly dispersed manner without agglomeration.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">According to the invention, a highly dispersed catalyst having a high loading can be produced by forming metal particles (e.g., Pt or Ru) having an average particle size of 0.1 to 1.5 nm on carbon using the technique disclosed herein, then loading or growing a catalytic metal such as PtRu on nuclei of Pt, Ru or the like.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As described above, the process involving the first stage (first loading step) of forming metal nano-particles or nuclei of Pt, Ru or the like, and the second stage (second loading step) of loading or growing a catalytic metal such as PtRu on the nuclei is able to produce a highly dispersed catalyst having a high loading. The catalytic metal such as PtRu finally formed has an average particle size of up to 4 nm, preferably up to 3 nm, and more preferably up to 2 nm. The lower limit of particle size is not critical although it is usually at least 0.1 nm, and specifically at least 1.0 nm. A particle size in excess of 4 nm is equal to or greater than the size of commercially available catalyst TEC61E54 and sometimes fails to achieve the activity improving effect.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">At the end of the second loading step, an overall loading of metal particles is preferably at least 50 wt%,<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> more preferably at least 60 wt%. With a loading of less than 50 wt%, nano-scale catalytic metal particles such as PtRu are readily dispersed, but a catalyst layer formed during fabrication of a membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) becomes thicker than that from a higher loading catalyst. Then the supply of methanol fuel becomes a velocity controlling factor, and the power may be reduced as compared with the use of a higher loading catalyst. The upper limit of loading is not critical although it is usually up to 90 wt%, preferably up to 70 wt%. Note that the loading (loading of metal nuclei and catalytic metal) is determined by the following equation (2). <maths id="math0002" num=""><math display="block"><mi>Loading</mi><mspace width="1em"/><mfenced separators=""><mi>wt</mi><mo>%</mo></mfenced><mo>=</mo><mfenced open="[" close="]" separators=""><mfenced separators=""><mi mathvariant="normal">A</mi><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">B</mi></mfenced><mo>/</mo><mfenced separators=""><mi mathvariant="normal">A</mi><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">B</mi><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi></mfenced></mfenced><mo>×</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">100</mn></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="106" he="6" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
A: weight of metal nuclei (weight of metal nuclei resulting from first loading step)<br/>
B: weight of catalytic metal (e.g., PtRu) (weight of catalytic metal resulting from second loading step)<br/>
C: weight of carbon support</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The means of growing the catalytic metal on the metal nano-particle nuclei in the second loading step employs a process of mixing the carbon support having the metal nano-particle nuclei loaded thereon into a solution of a compound of a metal to be grown in an alcohol-containing solvent, for example, when PtRu is to be grown, a solution of a platinum compound and a ruthenium compound in an alcohol-containing solvent, and effecting reaction at 50 to 120°C, specifically 60 to 100°C, more specifically the reflux temperature of the solvent, for 1 to 10 hours, specifically 3 to 8 hours, thereby creating and growing PtRu nano-particles on the metal nano-particle nuclei. Herein, exemplary platinum compounds include chloroplatinic acid, platinum(II) chloride, platinum(IV) chloride, diamminedinitroplatinum(II), bisacetylacetonatoplatinum, dichlorotetramineplatinum, platinum tetraminesulfate, ammonium platinum(II) chloride,<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> ammonium platinum(IV) chloride, and diamminedichloroplatinum, exemplary ruthenium compounds include ruthenium chloride, ruthenium nitrosyl nitrate, ruthenium nitrate, potassium ruthenium chloride, sodium ruthenium chloride, tris(acetylacetonato)ruthenium, triruthenium dodecacarbonyl, and potassium ruthenium nitroso chloride, and exemplary alcohols include ethanol, methanol, n-propanol, i-propanol, butanol, and ethylene glycol. That is, while the carbon support having the metal nano-particle nuclei loaded thereon is kept in a solution containing a salt of a catalytic metal to be created, the metal ion is reduced by the alcohol to create and grow the catalytic metal on the metal nano-particle nuclei.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In this embodiment, the platinum compound and ruthenium compound are preferably used in such amounts that a molar ratio of platinum metal to ruthenium metal may range between 2:8 and 9:1, specifically between 5:5 and 8:2. If the amount of platinum compound is too small, C-H dissociation reaction of methanol may be retarded, resulting in a methanol oxidation current value being reduced. If the amount of platinum compound is too large, oxidation reaction of CO, an intermediate reaction product of methanol is unlikely to occur, leading to a lower methanol oxidation activity at a low potential (equal to or less than 0.4 V vs RHE). If the amount of ruthenium compound is too small, there results a lower methanol oxidation activity at a low potential as in the case of excess platinum. If the amount of ruthenium compound is too large, there results a lower methanol oxidation current value as in the case of short platinum.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The carbon support for supporting the metal nano-particle nuclei thereon is preferably dispersed in the solution in a concentration of 0.01 to 2 wt%, specifically 0.1 to 1 wt%. If the amount of the carbon support is too small, the amount of the resulting catalyst is reduced. If<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> the amount of the carbon support is too large, it becomes difficult to disperse the carbon, which gives rise to such problems as agglomeration of metal particles and formation of coarse particles.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">It is noted that although the average particle size of the catalytic metal such as PtRu may be reduced to or below 4 nm by preparing colloids with a size up to 4 nm and causing them be loaded on carbon, an attempt to provide a loading of at least 50 wt% entails a tendency for colloid particles to agglomerate and a difficulty of uniform dispersion. When metal nuclei are provided on carbon at a low loading, the metal nuclei are uniformly dispersed on carbon surfaces, which ensures that subsequent growth of PtRu or the like on these metal nuclei results in metal particles having a particle size of up to 4 nm and being uniformly dispersed even at a loading of at least 50 wt%. Particularly when metal nucleation is effected by the technique disclosed herein, nuclei having a higher active area, i.e., smaller particle size can be formed on the carbon support in a highly dispersed manner. Absent metal nuclei, an attempt to provide a loading of at least 50 wt% entails agglomeration. Also, while a loading within the above-defined range may be provided by adjusting the amount of metal source admitted into the solution, the concentration of the metal compound in the solution is preferably 0.001 to 5 wt%, and specifically 0.01 to 1 wt%.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The carbon support catalyst on which the catalytic metal is grown as mentioned above may be further enhanced in methanol oxidation activity by treating it in a hydrogen-containing atmosphere. The preferred treating conditions used herein include an atmosphere containing hydrogen and an inert gas such as nitrogen, He or Ar in a ratio between 100:0 and 1:99 (volume ratio), a temperature up to 300°C, and a time of 1 minute to 5 hours, specifically 30 minutes to 2 hours. A time of less than 1 minute achieves an<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> insufficient hydrogen treatment effect. If the time is more than 5 hours, no change in the effect is discernable.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Such treatment in a hydrogen-containing atmosphere improves the methanol oxidation activity per surface area of the catalytic metal such as PtRu. It is noted that in the case of PtRu/C with a loading of at least 50 wt%, an elevation in the treating temperature entails agglomeration and growth of PtRu particles. This results in a reduction of PtRu specific surface area. Although the activity per specific surface area of PtRu is improved, the activity per weight of PtRu is reduced due to such a reduction of specific surface area. Thus, when the treating temperature is set below 100°C, the specific surface area is unchanged from before the treatment, the activity per surface area is improved, and the activity per weight of PtRu is improved.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In embodiments wherein such treating conditions are employed, the preferred treatment is in the above-described atmosphere at a temperature below 100°C, specifically of 20<br/>
to 80°C, more specifically 30 to 60°C for 0.5 to 8 hours, specifically 1 to 3 hours.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The fuel cell electrode catalyst thus obtained is suited for use as the electrode catalyst in direct methanol fuel cells.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The process for producing a fuel cell electrode catalyst according to the invention is also effective as the process for producing a cathode electrocatalyst.
