Documents <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1046877A"><text>EP 1 046 877</text></patcit> describes e.g. a gun, in particular portable hand firearm, with an optical sighting device. Lasers are the preferred means of generating light beams for weapon sighting because they have comparatively high intensity and can be focused into a narrow beam with a very small divergence angle so they produce a small, bright spot on a target. The laser projects a narrow beam of light in a direction generally parallel to the gun's bore. When the light beam and bore are properly aligned, the bullet (or other projectile) will hit on or very close to the location of the light beam projected on a target.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As used herein, "laser" includes any form of laser light source, and the term "laser sight" refers to a light emitting module or assembly that projects a beam of light having a small divergence angle suitable for weapon alignment or sighting purposes.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is known to attach a laser sight to the trigger guard of a hand gun or other weapon. Several types of trigger-guard mounted laser sights are known. A problem associated with trigger-guard mounted laser sights is that trigger guards are complex, three-dimensional shapes with non-uniform cross-sections and it is difficult to mount, align and use the laser light. It is also known to position a laser sight below the gun barrel, for example, on the picatinny rail. When the laser sight is in this position the gun is difficult or impossible to holster and the gun/laser sight usually requires two hands to operate because one hand is required to hold the gun and another to turn the laser off and turn.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Summary of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The invention is an apparatus according claim 1 and claims 2 to

f0009 f0010 f0011 f0012 f0013 f0014">Figures 1-11</figref> show a preferred embodiment of a device 10 according to the invention. Device 10 as shown is a laser sight, but could be any structure that includes one or more light sources and one or more power sources connectable to the light source(s) and that can be mounted to a gun in the manner described herein.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Preferably, device 10 is configured to be mounted in a slot formed in the top surface of a gun, wherein device 10 provides a lighting source and preferably still allows a user to mechanically sight the gun. The slot (best seen in <figref idrefs="f0012">Figures 9</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0016">13</figref>) 2010 is known to those skilled in the art (if the slot is on the top surface of the gun it preferably extends the entire width of the top surface), and in one embodiment (for a Glock 19 pistol) is 1" wide and .080" deep. Device 10 could also be mounted to the top, rear portion or side, rear portion of a gun in any other suitable, fashion that allows the gun to be properly holstered in a standard holster (i.e., one not specially made to accommodate the device, but made solely to holster the gun) and that allows the light source to be projected along a side surface of the gun or along the top surface of the gun. For example, device 10 could be mounted to the gun using a U-shaped or L-shaped bracket.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">When mounted on a gun device 10 preferably extends no farther from the back of the gun than about 2 1/2", 2", 1 1/2" or 1 1/4" and extends outward from the top surface or side surface of the gun no further than about 3/4", 1/2", 3/8" or .313". Device 10, and each device described herein, as shown preferably has an entire length L (seen best in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 1B</figref>) of less than<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> 3", or less than 2", or less than 1 1/2", less than 1" and preferably about .875", and preferably has a height H (seen best in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 1A</figref>) of less than 3/4", or less than 1/2" and preferably about 3/8".</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Device 10 includes a light source 20, a power source 30 and a housing 200 that includes a mount 102, which as shown is a bottom rail that fits into a slot formed on a gun.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Light source 20 has a first end 20A (through which light can be emitted), is preferably a visible-light laser module, but could be any light source, including a light emitting diode ("LED") flashlight (as used herein "flashlight" means any source of visible light other than a laser) or an infra-red light source (such as an infra-red LED or infra-red laser). In the embodiment shown light source 20 is a red-light, 650 nanometer, 3.3 mm diode, visible laser, and the laser module has an overall length of about 14 mm and a diameter of about 4.5 mm. It includes a 3 mm focal length, collimating lens. Any suitable laser/laser module may be used, however. A biasing spring 24 is attached to second end 20B to bias light source 20 towards first end 20A when device 10 is assembled.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Power source 30 can be any suitable power source for light source 20, and is preferably an electric power source and most preferably a portable, electrical power source such as a battery or multiple batteries. The embodiment shown uses four 1-3 silver oxide 1.5V silver oxide LR626 batteries 32, although any suitable batteries or other power source may be used.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Device 10 as shown further includes a housing 200, a light source adjustment apparatus 300, an integrated circuit board 400, a backing 500, and a battery cap 600. The purpose of housing 200 is to retain light source 20 and power source 30 and mount them to a gun, and to selectively connect power source 30 to light source 20. Any suitable structure or structures may be used for this purpose.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Housing 200 is preferably made of metal injection molded stainless steel (MIM), but could be made of any suitable material, such as another metal (for example, MIM carbon steel or extruded aluminum) or plastic. Housing 200 has a first end 200A, a second end 200B and includes a first canister 202 and a second canister 230. First canister 202 is configured to receive and retain the light source 20 (which is preferably a laser module), which as shown is first positioned in light source adjustment apparatus 300. Once so positioned, apparatus 300, with light source 20 inside, is positioned in and retained in canister 202.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">As shown, canister 202 has an outer surface 204, a first rib 206, a second rib 208, an inner cavity 210 in which apparatus 300 and light source 20 are retained, and an opening 212<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> through which the light source 20 can emit light. Canister 202 also includes an aperture 206A that extends through rib 206 to inner cavity 210 and an aperture 208A that extends through rib 208 to inner cavity 210. Each of apertures 206A and 208A are configured to receive a moveable screw or screw 225 (hereafter referred to as "set screw" or "set screws," which are preferably socket-head set screws). The purpose of rib 206 and rib 208 (each of which project outward about .075") are to provide additional area to support set screws 225. Alternatively, a raised portion (described, for example with respect to device 10', device 1000 and device 2000) may be used in place of rib 206 and/or 208. Other structures may be used for this purpose or no such structure may be used.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Second canister 230 as shown is spaced apart from first canister 202 and is configured to receive and retain the power source 30. Canister 230 as shown has an outer surface 234, an inner cavity 240, a first end 242 and a second end 244. Second end 244 is configured to open in order to add or change power source 30. In the embodiment shown second end 244 includes internal threads (not shown) that mate with threads on power source retention cap 600 to allow cap 600 to be screwed onto end 244 and screwed off of end 244 in order to add or remove power source 30 from canister 230.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Housing 200 also includes a connective portion 270 that connects first canister 202 and second canister 230. Connective portion 270 has a bottom surface 272 and a mount 102 attached to or integrally formed with bottom surface 272.
