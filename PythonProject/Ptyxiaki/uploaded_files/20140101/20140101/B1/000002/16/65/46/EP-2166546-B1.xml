As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, thin electromagnetic steel plates blanked in a shape of letter E by a pressing die are laminated and welded to obtain E-core 9, to which winding coils 10 wound with aluminum wires having an enamel film baked on the surface are fitted from the upper part.

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, winding coils 10 wound with aluminum wires 18 are fitted to iron core 16 formed of E-core 9 and I-core 11. Enamel parts are removed from start and end of winding of winding coils 10 of aluminum wires 18, and aluminum core wires 19 of aluminum wires 18 are exposed by about 10 mm, and pressed, connected and fixed to pressing and connecting part 25 of copper-made electric terminal 17, thereby composing reactor unit 14.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">At other opposite side of electric terminal 17, the core wire of copper-made lead wire 21 with connector 22 for supplying power source to the reactor is welded and fixed to welding part 17c of a nearly flat shape of electric terminal 17 by spot welding.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Junction part 20 between aluminum core wire 19 and copper-made electric terminal 17 produces a potential difference because dissimilar metals of aluminum and copper are connected. Therefore if water or moisture sticks, an electrolytic corrosion occurs, and the contact resistance may be increased. Therefore, by applying silicone resin 23 to cover at least the entire area of the connection part of dissimilar metals by using a brush or the like, an electric connection can be assured appropriately.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Further, by coating the outer circumference of junction part 20 with heat shrink tube 24 which shrinks when exposed to high temperature, as insulation tape, the waterproof effect may be further heightened.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> shows the detail of the connection part. <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref> is a side magnified view of the connection part. <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3B</figref> is a front magnified view of the connection part. <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3C</figref> is a sectional view of part 3C-3C of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A.

Therefore, terminal end part 30 is processed by changing the pressing height so that the crimp height relation may be ΔA &lt; Δ B.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In first pressing and connecting part 17a of section 3C-3C, terminal end part 30 is bent and processed to such an extent that inside aluminum core wire 19 may be compressed and deformed. By contrast, in second pressing and connecting part 17b of section 3D-3D, terminal end part 30 is bent and processed to such an extent that inside aluminum core wire 19 may not be deformed plastically.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Generally, unlike a copper wire, an aluminum wire is soft in surface hardness, and the aluminum itself is elongated by stress of pressing and connecting, and is deformed plastically. It is hence difficult to satisfy both the stability of contact resistance required in pressing and fixing and the assurance of tensile strength. To solve such problem, in the preferred embodiment, the pressing and connecting height is divided, and the contact resistance is stabilized in first pressing and connecting part 17a of section<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 3C-3C, and the tensile strength is assured in second pressing and connecting part 17b of section 3D-3D, and the required roles for connection are divided, and successive pressing and connecting may be achieved.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The opposite side of aluminum wire 18 of electric terminal 17 is welding part 17c for joining copper-made lead wire 21 and electric terminal 17 by spot welding.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">This welding part 17c is welding between copper materials, and is free from difference in coefficient of thermal expansion, junction part 20 has a strong resistance to temperature changes.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> shows an electric characteristic graph of the reactor unit of the preferred embodiment. In the electric characteristic graph, the axis of abscissas denotes the pressing crimp height (pressing and connecting height) of the pressing and connecting part, and the axis of ordinates represents the electric contact resistance value of the pressing and connecting part. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, when pressing and connecting an aluminum wire of, for example, 2.0 mm in diameter, in the range of crimp height value of about 1.8 mm to about 2.3 mm, the contact resistance value is stable, about 0.2 mΩ or less, but the contact resistance increases gradually when the crimp height value is about 2.3 mm or more.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In other words, the aluminum core wire is low in contact resistance and is stable when compressed strongly and deformed plastically, but the tensile strength against pulling is lowered.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Similarly, as for the tensile strength, in the range of crimp height value of about 1.8 mm to about 2.3 mm, the tensile strength increases gradually, and in the range of crimp height value of about 2.3 mm to about<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> 2.6 mm, the tensile strength is stable, about 300 N/m<sup>2</sup> or more.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Accordingly, in order to stabilize the contact resistance, first pressing and connecting part 17a is pressed and connected at a crimp height value of 1.9 mm to 2.1 mm, and in order to assure the tensile strength, second pressing and connecting part 17b is pressed and fixed at a crimp height value of 2.4 mm to 2.6 mm, so that both contact resistance and tensile strength can be satisfied.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Thus, in the preferred embodiment, dissimilar materials are fixed by pressing and connecting aluminum wire 18 of winding coil 10 to copper-made electric terminal 17, reactor unit 14 is composed, and similar materials of copper wire 21 and copper-made electric terminal 17 are connected by spot welding, thereby realizing an inexpensive and highly reliable reactor unit having electrical connecting means between aluminum winding coils and copper wires capable of preventing faulty contact in spite of sudden changes in the environmental temperature.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Further, by varying the crimp height when pressing and connecting first pressing and connecting part 17a and second pressing and connecting part 17b, both the tensile strength and the contact resistance of pressing and connecting part 25 can be stabilized at the same time. Therefore, a sufficient performance is assured in spite of aging effects, and the reliability may be further enhanced.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Moreover, by applying waterproof treatment with silicone resin on the contact surface of aluminum material and copper material, or by applying waterproof treatment by coating with a heat-shrink tube which shrinks when exposed to high temperature, electrolytic corrosion occurring<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> between dissimilar metals can be prevented, and the reliability may be enhanced moreover.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980181"
