materials are among the main constituents of paints and of paper coating colours. The former, generally latex-based and in the form of aqueous suspensions or dispersions, provide the necessary adhesion to a support and cohesion between the elements forming goods to be produced, such as paint or paper but also such as agricultural fertilizer. The latter, commonly calcium carbonate, may provide improvements, for example, in paper and painting quality and agriculture properties, notably relative to its optical properties. The concept of self-binding pigment particles is known to industry: it refers to distinct, solid particles, formed of mineral material and binder that are intimately bound to one another. The internal cohesion forces are such as to provide the self-binding pigment particles with excellent mechanical stability. Such particles may be directly implemented in a variety of applications.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Implementing self-binding pigment particles avoids the logistic difficulties of handling mineral materials and binders separately, and further avoids the unwanted physical and chemical interactions developed in comparable mixtures of minerals and binders.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Self-binding pigment particles are prepared by a process implementing at least one step of grinding mineral materials in the presence of binder, where grinding refers to an operation leading to a reduction in the particle size; the mineral materials in the self-binding pigment particles have a smaller diameter than the initial mineral material used to produce them. Such self-binding pigment particles are described in a number of documents, including <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2006008657A"><text>WO 2006/008657</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2006128814A"><text>WO 2006/128814</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2008139292A"><text>WO 2008/139292</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, the processes for preparing self-binding mineral pigment particles known in the art are limited to the preparation or the co-grinding of suspensions having a low solids content. High solid content suspensions could only be processed if corresponding dispersants would be added as mentioned, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP1747252A"><text>EP 1 747 252</text></patcit>, which relates to a method for producing surface-modified inorganic fillers or pigments of a desired particle size. Said method is characterised in that filler or pigment slurries of inorganic fillers or pigments are milled to the desired particle size under the action of compressive and shear forces using polymer dispersions in combination with milling aids and/or dispersing agents. The addition of dispersant, however, <i>inter alia</i> affects the adsorption of the binder to the particles during the co-grinding.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">On the other hand, the preparation of low solids content suspensions has the disadvantage that the obtained ground product has to be concentrated before being shipped to other facilities for further processing. During the time and energy consuming concentrating step, very often an undesired loss of polymeric binder is observed, and, additionally, unwanted agglomerates are formed. Furthermore, the prior art processes often lead to a suspension having a high total organic content of the aqueous phase of the ground suspension.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In view of the foregoing, improving the self-binding pigment particle production process remains of interest to the skilled man. It would be especially desirable to provide a process for making self-binding mineral pigment particles which can be<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> applied to mineral pigment suspensions having a high solids content, thus, avoiding an energy and time consuming up-concentrating step and, e.g., the formation of significant amounts of unwanted agglomerates.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A further object of the present invention is to reduce or eliminate fossil based binder raw material to follow at most the Kyoto protocol to reduce fossil CO<sub>2</sub> pollution of the atmosphere during combustion of the final goods.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The major feature of the Kyoto Protocol is that it sets binding targets for 37 industrialized countries and the European community for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This amounts to an average of five per cent against 1990 levels over the five-year period 2008 to 2012. The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on 11 December 1997 and entered into force on 16 February 2005.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">While the Applicant knows as a solution the unpublished European Patent Application Number 11 160900.4 describing a process for the preparing self-binding pigment particles comprising the steps of: a) providing an aqueous mineral pigment suspension, b) providing at least one polymeric binder, wherein the binder comprises at least one carboxymethylcellulose having a degree of carboxylation in the range of 0.4 to 2.0 and having an intrinsic viscosity in the range of 3 to 300 ml/g, c) mixing the binder of step b) with the aqueous mineral pigment material suspension of step a) and adjusting the solids content of the obtained suspension so that it is from 45 to 80 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the suspension, and d) grinding the aqueous mineral material suspension of step c), and the unpublished European Patent Application Number <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="EP11160926A"><text>11 160926.9 </text></patcit>describing a process for the preparing self-binding pigment particles comprising the steps of: a) providing an aqueous mineral pigment suspension, b) providing at least one polymeric binder, wherein the binder comprises at least one modified polysaccharide having a degree of carboxylation in the range of 0.4 to 2.0 and having an intrinsic viscosity in the range of 3 to 300 ml/g, wherein the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> carbon of the binder shows a rate of nuclear transformation of <sup>14</sup>C to <sup>14</sup>N of between 900 and 920 transformations per hour and per gram carbon in the binder; c) mixing the binder of step b) with the aqueous mineral pigment material suspension of step a) and adjusting the solids content of the obtained suspension so that it is from 45 to 80 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the suspension, and d) grinding the aqueous mineral material suspension of step c) until the fraction of self-binding pigment particles having a particle size of less than 1 µm is greater than 5 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the pigment particles, the foregoing and other objects are solved by the subject-matter as defined herein in the independent claims.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US5708162A"><text>US 5,708,162 A</text></patcit> describes a process for the preparation of low molecular weight polysaccharide ethers which can be employed in binders for improving adhesive power and film-forming properties.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to one aspect of the present invention, a process for preparing self-binding pigment particles is provided, the process comprising the following steps:
