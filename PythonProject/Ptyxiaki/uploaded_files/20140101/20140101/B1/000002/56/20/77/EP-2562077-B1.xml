the at least one gas release outlet is located on the peripheral wall of said directional nozzle for the connection of the at least one guide pipe of the gas guide device.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Moreover, the propeller comprises an axial tube having an inner end connected to the at least one guide pipe of the gas guide device and an outer end extended to the at least one gas release outlet located on the outer surface of the propeller.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Besides, the gas guide device uses a supplementary measure to guide engine waste gas or low pressure gas from the steam turbine into the at least<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> one guide pipe of the gas guide device from for generating air bubbles.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The gas guide device further compresses a pressure device for pumping a gas into the at least one guide pipe toward the at least one gas release outlet, the pressure device being selected from an air compressor, an air blower, an engine, a steam turbine and a turbo of the boat.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Thus, subject to Bernoulli's principle, gas compressible characteristic and Boyle's law and the arrangement of the contracted end piece of the nozzle to work as an air compressor for compressing air bubbles, the invention uses one single gas guide device and a negative pressure suction force to guide in air bubbles to enhance the propelling force of the hydraulic propeller, saving power consumption and cost.</p><heading id="h0005"><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic drawing of a hydraulic propeller according to the prior art.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic drawing illustrating flows of water driven out of the nozzle of the hydraulic propeller according to the prior art.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic drawing illustrating air bubbles generated in a nozzle of a hydraulic propeller in accordance with the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic drawing illustrating a gas guided into the hydraulic propeller in accordance with the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> is a sectional view taken in an enlarged scale line 5-5 of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref> corresponds to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>, illustrating air bubbles generated in the negative pressure zone.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0006"><u>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</u></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">Further features and benefits of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment taken in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The air bubbles <b>60</b> that are sucked into the at least one gas release outlet <b>40</b> are small-sized due to compression. When the compressed air bubbles <b>60</b> move with the flow of water to the outer end <b>342</b> of the axial tube <b>321,</b> the surrounding water pressure is reduced, and therefore, the compressed air bubbles <b>60</b> expand suddenly, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, enhancing the reactive force of the axial flow of water <b>F</b>, and therefore, the invention greatly increases the propelling force of the hydraulic propeller, i.e., the technical measure of the present invention utilizes:
<ol><li>1. Bernoulli's principle: a high-speed flow causes generation of a negative pressure therearound.</li><li>2. Gas compressible characteristic and Boyle's law: the volume of gas is indirectly proportional to the applied pressure, i.e., P<sub>1</sub> V <sub>1</sub>=P<sub>2</sub> V<sub>2</sub>; when increasing the pressure, the volume is reduced, or when reducing the pressure, the volume is increased. For example, 2P<sub>1</sub>1V<sub>1</sub>=1P<sub>2</sub>2V<sub>2</sub>.</li><li>3. Air compressor: water is not compressible, however it becomes compressible when contains air bubbles <b>60</b>; the contracted end piece <b>341</b> of the nozzle <b>34</b> works as an air compressor for compressing the air bubbles <b>60</b><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> passing therethrough.</li></ol></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The aforesaid technical measure for enabling the hydraulic propeller to guide in outside air for generating air bubbles <b>60</b> can be achieved simply by providing the at least one gas release outlet <b>40</b> in the hydraulic propeller <b>30</b> in the area where the high-speed flow of water passes without using any power, and therefore this method saves energy and cost. When a pressure is necessary drive air into the hydraulic propeller <b>30</b> for generating air bubbles <b>60,</b> a small power consumption can achieve a high effect.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>, a supplementary measure may be employed to guide air or gas into the at least one guide pipe <b>51</b> of the gas guide device <b>50</b>, for example, engine waste gas or low pressure gas from the steam turbine may be guided into the at least one guide pipe <b>51</b> of the gas guide device <b>50</b> for generating air bubbles <b>60</b>. This waste gas recycling method does not require any extra resource or cost. Further, a pressure device <b>70</b> and a control valve <b>71</b> may be used in the at least one guide pipe <b>51</b> of the gas guide device <b>50</b> for pumping a gas into the at least one guide pipe <b>51</b> toward the at least one gas release outlet <b>40</b>. The pressure device <b>70</b> can be the existing air compressor, air blower, engine, steam turbine or turbo of the boat <b>20</b>. Thus, using a small power can obtain multiple times of power.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In conclusion, subject to Bernoulli's principle, gas compressible characteristic and Boyle's law and the arrangement of the contracted end piece of the nozzle to work as an air compressor for compressing air bubbles, the invention uses one single gas guide device and a negative pressure suction force to guide in air bubbles to enhance the propelling force of the hydraulic propeller, saving power consumption and cost.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Although particular embodiments of the invention have been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications and enhancements may be made without departing from the scope of the claims.
