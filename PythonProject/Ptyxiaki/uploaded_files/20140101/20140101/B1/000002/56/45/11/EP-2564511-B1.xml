control.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Two-way communications headsets are in common use in many types of vehicles and with various large pieces of machinery, especially vehicles and machinery that create or are typically operated in a high noise environment such that necessary two-way communications with the driver, operator or pilot would be impaired without such headsets. Examples of such noisy environments include airplane cockpits, driver's compartments in commercial trucks and tractors, operator cabins in cranes and tunnel boring machines, and crew compartments in tanks and other military vehicles. It is commonplace for such vehicles and machinery to incorporate an intercom system providing one or more connection points to which such headsets are coupled. Such intercoms typically cooperate with multiple ones of such headsets to enable personnel within or in the immediate vicinity of such vehicles to communicate with each other, and such intercoms typically incorporate long-range wireless transceivers enabling personnel to use such headsets in communicating with other personnel at a distance.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It has recently become desired to further enable such headsets to be coupled to portable audio devices that personnel may carry with them, in addition to being able to be coupled to an intercom system of a vehicle or large piece of machinery. Therefore, it has become desirable to enable the simultaneous coupling of a headset to both an intercom system and a personal audio device in a manner that provides a high degree of ease of use of such a combination, and incorporates the ability to maintain a high degree of functionality in the event of the headset losing power normally provided by its own power source without draining the power sources of portable radios or other devices to which the headset is connected.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">A push-to-talk (PTT) switch with biasing to a first center position in which in which the PTT function of neither one of up to two audio devices is engaged, also having a first operated position to which the switch may be moved by hand operation to cause the PTT function of the first one of the two audio devices to be engaged, and further having a second operated position to which the switch may be moved by hand operation to cause the PTT function of the second one of the two audio devices to be engaged.

The headset 1000 incorporates a head assembly 100, a control box 200, and one or more of cables 300a, 300b and/or 300c. The head assembly 100 incorporates a pair of earpieces 110a and 110b that each incorporate an acoustic driver 115a and 115b, respectively, a headband 120 that couples together the earpieces 110a and 110b, a microphone boom 130 extending from the earpiece 110b to support a communications microphone 135, and a cable 140 coupling the earpiece 110b to the control box 200. The control box 200 incorporates a casing 210, a manually-operable push-to-talk (PTT) switch 215, and a pair of connectors 220a and 220b by which one or more of the cables 300a-c may be coupled to the control box 200. Each of the cables 300a-c are configured to enable one or more audio devices to be coupled to the control box 200, specifically, one or more of a radio 700, a vehicle intercom system (ICS) 800 (and perhaps to a vehicle radio 850 through the ICS 800), a radio 900 and an audio source 950.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">It should be noted that although the head assembly 100 is depicted with both the cable 140 and the microphone boom 130 being coupled to the same one of the earpieces 110a and 110b, other configurations of the head assembly 100 are possible in which they are coupled to separate ones of the earpieces 110a and 110b. It should be noted that although the cable 140 is depicted in a manner suggesting that the cable 140 is coupled to both the earpiece 110b and the control box 200 without connectors such that the cable 140 is not separable from either of these, other configurations are possible in which connectors (not shown) are used to couple the cable 140 to one or both of these. It should be noted that although the control box 200 is depicted as having a particular shape and a particular size relative to other components of the headset 1000, the control box 200 may be of any of a variety of sizes and shapes. Further, although the control box 200 is depicted as being physically distinct from all components of the head assembly 100, other configurations of the headset 1000 are possible in which the control box 200 is integrated into one of the earpieces 110a or 110b (such that the PTT switch 215 may be disposed on a casing of one or the other of the earpieces 110 or 110b, for example), or is integrated into the head assembly 100 in some other manner. It should be noted that although the connectors 220a and 220b are depicted as being disposed on the casing 210 of the control box 200, other configurations are possible in which one or both of the connectors 220a and 220b are separated from the casing 210 and are coupled to the casing 210 via one or more cables (not shown). It should be noted that although each of the cables 300a-c is depicted as having connectors on both ends, other configurations of one or more of the cables 300a-c are possible in which there are connectors only on the ends configured to be coupled to the control box 200.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The head assembly 100 is given its over-the-head physical configuration by the headband 120. Depending on the size of each of the earpieces 110a and 110b relative to the typical size of the pinna of a human ear, each of the earpieces 110a and 110b may be either an "on-ear" (also commonly called "supra-aural") or an "around-ear" (also commonly called "circum-aural") form of earcup. As will be explained in greater detail, the provision of an acoustic driver 115a and 115b in each of the earpieces 110a and 110b, respectively, enables the headset 1000 to acoustically output two-channel audio (e.g., stereo audio) to a user. However, it is important to note that it is commonplace for an intercom system (e.g., the ICS 800) to provide two-channel audio in which the two channels of audio do not necessarily represent a common piece of audio with a relationship such as "left" and "right" that provide a user with a spatial effect (the two channels may be related in other ways, or the very same audio may be provided on both channels). The microphone boom 130 positions the communications microphone 135 in the vicinity of the mouth of a user of the headset 1000 when the head assembly 100 is correctly worn such that the earpieces 110a and 110b overlie corresponding ones of the user's ears. However, despite the depiction in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1a</figref> of this particular physical configuration of the head assembly 100, those skilled in the art will readily recognize that the head assembly may take any of a variety of other physical configurations. By way of example, alternate<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> embodiments may incorporate a "behind-the-head" or "behind-the-neck" (e.g., what may be called a "napeband") variant of band in place of the headband 120, may position the communications microphone 135 on a portion of one or the other of the earpieces 110a and 110b (rather than at the end of the microphone boom 130), and/or may be structured to permit one or both of the cable 140 and the microphone boom 130 to be detachable from the earpiece 110a in order to be attached to the earpiece 110b (i.e., made "reversible" between left and right sides).</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">As depicted, the cable 300a enables the radio 700 to be coupled to the connector 220a, the cable 300b enables the ICS 800 to be coupled to the connector 220b (and through the ICS 800, perhaps also the radio 850), and the cable 300c enables either or both of the radio 900 and the audio source 950 to be coupled to the connector 220b. The radio 700 may be coupled through the cable 300a to the control box 200, along with either the ICS 800 (and perhaps also the radio 850) through the cable 300b or one or both of the radio 900 and the audio source 950 through the cable 300c. As will be explained in greater detail, mixing circuitry of the control box 200 enables various forms of mixing of audio output by various combinations of these audio devices (i.e., the radio 700, the ICS 800, the radio 850, the radio 900 and the audio source 950) to the ears of a user of the headset 1000. As will also be explained in greater detail, the exact manner in which mixing is carried out changes automatically in response to which ones of these audio devices are coupled to the control box 200 and/or are active. As will be further explained in greater detail, a PTT circuit of the control box 200 enables a user of the head set 1000 to operate the PTT switch 215 to select to engage the push-to-talk (PTT) function of one of these audio devices at times when more than one of these audio devices are coupled to the control box 200, in which the use the PTT function of the selected device to convey their own speech (as detected by the communications microphone 135) to other persons. As will be yet further explained in greater detail, the exact manner in which the PTT switch 215 is operable to choose what audio device is to have its PTT function so engaged changes automatically in response to which ones of these audio devices are coupled to the control box 200.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">It is envisioned that the headset 1000 is well suited for use by personnel who both travel in a noisy environment within a vehicle having the ICS 800 installed therein to enable communication among them, and also work collaboratively in a noisy environment outside the vehicle while relying on radios (such as the radio 700) carried by each of them to enable communication among them. It is further envisioned that vehicle may incorporate the vehicle radio 850 (accessible through the ICS 800, as will be explained in greater detail), that one or more of the personnel may carry another radio (such as the radio 900), and/or that one or more of the personnel may carry another audio device outputting audio (such as the audio source 950). One example of such use is that of soldiers in a military vehicle (a wheeled vehicle, a vehicle having tracks, a helicopter or other flying vehicle, a small motorized boat, etc.) having the ICS 800, and possibly also the vehicle radio 850. As will be familiar to those<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> skilled in the art of military communications, such vehicles are often noisy inside such that the provision of the ICS 800 is necessary to enable personnel to hear each other talking. Further, depending on conditions at a destination reached by such a vehicle, battlefield sounds and/or physical separation of personnel on patrol or engaged in combat often necessitate the use of radios carried by each of the personnel to, again, hear each other talking. Still further, one or more of such personnel may also be carrying another radio to communicate across greater distance to still other personnel, perhaps personnel in another vehicle (e.g., a pilot in a supporting aircraft). Yet further, one or more of such may also be carrying another device outputting audio (i.e., another audio source) such as a talking global positioning system (GPS) device, etc. However, it should be noted that this envisioned military example is not the only possible application of the headset 1000, or of headsets having a similar configuration. Another envisioned application is that of pilots and passengers in propeller aircraft or helicopters in which an intercom system (e.g., the ICS 800) is also required for such people to hear each other talking. Further, such people may need to employ radios carried on their persons to continue being able to hear each other talking when their aircraft is on the ground in a noisy location (perhaps due to the running of engines and movement of air caused by propellers in motion).</p><p id="p0039" num="0039"><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Figure 1b</b></figref> depicts an alternate embodiment of the headset 1000 in which much of the functionality and at least some of the components (the type of components to be presented in greater detail) of the control box 200 are incorporated into one or both of the earpieces 110a and 110b. More specifically, the PTT switch 215 is disposed on one of the earpieces 110a or 110b, as previously discussed. Further, the connectors 220a and 220b are disposed at the end of the cable 140, which is depicted as being of a Y-cable configuration, although other configurations of the cable 140 to accommodate both of the connectors 220a and 220b are possible, as those skilled in the art will readily recognize.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040"><figref idrefs="f0003"><b>Figure 2a</b></figref> provides an enlarged perspective view of a variant of the control box 200 to more clearly depict various features. As depicted, the casing 210 of the control box 200 may be shaped in a way to enable an almost "pistol-like" grip of the casing 210 in a user's hand such that an index and second finger of a user's hand are able to be positioned over surfaces 216a and 216b, respectively, of the PTT switch 215, while 3rd and 4th fingers are able to be positioned over the surface 211. The casing 210 also incorporates a removable cover 212 providing access to a compartment (not shown) into which a power source 290 (e.g., a battery) may be inserted to supply electrical power to circuits enclosed at least within the casing 210.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The cable 140 extends from a surface 213 of one portion of the casing 210 to couple the control box 200 to the head assembly 100, and the connectors 220a and 220b are disposed on a surface 214 of another portion of the casing 210. With this arrangement of where the cable 140 and the connectors 220a and 220b are disposed on the casing 210, this depicted variant of the control box<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> 200 is configured to be essentially "in line" with the cable 140 and whatever other cables are coupled to the connectors 220a and 220b. This configuration may be deemed amenable to be held in place against a structural portion of the interior of an airplane cockpit or to a belt of a user via any of a variety of straps, clips, tapes, adhesives or other hardware (not shown). In an altered form, the cable 140 and both of the connectors 220a and 220b may be disposed on the portion of the casing 210 (e.g., all on the same surface 213 or 214), which may be deemed amenable to being held in place against a component of a piece of machinery or other device carried by a user (e.g., a power tool, a radio, etc.), against a component of a vehicle (e.g., clamped to a portion of a steering wheel, or a control column or "yoke" of an airplane, etc.), or in military applications, being somehow mounted to a portion of a gun (e.g., to the stock, the barrel, a handle, etc.) in a manner that allows a military user to operate the PTT switch 215 without taking a hand off the gun.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The PTT switch 215, as depicted, is a 3-posiiton rocker switch having the surfaces 216a and 216b, and being configured to enable a user to selectively use the push-to-talk function of only one of multiple audio devices that may be coupled to the connectors 220a and/or 220b (e.g., the radio 700, the radio 900, the ICS 800, or the radio 850 through the ICS 800) at any given time. In other words, a user may press their index finger against the surface 216a to move the surface 216a in a rocking motion on a pivot of the PTT switch 215 inward (i.e., in a direction generally into the casing 210) to one non-center position to select and engage the PTT function of one audio device, or the user may press their second finger against the surface 216b to move the surface 216b in an opposing rocking motion on the same pivot of the PTT switch 215 inward to another non-center position to select and engage the PTT function of another audio device. However, as will be familiar to those skilled in the art of the design of rocker switches, it is not possible to press both of the surfaces 216a and 216b inward to select and engage the PTT function of both audio devices at the same time. Thus, the PTT switch 215 serves, by its mechanical design, to limit a user of the headset 1000 to engaging the PTT function of only one audio device at a time without use of electric power from any power source to do so. Further, as depicted by the arrows, the PTT switch 215 functions as a momentary switch when moved to either non-center position in the manner in which it may be operated to select one or the other of two audio devices, such that a user must continuously press (i.e., "hold") one of the surfaces 216a and 216b inward to keep the PTT switch 215 at a non-center position against a biasing force exerted by a spring (or other component, such as a living hinge -- the direction of the biasing force from either non-center position being depicted by the arrows) incorporated into the PTT switch 215 that tends to bias it towards the depicted center position (and away from either non-center position) in which neither of surfaces 216a or 216b are pressed inward such that no audio device is selected. In the more common vernacular of those skilled in the art of the design of switches, the PTT switch 215 is a rocker switch with a spring-return to its center position and momentary action when<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> operated to be "thrown" in either direction to one of two non-center positions to select an audio device to engage the PTT function of.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idrefs="f0004"><b>Figure 2b</b></figref> provides an enlarge perspective view of another variant of the control box 200 to more clearly depict various features, among which is a variant of the PTT switch 215 implemented with a toggle or paddle type of switch, as opposed to the earlier depicted rocker switch. As depicted, the casing 210 of the control box 200 is shaped in a way to enable it to be gripped in a user's hand such that all four fingers (including the index and second fingers) overlie the surface 211, and the thumb is comfortably positioned to operate the PTT switch 215 by pressing that thumb alternately against one or the other of the surfaces 216a and 216b. Again, the casing 210 also incorporates a removable cover 212 providing access to a compartment (not shown) into which a power source 290 may be inserted to supply electrical power to circuits enclosed at least within the casing 210. Also again, the cable 140 extends from the surface 213 to couple the control box 200 to the head assembly 100, and the connectors 220a and 220b are disposed on the surface 214.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As has already been depicted with the PTT switch 215 implemented with a rocker switch, this depicted variant of the PTT switch 215 is also a 3-posiiton switch carrying the surfaces 216a and 216b, and being configured to enable a user to selectively use the push-to-talk function of only one of multiple audio devices that may be coupled to the connectors 220a and/or 220b (e.g., the radio 700, the radio 900, the ICS 800, or the radio 850 through the ICS 800) at any given time. In other words, a user may press their index finger against the surface 216a to move the surface 216a in a rocking motion on a pivot of the PTT switch 215 to a non-center position to select and engage the PTT function of one audio device, or the user may press their second finger against the surface 216b to move the surface 216b in an opposing rocking motion on the same pivot of the PTT switch 215 to another non-center position to select and engage the PTT function of another audio device. However, again, it is not possible to press both of the surfaces 216a and 216b to select and engage the PTT function of both audio devices at the same time.

In other words, <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 3</figref> provides<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> specific depiction of some conductors and circuit components that are germane to the presentation and understanding of various aspects of the headset 1000, while not specifically depicting other conductors and circuit components in an effort to not distract from such presentation and understanding. For example, although those killed in the art will readily recognize that the acoustic drivers 115a and 115b require at least a second electrical connection (e.g., to a ground conductor) in addition to a connection by which audio is conveyed to them, and yet, such a second electrical connection is not depicted. Also for example, although the power source 290 is specifically depicted, its power connections to other components are not depicted to avoid distracting from the depiction of other conductors more germane to the discussion of what is presented herein. Further, although the headset 1000 incorporates the communications microphone 135 that is meant to be employed in enabling two-way audio communications, the communications microphone 135, its supporting components (e.g., a pre-amplifier, etc.) and its electrical connections (including the connectors 220a and 220b) are not depicted. Thus, this lack of depiction of the communications microphone 135, or its supporting components, or the electrical connections it would likely have through the connectors 220a and 220b should not be taken as an indication of the microphone 135 not being present or of either the communications microphone 135 or its supporting components not drawing electric power from the same power source(s) from which other components of the electrical architecture 2000 that are depicted draw their electric power.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">As depicted, the depicted portions of the electrical architecture 2000 incorporate at least the acoustic drivers 115a and 115b; the PTT switch 215; the connectors 220a and 220b; multiple resistors 232a, 232b, 233, 236 and 258; a pair of audio amplifiers 242a and 242b; a bypass circuit 243; a PTT circuit 250; and the power source 290. The power source 290 provides power to at least the PTT circuit 250 and the audio amplifiers 242a and 242b, despite the lack of specific depiction of power conductors. Together, the resistors 232a, 232b, 233 and 236 make up a mixing circuit 230. In embodiments of the headset 1000 in which the acoustic drivers 115a and 115b are disposed within casings separate from the mixing circuit 230 and the PTT circuit 250, as might well be the case where the control box 200 is not integrated into the head assembly 100 as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">Figure 1</figref>, the acoustic drivers 115a and 115b may be coupled to much of the rest of what is depicted in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 3</figref> through the cable 140.

The connector 220a incorporates<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> an audio contact coupled to an audio conductor 222a that is coupled to the resistor 232a, and the connector 220b incorporates both audio1 and audio2 contacts coupled to audio conductors 222b and 223 that are coupled to the resistors 232b and 233, respectively. The connector 220a incorporates a radio connect contact coupled to a radio connect conductor 226a that is coupled to the PTT circuit 250 and to the resistor 236, and the connector 220b may incorporate a radio connect contact coupled to a radio connect conductor 226b that may also be coupled to the PTT circuit 250. Also, the connector 220b incorporates an ICS connect contact coupled to an ICS connect conductor 227 that is also coupled to the PTT circuit 250. The connectors 220a and 220b each incorporate a PTT contact that is coupled to a PTT conductor 228a and 228b, respectively, that are each separately coupled to the PTT circuit 250 and coupled to different contacts of the PTT switch 215.

The resistors 232b and 236 are similarly coupled to each other with their common node being further coupled to an input of the audio amplifier 242b and another input of the bypass circuit 243. The resistors 232b and 236 function to subject audio signals received via the audio1 conductor 222b to the same degree of attenuation to which audio signals received via either the audio conductor 222a or the audio2 conductor 223 are subjected. This is done to balance the amplitudes of whatever audio is acoustically output to each ear of a user of the headset 1000 by the acoustic drivers 115a and 115b. As will be explained in greater detail, this balance in amplitude is constantly maintained by the mixing circuit 230 regardless of what audio devices are coupled to the connectors 220a-b and in spite of any loss of power from the power source 290.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Outputs of the audio amplifiers 242a and 242b are coupled to the acoustic drivers 115a and 115b, respectively.

During normal operation of the headset 1000 in which electric power is being provided to the audio amplifiers 242a and 242b by the power source 290, the audio amplifiers 242a and 242b amplify the audio signals received at their inputs and drive the acoustic drivers 115a and 115b, respectively, with amplified forms of those audio signals.

During operation of the headset 1000 in which electric power is not being provided by the power source 290 (e.g:, where the power source 290 is depleted or disconnected from the headset 1000), the audio<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> amplifiers 242a and 242b may be deprived of power and cease to function to provide amplification of audio signals. In response to this loss of electric power, the bypass circuit 243 electrically couples the common node of the resistors 232a and 233 to the acoustic driver 115a, and electrically couples the common node of the resistors 232b and 236 to the acoustic driver 115b, thereby permitting whatever audio devices that are coupled to the connectors 220a and/or 220b to more directly drive the acoustic drivers 115a and/or 115b with audio signals.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">A common contact of the PTT switch 215 is coupled to the ground conductor 221. As previously discussed, the PTT switch 215 is biased by a spring (or living hinge or other mechanism) to a center position in which no audio device is selected to engage its PTT function (and away from either of two non-center positions). This position in which no audio device is selected corresponds to the common contact of the PTT switch 215 not being coupled to either of the contacts of the PTT switch that are coupled to either of the PTT conductors 228a or 228b. Operation of the PTT switch 215 by a user of the headset 1000 towards a non-center position to select and engage the PTT function of an audio device entails the common contact of the PTT switch 215 being coupled within the PTT switch 215 to the ground conductor 221, and thereby coupling one or the other of the PTT conductors 228a and 228b to the ground conductor 221, as well as the corresponding contact of one or the other of the connectors 220a and 220b, respectively. The PTT circuit 250, which is also coupled to the PTT conductors 228a and 228b, monitors the PTT conductors 228 and 228b for instances of one or the other of these conductors being coupled to the ground conductor 221 by user operation of the PTT switch 215. During normal operation of the headset 1000 in which electric power is being provided by the power source 290 to the PTT circuit 250, the PTT circuit 250 selectively augments the functionality of the PTT switch 215 in enabling a user to select and engage the PTT function of an audio device in response to various conditions that the PTT circuit 250 detects, as will be explained in greater detail. During operation of the headset 1000 in which electric power is not being provided by the power source 290, the PTT circuit 250 may be deprived of power and ceases to function to augment the functionality of the PTT switch 215 in the various ways that will be described. Despite such loss of electric power, the PTT switch 215 remains operable to enable a user of the headset 1000 to be moved to either of two non-center positions to select and engage the PTT functionality of either an audio device coupled to the connector 220a or an audio device coupled to the connector 220b.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051"><figref idrefs="f0006"><b>Figures 4a</b></figref><b>,</b><figref idrefs="f0007"><b>4b</b></figref><b>,</b><figref idrefs="f0008"><b>4c</b></figref><b>,</b><figref idrefs="f0009"><b>4d</b></figref><b>and</b><figref idrefs="f0010"><b>4e</b></figref><b>,</b> taken together, depict various possible coupling configurations of the headset 1000 in which different possible ones or possible combinations of the cables 300a-c, and different possible ones or possible combinations of audio devices are coupled to the connectors 220a and/or 220b of the headset 1000.

With the coupling of the cable 300a to the connector 220a, the radio connect conductor 226a is coupled to the ground conductor 221 in a conductive loop formed within the cable 300a. This grounding of the radio connect conductor 226a provides the PTT circuit 250 with an indication of the connection of at least the cable 300a to the connector 220a, thereby providing the PTT circuit 250 with an indication of there being an audio device capable of two-way audio communications (such as a radio) to the connector 220a. With the coupling of the radio 700 to the connector 220a via the cable 300a, the radio 700 is coupled to the ground conductor 221, the audio conductor 222a and the PTT conductor 228a through the cable 300a.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">With all of these couplings made, the radio 700 is able to output an audio signal to the audio conductor 222a, which conveys the audio signal to the audio amplifier 242a and the bypass circuit 243 through the resistor 232a.

With no audio device coupled to the connector 220b, the audio2 conductor 223 is not coupled to an audio device, resulting in the resistor 233 effectively presenting an infinite impedance at the common node of the resistors 232a and 233, despite its own small impedance. Thus, given the relatively high impedance of the input to the amplifier 242a (e.g., perhaps 10Kohms to 100Kohms), the audio signal conveyed via the audio conductor 222a is attenuated by the resistor 232a to only a relative minor degree, at most.

As those familiar with common practices in the design of two-way radios (including portable radios supporting two-way audio communications) will readily recognize, it is common practice to remotely cause a coupling of an input to a two-way radio to a ground conductor cause the PTT function of that radio to be engaged.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></p><p id="p0055" num="0055">With no other audio device coupled to the connector 220b, the possibility exists that a user of the headset 1000 may become confused about which way to operate the PTT switch 215 (i.e., which non-center position to operate the PTT switch 215 towards) to select and engage the PTT function of the radio 700, and may mistakenly operate the PTT switch 215 in a wrong way (i.e., to a wrong non-center position) that uselessly couples the PTT conductor 228b to the ground conductor 221, instead of coupling the PTT conductor 228a to the ground conductor 221.

Indeed, to enable this balancing, it is preferred that all four of the resistors 232a, 232b, 233 and 236 have the same resistive value (i.e., a common resistance R, as depicted). As a result, the amplitude of the audio acoustically output to the ears of a user of the headset 1000 is balanced between what is acoustically output to one ear versus what is acoustically output to the other. The manner in which these resistors are coupled together and cooperate also serve to provide an advantageous proportion of mixing between the audio signals provided on the audio conductor 222a and the audio2 conductor 223, such that one ear of a user is provided with an even mixture of these two audio signals, while the other ear is provided solely with the audio signal provided on the audio 1 conductor 222b. It has been determined to be desirable to generally provide audio from each radio to only one ear of a user, while providing audio from an intercom system to both ears. This has been found to be advantageous in enabling a user to quickly distinguish things said to the user by individuals over a radio who are probably at a location where the user cannot see those individuals from things said to the user by individuals over an intercom system who are probably in the same vehicle with user (or otherwise in close proximity with the user such that the user is able to see them). It has also been determined to be desirable to provide audio from two different radios to separate ears of a user, as it has been found to be advantageous in enabling a user to quickly determine which radio a user is hearing someone through so as to more easily maintain a clear mental picture of the locations of different individuals who may be talking to the user at the same time. Further, this use of these resistors in forming passive mixers enables the mixing circuit 230 to function without electric power from the power source 290 (or any other power source) such that loss of electric power will not impair the operation of the mixing circuit 230.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">With the coupling of audio devices to both of the connectors 220a and 220b, the PTT circuit 250 generally responds by ceasing to augment the functionality of the PTT switch 215. More precisely, the PTT circuit 250 detects the coupling of the ICS connect conductor 227 to a positive voltage relative to the ground conductor 221, detects the coupling of the radio connect conductor 226a to the ground conductor 221, and determines that audio devices supporting two-way audio communications have been coupled to each of the connectors 220a and 220b. In response, the PTT circuit 250 refrains from augmenting the functionality of the PTT switch 215. This enables a user of the headset 1000 to simply operate the PTT switch 215 towards one non-center position or the other to couple the ground conductor 221 to either the PTT conductor 228a to engage the PTT function of the radio 700 or the PTT conductor 228b to engage the PTT function of the radio 850 (through the ICS 800).</p><p id="p0073" num="0073"><figref idrefs="f0010"><b>Figure 4e</b></figref> depicts a coupling configuration in which the radio 700 is coupled to the connector 220a via the cable 300a, and in which one or both of the radio 900 and the audio source 950 are coupled to the connector 220b via the cable 300c. With the coupling of the cables 300a and 300c<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> to the connectors 220a and 220b, respectively, the radio connect conductors 226a and 226b are both coupled to the ground conductor 221 in conductive loops formed within the cables 300a and 300c, respectively. With the coupling of the radio 700 to the connector 220a via the cable 300a, the radio 700 is coupled to the ground conductor 221, the audio conductor 222a and the PTT conductor 228a through the cable 300a. Where the radio 900 is coupled to the connector 220b via the cable 300c, the radio 900 is coupled to the ground conductor 221, the audio1 conductor 222b and the PTT conductor 228b through the cable 300c.

With audio signals being provided on both the audio conductor 222a and the audio2 conductor 223, the resistors 232a and 233 cooperate as a passive mixer to mix the audio signals provided on these two conductors, with the resulting mixed audio signal being conveyed from the common node of these two resistors to the acoustic driver 115a through the audio amplifier 242a or the bypass circuit 243, as previously discussed at length in reference to <figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 4d</figref>.

In other words, this presentation of all three of the passive mixer 230, the PTT switch 215 and the PTT circuit 250 into the same headset 1000 is meant to serve only as a single example that is presented to facilitate providing an explanation of the structure and function of each, and should not be taken as indicating that any one of these necessarily requires one or both of the others. For example, and as suggested by <figref idrefs="f0011">Figures 5a</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0013">6a</figref>, it is envisioned that the passive mixer 230 may be employed in headphones that provide no facility, whatsoever, for the user of the headphones to engage any PTT function of any device to which those headphones may be coupled. Also for example, and as suggested by <figref idrefs="f0012">Figures 5b</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0013">6b</figref>, it is envisioned that the PTT circuit 250 may be employed with a hand-held microphone or a microphone on a desk stand at a radio station or other environment with stationary speakers being provided in place of any form of headphones or headsets for listening to received radio signals.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">It should also be noted that although the radios 700 and 900 are presented as coupling a conductor coupled to one or the other of the connectors 220a and 220b to the ground conductor 221 when coupled to one of these connectors, and although the ICS 800 is presented as coupling a conductor coupled to the connector 220b to a power source of the ICS 800 when coupled to the connector 220b, these choices of manner in which the coupling of the radio 700, the radio 900 and the ICS 800 is signaled to the PTT circuit 250 representing arbitrary choices. More specifically, other embodiments are possible in which one of the radio 700 or 900 couples a conductor that is coupled to<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> one or the other of the connectors 220a and 220b to a power source of that one of the radio 700 or 900 when that one of the radio 700 or 900 is coupled to that one of the connectors 220a and 220b. However, it is deemed preferable to avoid the possibility of draining the often very limited power sources of a radio, especially a portable radio, allowing any component of the headset 1000 (including the PTT circuit 250) to draw power from such power sources. In contrast, it is deemed desirable to allow the ICS 800 to provide a coupling to a power source of the ICS 800 when coupled to the headset 1000. In addition to the provision of power serving as a signal to the PTT circuit 250 that the ICS 800 is coupled to the headset 1000, the fact the ICS 800 is likely to have access to a much higher capacity power supply of a vehicle makes it potentially desirable to draw electric power from the ICS 800 in lieu of depleting the power source 290, which may also be of highly limited capacity.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079"><figref idrefs="f0011"><b>Figure 5a</b></figref> depicts a variant of the electrical architecture 2000 of <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 3</figref> in which an alternate form of the mixing circuit 230 is depicted, as well as the audio amplifiers 242a and 242b, the bypass circuit 243 and the acoustic drivers 115a and 115b.
