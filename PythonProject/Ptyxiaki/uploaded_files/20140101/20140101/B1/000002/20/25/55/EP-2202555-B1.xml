Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">Apparatuses and methods consistent with the present invention relate to a light source apparatus of an image display apparatus, and more particularly, to a collimate lens assembly which collimates illumination light of a light source.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In general, in an image display apparatus such as a beam projector, a light source apparatus is installed to generate illumination light, and in the light source apparatus, a collimate lens assembly is installed to collimate illumination light irradiated from the light source. The collimate lens assembly bends and reflects the illumination light irradiated from the light source, forms parallel light, and project the light on an image apparatus such as a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Halogen lamps have been widely used as a light source, but these days, metal halide lamps or xenon lamps are being used more frequently than halogen lamps because halogen lamps consume more electric power and heating energy. In particular, in the case of small-sized image display apparatuses such as a portable beam projector, a light source apparatus having a light emitting diode (LED) as a light source is often used.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, a LED light source is darker than a related-art light source, and thus the light source occupies a large area of an image display apparatus comprising the light source. If the area of the light source increases, the size of a collimate lens assembly should also be increased in order to maintain a certain level of a condensing efficiency. Consequently, the volume of the light source apparatus increases, and thus there is a need to resolve this issue.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20070278512A"><text>US 2007/0278512</text></patcit> describes a packaged light emitting device which includes a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> substrate, a solid state light emitting device on the substrate, a first generally toroidal lens on the substrate and defining a cavity relative to the solid state light emitting device and having a first index of refraction, and a second lens at least partially within the cavity formed by the first lens and having a second index of refraction that is different from the first index of refraction.

The matters defined in the description, such as the detailed construction and elements, are provided to assist in a comprehensive understanding of the invention. Thus, it is apparent that the present invention can be carried out without those specifically defined matters.

The angle of incidence may change depending on whether the total reflection surface 113 is coated or not, and if the surface is not coated, the angle of incidence may be formed to satisfy the conditions for total reflection according to the texture of the first collimate lens 110.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The second refracting surface 112 refracts the illumination light reflected via the total reflection surface 113 to form a parallel light, and has the index of refraction which allows the angle proportion of the refracted illumination light to be within a certain area. In order to do so, the second refracting surface 112 may form one of aspheric, flat, and curved surface, and a designer may select one of them depending on the type of light source and the volume of an optical system.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The second refracting surface 112 of the present exemplary embodiment has an aspheric surface, and the illumination light refracted by the second refracting surface 112 is condensed on an image formation surface within the range of ±20 degrees.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The total reflection surface 113 is formed to have an angle which satisfies the conditions for total reflection of light penetrating materials, and can be used without coating the surface. However, the surface may be coated with reflecting material, if necessary.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The hole 115 is penetrably formed at the center of the first collimate lens 110, and is formed in a location which faces the LED light source 10. The diameter of the hole 115 may be at least greater than the diameter of the LED light source 10.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The second collimate lens 120 is formed to have the same diameter as the hole 115 which is formed at the center of the first collimate lens 110, and is connected or fixed to the hole 115 by an ultraviolet (UV) bond 117.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The second collimate lens 120 is formed to have a greater index of refraction than the index of refraction of the fist collimate lens 110. The second collimate lens 120 may be formed to have a relatively higher index of refraction to collimate the illumination light of the LED light source 10 more efficiently.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As described above, in order for the first collimate lens 110 and the second collimate lens 120 to have different indexes of refraction, the first collimate lens 110 and the second collimate lens 120 may be made of different materials. Preferably, but not necessarily, the first collimate lens 110 is made of a plastic material such as Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) and ZENOR, and the second collimate lens 120 is made of a glass material.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">If the first collimate lens 110 is made of a plastic material, it is easy to form the first refraction surface 111 and the second refraction surface 112, and it is also easier to form the total reflection surface 113 which satisfies the conditions for total reflection.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As described above, if the first collimate lens 110 and the second collimate lens 120 are made of different materials, and the second collimate lens 120 has a greater index of refraction compared with the first collimate lens 110, the condensing efficiency can be enhanced even though the collimate lens assembly 100 is formed smaller than before.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">That is, if the second collimate lens 120 disposed in a position corresponding to the LED light source 10 is formed to have a greater index of refraction than that of the first collimate lens 110, the illumination light irradiated from the LED light source 10 forms parallel light, having a minimum angle change towards a central light axis of the LED light source 10. Therefore, the illumination light is condensed almost perpendicular to the image formation surface, and as a result, the collimating efficiency can be enhanced.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006">FIGS. 3 to 6</figref> illustrate experimental proportions of a condensing efficiency according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the above experiment, the properties of the first collimate lens 110 are as follows: K of the first refracting surface 111 is 0.40834 and the radius is 5.4535, and K of the second refracting 112 is 0.017438 and the radius is 5.2287.
