mxw-id="PDES63957521" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>Field of the invention</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to preservatives and antimicrobial agents. In particular, the invention relates to preservatives derived from extracts derived from sugar cane which can be used to preserve food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and other similar compositions and to antimicrobial agents derived from extracts derived from sugar cane which can be used in oral hygiene products.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background of the invention</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In this specification where a document, act or item of knowledge is referred to or discussed, this reference or discussion is not an admission that the document, act or item of knowledge or any combination thereof was at the priority date, publicly available, known to the public, part of common general knowledge; or known to be relevant to an attempt to solve any problem with which this specification is concerned.</p><heading id="h0003"><i>Preservatives</i></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">A preservative is a natural or synthetic chemical that is added to products such as foods, pharmaceuticals, biological samples, wood, etc. to prevent decomposition by microbial growth or by undesirable chemical changes.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Food preservation is the process of treating and handling food in a way that preserves its edibility and nutrition value. The main effort is to stop or greatly slow down spoilage to prevent foodborne illness (e.g. by salting, cooling, cooking). However some methods utilise benign bacteria, yeasts or fungi to add specific qualities and to preserve food (e.g. cheese, wine). While maintaining or creating nutritional value, texture and flavour is important in preserving its value as food; this is a culturally dependent determinant as what qualifies as food fit for humans in one culture may not qualify in another culture.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Preservation usually involves preventing the growth of bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms, as well as retarding the oxidation of fats which cause rancidity. It also includes processes to inhibit natural ageing and discolouration that can occur during food preparation such as the enzymatic browning reaction in apples which causes browning when apples are cut. Some preservation methods required the food to be sealed after<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> treatment to prevent re-contamination with microbes; others, such as drying, allow food to be stored without any special containment for long periods.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Common methods of applying these processes include drying, spray drying, freeze drying, freezing, vacuum-packing, canning, preserving in syrup, sugar crystallisation, food irradiation, adding preservatives or inert gases such as carbon dioxide. Other methods that not only help to preserve food, but also add flavour, include pickling, salting, smoking, preserving in syrup or alcohol, sugar crystallisation and curing.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Preservative food additives can be used alone or in conjunction with other methods of food preservation. Preservatives may be anti-microbial preservatives, which inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi, or antioxidants such as oxygen absorbers, which inhibit the oxidation of food constituents. Common anti-microbial preservatives include calcium propionate, sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, sulfites (sulfur dioxide, sodium bisulfite, potassium hydrogen sulfite, etc.) and disodium EDTA. Common antioxidants include BHT (butylated hydroxy toluene) and BHA (butylated hydroxy anisole). Other preservatives include formaldehyde (usually in solution), glutaraldehyde (kills insects), ethanol and methylchloroisothiazolinone. The benefits and safety of many artificial food additives (including preservatives) are the subject of debate among academics and regulators specializing in food science and toxicology.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Antioxidants are used in a wide range of food products including, but not limited to, meat, poultry, fats, oils, margarines, fish, seafood and baked goods to inhibit the break-down of fats and oils or their oxidised products. The market is currently dominated by synthetic preservatives such as BHT and BHA. These are starting to be replaced by natural preservatives such as rosemary, tea extracts, tocopherol and ascorbate. However, the current natural preservatives can be expensive which limits their broader use in foods, leading to continued use of the synthetic preservatives.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Antimicrobials are also currently employed as preservatives within the food industry to extend product shelf life, improve product safety, maintain product quality, reduce processing costs and increase the ability to distribute products globally in complex supply chains. Due to consumer concern about the use of synthetic additives, the market for synthetic antimicrobials is declining and being replaced with natural antimicrobials.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Natural substances such as salt, sugar, vinegar, and diatomaceous earth are also used as traditional preservatives. Another group of preservatives targets enzymes in fruits and<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> vegetables that continue to metabolize after they are cut. For instance, citric and ascorbic acids from lemon or other citrus juice can inhibit the action of the enzyme phenolase which turns surfaces of cut apples and potatoes brown.</p><heading id="h0004"><i>Rancidity</i></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">Rancidification is the decomposition of fats, oils and other lipids by hydrolysis or oxidation, or both. Hydrolysis will split fatty acid chains away from the glycerol backbone in glycerides. These free fatty acids can then undergo further auto-oxidation. Oxidation primarily occurs with unsaturated fats by a free radical-mediated process. These chemical processes can generate highly reactive molecules in rancid foods and oils, which are responsible for producing unpleasant and noxious odours and flavours. These chemical processes may also destroy nutrients in food. Under some conditions, rancidity, and the destruction of vitamins, occurs very quickly.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">When a fatty substance is exposed to air, its unsaturated components are converted into hydroperoxides, which break down into volatile aldehydes, esters, alcohols, ketones, and hydrocarbons, some of which have disagreeable odours. Butter becomes rancid by the foregoing process and by hydrolysis, which liberates volatile and malodorous acids, particularly butyric acid. Saturated fats such as beef tallow are resistant to oxidation and seldom become rancid at ordinary temperatures.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Factors which accelerate fat oxidation include trace metals (iron, zinc, etc.), salt, light, water, bacteria, and moulds. Fat oxidation can be retarded by use of spices such as sage and rosemary, and by storing fats and oils in a cool, dark place with little exposure to oxygen or free-radicals, since heat and light accelerate the rate of reaction of fats with oxygen.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Antioxidants are often added to fat-containing foods in order to retard the development of rancidity due to oxidation. Natural antioxidants include flavonoids, polyphenols, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and tocopherols (vitamin E). Synthetic antioxidants include BHA, BHT, propyl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate (also known as propyl gallate) and ethoxyquin. The natural antioxidants tend to be short-lived, so synthetic antioxidants are used when a longer shelf-life is preferred. The effectiveness of water-soluble antioxidants is limited in preventing direct oxidation within fats, but is valuable in intercepting free-radicals that travel through the watery parts of foods.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0005"><i>Natural antioxidants</i></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">Some modem synthetic preservatives have become controversial because they have been shown to cause respiratory or other health problems. Some studies point to synthetic preservatives and artificial coloring agents aggravating ADD &amp; ADHD symptoms in those affected. Several major studies show academic performance increased and disciplinary problems decreased in large non-ADD student populations when artificial ingredients, including preservatives were eliminated from school food programs. Allergenic preservatives in food or medicine can cause anaphylactic shock in susceptible individuals, a condition which is often fatal within minutes without emergency treatment.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Accordingly, there is now a trend to use natural antioxidants. Plants contain phytochemicals, many of which are known to have antioxidant properties. Polyphenols is a generic name for a group of phytochemicals including flavonoids, anthocyanins and phenolic acids which occur naturally in a wide range of plants. Most are coloured and are responsible for the colors found in the fruits and in other parts of the plants. Their bioactivity is principally as an antioxidant which assists in protecting the plant from tissue damage and invasion by microorganisms.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The literature on plant phenolics is extensive and various polyphenols associated with different plant species have been well characterized and studied. The physiological effects of ingestion of many such polyphenols has also been examined clinically and they have been found not only to exhibit antioxidant activity but also anti-inflammatory and vasodilation properties.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Commonly consumed foods such as coffee, tea, cocoa (chocolate), red wine, berries (blue berries, blackberries, strawberries) and fruits (mangosteens, Noni, pomegranates, Acai, grapes) are now being shown and marketed for their high antioxidant levels and health promoting properties.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In general, plants and plant products have a much higher antioxidant content than do animal food products. Certain spices, berries, fruits, nuts, chocolate-containing products, vegetables and cereals are good sources of dietary antioxidants. Further, the drinks of coffee, green and black tea, red wine and various berry and fruit juices are good sources of antioxidants.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Antioxidant syrups and powders from many of the above sources are now being offered as food ingredients and additives for use in a wide range of food systems. High polyphenol antioxidant syrups and powders (eg grape derived Vinlife from Tarac Technologies in South<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Australia and Polyphenolics from California, USA) are finding their way into products such as chocolate (Cocoa Farm, Melbourne Australia), cocoa beverages, teas and ice creams (Wendy's Vinlife Ice Cream, Australia). However, these food ingredients are usually being used to increase the antioxidant content of the food to provide beneficial health effects and not as food preservatives.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Sugar cane is known to contain polyphenols and other phytochemicals having beneficial properties. Examples of publications regarding these properties include international patent application nos <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2005117608A"><text>WO 2005/117608</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="AU2006000769W"><text>PCT/AU2006/000769</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="AU2007001382W"><text>PCT/AU2007/001382</text></patcit>. However, these documents do not disclose the use of low colour extracts of sugar cane as food preservatives.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The antioxidant activity of a number of sugar cane manufacturing products is measured in <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Payet et al, "Comparison of the Concentrations of Phenolic Constituents in Cane Sugar Manufacturing Products with their Antioxidant Activities" J Agric Food Chem, 2006, 54, 7270-7276</text></nplcit>. The document speculates that the antioxidant activity may be due to the effect of Maillard reaction products and the large increase in colorant. Preservatives which have a high colour would have limited use as a food additive. There is no disclosure of the use of low colour extracts of sugar cane as food preservatives.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Japanese patent publication no <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2001112439A"><text>2001-112439</text></patcit> discloses that an extract from brown sugar which contains melanoidins has an antioxidant effect, can be used to reduce body fat and improve skin condition. However, melanoidins are brown, high molecular weight heterogeneous polymers that are formed when sugars and amino acids combine (through a Maillard reaction) at high temperatures and low water activity. The extract would therefore have a high colour which would limit its use as a food additive. The extract may also have a strong flavour which would further limit its use as a food additive. There is no disclosure of the use of low colour extracts of sugar cane as food preservatives</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Japanese patent publication no <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2002161046A"><text>2002-161046</text></patcit> discloses that polyphenols can be extracted from sugar cane ear which have antioxidant properties.

These natural antioxidants tend to be expensive. Tocopherol also has practical issues because it is hydrophobic. Ascorbate has practical issues since it adds an acidic taste to foods.</p><heading id="h0006"><i>Antimicrobial agents</i></heading><p id="p0027" num="0027">Agents that kill or inhibit microorganisms may be classified as disinfectants, antiseptics or antibiotics. Antibiotics are molecules that are produced by one microorganism that kill (bacteriocidal) or inhibit (bacteriostatic) other microorganisms. Antiseptics and disinfectants are commercially prepared chemicals and the distinction between them is that antiseptics can be exposed to mucosal surfaces for at least a short time and disinfectants should not as they could impart harm.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The ADA's Council on Scientific Affairs has highlighted the oral health benefits of other ADA-Accepted products such as antimicrobial mouth rinses and toothpastes that can help prevent and reduce plaque and gingivitis, and fluoride mouth rinses that can provide extra protection against tooth decay over that provided by fluoride toothpaste alone.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Rinses are generally classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as either: cosmetic, therapeutic, or a combination of the two. Cosmetic rinses are commercial over-the-counter (OTC) products that help remove oral debris before or after brushing, temporarily suppress bad breath, diminish bacteria in the mouth and refresh the mouth with a pleasant taste. Therapeutic rinses have the benefits of their cosmetic counterparts, but also contain an added active ingredient that helps protect against some oral diseases. Therapeutic rinses are regulated by the FDA and are voluntarily approved by the American Dental Association (ADA).</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Most mouth rinses are, at the very least, effective oral antiseptics that freshen the mouth and curb bad breath for up to three hours. Their success in preventing tooth decay, gingivitis (inflammation of the gingival gum tissue) and periodontal disease is limited, however.

There were notable differences between all profiles which could be used to characterise the pools. Pool 1 showed a gradual rising profile with only one minor peak. Presumably this sample contains heterogeneous polymeric material which could not be resolved to individual peaks by the HPLC column. Pool 2 represents the molecular weight range 636-1377 Da and includes the sharp peak of dark brown material. This pool showed the most hydrophilic material eluting at less than 1 min, and a number of well-resolved peaks on the gradient. Pools 3 and 4 represent the low-colour antioxidant peak and showed considerable differences between their respective profiles. Pool 5 showed a range of peaks which could represent low molecular weight phenolic acids and a higher molecular weight compounds that have been weakly bound to the column and were not eluted according to their molecular weights. The proportion of hydrophilic material in this pool was low resulting in greater peak heights in the hydrophobic region of the profile. The molasses load sample enables some peaks to be matched up to certain molecular<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> weight ranges in the pools, as well as showing which molasses peaks are weakly bound to the gel and eluted in Pool 5. All samples exhibited a significant peak at 14.5 min which is not relevant to the chromatography, and represents an acetonitrile flush to remove all bound material from the column at the end of the run. Interestingly, this peak which represents the more hydrophobic compounds in molasses, decreased with molecular weight of the pools.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083"><i>SDS-PAGE:</i> Denaturing electrophoresis of the lyophilised pools was used to detect protein material in the extracts. No protein bands were apparent above 14 kDa in the extracts. In Pool 1 (Lane 2) light staining was observed close to the dye front, but it is uncertain if this is stained protein or residual Coomassie Blue from an uneven dye front. Detection of low molecular weight polypeptides (&lt;10 kDa) would require a 16% gel with a Tris-Tricine buffer.</p><heading id="h0019"><u>Conclusion</u></heading><p id="p0084" num="0084">The gel filtration profiles showed that dark molasses colorants measured at 420 nm were eluted in the void volume of the column (&gt;1800 Da) and at 832 Da. Antioxidant activity and total phenolics co-eluted with these two colour peaks. A broad antioxidant/phenolic peak was eluted between 135 and 599 kDa, but was not associated with a colour peak. This antioxidant peak contained all the sucrose and monosaccharides. It comprised 49% of the eluted antioxidant activity and 50% of the total phenolics. Consequently, removal of the dark colorants of molasses would approximately halve the antioxidant activity of the product The dark-coloured polymeric material eluting near the void volume comprised 14% of the eluted antioxidant activity.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">The quantities of lyophilised gel filtration pools varied from 0.5 g to 18 g, with high masses obtained for the two pools containing sugars. Recovery of antioxidant activity was greater than 92% in three of the lyophilised pools, but significant losses in antioxidant activity were found in Pools 2 and 5.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">HPLC fingerprints of the lyophilised pools showed some distinct differences which could be used to characterise the samples. Protein analysis by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed an absence of protein material above 14 kDa in all lyophilised samples. Pool 1 showed a trace of a protein stain near the dye front. This could be bound protein associated with hydrolysable tannins<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><p id="p0087" num="0087">The lyophilised samples will be analysed subsequently for polysaccharides and polyphenol characterisation, and for their ability to inhibit gut enzymes.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">The example demonstrates that the colour profiles obtained by the gel filtration of molasses were dependent on the pH and/or composition of the buffer and that a less coloured high antioxidant extract according to the invention can be produced. At pH 7.5, most of the dark colour was eluted at the void volume, while at pH 5.0, a second dark-coloured peak was observed at lower molecular weight. The pH 5.0 buffer contained 10% acetonitrile which could have contributed to a change in the permeation properties of the gel.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">Such a lower colour high antioxidant extract will be useful as an additive to foods to reduce GI, reduce carcinogenicity, change body composition and be useful as an antioxidant or antimicrobial without interference with the colour or organoleptic properties of the food.

The batch used in this study was not recently prepared and a fresh batch of the molasses extract polyphenol powder may yield better results as polyphenols tend to oxidize rapidly without appropriate storage.</p><p id="p0163" num="0163">Whilst the example uses a high colour molasses extract, it is expected that the relevant polyphenols will be present in the low colour high antioxidant extracts used in the methods according to the invention.
