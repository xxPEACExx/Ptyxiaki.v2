As a paint coating system which can meets these requirements, there has been known in the art a cartridge type paint coating system employing cartridges which are filled with different colors and adapted to be interchangeably attached to a coater unit (see, for example, Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2000176328A"><text>2000-176328</text></patcit>, Patent Literature 2: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2004042036A"><text>2004-42036</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The cartridge type paint coating system, according to the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> prior art mentioned-above, is largely constituted by a paint coating machine including a coater unit for spraying paint which is supplied from loaded cartridge toward a coating object, and a paint replenishing system for a cartridge which is adapted to replenish an empty or consumed cartridge with paint which is supplied from a paint source by way of a paint supply line.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In this case, the paint replenishing system for a cartridge is provided with a paint feed means adapted to supply paint to a paint chamber which cartridge is defined in a paint chamber and an extruding liquid chamber by a movable partition wall, and an extruding liquid supply means adapted to push out residues of a previous color from the paint chamber by supplying an extruding liquid to the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As soon as a cartridge is set on a replenishing stool, an extruding liquid is supplied to an extruding liquid chamber in the cartridge from an extruding feed means to push out residues of a previous color from a paint chamber. In the next place, paint is replenished into the paint chamber of the cartridge by a paint feed means. At this time, the extruding liquid in the extruding liquid chamber is discharged and collected in an extruding liquid storage tank.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Generally, a paint replenishing system for a cartridge of this sort is provided with a flow meter in a paint conduit for the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> purpose of resilling a cartridge with a predetermined amount of paint which will be used in next coating operation. By means of this flow meter, the paint replenishing system for a cartridge can measure the flow rate of paint in supply to a cartridge, turning off the paint supply as soon as the cartridge is replenished with a suitable amount of paint which is determined depending upon the size of a work piece to be painted, coating film thickness and other conditions of a paint coating operation.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In this regard, according to the prior art mentioned above, a flow meter is provided in the course of a paint supply conduit thereby to measure the amount of replenishing paint. Taking into consideration the fact that there are a diversity of paint products which differ from each other in properties such as viscosity and specific gravity and which may or may not contain mica or a metallic component. Therefore, depending upon paint properties, errors can occur to measurements by a flow meter.

<ol><li>(1) According to the present invention, there is provided a paint replenishing system for a cartridge composed of: a paint feed means for feeding paint to a cartridge which is defined to a paint chamber and an extruding liquid chamber by a partition wall, and an extruding liquid feed means adapted to push out residual paint from the paint chamber by feeding an extruding liquid to the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge.
<br/>
In order to achieve the above-stated objective, the paint replenishing system for a cartridge according to the present invention comprises: a quantitation setup means for presetting a quantity of paint to be replenished into the paint chamber of the cartridge according to a preset target quantitation value, and stopping paint replenishment by the paint feed means as soon as<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> discharges of an extruding liquid from the extruding liquid chamber reach a preset target quantitation value by a replenished paint of the paint chamber by the paint feed means.
<br/>
With the arrangements just described, a cartridge is set on the paint feed means, connecting the extruding liquid feed means to the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge. In this state, an extruding liquid is fed to the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge from the extruding liquid feed means to push out residual paint from the paint chamber of the cartridge, getting rid of residues of a color which was not used in a previous paint coating operation. Then, the paint feed means is connected to the paint chamber of the cartridge, and wash fluids are fed thereto to wash clean the interiors of the paint chamber.
<br/>
On the other hand, by way of the quantitation setup means, a quantity of a next color to be replenished into the paint chamber of the cartridge is set at a specified target value. In this state, paint of a color to be used in a next paint coating operation is fed to the cartridge from the paint feed means. At this time, by the paint replenishment to the paint chamber, an equivalent amount of an extruding liquid is displaced and discharged from the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge.
<br/>
In the meantime, the discharged amount of the extruding liquid are measured by the quantitation setup means. As soon as the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> discharged amount of the extruding liquid reach a quantity corresponding to a preset target quantitation value, the paint supply from the paint feed means is stopped to complete a quantitative paint replenishment to the cartridge by the quantitation setup means.
<br/>
Thus, irrespective of paint properties (e.g., viscosity, specific gravity or existence or absence of a metallic component and the like), paint can be replenished into a paint chamber of a cartridge exactly in a quantity which is required in a next coating operation.
<br/>
That is to say, irrespective of the nature or properties, all kinds of paint media can be replenished into a cartridge correctly in a specified quantity to realize a significant reduction in paint consumption by cutting the amount of discarding waste paint, in addition to a cut in cost of waste paint disposal. Even in a case where a cartridge is repeatedly replenished exclusively with paint of a particular color, the cartridge can be exempted from degradations in coating quality, it becomes possible to improve painting quality.
</li><li>(2) According to the present invention, wherein the quantitation setup means is comprised of a quantitation tank, an extruding liquid line change-over valve for selectively connecting the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge with either an<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> extruding liquid feed means or the quantitation tank, a movable partition wall incorporated into the quantitation tank to define therein a metering chamber having an inner volume varying in proportion to a quantity of the extruding liquid introduced into the metering chamber from the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge, a quantitation setup portion for presetting a quantity of paint replenishment to the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge, and a sensor adapted to output a detection signal as soon as the movable partition wall is displaced to a predetermined position preset by the quantitation setup portion.
<br/>
Thus, through the quantitation setup portion of the quantitation setup means, the position of the sensor is adjusted in such a way that it can detect the movable partition wall when the latter is displaced to a preset quantitation position. Further, the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge is connected to the quantitation tank by way of the extruding liquid passage change-over valve of the quantitation setup means. As a consequence, an extruding liquid, which is displaced and discharged from the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge, is introduced into the metering chamber of the quantitation tank by way of the extruding liquid passage change-over valve. The sensor outputs a detection signal as soon as the movable partition wall is displaced to a preset quantitation position. Thus, the quantitation setup<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> means is arranged to correctly quantitate a paint replenishment to a paint chamber of a cartridge by metering the amount of extruding liquid which is stable in nature.
</li><li>(3) In the case of the paint replenishing system for a cartridge in (2) above, wherein the paint feed means is adapted to stop a quantitative paint replenishment in response to a signal output by the sensor.
<br/>
The paint replenishment by the paint feed means is stopped as soon as a detection signal is output by the sensor upon detection of a displacement of the movable partition wall to a preset quantitation position. Thus, exactly a predetermined amount of paint can be replenished into the paint chamber of the cartridge.
</li><li>(4) Further, in the case of the paint replenishing system for a cartridge in (2) above, wherein the quantitation setup portion is adapted to squeeze residues of the extruding liquid out of the metering chamber by pushing the movable partition wall as far as an initial position, reducing inner space of the metering chamber to a minimum volume.
<br/>
Thus, upon completing a measurement of paint replenishment to the cartridge by way of introducing the extruding liquid into the metering chamber and a displacement of the movable partition wall, the quantitation setup portion can push back the movable partition wall. At this time, residues of the extruding liquid can<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> be squeezed out of the metering chamber since the inner space of the metering chamber is reduced to a minimum volume as the movable partition wall is pushed toward an initial position by the quantitation setup portion. It follows that there is no necessity for providing a mechanism exclusively for resetting the movable partition wall. Namely, the quantitation setup portion which is provided for shifting a sensor position is utilized for resetting the movable partition wall, to simplify the construction.
</li><li>(5) Further, in the case of the paint replenishing system for a cartridge in (2) above, wherein a metering chamber and an air chamber are defined in the quantitation tank by the movable partition wall, the air chamber of the quantitation tank being connected to an air valve thereby to push the partition wall as far as an initial position, reducing inner space of the metering chamber to a minimum volume.
<br/>
In this case, after measurement of the displaced extruding liquid, the air valve is opened to introduce compressed air into the air chamber of the quantitation tank, thereby pushing the movable partition wall toward and as far as an initial position. Thus, the extruding liquid can be discharged from the metering chamber without moving the quantitation setup portion.
</li><li>(6) Further, in the case of the paint replenishing system for a cartridge in (2) above, wherein an initial position sensor<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> is provided in the quantitation tank to detect location of said movable partition wall at an initial position after pushing inner space of the metering chamber to a minimum volume.
<br/>
In this case, whether or not the movable partition wall is reset in an initial position can be checked by the initial position sensor, to guarantee a correct measurement of the extruding liquid.
</li><li>(7) On the other hand, a paint replenishing system for a cartridge according to the present invention, wherein the paint feed means is comprised of a replenishing stool for mounting a cartridge, a color change valve device connected to the replenishing stool to supply paint and wash fluids to the cartridge, and a paint feed valve connected between the replenishing stool and the color change valve device to turn on and off a paint supply from the color change valve device; the quantitation setup means being adapted to output a replenishment stop signal as soon as discharges of an extruding liquid from the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge reach a preset quantitation value; and the paint feed means being adapted to end a quantitative paint replenishment by stopping a paint supply from the paint feed valve and/or the color change valve device to complete a quantitative replenishment as soon as a replenishment stop signal is output by the quantitation setup means.
<br/>
In this case, as soon as a cartridge is set on a replenishing<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> stool, the color change valve device is brought into a connected state for feeding paint to a paint chamber of the cartridge via the paint feed valve. At this time, an extruding liquid is displaced and discharged from the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge to the quantitation setup means. Thus, the quantitation setup means is adapted to quantitate paint replenishment by measuring a quantity of the displaced extruding liquid. The paint feed valve and/or the color change valve device is closed as soon as a replenishment stop signal is output by the quantitation setup means, exactly quantitating the paint replenishment to the paint chamber of the cartridge according to a preset quantitation value.
</li><li>(8) Further, a paint replenishing system for a cartridge according to the present invention, wherein the paint feed means is comprised of a replenishing stool for mounting the cartridge, a color change valve device connected to the replenishing stool to supply paint and wash fluids to the cartridge, and a paint feed valve connected between the replenishing stool and the color change valve device to turn on and off a paint supply from the color change valve device; the extruding liquid feed means being comprised of an extruding liquid source holding a stock of extruding liquid, an extruding liquid line connected between the extruding liquid source and the replenishing stool, and a pump provided in the extruding liquid line; the quantitation setup means being comprised<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> of an extruding liquid line change-over valve provided in the extruding liquid line at a position between the replenishing stool and the pump, a quantitation tank connected to the extruding liquid line change-over valve, a movable partition wall incorporated into the quantitation tank to define therein a metering chamber having an inner volume varying in proportion to a quantity of an extruding liquid introduced into the metering chamber from the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge, a quantitation setup portion for presetting a quantity of paint replenishment to the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge, and a sensor adapted to output a replenishment stop signal as soon as the movable partition wall is displaced to a predetermined position preset by the quantitation setup portion; and the extruding liquid line change-over valve being comprised of a feed valve for establishing and blocking communication between the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge and the pump, and a return valve for establishing and blocking communication between the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge and the metering chamber of the quantitation tank.
<br/>
In this case, prior to a quantitation, the feed valve of the extruding liquid passage change-over valve is opened to communicate the extruding liquid chamber of a cartridge with the pump, while the return valve is closed to block communication between the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge and the metering chamber<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> of the quantitation tank. In this state, an extruding liquid is supplied to the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge from the extruding liquid source by the pump.
<br/>
On the other hand, at the time of a quantitation, the feed valve of the extruding liquid passage change-over valve is closed to block communication between the extruding liquid chamber of a cartridge and pump, while the return valve is opened to communicate the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge with the metering chamber of the quantitation tank, feeding the metering chamber of the quantitation tank with an extruding liquid which is displaced and discharged from the extruding liquid chamber of the cartridge.
<br/>
At this time, a replenishment stop signal is output by the sensor of the quantitation setup means upon detection of a displacement of the movable partition wall to a position of a specific quantitation value by the quantitation setup portion. Thus, the quantitation setup means can accurately quantitate the paint replenishment to a paint chamber of a cartridge.
</li><li>(9) Further, in the case of the paint replenishing system in (8) above, wherein the paint feed means is adapted to end a quantitative paint replenishment by stopping a paint supply from the paint feed valve and/or the color change valve device in response to a replenishment stop signal output by the sensor of the quantitation setup means.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> -->
<br/>
In this case, a paint supply from the paint feed valve is stopped as soon as a replenishment stop signal is output from the sensor of the quantitation setup means, to replenish the cartridge with a specified amount of paint.
</li><li>(10) Further, in the case of the paint replenishing system for a cartridge in (8) above, wherein the quantitation setup means further comprises a drain valve which being closed when an extruding liquid is introduced into the metering chamber of the quantitation tank and opened when draining the extruding liquid from the metering chamber.
<br/>
In this case, the drain valve is kept in a closed state when an extruding liquid is introduced into the metering chamber of the quantitation tank by the quantitation setup means. The extruding liquid is drained from the metering chamber upon opening the drain valve.

At this time, the wash fluid feed valve 44 of the paint/wash fluid change-over valve 42 is opened, and the wash air valve 53Ar and wash liquid valve 53Lq of the wash fluid selector valve 53 are opened alternately to let the wash air and wash liquid flow through the wash fluid selector valve 53, wash fluid feed valve 44, outlet passage 40, paint passage change-over valve 39, waste liquid passage 41 and connector member 36, discharging spent wash fluids to the waste liquid tank 38 through the waste liquid line 37.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111">Now, paint residues of color A in the paint line 46 are washed away in the manner as follows. Namely, for this purpose, the waste liquid valve 45 is opened, and the wash liquid valve 49Lq and wash air valve 49Ar of the color change valve device 49 are opened alternately, directly feeding wash fluids from the color change valve device 49 to the paint line 46 to wash away residues of color A and discharging same to the waste liquid tank 38.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">In this instance, the wash fluids in circulation through the<!-- EPO <DP n="51"> --> waste liquid passage 41 as mentioned above can be directed toward a fore end portion of the feed tube 21 from the radial port 36A of the connector member 36 to efficiently wash off scattered paint deposits on the fore end portion of the feed tube 21.</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">On the other hand, in the post-replenishment stage, the return valve 60B of the extruding liquid line change-over valve 60 of the quantitation setup mechanism 58 is closed while the drain valve 68 is opened. In this state, the servo motor 65A of the quantitation setup portion 65 is put in rotation to move the support arm 64 in the direction of arrow A to push the piston 62 with the support arm 64 in the direction of arrow A. As a result, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 12</figref>, the extruding liquid in the metering chamber 63 can be returned to the extruding liquid source 57 through the drain line 59B.</p><p id="p0114" num="0114">Further, as the piston 62 is pushed in the direction of arrow A as far as the initial position <u>a</u> in the proximity of or in abutting engagement with the front lid portion 61A of the quantitation tank 61, the front face 62A of the piston 62 is detected by the initial position sensor 67, and an initial position detection signal is output to the control unit of the paint replenishing device 31 to permit a next paint replenishing operation.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">In the foregoing description, the cartridge 16 is replenished with paint of a different color. Now, described below with reference to <figref idrefs="f0014">Fig. 14</figref> are procedures for replenishing a cartridge<!-- EPO <DP n="52"> --> 16 repeatedly with paint of the same color.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">In this case, there is no need to proceed the washing stage for a cartridge 16, even if a previous color remains in the cartridge 16. Therefore, as soon as a cartridge 16 is set on a replenishing stool 33 for paint replenishment as shown in <figref idrefs="f0014">Fig. 14</figref>, a replenishing operation can be started immediately to refill the cartridge with paint of the same color in a preset quantity.</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">Thus, according to the present embodiment, the quantity of paint to be replenished into a paint chamber 19 of a cartridge 16 is set up in advance by way of the quantitation setup mechanism 58, which is arranged to meter an amount of an extruding liquid which is displaced and discharged out of the extruding liquid chamber 20 as a result of a paint replenishment into the paint chamber 19 and to stop the paint replenishment by the paint feed mechanism 32 as soon as the amount of the displaced extruding liquid reaches a preset quantitation value.</p><p id="p0118" num="0118">At the time of a paint replenishment, a cartridge 16 is set on a replenishing stool 33 of the paint feed mechanism 32, whereupon a paint chamber 19 is connected to the respective paint sources 50A through 50N of the paint source unit 50 while an extruding liquid chamber 20 is connected to the quantitation setup mechanism 58. Now, the paint feed mechanism 32 can replenish the paint chamber 19 of the cartridge 16 with paint from a selected one of the paint<!-- EPO <DP n="53"> --> sources 50A to 50N. In step with a progress of paint replenishment into the paint chamber 19, an equivalent amount of an extruding liquid is displaced and discharged from the extruding liquid chamber 20 at the cartridge 16.</p><p id="p0119" num="0119">Accordingly, irrespective of paint properties (e.g., viscosity, specific gravity or existence of a metallic component), the quantitation setup mechanism 58 can correctly quantitate replenished paint which are replenished in the cartridge 16 by metering the amount of an extruding liquid which is discharged from the extruding liquid chamber 20 of the cartridge 16. As soon as the discharges of the extruding liquid reach a preset quantitation value, the quantitation setup mechanism 58 stop the paint replenishment by the paint feed mechanism 32. Thus, the cartridge 16 is correctly replenished with a preset amount of paint.</p><p id="p0120" num="0120">As a result, all paint, which will be used in coating operation can replenish in correct amount to the cartridge 16, irrespective of the nature of paint, it becomes possible to contribute to cut the paint consumption through reductions of wasteful paint rejections and to cut the cost of waste disposal as well. In addition, even in a case where a cartridge 16 is replenished exclusively with paint of a specific color repeatedly, it becomes possible to prevent old paint from accumulating in the cartridge 16 to improve the finish quality of paint coatings.<!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --></p><p id="p0121" num="0121">Further, the quantitation setup mechanism 58 is composed of the quantitation tank 61 which is connectible to an extruding liquid chamber 20 of a cartridge 16, a piston 62 defining the metering chamber 63 on one side thereof and being displaced in step with a progress of quantitation of the extruding liquid introduced into the metering chamber 63, the quantitation setup portion 65 for preset a specified amount of replenishment for the cartridge 16, and the sensor 66 which is adapted to output a replenishment stop signal as soon as the piston 62 is displaced as far as a preset position by the quantitation setup portion 65.</p><p id="p0122" num="0122">With the quantitation setup mechanism 58, an extruding liquid which is discharged from an extruding liquid chamber 20 of a cartridge 16 is introduced into the metering chamber 63. At this time, commensurate with the amount of the extruding liquid introduced into the metering chamber 63, the piston 62 is accurately put in a displacement. Therefore, the paint replenishment into a paint chamber 19 can be correctly quantitated by way of detecting a distance of displacement of the piston 62 by the sensor 66.</p><p id="p0123" num="0123">Upon detecting the piston 62 displaced a predetermined distance in the direction of arrow B, a replenishment stop signal is fed to the control unit of the paint replenishing device 31 from the quantitation setup mechanism 58 to stop the paint replenishment by the paint feed mechanism 32. Thus, a preset amount of paint,<!-- EPO <DP n="55"> --> necessary for a next paint coating operation, can be correctly quantitated by the metering chamber 63 and replenished into a paint chamber 19 of a cartridge 16.</p><p id="p0124" num="0124">Further, the quantitation setup portion 65, which is arranged to shift the position of the sensor 66 by means of the servo motor 65A, can adjust the position of the piston 62 correctly in a stepless fashion. That is to say, the amount of paint to be replenished into the paint chamber 19 of a cartridge 16 can be set up properly and correctly.</p><p id="p0125" num="0125">On the other hand, the quantitation setup portion 65 is arranged to push the piston 62 in the direction of arrow A as far as the initial position <u>a</u> (see <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10</figref>) where the inner space of the metering chamber 63 is squeezed to a minimum volume. Thus, by pushing back the piston 62 by the support arm 64 in a post-replenishment stage, an extruding liquid in the metering chamber 63 can be returned to the extruding liquid source 57. Since the piston 62 can be moved by the quantitation setup portion 65 for shifting the sensor 66 without resorting to an exclusive piston drive mechanism, the quantitation setup mechanism 58 can be provided in a simplified form in construction.</p><p id="p0126" num="0126">Further, the initial position sensor 67 is provided on the front lid portion 61B of the quantitation tank 61 to detect the piston 62 as soon as it is located in the initial position a after<!-- EPO <DP n="56"> --> pushing the inner space of the metering chamber 63 to a minimum volume. Thus, there is no possibility of replenishing a cartridge 16 with an incorrect amount of paint.</p><p id="p0127" num="0127">Furthermore, since the quantitation setup mechanism 58 is adapted to meter the amount of replenished paint in the paint chamber 19 on the basis of an amount of an extruding liquid which is displaced and discharged out of the extruding liquid chamber 20 of the cartridge 16 in step with a progress of paint replenishment. Therefore, even in the event of a change of a paint supply line, replenishing paint can be quantitated accurately without necessitating any adjustment.</p><p id="p0128" num="0128">Now, referring to <figref idrefs="f0015">Figs. 15</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0016">16</figref>, there is shown a second embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment has a feature in that the quantitation mechanism is adapted to move a piston to an initial position by the use of compressed air. In the following description of the second embodiment, those component parts which are equivalent with a counterpart in the foregoing first embodiment are simply designated by the same reference numeral or character to avoid repetitions of similar explanations.</p><p id="p0129" num="0129">In <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 15</figref>, indicated at 71 is a quantitation setup mechanism which is adopted as a quantitation setting means in the second embodiment, and at 72 a quantitation tank of the quantitation setup mechanism 71. Similarly to the quantitation tank 61 in the first<!-- EPO <DP n="57"> --> embodiment, the quantitation tank 72 is constituted of a tubular body 72A, a front lid portion 72B and a rear lid portion 72C. An arm passage hole 72D is formed in the rear lid portion 72C for insertion of a support arm 64. Similarly to the first embodiment, a piston 62 is fitted in the quantitation tank 72, defining a metering chamber 63 between the piston 62 and the front lid portion 72B.</p><p id="p0130" num="0130">However, the quantitation tank 72 of the second embodiment differs from the quantitation tank 61 in the first embodiment in that the arm passage hole 72D is fitted air-tight around the circumference of the support arm 64, and in that an air valve 74 is connected as described hereinafter. In the case of the second embodiment, an air chamber 73 is defined in the quantitation tank 72, on the rear face 62B of the piston 62.</p><p id="p0131" num="0131">Indicated at 74 is an air valve which is connected to the air chamber 73 of the quantitation tank 72 through an air line 75. This air valve 74 plays a role of selectively connecting the air chamber 73 with the atmosphere or an air source 76. Namely, the air valve 74 is adapted to normally communicate the air chamber 73 with the atmosphere to release compressed air, permitting the piston 62 to move in the direction of arrow B. On the other hand, when the air valve 74 is switched to connect the air line 75 with the air source 76, compressed air is fed, pushing the piston 62<!-- EPO <DP n="58"> --> in the direction of arrow A toward an initial position as indicated in a time chart of <figref idrefs="f0016">Fig. 16</figref>, irrespective of operations of a sensor 66 and support arm 64.</p><p id="p0132" num="0132">Being arranged in the manner as described above, the second embodiment can produce substantially the same operational effects as the foregoing first embodiment. Especially in the case of the second embodiment, the piston 62 is moved by means of the air valve 74 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0016">Fig. 16</figref>. Therefore, no matter in which position the support arm 64 is located, the piston 62 can be moved in the direction of arrow A toward the initial position <u>a</u> simply by introducing compressed air into the air chamber 73 by switching the air valve 74. Accordingly, in this case, there is no need for driving the support arm 64 at the time of returning the piston 62 to the initial position a, permitting to carry out replenishing process in a more efficient manner.</p><p id="p0133" num="0133">In the foregoing embodiments, the paint/wash fluid change-over valve 42 is provided on the replenishing stool 33 of the paint feed mechanism 32, providing two separate wash lines for the purpose of shortening the time period of a washing operation, i.e., a line for washing the outlet passage 40 and paint chamber 19 of a cartridge 16 and a line for washing from the color change valve device 49 to the paint line 46.</p><p id="p0134" num="0134">However, in this regard, it is to be understood that the<!-- EPO <DP n="59"> --> present invention is not limited to the particular example shown. For instance, as in a modification shown in <figref idrefs="f0017">Fig. 17</figref>, a paint feed valve 81 which is directly connected to a color change valve device 82 may be provided on a replenishing stool 33. In this case an outlet passage 40 and a paint chamber 19 of a cartridge 16 can be washed with wash liquid and wash air which are supplied from the color change valve device 82. That is to say, in this case, the wash fluid feed valve 44 and the waste liquid valve 45 of the paint/wash fluid change-over valve 42 as well as bypass lines 52Lq, 52Ar and a wash fluid selector valve 53 can be omitted.</p><p id="p0135" num="0135">Further, in the foregoing embodiments, by way of example arrangements are made such that the paint feed valve 43 of the paint/wash fluid change-over valve 42 is closed in response to a replenishment stop signal which is fed to a control unit (not shown) from the sensor 66 of the quantitation setup mechanism 58. However, in this regard, the present invention is not limited to the particular arrangements shown. For instance, the paint feed mechanism may be arranged in such a way as to stop a replenishing operation as soon as a replenishment stop signal is applied to a corresponding one of paint valves 49A through 49N of the color change valve device 49 from a control unit. Alternatively, a replenishing operation may be stopped by simultaneously closing both of the paint feed valve 43 and color A feed valve 49A by the replenishment stop<!-- EPO <DP n="60"> --> signal.</p><p id="p0136" num="0136">Further, in the foregoing embodiments, by way of example a piston 18 is provided in a tank 17 of a cartridge 16 as a movable partition wall to be put in a sliding displacement within the tank 17. However, the present invention is not limited to this particular example. For instance, a bellows structure or a flexible bag may be provided in a tank 17 of a cartridge 16 as a movable partition wall which is internally communicated with a feed tube.</p><p id="p0137" num="0137">On the other hand, in the foregoing embodiments, by way of example the support arm 64, quantitation setup portion 65 and sensor 66 are provided separately from the quantitation tank 61. However, in this regard, the present invention is not limited to the particular example shown. For instance, the support arm 64 may be formed integrally with the shift member 65C of the quantitation setup portion 65. Alternatively, the support arm, sensor and quantitation setup portion may be integrally incorporated into one quantitation tank assembly. Further, a bellows or a diaphragm may be employed as a movable partition wall in place of the piston 62 if desired.</p><p id="p0138" num="0138">Furthermore, in the foregoing embodiments, by way of example arrangements are made such that paint is replenished into a paint chamber 19 of a cartridge 16 through the quick joint 23 and paint<!-- EPO <DP n="61"> --> passage 22. However, the present invention is not limited to the particular arrangements shown. For instance, in a manner similar to Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2000176328A"><text>2000-176328</text></patcit>, a color change valve device and a replenishing valve may be provided at the position of a waste liquid line 37 which is connected to a replenishing stool 33 to replenish paint into a paint chamber 19 of a cartridge 16, for example, by way of a paint supply passage 21A of a feed tube 21 and a paint passage 17B of a tank 17. In this case, the paint passage 22 on the side of a cartridge, quick joint 23 and paint passage change-over valve 39 can be omitted.</p><p id="p0139" num="0139">Moreover, in the foregoing embodiments, by way of example an extruding liquid is fed toward a cartridge 16 from the extruding liquid source 57 by the use of the pump 56. However, the present invention is not limited to this particular example. In a case where an extruding liquid is fed under a high pressure like a circulation line in a plant, the pump 56 can also be omitted.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980376" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="66"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Farbwiederauffüllsystem für eine Kartusche, wobei das System aufweist:
