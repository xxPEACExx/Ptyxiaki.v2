together by means of detachable and refastenable fastener means. For example, Publication of <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1523968A1"><text>EP 1 523 968 A1</text></patcit> discloses fastener means used for such wearing article. According to the disclosure thereof, a sheet strip is folded in a Z-shape and an inverted Z-shape and a top section of Z-shape is permanently bonded to an inner surface of one of the front and rear waist regions and a loop element of a mechanical fastener is attached to a bottom section of Z-shape so that the loop element is engaged with a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> hook element attached to an inner surface of the other waist region. The top section and the bottom section are connected by an intermediate section. The top section and the intermediate section respectively have surfaces opposed to and permanently bonded to each other.</p><heading id="h0003">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0004">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">The fastener means used in the known wearing article as has been described above is attached to an inner surface of the wearing article and necessarily it is preferred to use a soft and comfortable material for the sheet strip. On the other hand, it is inevitable that a tension in a circumferential direction is exerted on the fastener means as the sheet strip folded in a Z-shape is unfolded so that the bottom section and the intermediate section are developed in a straight line when the wearing article is actually put on the wearer's body. Such tension is exerted primarily on a starting point of a bonding zone between the top section and the intermediate section. Thus a sufficiently high strength against such tension is required for the intermediate section. However, the inventors have found that it is not easy to obtain the sheet strip which provides for such high strength and simultaneously provides for a soft<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> and comfortable touch since sheet materials providing the soft and comfortable touch often has not a high strength.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In view of the problem as has been described above, it is an object of the present invention to improve the fastener means for the pants-type wearing article so that a soft and comfortable sheet material can be used for the faster means which would not be easily broken.</p><heading id="h0005">MEASURE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">According to the present invention, by an improvement in a pants-type wearing article comprising a first waist region corresponding to one of front and rear waist regions, a second waist region corresponding to the other of the front and rear waist regions wherein the second waist region has a same width with the first waist region in a circumferential direction and fastener means fastening the first and second waist regions together in a detachable and refastenable manner along transversely opposite side edges thereof so that, a pair of in a state of the first and second waist regions put flat together, a pair of the fastener means have, as viewed in the circumferential direction, a Z-shape cross-section and an inverted Z-shape cross-section being symmetrical to each other<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> about a center line bisecting the width in the circumferential direction of the first and second waist regions.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The improvement according to the present invention is characterized in that: the fastener means comprises a sheet-like supporting element folded in a Z-shape or an inverted Z-shape and a fastener element attached to the supporting element, the supporting element has a top section and a bottom section extending in parallel to the top section and an intermediate section being contiguous to the top section and to the bottom section, the top section having a top section's joint end being contiguous to one end of the intermediate section and a top section's openable end opposed to the joint end, the bottom section having a bottom section's joint end being contiguous to another end of the intermediate section and a bottom section's openable end opposed to the joint end, and the top section is permanently attached to an inner surface of an inner surface of the first waist region while the bottom section is attached to the second waist region by means of the fastener means in a detachable and refastenable manner.

The fastener means 14<sub>L</sub> comprises a sheet-like supporting element 20 and the hook element 21 attached to the supporting element 20 using bonding means 23 such as adhesives. The supporting means 20 has a first section 41 permanently bonded to the inner surface of the front waist region 6 by means of an adhesive layer 24, a second section 42 being contiguous to the first section 41 so as to extend from the front waist region 6 to the rear waist region 7 and provided with the hook element 21, and a third section 43 being contiguous to the second section 42 so as to extend from the rear waist region 7 to the front waist region 6. The first section 41 and the second section 42 are permanently bonded to each other in a second bonding zone 52 formed by appropriate adhesives or<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> sealing techniques while the second section 42 and the third section 43 are permanently bonded to each other in a first bonding zone 51 formed by appropriate adhesives or sealing techniques. The supporting element 20 of such arrangement is destined to face and come in contact with the wearer's skin and, in consideration of this, nonwoven fabrics or woven fabrics providing a soft and comfortable feeding to wear are used as stock materials for the supporting element 20. Preferred types of nonwoven fabric include a spun bond nonwoven fabric, an air-through nonwoven fabric and a melt bond nonwoven fabric made of thermoplastic synthetic fibers having fineness in a range of 1 to 5 dtex and a basis weight in a range of 10 to 70 g/m<sup>2</sup>. While it is not essential for such nonwoven fabrics to have a level of strength sufficient to function as sheet materials serving to connect the front and rear waist regions to each other, the respective sections 41, 42, 43 may be bonded one to another by means of the first bonding zone 51 and the second bonding zone 52 as shown to ensure the fastener means 14 to obtain a desired strength. For example, a stretching force in a circumferential direction P exerted on the supporting element 20 during use of the diaper 1 concentrate in a vicinity of an end 52a of the second bonding zone 52 encircled by an imaginary line A. However, in the vicinity of the end 52a, the second<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> section 42 and the third section 43 of the supporting element 20 are bonded together by means of the first bonding zone 51. Specifically two nonwoven fabric layers overlap here to enhance strength of the supporting element 20 and thereby to protect the supporting element 20 against being easily broken. In the vicinity of the end 52a, further more, the first section 41 of the supporting element 20 is bonded to the inner sheet 2 by means of an adhesive layer 24 and, in this section 41 also, the supporting element 20 is protected from being easily broken. The second section 42 of the supporting element 20 is bonded to the third section 43 by means of the first bonding zone 51 also in a vicinity of an end 21a of the hook element 21 encircled by an imaginary line B. Consequentially, it is unlikely that the supporting element 20 might be easily broken even when a stretching force in the circumferential direction P is exerted on a vicinity of the end 21a. The first and second bonding zones 51, 52 can be formed by locally sealing nonwoven fabrics made of thermoplastic synthetic fibers constituting the supporting element 20.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the fastener means 14<sub>L</sub> of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, along a fold zone 46 connecting the first section 41 to the second section 42 and a fold zone 47 connecting the second section 42 to the third<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> section 43 as well as in a gap zone 48 defined between an end 43a of the third section 43 and the second section 42, the respective sections of the supporting element 20 are not bonded one to another and separable one from another. In these zones 46, 47, 48, the nonwoven fabric layers placed one upon another and constituting the supporting element 20 are free to be independently and flexibly deformed. While the presence of the adhesive layer 24, the first bonding zone 51, the second bonding zone 52, the hook element 23 and vicinities thereof in the supporting element 20 tends to make the supporting element 20 stiff and to irritate the wearer's skin, the zones 46, 47, 48 function as cushioning zones to alleviate such undesirable irritation. In this way, the fastener means 14 attached to the inner side of the diaper 1 would not irritate the wearer's skin. When it is not required for these zones 46, 47, 48 to function as the cushioning zones in the diaper, the respective sections of the supporting element 20 may be bonded one to another.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating a part of a process for continuous production of the diaper 1 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, in which a direction from right to left is a machine direction MD.

It should be understood also that a dimension by which a bottom section 62 and an intermediate section 63 are spaced from each other is indicated in an exaggerated form. The composite fastener means 114 is symmetrically formed about the preset cutting line 192 and comprises a left half 114<sub>L</sub> and a right half 114<sub>R</sub> to be obtained after the composite fastener means 114 has been cut off along the preset cutting line 192.

The front and rear waist regions 6, 7 of the diaper 1 put flat together may be separated from each other in a vertical direction as viewed in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> to ensure that the top section 61 and the intermediate section 63 being integral with the top section 61 are unfolded and developed with respect to the bottom<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> section 62 so as to describe a gentle circular arc or a generally straight line. In this way, the diaper 1 gets into the state as seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>.

A dimension L in the circumferential direction P by which these upper bonding zone 152 and lower bonding zone 151 overlap each other is preferably at least 3 mm. In the preferred diaper 1, the portions of the waist-surrounding elastic elements 18a, 18b and the leg-surrounding elastic elements 19 extending on the fastener means 14 and the loop element 22 may be subjected to an appropriate treatment to prevent the fastener means 14 and the loop element 22 from being formed with gathers under contraction of these elastic elements 18a, 18b, 19.

It is possible to attach the composite fastener means 114 to the rear waist region 7 rather than to the front waist region 6. It is also possible to bring the loop element 122 in engagement with the hook element 121 of the composite fastener means 114 rather than attaching the loop element 122 to the second web 102 in the step (3) and to attach the loop element 122 to the second web 102 facing the loop element 122 after the first composite web 191 has been folded back in the step (6).</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> is a view similar to <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, showing an embodiment of the combined fastener means 114. In the composite fastener means 114 according to this embodiment, the liner section 143 is formed from a sheet material provided separately from a series of the top section 61, the intermediate section 63 and the bottom section 62. The liner section 143 extending from a vicinity of the bottom section's openable end 69 toward the top section's joint end 66 is not connected to the bottom section's openable end 69 but extends outward in a horizontal direction from the end zone 151b of the first bonding zone 151.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> The liner section 143 included in the fastener means 14<sub>L</sub> obtained from the right half 114<sub>R</sub> of this composite fastener means 114 functions in the similar manner as the second section 43 in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. Specifically, the liner section 143 improves a tensile strength of the fastener means 14<sub>L</sub> and simultaneously prevents the end zone 151b of the first bonding zone 151 corresponding to the upper bonding zone 51 as well as the end zone of the hook element 121 from coming in direct contact with the wearer's skin. In other words, the liner section 143 functions as a cushioning material adapted to alleviate an undesirable irritating effect to the wearer's skin. While particular types of the sheet material to be used for the liner section 143 is not specified, if nonwoven fabrics forming the composite supporting element 120 has a poor sweat-absorbency, the sheet material of high sweat-absorbency may be used for the liner section 143 to protect the wearer from getting heat rash even if the fastener means 14 comes in close contact with the wearer's skin during use of the diaper 1.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> also is a view similar to <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, showing another embodiment of composite fastener means 114.

The lapping section 243 is bonded to the top section 61 in the upper bonding zone 152 and bonded to the bottom section 62 as well as to the intermediate section 63 in the lower bonding zone 151. The lower bonding zone 151 and the upper bonding zone 152 overlap each other by a dimension L and this dimension L in the right half 114<sub>R</sub> is preferably at least 3 mm. The hook element 121 is attached to the lapping section 243 by means of the bonding means 123. The bottom section 62 and the intermediate section 63 are detachably bonded by means of temporary bonding means 72 such as a pressure-sensitive adhesive or temporary sealing. The temporary bonding means 72 is provided for the purpose of merely retaining the shape of the supporting element 120<sub>R</sub> folded in a Z-shape in the course of process for producing the diaper 1 and has a bonding strength at a degree such that the bottom section 62 and the intermediate section 63 may be easily separated when it is desired to put the diaper 1 on the wearer's body. The fastener means 14<sub>L</sub> obtained from the right half 114<sub>R</sub> of such arrangement provides a functional effect similar to that<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> provided by the fastener means 14<sub>L</sub> in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>. More specifically, the supporting element 120<sub>R</sub> is capable of functioning as the cushioning material in the fastener means 14<sub>L</sub> and the lapping section 243 provides a reinforcing effect for the bottom section 62 as well as for the intermediate section 63 just like the liner section 143 although the lapping section 243 is not only bonded to the bottom section 62 and the intermediate section 63 in a manner differing from the manner in which the liner section 143 of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is bonded to these sections but also bonded to the top section 61. While the hook element 121 is bonded to the lapping section 243, this lapping section 243 is integrated with the bottom section 62 by means of the lower bonding zone 151 and thus substantially bonded to the bottom section 62. While <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> shows the embodiment in which the top section 61 is bonded to the lapping section 243 by means of the upper bonding zone 152, such embodiment may be replaced by still another embodiment in which the top section 61 is bonded to the lapping section 243 and the intermediate section 63.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">To exploit the present invention, the hook element 21 employed in the illustrated embodiment may be replaced by the loop element or pressure-sensitive adhesive.
