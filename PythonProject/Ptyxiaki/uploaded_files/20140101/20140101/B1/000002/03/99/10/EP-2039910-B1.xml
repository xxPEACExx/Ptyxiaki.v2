In this embodiment, directions of front, rear, left, right, up, and down are directions of front, rear, left, right, up, and down seen from a rider operating the motorcycle. A right-and-left direction may also be referred to as a vehicle width direction.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The motorcycle will be described first. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a left side view of a motorcycle 1. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the motorcycle 1 includes a front wheel 3 and a rear wheel 4 rotatably supported by<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> a body thereof, a seat 5 which a driver sits on, handlebars 6 for steering the front wheel 3, and an engine 2 for producing power to drive the rear wheel 4.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The seat 5 behind the handlebars 6 extends from an intermediate position between the front wheel 3 and the rear wheel 4 to a position above the rear wheel 4. This seat 5 is a tandem seat having a front seating section 5a on which the driver sits in front and a rear seating section 5b on which a passenger sits above the rear wheel. The driver seated on the seat 5 manipulates the handlebars 6 to turn the front wheel 3 from side to side, which is rotatably supported at lower ends of a pair of a right and a left front forks 7.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The engine 2 is fixed to a body frame (not shown) constituting a body framework of the motorcycle 1. The engine 2 has a cylinder section 2b for accommodating pistons (not shown). The cylinder section 2b extends upward while inclining forward from a position below the front seating section 5a of the seat 5. The engine 2 will be described in detail later.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The motorcycle 1 is also equipped with a shaft-driven driveline 8 for transmitting driving force of the engine 2 to the rear wheel 4. More specifically, the motorcycle 1 has a drive shaft 9 extending from the engine 2 to the rear wheel 4 in the left side of the body.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The drive shaft 9 is supported to be vertically swingable about a pivot shaft 11 extended in the vehicle width direction. A bevel gear formed on a rear end of the drive shaft 9 meshes with a bevel gear formed on a left end of a rear wheel rotating shaft 4a, which supports the rear wheel 4 for rotation. Thus, the rear wheel 4 is supported to be vertically swingable about the pivot shaft 11.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The motorcycle 1 also includes a body cover 12 for covering the body thereof. The body cover 12 includes: a front cowling 12a formed above the front wheel 3 to cover a front section of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> body; leg shields 12b formed to cover the front of the legs of the driver seated on the front seating section 5a of the seat 5; a center cover 12c formed to cover an upper section of the body in a position between the handlebars 6 and the seat 5; a side cover 12d formed to cover the right side and the left side of the body (that is, lateral sides in the vehicle width direction) below the center cover 12c; and a pair of a right and a left footboards 12e formed below the side cover 12d with a pair of a right and a left flat surfaces 12f which the driver seated on the front seating section 5a of the seat 5 puts his/her right and left feet on.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The center cover 12c extends forward while inclining upward from a position below a front end of the seat 5. The inclination of the center cover 12c generally corresponds with that of the cylinder section 2b of the engine 2 disposed below the center cover 12c.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The engine 2 can be started by a starter motor 2c to start driving of the motorcycle 1. Air and a fuel are supplied from an intake port (not shown) to the cylinder section 2b of the started engine 2 by a fuel injection method. The engine 2 produces power by combusting the fuel in the cylinder section 2b. This power is transmitted to the rear wheel 4 via the drive shaft 9. Consequently, the rear wheel 4 rotates, and the motorcycle 1 travels forward. Exhaust gases of the engine 2 discharged from an exhaust port (not shown) in the cylinder section 2b are released into the atmosphere through a silencer (muffler) 10.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Next, the engine 2 will be described in detail. <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a left side view of an engine case 2a constituting a framework of the engine 2. <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGs. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref> are right side views of the engine case 2a. <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref> show the engine case 2a in a state where a cover section for partially covering a lateral side in the vehicle width direction is removed. <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a sectional view of the engine 2 taken along the line V-V of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a sectional view of the engine 2 taken along the line VI-VI of <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004">FIGs.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> 2 to 4</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> is a sectional view of the engine 2 taken along the line VII-VII of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The engine case 2a has a crankcase 20 for accommodating a crankshaft 40 and a transmission case 30 for accommodating a transmission 60.

In other words, as two case sections that are formed individually and dividable into the upper and the lower sections, the crankcase 20 has an upper case section 20a constituting a section above the dividing surface S1 (that is, in the cylinder section 2b side) and a lower case section 20b constituting a section below the dividing surface S1. The crankcase 20 is constructed by joining a mating surface at a bottom of the upper case section 20a with a mating surface on top of the lower case section 20b on the dividing surface S1.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006 f0007">FIGs. 5 to 7</figref>, the transmission case 30 is configured to be dividable into a right and a left sections on a dividing surface S2 and a dividing surface S3, both of which are perpendicular to the axial center P1 of the crankshaft 40. In other words, the transmission case 30 has a right case section 30a, a left case section 30b, and a left end case section 30c as three case sections that are formed individually and separable from each other into the right and the left sections. The right case section 30a constitutes a section further on the right of the right dividing surface S2 and covers the right side of the transmission 60 (outside in the vehicle width direction). The left case section 30b constitutes a section between the dividing<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> surface S2 and the left dividing surface S3 and covers the left side of the transmission 60 (inside in the vehicle width direction). The left end case section 30c constitutes a section further on the left of the dividing surface S3 and partially covers the left side of the left case section 30b.

This further facilitates the arrangement of the oil flow passages from the transmission-side oil pan 80 into the transmission 30.<!-- EPO <DP n="57"> --></p><heading id="h0006">Description of Reference Numerals and Symbol</heading><p id="p0188" num="0188"><ul><li>1: motorcycle</li><li>2: engine</li><li>2a: engine case</li><li>2b: cylinder section</li><li>3: front wheel</li><li>4: rear wheel</li><li>5: seat</li><li>6: handlebar</li><li>7: front fork</li><li>8: driveline</li><li>9: drive shaft</li><li>10: silencer</li><li>11: pivot shaft</li><li>12: body cover</li><li>13: cylinder block</li><li>14: cylinder head</li><li>15: cover</li><li>20: crankcase</li><li>20a: upper case section</li><li>20b: lower case section</li><li>21: crank chamber</li><li>22: clutch chamber</li><li>22a: left clutch shaft bearing</li><li>22b: middle clutch shaft bearing</li><li>22c: right clutch shaft bearing</li><li>23: crankcase-side oil pan</li><li>24: oil tank</li><li>29a: right pump support section</li><li>29b: left pump support section</li><li>29c: left crankcase-side pump shaft bearing</li><li>29d: right crankcase-side pump insertion section</li><li>30: transmission case<!-- EPO <DP n="58"> --></li><li>30a: right case section</li><li>30b: left case section</li><li>30c: left end case section</li><li>30d: opening</li><li>31: transmission chamber</li><li>32: output chamber</li><li>33a: right drive-side pulley shaft bearing</li><li>33b: left drive-side pulley shaft bearing</li><li>34a: right driven-side pulley shaft bearing</li><li>34b: left driven-side pulley shaft bearing</li><li>37: transmission-side pump support section</li><li>37c: transmission-side pump insertion section</li><li>38: transmission-side oil pan</li><li>40: crankshaft</li><li>50: clutch</li><li>53: clutch shaft</li><li>60: transmission</li><li>61: drive pulley</li><li>62: drive pulley shaft</li><li>63: driven pulley</li><li>64: driven pulley shaft</li><li>70: output shaft</li><li>71: coupling shaft</li><li>80: transmission-side oil pump</li><li>81: transmission-side pump shaft</li><li>82: crankcase-side oil pump</li><li>85: crankcase-side pump shaft</li><li>85a: crankcase-side oil pump shaft</li><li>85b: cooling water pump shaft</li><li>86: intermediate gear</li><li>88: engaging member</li><li>90: fastening hole</li><li>91: bolt member<!-- EPO <DP n="59"> --></li><li>100: complex main shaft</li><li>101: complex pump shaft</li><li>110: crankcase oil pan</li><li>120: crankcase-side oil pan</li><li>130: oil tank</li><li>140: transmission oil pan</li><li>141: bottom surface</li><li>200: control unit</li></ul></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980535" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="62"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Motor (2), umfassend:
