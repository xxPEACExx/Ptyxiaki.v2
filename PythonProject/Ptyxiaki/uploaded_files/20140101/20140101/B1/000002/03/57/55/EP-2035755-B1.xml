Such solar collectors are for instance placed on roofs of houses in order to thus directly or indirectly heat water of a central heating system, tap water and the like. The solar collector herein usually forms part of an optionally closed circulation system which also incorporates the liquid container. The liquid container then functions as storage medium for the process liquid heated by the solar collector. A heat exchanger accommodated in the liquid container provides for heat transfer from the heated process liquid to the tap water for heating, which is carried through the conduits of the heat exchanger. The use of the thermal solar collectors as described is relatively simple, while a considerable efficiency can nevertheless be achieved. It hereby also becomes economically advantageous to use thermal solar collectors of the described type.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The prior art solar energy systems provided with the known liquid container do however have the drawback that they are relatively expensive for the average consumer, both to purchase and to use. Fitting of the known solar collectors and liquid containers is moreover relatively time-consuming. The known liquid container generally comprises for instance a metal container body provided with heat transfer means, for instance a heat exchanger and throughfeed channels for connecting to the external conduits. The heat transfer means provide for heat transfer from the process liquid to the tap water for heating. In order to maintain the temperature of the process liquid stored in the liquid container as long as possible, the liquid container is wrapped with thermal insulating material. The known liquid container is however difficult to handle due to its weight. Although a plastic liquid container would be lighter, plastic is generally not sufficiently rigid to be able to properly withstand the forces exerted by the water pressure on the walls of the container. This is certainly the case in the longer term because plastic deforms (creeps) over time when under load. This has the consequence that solar energy<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> systems have still not been able to fulfil their true potential, particularly not in the consumer market.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5555997A"><text>US 5,555,997</text></patcit> describes a storage tank for water.

A number of foam plates are bend around the (cylindrical) container body. The foam plates are provided with grooves to be able to easily bend them. The liquid container is provided with spacers to keep a space clear between the first container body and the faom plates at all times.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention has for its purpose to provide a liquid container and device of the type stated in the preamble, with which the stated drawbacks can be obviated in simple manner while maintaining the advantages of the prior art. The invention provides for this purpose a liquid container which comprises at least a first container body for containing a liquid and further comprises connecting means for external conduits in which the liquid can be circulated, as well as heat transfer means for exchanging heat with the liquid present in the liquid container, wherein the liquid container comprises at least a second container body which is manufactured from a thermally insulating foam material and which encloses the first container body while leaving an intermediate space clear between the first and second container bodies, wherein the first container body can be deformed during use such that at least a part of the first container body comes to lie against the second container body. In the liquid container according to the invention the heated liquid only comes into contact with the first container body. The liquid present in the first container body exerts a pressure on the walls thereof during use. The first container body will hereby deform, wherein the higher the temperature of the liquid, the greater the deformation. This deformation is taken up according to the invention by providing a second container body which encloses the first container body. The first and second container bodies co-act structurally such that the usual loads can be readily absorbed. If desired, the container bodies can be at least locally reinforced. Reinforcement of a container body can for instance take place by arranging a steel band and/or tube round the relevant container body. It is also possible to incorporate rigid plates and/or strips in the foam material, particularly for reinforcing the second container body.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is characteristic of the inventive liquid container that, in the unfilled state of the first container body, it has at all times an open intermediate space between first and second container bodies. The space between the first and the second container bodies (the "cavity") is chosen to have a width such that during operation at least a part of the first container body comes to lie against at least a part of the second container body. Although not limited hereto, typical cavity widths (with unfilled first container body and at room temperature) are generally chosen between 0.1 mm and 100 mm, more preferably between 0.5 and 30 mm, and most preferably between 1 and 15 mm, wherein the cavity width can, if desired, vary over the surface of the container bodies. For container bodies with cylindrical peripheral surface it is thus possible for instance to<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> choose a first cavity width for the intermediate space between the two peripheral surfaces and a second cavity width for the intermediate space between the two upper sides of the containers.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Because the second container body is manufactured according to the invention from a thermally insulating foam material, the liquid container according to the invention is automatically thermally insulated. It is therefore no longer necessary to arrange additional insulating material, which considerably shortens the fitting time. The cavity between first and second container bodies further enhances this insulation. A further advantage of the liquid container according to the invention is that it can be used at a higher application temperature than is generally the case with plastic containers. This is because the thermally insulating second container body will have a lower average temperature than the first container body, which is in direct contact with the heated liquid, whereby this second container body can absorb more load Because the liquid container can be used at higher temperatures, it has a higher energy storage density, defined as the amount of energy stored per m<sup>3</sup>. A unique property of the liquid container is that it is self-regulating. As the temperature of the heated liquid increases, the deformation of the first container body will become greater, whereby more load is transferred to the second container body, which has a lower average temperature due to the presence of the intermediate space between the two containers and the thermal insulation, and can therefore better absorb the load. When placed in the outside environment it is also possible that the temperature of the second container body becomes very high on hot days, and possibly even higher than the temperature of the first container body. In that case a part of the load will however shift to the first container body, whereby the liquid container in its entirety is better able to absorb the loads.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In a further preferred embodiment of the liquid container the second container body is manufactured from an expanded polyolefin, and more preferably an expanded polypropylene. Such materials are per se known, although not in this application, and combine a good thermal insulation with a good mechanical loadability. Although the foam material can be chosen within wide limits, it is advantageous if the foam material has a density - in unloaded state - of at least 20 g/dm<sup>3</sup>, more preferably at least 35 g/dm<sup>3</sup>, and most preferably at least 50 g/dm<sup>3</sup>. By increasing the density the second<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> container body not only acts as an excellent thermal insulation for the liquid stored in the first container body, but a substantial part of the load can also be absorbed during use. According to the invention the first container body (or a previous container body) deforms during use such that a substantial part of the load is transmitted to the second (or further) container body. Within the scope of the present application, a substantial part of the load is understood to mean that at least 20% of the load is preferably transmitted from a previous container body to a subsequent container body. In a particular preferred embodiment of the liquid container the properties of the first container body are chosen such that at least 50% of the load is transmitted to the second container body during use. This is even more preferably at least 75% of the load. The distribution of the load over the first and second container bodies can be adjusted in simple manner by the skilled person - in otherwise known manner - by making a suitable choice of the mechanical properties of the container body material, such as for instance the elasticity modulus, and of design parameters, such as for instance the wall thickness of the container bodies.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In a further preferred variant the liquid container according to the invention is characterized in that the creep load as according to ISO 7850 of the foam material from which at least the second container body is manufactured amounts to at least 20 kPa for 5% deformation during 100 days. This is more preferably at least 50 kPa, most preferably at least 80 kPa for 5% deformation during 100 days.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is in principle sufficient for good operation if the liquid container comprises a first and a second container body. By providing a plurality of nested container bodies a better load distribution and thermal insulation is achieved without this having to adversely affect the weight of the liquid container.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the invention the liquid container comprises at least a first container which is enclosed by a second container body from a thermally insulating material which also provides structural support. A structurally simple liquid container has for this purpose a practically closed first container body and a second container body in the form of two mutually pivoting shell elements. The liquid container according to the invention is obtained by closing the two shell elements. It will be apparent that there are other possibilities for manufacturing the second container body.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">A further advantage of the liquid container according to the invention is that both the first and the second container body can function as mounting facility for components which can be incorporated in the liquid container, such as for instance a circulation pump, a heat exchanger, controls and sensors for the temperature and pump, conduits and the like. A preferred embodiment of the liquid container therefore has the feature that the first container body comprises fixing, means on the liquid side thereof for arranging components in the liquid container, if desired between opposite wall parts, wherein the first container body can be deformed such that the components can be fixed by at least temporarily deforming the first container body. Because the first container<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> body can be deformed relatively easily according to the invention, at least some of the components, and in particular the heat exchanger, can be suspended without making openings in the first container body. In the context of this application, without making openings is understood to mean that no openings have to be made in the wall of the container body for the purpose of mounting the components. Possible leakage of the liquid container is hereby avoided and a structurally stronger container is obtained. The extra support required after the suspension of the components without making openings is provided by the thermal insulating layer in combination with the second container body.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The liquid container is in principle suitable for any volume. In a typical and also particularly suitable application the liquid container has a volume of a maximum of 160 litres, and in particular a maximum of 110 litres. Such a volume is adapted to domestic use and facilitates placing of the liquid container as component of a device for heating tap water, which for instance also comprises a thermal solar collector as energy source. In such a device the liquid container is preferably positioned not too far from the solar collector. The liquid container according to the invention has the additional advantage that it is relatively compact and that the shape thereof can easily be modified to the circumstances. The shape of the second container body can however be freely chosen. A particularly suitable liquid container has the feature that at least a part of the container bodies is not rotation-symmetrical. By providing for instance the second container body with a flat wall part, the liquid container can be placed with this part on a surface. Owing to the compact dimensions of the liquid container it can for instance be placed behind the knee wall of a roof via a hatch of standard dimensions. The liquid container is also easy to place in relatively small spaces, such as for instance in a kitchen cabinet. The liquid container can herein be placed with the flat wall part on a flat surface and connected and filled in simple manner without disassembly being necessary. In order to further increase the convenience of use the liquid container can, if desired, be provided with reading meters for the water level and the water temperature, wherein the reading meters are preferably incorporated in a wall part.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Although it is not necessary for the invention, it is highly advantageous if at least a part of the container bodies is manufactured from a plastic, preferably by means of rotation moulding. A particularly suitable plastic comprises a polyolefinic plastic, such as for<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> instance polypropylene, because it can be readily rotation moulded and has the desired properties. In the per se known rotation moulding, plastic grains are arranged in a rotating and, if desired, heated mould and then flung in melted state against the wall of the mould, where they solidify and thus form a solid wall. It has been found that the liquid container which comprises at least one rotation-moulded first container body further accentuates the advantages of the inventive container.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The invention also relates to a device for heating tap water, which comprises at least one thermal solar collector and at least one liquid container according to the invention, and which further comprises a supply conduit placed between the liquid container and the thermal solar collector, a discharge conduit placed between the thermal solar collector and the liquid container and a pump for causing forced circulation of the liquid in the device, and wherein the pump is switched off and on to respectively stop the liquid supply and activate the liquid supply. The liquid supply can thus be regulated by operating the pump. The pump can be controlled manually, but in practice the pump will be automatically controlled. Use can for instance be made here of sensors which record temperature values at one or more locations in the solar energy system, on the basis of which the automatic operation of the pump is controlled. It is thus possible for instance to have the pump start when the sun begins to shine, whereby the temperature increases at the position of the solar collector. When solar heat decreases, this temperature will fall and the pump is switched off again. A preferred embodiment of the liquid container according to the invention is provided with a pump for causing forced circulation of the liquid in the heat transfer means. The container according to the invention can advantageously be provided with (connections for) flexible plastic conduits for the process liquid.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A further preferred variant of the liquid container comprises a pump with a maximum flow rate of 30 litres per hour. Such a pump is used in circulation systems of the so-called "low-flow" type, wherein only a low flow rate, in the order of magnitude of 20 litres per hour per m<sup>2</sup> of collector, is carried through the solar collector. It will be apparent that the liquid container according to the invention is particularly suitable for such low-flow systems.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">It is possible in principle to use any suitable energy source in the device according to the invention. It is thus for instance possible to apply the inventive liquid container as an electric boiler, wherein it is thus connected to the mains electricity. A solar collector is however preferably used as energy source. Such collectors are per se known, for instance from the Netherlands patent <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="NL1021229"><text>NL1021229</text></patcit>. A particularly suitable energy source comprises an assembly of at least two solar collector modules, each of which comprise a vacuum-formed rear tray manufactured from a suitable plastic, and which are also provided with insulation, with an absorbing unit and a cover plate for the channel plates which is manufactured from transparent plastic.
