mxw-id="PDES63957685" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><u>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to compositions for use in a method to treat and prevent complement-mediated tissue damage, and to in vitro methods of regulating complement cascade.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Astroviruses are small, non-enveloped icosahedral viruses with a single-stranded, messenger-sense RNA genome and are known to infect both mammals and birds. They are estimated to cause 2-17% of children's diarrheal illness worldwide. Astroviral infection can be especially devastating for children with malnutrition, intestinal parasites, or both. Even in developed western countries human astrovirus (HAstV) causes a significant economic loss due to parents taking time off from work to care for sick children. This trend of economic loss is likely to worsen as increasing numbers of mothers enter the workforce. Prevention or treatment of astrovirus infection in children would have a significant economic impact on physician and emergency department visits and lost workdays. In poultry farming, turkey astrovirus has a major economic impact on the turkey farming industry. In particular, turkey astrovimses cause a rapidly fatal viremic sepsis in young turkeys suggestive of overwhelming immunologic cascade that likely involves, and may be driven by, the complement system. Veterinary therapeutics<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> designed to prevent or mitigate the damage of turkey astrovirus would be a significant development for this industry.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">There is a great need for complement inhibitors. Currently, no anti-complement therapies are approved for use in humans, despite the known morbidity and mortality associated with complement disregulation in many disease processes, including such autoimmune diseases as systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, and multiple sclerosis. The impact of complement-mediated tissue injury in such a diverse array of diseases has driven the development of many complement inhibitors with an estimated market of between $2-4 billion annually. For a review on complement therapeutics as of 2003, please see the review article by <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>B.P. Morgan and C.L. Harris entitled, "Complement therapeutics; history and current progress" (B.P Morgan and C.L. Harris, 2003. Molec. Immunol. 40, 159-170</text></nplcit>). The astrovirus coat protein appears to have extremely strong effects on the complement system, suggesting that the 'active' portion of the protein may have clinical utility in decreasing tissue damage from complement-mediated diseases. There are currently no commercially available anti-complement specific immunomodulators. There is some evidence that IVIg (intravenous immuneglobulin) in high doses has anti-complement effects that may explain its utility in some autoimmune diseases. IVIg is extremely expensive and has safety concerns because it is derived from the blood of hundreds of donors.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Current candidate compounds for anti-complement therapeutics have the significant disadvantage of acting too broadly, or in some cases are not viable due to toxicity. For example, the most powerful anti-complement substance known to date, cobra venom factor (CVF), is capable of virtually depleting all C3 in the plasma by acting as a stable C3 convertase (C3bBb). However, CVF is essentially untenable as a therapy due to the uncontrolled complement activation that results in a prolonged period of decomplementation and vulnerability to overwhelming infection in some experimental models (<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Younger, J.G. et al., 2001. J. Appl. Physiol. 90, 2289-2295</text></nplcit>). Antibody response to the CVF would likely also make the therapeutic benefit of this compound too short-lived to be ultimately useful in the treatment of chronic disease. The ideal anti-complement therapeutic method would be as effective in complement depletion as CVF but less toxic and less antigenic when administered to the host. Astrovirus coat proteins and derivatives thereof are capable of regulating complement cascade proteins to an<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> extent comparable with CVF, and thereby are useful for treatment or prevention of complement-mediated tissue damage and mitigation of complement related diseases.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In one aspect, the invention provides an <i>in vitro</i> method for regulating complement cascade proteins using Astroviridae family coat protein(s) and/or component(s) of the astrovirus coat protein, wherein said component is either purified from wild type virus or recombinantly produced; is a region or modification of the astrovirus coat protein, the region or modification of the astrovirus coat protein being an isolated coat subunit, or a truncation or deletion mutant, a chimeric protein, a fusion protein, or other protein containing elements of the astrovirus coat protein; and is capable of either (i) decreasing lysis of red blood cells in response to normal human serum or (ii) binding to complement factor Clq.<br/>
The coat protein and/or component may inhibit the classical complement pathway or the alternative complement pathway. The astrovirus coat protein or derivative may inhibit the lytic process of the classical complement pathway by regulating classical pathway proteins.<br/>
Alternatively, the coat protein or derivative may inhibit the lytic process triggered by the alternative complement pathway by regulating alternative complement pathway proteins. The coat protein and/or component may inhibit activation of the terminal pathway of the complement cascade, inhibit the formation of complement peptide iC3b, inhibit the formation of complement peptide complex C3 convertase, complement peptides C3b, C5a, C5b, or the complex of peptides known in the art as the Membrane Attack Complex, or MAC, inhibit the lysis of red blood cells in a standard RBC lysis assay using normal human serum or Factor B depleted serum or bind to complement C1.<br/>
A person of skill in the art will recognize that testing the inhibition of the complement pathway may be achieved through well-known standard assays. In one embodiment of the invention, the assay involves using normal human serum to test lysis of sensitized red blood cells. In another embodiment of the invention, the assay involves using Factor B depleted serum in order to confine the results of the assay to testing for inhibition of the classical pathway. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the astrovirus coat protein binds to a component of the complement peptide C1.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The coat protein and/or component may be displayed and a viral-like particle. A non-infectious virus-like particle (VLP) may regulate the activity of complement proteins. In one embodiment, multiple copies of the astrovirus coat protein and/or component are expressed on the outer surface of the particle, typically through recombinant expression of the viral coat protein in the absence of other non-structural viral genes. In another embodiment, the VLP is produced from another virus, for example Flock House virus, which displays the complement-regulating portion of the astrovirus coat protein on its surface. The method further discloses the use of peptides<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> derived from astrovirus coat proteins for the regulation of complement and treatment of complement-related disease.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The astrovirus coat protein and/or component may be purified from wildtype astrovirus virions or coat proteins thereof. Using standard viral purification techniques, wildtype astrovirus particles may be purified and used for further analysis and testing for complement regulating, inhibiting, or depleting ability.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Alternatively, the coat protein and/or complement may be produced by recombinant technology coat protein or derivatives. A person of ordinary skill will recognize that there are many options for the production of recombinant proteins, and these methods may be adapted without undue experimentation for the purpose of producing large quantities of viral coat proteins. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the recombinant astrovirus protein and/or component is produced in a baculovirus system. In another embodiment, the recombinant protein is produced in <i>E</i>. <i>coli.</i> In still further embodiments, the proteins are produced in yeast cells. In each of these cases, recombinant coat proteins thus produced are harvested from the producer cells and purified by standard protein techniques. A skilled artisan will appreciate that a wide range of eukaryofic expression systems, including mammalian cells, is available for recombinant production of proteins. A suggested reference for recombinant molecular techniques is <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="b"><text>Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (2001</text></nplcit>).<br/>
Similar references are well known to those in the art and readily available for explanations of routine recombinant molecular biology protocols.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The coat protein and/or component may be produced by recombinant technology and include regions of a second protein fused thereto. Such a fusion or chimeric protein may be used to regulate complement and decrease complement-related tissue damage at a specific target site In the recipient by linking the coat protein to an antibody or antibody fragment. The coat component may be a peptide.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In another aspect, the invention is directed to an astrovirus coat protein and/or component of the astrovirus coat protein for use in an <i>in vivo</i> method of inhibiting complement-mediated tissue damage, wherein said component is either purified from wild type virus or recombinantly produced; is a region or modification of the astrovirus coat protein, the region or modification of the astrovirus coat protein being an isolated coat subunit, or a truncation or deletion mutant, a chimeric protein, a fusion protein, or other protein containing elements of the astrovirus coat protein; and is capable of either (i) decreasing lysis of red blood cells in response to normal human serum or (ii) binding to complement factor Clq. Complement-mediated tissue damage is frequently associated with autoimmune and other diseases with inflammatory pathologies. Astrovirus coat protein or derivatives may be useful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, serum<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> sickness, Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome, ischemia-reperfusion injury (for example, stroke or myocardial infarction), allo- or xeno- transplantation (including hyperacute rejection and Graft Versus Host Disease), Alzheimer's Disease, burn injuries, hemodialysis damage, cardiopulmonary bypass damage, Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria, and other diseases associated with complement-mediated tissue damage. Further uses include veterinary application to treat animal diseases, such as turkey astrovirus infection.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In another aspect, the invention is directed to astrovirus particles, coat protein, and/or component of the astrovirus coat protein for use in a method of treating hereditary angioedema (HAE), wherein said component is either purified from wild type virus or recombinantly produced; is a region or modification of the astrovirus coat protein, the region or modification of the astrovirus coat protein being an isolated coat subunit, or a truncation or deletion mutant, a chimeric protein, a fusion protein, or other protein containing elements of the astrovirus coat protein; and is capable of either (i) decreasing lysis of red blood cells in response to normal human serum or (ii) binding to complement factor Clq.<br/>

This invention has multiple uses and advantages. Astrovirus coat proteins may be used to treat complement-mediated diseases or reduce complement-mediated tissue damage in a variety of pathologies in both humans and animals.</p><heading id="h0006"><i>The astrovirus coat protein</i></heading><p id="p0043" num="0043">For a review of the current knowledge concerning astrovirus capsid biology, please refer to the review entitled "<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>Identification of structural domains involved in astrovirus capsid biology" (Viral Immunology 18(1): 17-26, 2005</text></nplcit>). Briefly, the <i>Astroviridae</i> constitute a family of non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses with a single-stranded, messenger-sense RNA genome. These viruses infect mammals and birds and are a significant cause of gastroenteritis in young children as well as disease in other animals and avian species, including a fatal viremic sepsis in turkeys. Herein disclosed is a method for an <i>in vitro</i> assembly system in which large quantities of the coat protein (and coat protein deletion mutants) can be purified using a recombinant baculovirus expression system in insect cells. Other recombinant techniques are also contemplated for the production of coat protein or derivatives. Infectious astrovirus, such as HAstV-1 or other virions produced in mammalian tissue culture, may also be used.</p><heading id="h0007"><i>The complement system</i></heading><p id="p0044" num="0044">The complement system comprises a group of related plasma proteins that, when activated, generates an extremely destructive immunologic cascade. The complement system combats infection by a wide variety of methods including lysis of bacteria and infected cells by pore formation (i.e., formation of the Membrane Attack Complex or "MAC"), opsonization<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> (immune-tagging) leading to ingestion and destruction by white blood cells, activation of white blood cells, directing white blood cells to the site of infection, stimulating B-lymphocyte responses, and antibody generation. The complement system is activated by three known pathways: the classical pathway, the alternative pathway, and the mannan-binding lectin pathway (see <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 1</b></figref>). Each results in a cascade of protein-protein reactions amplifying in an exponential manner that culminate in an extremely robust immune response. While complement is a vital host defense against pathogenic organisms such as bacteria and some enveloped viruses, its unchecked activation can cause devastating host cell damage. Host tissue damage mediated by complement has been implicated in a wide variety of diseases including autoimmune pathologies such as: rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and serum sickness. It has also been identified as contributing to the pathogenesis of the following diseases: Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), stroke (ischemia-reperfusion injury), myocardial infarction (ischemia-reperfusion injury), allo- and xenotransplantation (hyperacute rejection &amp; graft versus host disease), Alzheimer's disease, bum injuries, hemodialysis damage, cardiopulmonary bypass damage, and Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Accordingly, the present invention relates to coat proteins and/or components thereof from the <i>Astroviridae</i> family of viruses for use in a method to mitigate the tissue damage associated with complement cascade proteins. Although not intending to be bound by any particular mechanistic theory, the coat proteins may deplete or inhibit either the classical complement pathway, typically initiated by antibody binding to an antigen followed by the C1 protein and fragments thereof, or the alternative pathway, typically initiated by the C3 protein and fragments thereof.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">As used herein, the term "astrovirus" refers to any member of the <i>Astroviridae</i> family, including but not limited to mammalian astrovirus species such as bovine, feline, human, ovine, porcine, and mink astrovirus, or avian species including chicken, turkey, and duck astrovirus (Table 1).</p><p id="p0047" num="0047"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO9944625A"><text>WO 99/44625</text></patcit> discloses a method of inhibiting complement activation using small pox inhibitor of complement enzymes (SPICE).<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> -->

Astrovirus coat peptides, polypeptides, regions, or whole proteins thus produced are then subsequently purified on a sucrose gradient, column or similar apparatus as discussed <i>supra.</i> It will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art that production of recombinant proteins is readily adaptable to other systems, such as yeast cells, which likewise involves the introduction of recombinant DNA into host cells followed by propagation, lysis, and purification of the protein of interest.</p><heading id="h0009"><i>Inhibition of complement-mediated lysis by astrovirus coat protein</i></heading><p id="p0057" num="0057">The invention disclosed herein demonstrates by way of example that the coat protein of <i>Astroviridae</i> family member HAstV-1 is as effective as CVF in inhibiting complement-mediated cell lysis. Given the structural similarities between members of the <i>Astroviridae</i> family, coat protein or derivatives thereof from other mammalian strains of astrovirus, such as human strains HAstV-2 through HAstV-8, bovine, porcine, ovine, feline, mink and poultry strains such as chicken, turkey, and duck astrovirus are contemplated herein as also having anti-complement activity. <b>Table 1</b> provides a non-limiting list of fully sequenced astrovirus family members to date.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">In order to compare the complement-depleting or inhibiting activity of HAstV-1 or other astrovirus coat protein to CVF, it is informative to test the astrovirus coat protein in a series of cell lysis experiments as described in the examples <i>infra.</i> Red blood cells are a sensitive and specific method for testing serum complement activation by measuring red blood cell lysis. Measurement of the percentage of lysed cells in the assay is therefore a proximal measurement of complement activation in the experimental sample, typically normal human serum (NHS). The method disclosed herein for inhibiting complement mediated lysis is comparably in efficacy to CVF, the strongest complement-depleting substance in nature. The inhibition of complement-mediated lysis of RBCs applies not only to purified coat protein, but also to intact HAstV-1 virions. Accordingly, intact astrovirus virions or virus-like particles may be used to deplete complement cascade proteins from the plasma. Although HAstV-1 virions and purified coat protein demonstrate similar levels of complement suppression when compared to CVF, the data presented here demonstrates that astrovirus virions and coat protein act to suppress serum complement activity through an inhibition mechanism as opposed to activation and subsequent depletion of complement factors exhibited by CVF.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0059" num="0059">It is important to note that wildtype astrovirus coat protein often oligomerizes into trimers (and possibly other higher order oligomers) in the buffer in which the coat protein is stored. Thus, it is contemplated that, the coat protein in the red blood cell assays for complement-mediated lysis may be a dimer, a trimer, or a higher-ordered oligomer. The coat protein may precipitate when exposed to calcium ions, an effect which occurs to a lower extent with magnesium and not at all with EDTA/NaCl. It is contemplated that these observations may be indicative of early viral-like particle assembly, as many icosahedral capsids require calcium ions for assembly. The RBC lysis assays described herein contain calcium ions (150 micromolar) and would therefore be consistent with the observed self-assembly of the coat protein subunits.</p><heading id="h0010"><i>Interactions between protein coat subunits and complement components</i></heading><p id="p0060" num="0060">An important area of investigation for the optimization of using the disclosure herein is to identify interactions between specific complement components and astrovirus coat proteins. This may be achieved, for example, through the use of a modified viral overlay blot, described by way of example <i>infra.,</i> which generally involves electrophoretic gel separation of complement proteins followed by transfer to a membrane and probing with purified coat protein. Several caveats should be noted in this approach. First, the artisan of ordinary skill will appreciate that while complement proteins C2, C3, and C4 are readily available as highly purified preparations, the C1 protein complex is much more difficult to purify owing to the fact that it is a very labile complex and falls apart easily. As a result, other serum proteins are usually present in C1 preparations. However, C1 preparations that are free of other complement factors such as C2, C3, C4, and C5, and routine batch testing with anti-complement antibodies is generally sufficient to prevent most cross-contamination with other complement factors.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">While C1q, a complex molecule, separates into several fragments during electrophoresis, C1r and C1s run as homodimers in non-reducing gels. Binding of the astrovirus coat protein in these assays may be specific to homodimers; one of ordinary skill will realize that the same protein preparations run under reducing conditions may not reflect binding at all, either because the coat protein is incapable of binding the monomer or because the concentration of the monomer in the preparation is below detectable levels.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><heading id="h0011"><i>Formulation and Administration</i></heading><p id="p0062" num="0062">Disclosed herein are pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one astrovirus coat protein or derivatives thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, or excipients.

As a negative control, NHS in the presence of cell culture medium did not affect lysis as expected (NHS + media column). While this assay is set up to detect alternative pathway activation (i.e., the RBCs are not sensitized with antibody), the presence of astrovirus antibodies in NHS could potentially activate the classical pathway. To confirm that these findings were specific to the alternative pathway, C2 depleted serum (C2D) was utilized in the place of NHS <b>(</b><figref idrefs="f0009"><b>Fig. 9</b></figref><b>).</b> By depleting NHS of C2 in this assay, the classical pathway and lectin pathways are blocked and any RBC lysis is due exclusively to alternative pathway activity.

These results demonstrate that HAstV-1 virions inhibit the alternative pathway to a lesser extent then the classical pathway and it is possible that the viral coat protein functions to block both pathways by completely different mechanisms.
