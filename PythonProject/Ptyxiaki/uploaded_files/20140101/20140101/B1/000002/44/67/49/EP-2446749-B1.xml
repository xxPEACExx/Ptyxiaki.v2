Generally speaking, when the mixture reaches the desired temperature (whether for low, medium or high pasteurisation), the heater is switched off and the cooling circuit switched on until the mixture reaches a steady state at the aging or storage temperature (a low temperature around 2° to 6°C).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The electric heater usually consists of an<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> electrical heating element mounted in the wall of the pump and/or of the tank and heated by the Joule effect.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The cooling circuit, on the other hand, consists of the evaporator of a cooling system coiled around the pump liner and/or the side wall of the tank. The prior art machines described briefly above have several disadvantages.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Mounting the electric heater on the bottom of the vessel pump or on the side wall of the tank does not guarantee optimum transmission of heat to the mixture circulating in the pump. Heating the mixture may therefore take a very long time since the operating temperature of the heating element cannot be raised too much (without the risk of locally overheating the mixture).</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It is also extremely difficult to control the local temperature of the heating elements and to prevent the formation of hot spots (leading to local overheating and burning of the mixture).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Further, it has proved extremely complex to mount the electric heating element in the same way as the evaporator of the cooling circuit because the surface available for heat exchange is not large enough for both.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> Further, since a complete thermal treatment cycle comprises heating, holding the temperature, cooling and again holding the temperature, it is necessary to strike a compromise which optimizes both steps of heating and cooling.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Moreover, again in connection with this aspect, in the transient from heating and/or holding the temperature to cooling, the process is significantly slowed by the thermal inertia of the heating elements and of the mass of mixture, delaying the treatment of the food mixture.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Lastly, the above machines consume large amounts of electricity, thus increasing machine running costs considerably. It is also known from the prior art document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP0088351A1"><text>EP0088351A1</text></patcit> which describes electrical apparatus for the preparation of food, particularly for cooling and/or refrigerating while simultaneous mixing and/or homogenizing, foodstuffs that comprises a refrigerating unit, in conditions of thermal exchange with a container, that provide the cooling and the heating of the container by reversing the refrigerating cycle.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In this context, the technical purpose which forms the basis of this invention is to propose a homogenisation, thermal treatment and pasteurisation machine which overcomes the above mentioned disadvantages of the prior art.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">More specifically, this invention has for an aim to provide a pasteurisation machine capable of heating the mixture uniformly and effectively.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Another aim of the invention is to provide a homogenisation, thermal treatment and pasteurisation machine having limited running<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> costs.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The technical purpose indicated and the aims specified are substantially achieved by a machine comprising the technical features described in one or more of the accompanying claims.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Further features and advantages of the invention are more apparent in the detailed description below, with reference to a preferred, non-limiting embodiment of a machine for the homogenisation and thermal treatment of liquid and semi-liquid food products, illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which:

The basic difference between carbon dioxide and traditional refrigerants such as, for example, HFC<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> (R-134a and R-404A) and hydrocarbons is the critical temperature value which, for carbon dioxide, is 31°C.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Thus, in a traditional vapour compression cycle, the transfer of heat to the surrounding environment (that is to say, to the food mixture when the machine operates as a heat pump) does not entail condensation of carbon dioxide but its gradual cooling until obtaining a dense gas phase.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A thermal machine with reversible thermodynamic carbon dioxide cycle does not therefore contemplate a condenser but a dense gas refrigerator, known as gas-cooler.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The corresponding thermodynamic cycle is referred to as transcritical because it occurs between two isobars, the first of which (at the inlet to the compressor and hence at the outlet from the evaporator) at a pressure lower than the critical value, and the other at a pressure higher than the critical value (at the outlet from the compressor and into the gas-cooler).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Advantageously, the thermal machine comprises a pipe 5 coiled around a containment body 6 holding the centrifugal pump 3.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The pipe 5 operates as an evaporator when the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> cooling means are activated and as a gas-cooler when the heating means are activated.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The carbon dioxide in the pipe 5 flows in countercurrent with respect to the flow of the mixture in the pump 3.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In other words, the pipe 5 heats the mixture flowing through the pump 3 when the thermal machine is working as a heat pump, and the selfsame pipe 5 cools the mixture flowing through the pump 3 when the thermal machine is working with a thermodynamic cycle which is the reverse of that of the heat pump (that is to say, when it is working as a cooling machine).</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In an alternative embodiment (not illustrated) the pipe 5 is substituted with a direct exchange evaporator integral with the containment body 6 of the centrifugal pump 3.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">This evaporator works by direct expansion when the cooling means are activated and as a gas-cooler when the heating means are activated.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In other words, the purpose of the evaporator is exactly the same as that of the pipe 5 and thus, all the functions performed by the pipe 5 are performed by the evaporator.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">When the thermal machine 4 operates as a cooling<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> machine, work is supplied to extract heat from the mixture and transfer it, increased by the thermal equivalent of the work done, to the outside environment.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Basically, a superheated vapour compression machine consists of a compressor, an evaporator, a condenser (or gas-cooler in the case of CO<sub>2</sub>) and an expansion element (consisting, for example, of a capillary tube or a thermostatic valve). During the operating cycle, the refrigerant, according to the invention carbon dioxide, is compressed and brought to gas-cooler inlet pressure.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The refrigerant in the gas-cooler cools down at a constant pressure until reaching a dense gas phase transferring heat to the surrounding environment. It should be noted that at this stage the carbon dioxide does not undergo any phase change.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In other words, the refrigerant does not condense but undergoes dense gas cooling.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Next, by a lamination effect, the carbon dioxide undergoes adiabatic expansion from the second pressure to the first.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The refrigerant then enters the evaporator (consisting of the pipe 5), absorbing heat from the mixture in transit through the pump 3, thus<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> completing the thermodynamic cycle with a step of isobaric heating.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">When the thermal machine operates as a heat pump, that is to say, when the mixture in transit through the pump has to be heated, the thermodynamic cycle described above is performed in reverse.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">That way, the transfer of heat to the mixture in transit through the centrifugal pump 3 occurs in the pipe 5 acting as a gas-cooler.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">It should also be noted that the heat pump provides more thermal energy (that is, heat transferred to the mixture to be heated) than the electrical energy used by the compressor since it absorbs heat from the outside environment.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">That way, the mixture in transit through the pump is heated in a much more energy efficient manner than if it were heated using Joule effect electrical heating elements (in which the thermal energy transferred is less than the electrical energy used).</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">It should also be noted that the substantial amount of energy (that is to say, the maximum mechanical work that can be extracted from the system when it is brought to a state of equilibrium with a reference environment) made available when the hot<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> gas is cooled in the gas-cooler is partly recovered by the heated food mixture, allowing the machine 4 to obtain an efficiency level comparable with or greater than machines of the same kind operating with traditional refrigerants such as, for example, R-134a and R-404A.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The shape of the hypercritical isobars for carbon dioxide show that transcritical cycles operating with this refrigerant are optimal for heat pumps used for heating a flow of fluid with large fluid temperature variations.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The above may be inferred from <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> which shows the temperature profiles of carbon dioxide at a pressure of 120 bar (unbroken line) and a water flow heated in countercurrent (dashed line) in the gas-cooler from 15° to 84°C (the temperature values are shown on the y-axis).</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">As may be noticed from the graph, the two curves are very well matched, demonstrating the better efficiency in heating the liquid mixture compared to a machine which uses a traditional refrigerant.
