It is thus possible for a user to apply an auxiliary force to an actuating element to switch on and off functions associated with different electrical circuits. Often such switch assemblies switch on and off the sliding and rising roof functions of a sliding-rising-roof of a motor vehicle. This type of switch assembly can be called lift-and-slide switch.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE3931722C2"><text>DE 39 31 722 C2</text></patcit> discloses a switch assembly having a housing which receives movable electrical switching contacts. The housing has a transverse axis and a longitudinal axis. An actuating element is mounted on the housing. Each of two axle journals associated with the actuating element engage a longitudinally elongated hole provided in opposite walls of the housing in parallel with the longitudinal axis. The two axle journals are rotatable and longitudinally displaceable within the elongated holes such that the actuating element is pivotable about the transverse axis and longitudinally movable along the longitudinal axis to move between switching positions.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The actuating element includes two guide cams each spaced apart from an axle journal in parallel with the longitudinal axis. The guide cams each engage a cross-shaped connecting member provided on the opposite walls of the housing to enable the actuating element to be pivotable and longitudinally movable. The actuating element can therefore be moved to switching positions by sliding and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> pivoting movements which correspond to the movements of a sliding-rising-roof of a motor vehicle.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The actuating element includes switching pieces which transmit the actuating element movements to the movable switching contacts to complete electrical circuits and enable switching functions associated with the switching positions. Furthermore, the switch assembly includes a plurality of compression spring-loaded control devices which ensure that the actuating element remains in a starting position and automatically returns from a switching position to the starting position. A problem associated with the switch assembly disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="DE3931722C2"><text>DE 39 31 722 C2</text></patcit> is that the switch assembly includes a considerable number of individual parts which are complicated to assemble resulting in considerable assembly costs.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="DE3415997C2"><text>DE 34 15 997 C2</text></patcit> discloses a switch assembly wherein movements of the actuating element correspond to the movements of a sliding-rising-roof of a motor vehicle.

The switch travel direction can not be defined precisely such that the actuating element tends to hang loose generating bad feeling for the user. This problem is difficult to solve taking into account the dimensional tolerances of the different parts of the assembly.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a switch assembly for a sliding-rising-roof of a motor vehicle which maintains a high degree of functionability, which has a compact design, and which consists of exceptionally few individual parts which are convenient to assemble.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In carrying out the above object and other objects, features, and advantages, the present invention provides a switch assembly according to the preamble of claim 1, characterized in that each longitudinal wall comprises a cross-shaped groove including a cross-shaped guiding track, said cross shaped groove being dimensioned so as to receive a projecting member of the actuating element and said guiding track receiving a pressure piece carried by the actuating element and biased towards the bottom of said guiding track in order to guide the actuating element when it pivots and when it slides, and in that said cross shaped groove has end surfaces which form abutment surfaces for the corresponding surfaces of the projecting member in order to stop the actuating element in its extreme sliding and pivoting positions.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Thanks to the present invention, the guiding function and the stopping function in connection with the four different switching positions are obtained simply with a few components. It is economic and easy to manufacture. The haptic feeling for the user is also improved because there is no loosening and no snagging when the actuating element is manipulated. The switch assembly is more reliable and more robust because the stop positions are better defined.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to other advantageous features of the present invention:

The switch assembly 10 includes a housing 12 and an actuating element 14 or button which is mounted on the housing 12. The actuating element 14 is movable between switching positions. The switch assembly 10 further includes movable electrical switching contacts 16, 18, 20, 22 disposed in the housing 12. A movement of the actuating element 14 causes the switching contacts 16, 18, 20, 22 to move between switching positions in relation to fixedly held switching contacts (not shown) disposed on a printed circuit board (not shown) to complete electrical circuits and enable switching functions associated with the switching positions.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The housing 12 has a pair of spaced apart longitudinal walls 24, 26 and a pair of spaced apart transverse walls 28, 30 delimiting a rectangular box receiving the actuating element 14.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As is particularly evident in <figref idrefs="f0001">figures 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">3</figref>, the actuating element 14 is longitudinally displaceable along a longitudinal axis A1 of the housing 12 between a first and second switching positions, here called forward and rear<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> positions, and is pivotable about a transverse axis A2 of the housing 12, the transverse axis A2 extending perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis A1, between a third and fourth switching positions, here called upper and lower positions.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to the teaching of the present invention, each longitudinal wall 24, 26 comprises a cross-shaped groove 32, 34 including a cross-shaped guiding track 36, as can be seen on the detailed views of <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">figures 5 to 7</figref>. Said guiding track 36 receives a pressure piece 40 carried by the actuating element 14 along a transverse axis A3 and biased towards the bottom of said guiding track 36 in order to guide the actuating element 14 when the latter pivots and when the latter slides.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Said cross shaped groove 32, 34 is dimensioned so as to receive a projecting member 38 of the actuating element 14, which is best shown in cross section on <figref idrefs="f0003">figures 5C, 6C</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0004">7C</figref>. Said cross shaped groove 32, 34 has end surfaces 42, 44, 46 48 which form abutment surfaces for the corresponding surfaces of the projecting member 38 in order to stop the actuating element 14 in its extreme sliding and pivoting positions corresponding essentially to the switching positions. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 6A and 6C</figref> show the projecting member 38 in abutment against the end surface 42 when the actuating element 14 is in its front position and <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 7A and 7C</figref> show the projecting member 38 in abutment against the end surface 46 when the actuating element 14 is in its upper position.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Advantageously, said projecting member 38 is made of one piece with the actuating element 14, for example by injection-molding. According to the present embodiment, said projecting member 38 has a substantially square profile in cross section along a longitudinal cutting plane so as to form four plane surfaces 50, 52, 54, 56 which are able to come into abutment against the corresponding end surfaces 42, 44, 46, 48 of the cross-shaped groove 32, 34.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Each cross-shaped groove 32, 34 is preferably made of plastic material by molding with the housing 12. Here it is made as a bumped out in the internal face of the longitudinal walls 24, 26. Said cross-shaped grooves 32, 34 do not open on the external faces of the longitudinal walls 24, 26.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As can be noted on <figref idrefs="f0003">figures 6C</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">7C</figref>, the width of each projecting member 38 is inferior to the width of each branch of the cross-shaped groove 32, 34 which forms a gap G1, G2 on each side of the projecting member 38. The<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> guiding of the actuating element 14 during the motion is not implemented by the projecting member 38 but by the pressure piece 40 which cooperates with the guiding track 36.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Each guiding track 36 extends in the bottom of the cross-shaped groove 32, 34. It has as many branches as the cross-shaped groove 32, 34. As can be seen on <figref idrefs="f0003">figures 6B</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">7B</figref>, the guiding track 36 is dimensioned so as the projecting member 38 comes into abutment against the end surfaces 42, 44, 46, 48 before the pressure piece 40 reaches the end of the corresponding branch of the guiding track 36. At the central part of the cross formed by said guiding track 36, there is a central junction 57 which corresponds to the rest position of the actuating element 14.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to the present embodiment, each pressure piece 40 comprises a spring-loaded pressure sleeve 58 forming a plunger having a hemispherical end 60 which comes into sliding contact with two points X, Y (<figref idrefs="f0003">figure 6A</figref>) on the parallel edges, or sloped walls 62, 64, of the guiding track 36 when the actuating element 14 pivots and when it slides. Each pressure piece 40 comprises a helical compression spring 66 which biases the sleeve 58 transversally against the guiding track 36.
