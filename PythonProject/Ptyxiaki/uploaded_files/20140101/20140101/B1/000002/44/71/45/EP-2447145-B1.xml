load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">Prior Art</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">Electric bicycles or e-bicycles are driven by a pedal drive as well as by a supplemental electric drive. The electric drive usually comprises an electric motor located at the axle of the front wheel, of the rear wheel or at the bottom bracket. In order to accommodate the motor drive, the design of an electric bicycle significantly differs from the design of common bicycles. Thus, an electric drive can not be added to common bicycles without substantial modifications, e.g. widening the fork width. Rather, particular designs regarding the wheel support or the bottom bracket are required. Further, common electric drives add a substantial amount of weight to the bicycle.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US3961678A"><text>US 3,961,678</text></patcit>, a supplemental electrical drive for a common bicycle is shown. This supplemental electrical drive comprises an electric DC motor lateral to the circumference of the rear wheel, wherein the electric motor drives a roller supported by a swing arm. ' The roller contacts the circumferential tire of the rear wheel. The electric drive shown in this prior art document requires significant space such that the drive can only be attached to an additional support construction, ie. a carrier mounted at the rear wheel. Further, the electrical drive of <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US3961678A"><text>US 3,961,678</text></patcit> is fixedly attached to the bicycle and extends on the rear wheel as well as lateral to it. Due to the size and mounting arrangement, the electrical drive shows poor handling properties.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide an electrical drive with improved handling.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0002">Summary of the Invention</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">This problem is solved by an electric drive according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The inventive electric drive provides an integrated arrangement of drive and motor leading to a significantly reduced size. Further, the complexity as well as the costs of the inventive electric drive are significantly reduced while the efficiency is significantly increased. The arrangement of the inventive electric drive allows to integrate motor and output drive. Therefore, no parts of the inventive drive extend laterally to the drive which allows flexible mounting, in particular at areas of the bicycle at which the space is limited, eg. at the bottom bracket. Further, the size and weight of the motor is decreased due to the use of a more compact motor. In addition, the motor according to the invention has a significantly reduced wearing and allows higher speeds of the magnetic poles relative to the stator coils an does not the need of an additional reduction drive unit, eg. a gear. The motor of the inventive drive can be a electric-motor. Preferably the motor of the inventive drive is a brushless motor in which no additional space is occupied by a mechanical commutator. Alternatively, the motor can comprises a mechanical commutator having brushes. Further, a brushless motor provides less wearing problems and increased rotational speeds. A brushless motor is a electric motor with an electronic commutation, preferably a synchronous electric motor. Preferably, the inventive drive comprises an electric motor with an external rotor (encompassing the motor's stator) also called "outer rotor motor", in particular a brushless permanent magnet motor.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The invention concerns an electric drive for a bicycle. The supplementary electric drive comprises an electric motor (preferably brushless) and a contact roller having an outer contact surface. This outer surface is adapted to be used as friction drive for a bicycle wheel. The motor comprises a stator having plurality of stator coils as well as corresponding magnetic rotor elements. The magnetic rotor elements are arranged circumferentially around the stator. Further, the rotor elements are fixedly attached to an inner surface of the contact roller. The contact roller (as well as the rotor elements attached thereto) encloses the stator.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the invention, the electromechanical motor components are located within the roller, which provides the output drive in form of its (rotating) outer surface. The roller combines electromagnetic elements of the motor, ie. the magnetic rotor elements, and the output drive surface, ie. the outer contact surface. Thus, there is a direct connection between the magnetic rotor elements and the outer contact surface. In particular, the magnetic rotor elements and the outer contact surface are directly connected with each other by the wall of the contact roller. The wall extends between inner surface of the contact roller and the outer contact surface. In particular, the wall is circumferentially closed and continuous, and is provided by one single, homogenous hollow body providing the inner surface as well as the outer contact surface or by an hollow body providing the inner surface, the hollow body being covered with a sleeve providing the outer contact surface. The contact roller encloses the stator and the magnetic rotor element. In particular, the contact roller encloses the coils, ie. The contact roller encloses a stator core on which windings are placed. The coils comprise windings and the core, wherein the core connects the coils magnetically.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The contact roller has a circular cross section and extends along the rotational axis of the motor. The shape of the roller in longitudinal direction of the roller is preferably concave, in particular with a curvature less than the complementary curvature of a running surface of a bicycle tire. Alternatively, the roller can have a cylindrical shape with a constant circular cross section. The roller comprises a metal, in particular steel or a Al-alloy with increased hardness. In particular, the roller comprises a magnetic material having a high magnetic permeability providing a magnetic loop connection for closing the magnetic circuit provided by magnetic elements of the motor. The core of the coils is magnetically connected to the magnetic material; in particular, the core comprises (a part of) the magnetic material. The roller can comprise two materials, one having a high magnetic permeability and another providing a high hardness. The material providing the hardness provides the contact surface. The roller's geometry as well as (at least one of) the material of the roller provide a low magnetic reluctance.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The outer contact surface of the roller is structured for increased friction between contact surface and tire. Preferably, the outer contact surface comprises a plurality of indentations or elevations or both. The indentations or elevations can extend in radial<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> direction only or can extend in a radial direction as well as a perpendicular thereto in a direction inclined to a tangential direction of the roller, eg. in form of grooves. In another embodiment, the outer contact surface can be provided by an additional sleeve fitted onto the roller. This sleeve is preferably replaceable and is made of a partly elastic material, eg. rubber or plastics. The sleeve can comprise anti-slip material at the contact surface, eg. sandpaper. The sleeve can comprise an adhesive inner layer abutting towards the roller. The roller can be provided with fastening elements engaging with corresponding fastening elements in the sleeve. The fastening element can be mechanical elements or adhesive elements, eg. an adhesive layer.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The outer surface is preferably coated with a layer comprising reinforcing particles, e.g. ceramic particles made of ceramic material or ceramic composite material. As an example, the ceramic material can comprise A1<sub>2</sub>0<sub>3</sub> (as corundum), SiC, BN or similar materials, preferably with a hardness of at least 1000, 2000 or 2500 (according to Vickers). Advantageously, the layer further comprises a binding component (i.e. a matrix) for fixing the particles to the roller, e.g. aluminum, an aluminum alloy or steel or another metal or alloy. Instead or in combination with ceramic particles, hard materials based on metal or an alloy could be used, e.g. tungsten carbide in order to provide the reinforcing particles. The outer surface can be provided by the roller's outer surface or by sleeve's outer surface. The reinforcing particles and/or the binding component can be provided as an arc sprayed layer.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The stator of the brushless motor is an inner stator, around which the rotor (as outer rotor) is arranged. The stator comprises core elements (made of the magnetic material) as well as windings arranged thereon, both forming the coils. Thus, the stator comprises the coils provided by the core elements and the respective windings arranged thereon. The coils can be electrically grouped together by direct electrical connection within the motor. The coils are grouped according to a three-phase system with a mutual phase shift of n x 120°, n being an integer. Neighboring coils are assigned to distinct phases. The coils are arranged circumferentially in a sequence periodically repeating three distinct phases in the same order. The core elements (as well as the magnetic material) magnetically connected and are made of highly permeable magnetic material, eg. a ferrite or iron or an iron alloy. The core elements extend longitudinal with regard to the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> stator. The stator is mechanically connected to a static (non-rotating) part of the bicycle via a mounting assembly. The stator windings, ie. the stator coils, are electrically connected to an electrical (electronical) commutator circuit. The stator comprises an armature, on which the windings are arranged. The armature comprises the core elements of the coils as well as magnetic material connecting the core elements. The core elements of the coils as well as magnetic material connecting the core elements of the armature are fixedly connected to each other, wherein the armature provides the magnetic and mechanic connection. The armature comprises an inner opening through which the mounting shaft extends. The mounting shaft and the armature are fixedly connected with each other at an inner wall of the inner opening. The mounting shaft can be directly connected to the armature, such that the mounting shaft and the armature physically contact each other. In a preferred embodiment, the mounting shaft is connected to the armature via a mechanical damper element, e.g. elastic bushings as described below. The armature comprising the core elements and the magnetic material connecting the core elements can be provided as a stack of sheets of magnetically permeable material. The sheets are stacked along the longitudinal axis of the motor. In order to reduce eddy current losses, the sheets are electrically insulated, preferably by an insulation coating.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Magnetic rotor elements are arranged around the stator and are supported by the inner surface of the contact roller. The magnetic rotor elements are preferably permanent magnets, in particular rare earth magnets. The magnets can be neodymium, samarium-cobalt or AINiCo magnets, or magnets of other materials with high coercivity.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In a preferred embodiment, the stator is provided with a mounting shaft fixedly attached to the stator windings, ie. fixedly attached to core of the windings. In other words, the mounting shaft is connected to the coils. The mounting shaft is not adapted for following the rotational movement of the rotor. Rather, the mounting shaft is a fixed component of the inventive drive (fixedly connected to a mounting assembly), wherein the roller is rotatable vs. the mounting shaft. The mounting shaft forms a fixed shaft. In particular, the mounting shaft is indirectly attached to the stator windings (ie. to the coils). Preferably, the mounting shaft is mechanically connected with the armature, ie. an inner opening of the armature. The mounting shaft is fixedly attached to the core on which the windings are located, preferably with no degrees of freedom or at least no rotational<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> degrees of freedom. The mounting shaft can be directly attached to the armature or is, as a preferred embodiment, attached to the armature via an elastic damper element as described below. Any dampening movement allowed by the damper element shall not be considered as a movement in the sense of a degree of freedom..</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In a particular embodiment, the mounting shaft is formed of two mounting bushings, both extending at least partly within a longitudinal center bore of the core, wherein a (longitudinal) pin connects the mounting bushings. The mounting shaft extends longitudinally through the contact roller. Further, the mounting shaft comprises two attachment sections at both opposite end faces of the contact roller. Preferably, the attachment sections each project from the pertaining end faces of the contact roller. In particular, at least one of the attachment sections comprises attachment elements (e.g. bores or threaded holes) at least one of which is not located at the rotational axis of the motor. Alternatively or in combination therewith, at least one of attachment sections comprise a non-circular attachment element. In both alternatives, the attachment elements are adapted to transmit torque between the stator and a bicycle section to which the inventive drive is attached to. The mounting shaft coextending with the motor (ie. the stator) allows in particular symmetrical, stable and simple attachments to a bicycle.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In a preferred embodiment, an elastic damper element is provided between the mounting shaft and (the cores of) the coils. The elastic damper element is preferably in form of two elastic bushings arranged on the mounting bushings and the core elements. In particular, the elastic damper element is arranged between the armature, i.e. an inner opening of the armature, and the mounting shaft, which is preferably provided by mounting bushings. The elastic damper element significantly reduces the noise resulting from the operation of the motor by mechanically decoupling inner motor components (the stator) from the motor support with regard to vibrations (in particular in the audible range).</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The damper element is provided at the mounting assembly at the top part. Thus, the damper element is arranged between (most components of) the mounting assembly and the bicycle provided with the inventive drive. The damper element can be provided at the beams, at the arms (in particular at the pivoting point, wherein the damper element can form a support for a pivoting bearing connecting the arms and the mounting shaft of the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> motor. Thus, the damper element can be provided within components of the mounting assembly connecting the top part and the stator. Further, the damper element can be provided within the mounting shaft. The damper element is of elastic material or is an elastic construction adapted to absorb vibrations. The damper element can be sheet or a pad of elastic material like rubber.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to an aspect of the invention, the electric drive is provided with a first and a second rolling-element bearing. The bearings support the roller vs. the stator or the mounting shaft. The bearings are located at distinct longitudinal positions of the drive, ie. at opposite ends of the roller. The bearings connect the mounting shaft and the contact roller, however with a rotational degree of freedom. The bearings are at opposite longitudinal positions of the mounting shaft. The bearings can be roller bearings, ball bearings or needle bearings. The rotating elements (as well as the surface contacted thereby) can be made of steel, hardened steel, surface treated steel or any combinations thereof. Further, the rotation elements (as well as the surface contacted thereby) can be made of ceramics or can comprise a surface layer of ceramics, in particular comprising Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> or Zr0<sub>2</sub>. The first and the second bearing, ie. both bearings at opposite ends of the electric drive, are preferably of the same kind. Preferably, the bearings have identical dimensions and are made of the same material. In particular, the bearings have the same dimensions, performance, load rating, radial load capacity and/or rating life. Thus, the bearings are symmetrical as regards their supporting performance or load capacity. In comparison to common brushless motors with external rotor, this embodiment provides a symmetrical load capacity. In other words, the load capacity as regards radial force is equal for both bearings. In this way, the inventive electric drive provides a high lifetime. In addition, the symmetry of most of the components allows to use highly similar or identical parts leading to reduced production costs.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In a particular embodiment, an electrical supply line (connected to the windings or coils of the stator) extends through the stator, and in particular through the mounting shaft. Thus, the stator (and in particular the mounting shaft) comprises a hollow section or an inner channel through with (a part of) the supply line extends. According to this aspect of the invention, the mounting shaft is hollow or comprises a longitudinal section, in which it is hollow. A channel is formed through which the supply line extends to the outside of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the stator. The supply line extends through an end face of the mounting shaft in order to be connected with other electrical components outside the stator. The mounting shaft defines an inner channel in which an electrical supply line is located. The supply line extends through at least one of the end sections and/or end faces of the mounting shaft.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to a first realization, the supply line is directly connected to the stator windings (i.e. connected to the coils). According to an alternative, second realization, the supply line is connected to a brushless motor control circuit located within the contact roller (e.g. within the stator, or, preferably at an end face of the mounting shaft). The brushless motor control circuit controls the stator windings (i.e. coils) connected therewith. In the first realization, the supply line is a multiphase line comprising a line for each phase (in particular in addition to a neutral conductor), e.g. a three-phase line with phases R, S, T. The stator coils (i.e. the windings thereof) are electrically grouped according to their phase. In an N phase system, N windings in sequence pertain to distinct phases. Coils, between which N-1 other coils (of other phases) are located, are connected serially or in parallel. N is an integer and equal to 3 or greater. Coils of distinct phases are arranged in a particular sequence of phases, which is repeated for all windings. The coils and their interconnection provide a rotating magnetic field when supplied with an N-phase system. Connections among the coils are located within the stator. Further, these connections or the coils (i.e. the windings thereof) comprise taps to which the multiphase line is connected. It is also possible to provide lines for each of the coils (i.e. the respective windings), wherein the mutual interconnection of the coils (and, consequently, the association to a particular phase or group or) is located outside the stator. In this case, the supply line is formed by lines leading to the individual windings. In the second realization, the supply line preferably comprises two supply conductors, eg. DC conductors providing V+ and GND voltage. These are connected to the motor control circuit. At least one further line (also connected to the motor control circuit) in addition to the supply lines transmits control data (e.g. revolving speed data or power data or torque data as set point data) and/or sensor data (e.g. temperature data or load data provided by the motor or sensors at the motor). In preferred embodiments, the supply line extending through the mounting shaft is a three-phase line (with three phase conductors or three phase conductors and an additional neutral conductor) connected to the windings, which are connected in groups, ie. according to the phase system. In these<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> preferred embodiments, the motor control circuit is located outside the mounting shaft and the stator but is a component of the electric drive, preferably located within a mounting assembly of the electric drive. The motor control circuit comprises a brushless motor controller (as an integrated circuit) and output stage switches (as electronic switches) driven thereby. Generally, the electrical features and properties of the coils apply for the windings of the respective coils.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The motor control circuit can be provided with a sensor input or a sensor for sensing the magnetic field orientation within the motor or the orientation of the rotor vs. the stator. The magnetic field orientation is provided as input to the controller for field oriented control (with or without field sensor). Alternatively, the motor control circuit can provide a sensorless control. In particular, the control provided thereby is a commutation control. The motor control circuit can provide a six step block commutation, a sinusoidal commutation and/or a field oriented commutation. In particular, the electronic commutator (i.e. the control circuit) drives the coils with mutually phase-shifted trapezoid or sinusoidal currents or voltages. The driving currents or voltages have positive and negative half-cycles. The trapezoid shape comprises an increasing, a constant, and a decreasing phase step for each of the half-cycles. Thus, the trapezoid current or voltage comprises six steps for each period. In addition, the shape of the driving current of driving voltage can be any shape approximated to a sinusoidal shape. In addition, the driving voltage or driving current can, taking into account the mechanical and electric properties of the coils, the rotor magnets and the armature, be provided such that a back-EMF voltage is generated having a shape similar to the shape of the driving currents or voltages mentioned above.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The motor control circuit provides a pulse width modulation (PWM) for controlling the effective power, ie. the RMS of the motor current. The motor control circuit is adapted for trapezoidal commutation control (or any other form leading to a low high frequency component or torque ripple, eg. sinusoidal commutation control). The motor is provided as permanent magnet synchronous machine. Preferably, the armature can be wounded to produce a back-EMF in trapezoidal or sinusoidal form.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to an aspect of the invention, the electric drive comprises a cooling surface. This cooling surface is located at an end of the outer contact surface. Preferably, the electric drive comprises two (symmetrical) cooling surfaces at both ends of the outer contact surface. The outer surface area of the contact roller comprises the contact surface arranged for contacting a wheel of the bicycle as well as at least one cooling surface. The cooling surface is arranged at a lateral end of the outer contact surface area. Preferably, the outer surface area of the contact roller comprises two cooling surfaces at the lateral ends of the contact roller. If two cooling surfaces are provided, the contact surface is arranged between the cooling surfaces. The cooling surfaces are preferably provided with circumferential grooves for increasing cooling effect. Cooling effects are provided by the cooling surface(s), i.e. by an air flow, in particular by wind created by the bicycle's movement. Additional cooling effects are provided by heat transfer from the contact surface to the wheel contacted by the contact roller.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In order to protect the interior of the drive, the electric drive further comprises at least one cover member covering the stator at one or preferably at both end faces of the stator or at one or preferably at both end faces of the contact roller. The cover members extend in a radial direction. The cover members extend between a rolling-element and the inner surface of the contact roller.

Thus, the two side beams and the top part in between can be in the U-shape or in another shape, in which the top part connects the two side beams and wherein at least a section of the top part is perpendicular to a mounting section of the side beams at which the mounting shaft is attached. The second fastening elements comprise two arms, which are pivotally connected to the pivot points of the side beams at first ends of the arms (preferably by a pivoting bearing for each of the pivot points). The arms are pivotable with regard to the pivot points. A second end of the arm is connected to the stator. The second ends of the arms are opposite to the first ends. The side beams are separated from each other providing a space adapted to accommodate length of the contact roller. The side beams are connected by the top part at ends of the side beams opposite to the ends of the side beams connected to the arms supporting the mounting shaft.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The arms are biased in order to press the contact roller against the wheel driven by the electric drive. The force (in particular the component generating the force, a tension element) is preferably controllable. The second fastening elements comprise a tension element connecting one of the second ends of the arms or the stator to one of the side plates. In this way, a force provided by the second fastening elements is exerted onto the contacting roller. The tension element is located between side beams plates and stator of the contacting roller and provides a pressing force or, preferably, a pulling force. The tension element connects one of the second ends of the arms (or the stator / the mounting shaft) and a location of one of the side plates, which is closer to the first fastening element than the first ends of the arm. Alternatively, a tension element can be provided for each of the arms allowing a symmetric support of the contact roller or any other place. The tension element exerts a resilient force to the stator or to the second ends of the arms towards the side plate to which the tension element is connected.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The tension element is biased in order to provide a bias force or bias torque pressing / drawing the roller away from the mounting assembly (towards driven wheel). The tension element is adapted to provide a certain bias force at a position at which the roller contacts the driven wheel (i.e. the contact position). The bias force is adapted to the static friction coefficient of the outer contact surface of the roller and the surface of the wheel driven thereby. The bias force moving the roller towards the wheel is provided by the force provided by the tension element, a point of application of the spring force generated by the tension element (i.e. effective lever length), and contacting angle of the roller vs. the wheel's surface defined by the direction of the contacting force. Preferably, the bias force (or the spring force) can be adjusted according to the friction coefficient between wheel and contact roller, in particular according to a current road condition (dry / wet / dusty). An actuation element can be provided in order to adjust the bias force, e.g. a lever connected to the inventive drive via a Bowden cable (or an electromechanical equivalent). Such a mechanism comprising a tension element and a control is also described in detail below.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">With increased (decreased) driving torque and in particular with increased (decreased) tangential force exerted by the contact roller onto the wheel, the contacting force by which the contact roller is urged against the wheel driven thereby is increased (decreased). The strictly increasing monotonic dependency between driving torque and contacting force (= normal force) urging the contact roller against the wheel (i.e. in a direction away from the mounting assembly) results from the fact that the roller is urged towards the wheel in opposite direction to the (tangential) driving force exerted by the contact roller onto the wheel due to the motor's torque. The dependency ( in the first order of magnitude is) is roughly a linear dependency, wherein the offset of the linear dependency (concerning the pressing force) corresponds to the bias force and the slope of the linear dependency is defined by the orientation of the contact roller vs. the pivoting point at which the arms holding the contact roller are supported by the side beam(s). In particular, the slope is r <sup>*</sup> t / n, r being the radius of the contact roller, t being the distance between pivoting point of the arms and tangential of the roller at the contact point and n being the tangential offset between pivoting point of the arms holding the roller and the contacting point of the roller, i.e. the distance between contacting point and pivoting point in direction of the tangential. The definition of n refers to a tangential<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> offset at the contacting point (i.e. the tangent of roller or wheel at the contacting point) vs. the pivoting point of the arms at the side beam(s). The contacting point of the roller is the point (= cross sectional view of a contacting line) at which roller and wheel are in physical contact. Distance n reflects the tilting angle between (the arms of) the mounting assembly relative to the direction of the contacting force, wherein n corresponds to a side of a right triangle (reflecting the orientation of the arms) opposite to the angle.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The slope of this dependency can be provided according to a (given) static friction coefficient reflecting a proportional dependency between contacting force (normal force) and resulting maximum tangential force. The maximum tangential force resulting from the static friction element is greater than the tangential force exerted by the contact roller for all driving torques realizable by the motor. This avoids slipping.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In particular, at least one of the physical quantities of r, t and n defining dimensions of the inventive drive can be provided according to the surface properties of the roller and the wheel (under certain standard conditions) and the resulting friction coefficient. Further, for example t or n can be adapted according to current street conditions, i.e. according to the current friction coefficient, e.g. by an adaptation mechanism, e.g. comprising a lever, a Bowden cable an electro mechanic actuator. Further, different supporting points at the beam(s) can be provided in order to allow distinct pivoting points for the arm. By providing distinct pivoting points (at least two) for the arms supporting the contact roller, distinct t or n sizes can be provided. In the same way, distinct application points for the tension element at the arms or distinct anchor points for the tension element at the beams can be provided. The anchor point to which the tension element is connected is the application point. Particular points of the supporting points (providing the pivoting point), application points and/or the anchor points can be selected in order to select a certain t and/or s. For distinct points, t and/or s are distinct. This allows to define and select a certain desired dependency between contacting force and driving torque, in particular depending on a current friction coefficient resulting from actual street conditions. An adapted orientation (resulting in an adapted dependency between contacting force and driving torque) can be provided by distinct discrete orientations of the roller vs. wheel, ie. by the pivoting points, application points and anchor points. Further, such an adaptation can be provided by a continuously adaptable<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> orientation, e.g. provided by a mechanism comprising an adjusting screw or a setscrew in order to adapt at least one of t or s.

In addition to the constant preload (bias), the drive torque provided by the roller increases mechanically the force pressing the roller against the wheel, according to the relationship mentioned above. A stronger torque results in stronger pressing force, according to the linear relationship denoted above. So in lower torque cruise mode the overall system efficiency is increased compared to a fixed pressing force set up. The contact force is sufficient to avoid slip but does not lead to unnecessary deformation of the wheel by the contact roller, which would significantly reduce the efficiency otherwise. In particular, this allows to reduce additional flexing of the wheel to a minimum.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The arms holding the contact roller have length of preferably 35 - 100 mm, measured from the pivoting point and the contact roller's axis, i.e. the connection point of arms and mounting shaft.

In a particular embodiment, a lever for manual actuation is combined with latching means, both controlling an elastic tension element at the second fastening element. The lever is adapted to adjust the degree of compression of the tension element, ie. to control the force generated by the tension element. The tension element exerts a force on the arm pressing (or pulling) the contact roller towards a bicycle's wheel (e.g. in an engagement mode). The latching element maintains the degree of compression of the tension element is the actuation element is not actuated any longer.

The anchor point 82 is displaced with regard to the pivot point in order to allow an urging force of the contact roller 40 in a tangential direction of the arms 50.<br/>
<figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> shows an electric motor and a contact roller of an embodiment of the present invention in exploded view. The contact roller 132, 132' (corresponding to contact roller 32 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>) encloses most of the parts of the motor, in particular all parts apart from lateral attachment components. The motor comprises a plurality of magnetic rotor elements 110 which are circumferentially arranged within an inner surface 134 of the contact roller and attached thereto. The magnetic rotor elements 110 extend parallel to the axis of the motor and are in the shape of a bar. The contact roller comprises an element in the shape of a hollow cylinder 132 with a cylindrical cross section. This cylindrical body 132 is of a magnetically permeable material for providing a magnetic loop connection. The magnetic rotor elements 110 are equidistant. The magnetic rotor elements are permanent magnets and are made of magnetic material with a high coercivity. The cylindrical body 132 is of magnetic material with a high permeability, e.g. a ferromagnetic material, Mu-metal, permalloy, ferrite or similar or comprises at least such material. The magnetic material forms the inner surface 134 of the contact roller. Corresponding to the magnetic rotor elements 110, an armature 120 as a part of the stator is provided, wherein the armature is made of a magnetically permeable material. The armature comprises core elements 122 and magnetic material 124, which magnetically connects the core elements 122. The magnetic material provides an inner bore 126 for attaching the armature to further components of the motor. The windings of the coils (not shown for clarity reasons) encompass the core elements. The electrical supply lines of the motor 127 (just an example is shown for clarity reasons) passing through the hollow mounting shaft 150 and the bearing 170. The armature further comprises outer pole areas 128 oriented towards the magnetic rotor elements. In order to avoid the transmission of vibrations, two damper elements 130 are provided, which are arranged within the inner bore 126 of the armature, wherein the damper elements 130 are introduced from opposite sides into the inner bore 126 of the armature 120. At least one of the damper elements 140 are hollow in order to provide a channel for electrical connections to the coils arranged on the armature 120. Further, the damper<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> elements 140 are in the shape of a bushing in order to partially receive mounting bushings 150. The damper elements 140 and the mounting bushings 150 can be referred to as mounting shaft. Electrical connections between the coils and the exterior of motor (not shown for clarity reasons) extend through the mounting shaft, i.e. through the at least one of the damper elements 140 and least one of the mounting bushings 150. In addition, the inner bore of the armature 120, at least one of the mounting bushing, or one of the damper elements can be provided with radial bores through which the electrical connections extend.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The contact roller further comprises two end caps 132' which are laterally engaged with the cylindrical body 132 from both sides of the cylindrical body. Each end cap 132' provides an outer circumferential shoulder area 136 which receives an end of the cylindrical body 132. The outer circumferential shoulder area 136 is connected to lateral end sections of the inner surface 134 of the cylindrical body 132, preferably by press fit. Further, each end cap 132' provides an inner circumferential shoulder area 138 connected to one of the mounting bushings 150 via one of the damper elements 140. The outer circumferential surface of the end caps 132' comprises circumferential groves 137 for increased surface area resulting in an increased cooling effect. The end caps 132' and the cylindrical body 132 are preferably of the same material.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The inventive drive further comprises rolling element bearings 170, each rolling element bearing supporting one of the mounting bushings 150. Inner sides of the rolling element bearings 170 contact the mounting bushings 150 and outer sides of the rolling element bearings 170 contacts the contact roller. In particular, the outer sides of the rolling element bearings 170 contact the inner circumferential shoulder areas 138 of the end caps 132' of the contact roller.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Axially extending fixing elements 151 are provided within the mounting bushings 150, which are offset to the axis 120. The axially extending fixing elements 151 are threaded bores receiving screws 180 which allow to attach the mounting shaft (in particular: the mounting bushings 150) to a mounting assembly (not shown). Due to the offset, the stator can not rotate relative to the component of the mounting assembly, which directly contacts the mounting bushing. Further, an axial fixing element 182 extending along the<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> axis 120 is provided for attaching the roller and the motor to a mounting assembly. Sealing elements 154 are provided to cover a gap between inner and outer elements of the rolling element bearing, in which the balls or the cylinders of the rolling element bearing are provided.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Preferably, all elements in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, apart from the screws 180 and the axial fixing element 182, are permanently attached to each other, for example by press fit.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">In <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, an embodiment of the inventive drive is shown in side view. The embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> comprises a motor and a contact roller similar to the embodiment depicted in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>. In addition, the drive shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> is similar to the drive shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">The electric drive shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> comprises a contact roller 232 (similar to contact roller 132, 132' of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>). An end cap 232' extends between the inner surface of the contact roller 232 and an outer side of a rolling element bearing 270. The rolling element bearing 270 is seated on a mounting shaft (in particular: on a mounting bushing). Fixing elements 251 in form of screws attach the mounting shaft to an arm 250. In an alternative embodiment (not shown), only one fixing element radially dislocated to the axis of the mounting shaft / of the mounting bushings is provided. In <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, the drive comprises two arms, one each at one of the axial ends of the motor / roller, wherein <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> shows only one of these arms due to the side view representation. The arms are part of a mounting assembly. Arm 250 (as well as the other arm, not shown) has a first end at which it is pivotably connected to a pivot point of a side beam 232 of the mounting assembly. Due to the side view representation, only one side beam of two side beams 232 are shown. At the first end, the arm 250 (as well as the other arm, not shown) is connected to the beam 232 via a pivoting bearing 252'. The pivoting bearing 252' is connected to a pivot point 252 of the beam 232. The arm 250 (as well as the other arm) further comprises a second end opposite to the first end at which the arm 250 is connected to the stator (or mounting shaft) of the motor via the fixing elements 251. At the second end of the arm 251, though holes 254 are provided through which electrical connections (not shown) to the stator coils (not shown) extend.<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --></p><p id="p0062" num="0062">The arm further comprises a stopper (or abutment) 290 having a slot into which a pin connected to the beam engages. The dimensions of the slot define the movement range of the arm 250.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Further, the mounting assembly shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> comprises a tension element in form of a spring assembly 280, which connects an anchor point 282 of the beam 232 with a lever 284. The lever 284 is attached to the arm 250, in particular to the second end of the arm 250, at which also the mounting shaft of the motor is attached to the arm 250. The lever 284 is inclined to the arm 250, in particular with an angle of about 90°. The lever 284 provides an offset perpendicular to the direction into which the arm extends. This allows to create a normal force urging the contact roller from the mounting assembly (i.e. from the beams 232) as a result of the force provided by the spring assembly. At the anchor point, a set screw 286 is provided in order to set and adjust the bias tension provided by the tension element. Instead of a set screw, a plurality of discrete connection points could be provided in order to select the bias tension according to the location of the selected set point. Further, a plurality of anchor points can be provided, the selection of which defines the characteristic curve of normal pressure and inclination of the arm 250. In addition, the effective length of lever 284 allows to adjust the characteristic curve. Thus, the point of connection between spring assembly 280 and lever 284 could be a selectable point, e.g. by providing a plurality of such points at the lever 284, wherein one selected of which is connected to the spring assembly 280. A plurality of points can be provided by a sequence of wholes or projecting engagement elements. In general, either the point at which the tension element 280 exerts its force on the arm 250 is distinct to the axis of the roller 232 or the anchor point 282 is distinct to the pivot point 252 or both. This allows the tension element to create a force in a tangential direction of the arm with regard to the pivot point 252. The orientation between pivot point 252 and anchor point 282 as well as the orientation of the lever 284 defines a bias normal force as well as an increase rate, wherein the bias normal force is adjusted according the friction coefficient between contact roller and wheel, and wherein the increase rate defines the increase of the normal force as a function of the driving torque delivered by the drive to the wheel. The increase rate as well as the bias normal force are adjusted such that, at maximum driving torque, the resulting normal force is higher than a minimum force below which slip between the contact roller and the wheel occurs. The minimum force<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> depends on the maximum driving torque and the friction coefficient between wheel and roller.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">The mounting assembly further comprises a top part 261 having first fastening elements 260 a-d. These first fastening elements are a projecting plate 260a, a threaded bolt or stud 260b extending from the projecting plate 260a, a washer plate 260c through which the stud 260b extends, and a nut 260d having an inner thread engaging the outer thread of the stud 260b. The stud 260b has a length allowing to extend through a complementary attachment component at a bicycle frame, wherein the nut 260d and the washer 260c are adapted to mount the first fastening elements to the complementary attachment component of a bicycle frame. A damper element can be provided as a pad or sheet of elastic material below the washer plate 260c, above the projecting plate 260a, or a combination thereof. Such a damper element can be combined with damper elements at the mounting shaft (i.e. at the stator). In addition a damper element can be provided at the arm 250, for example as an elastic support at the pivot point 252. In particular, the damper element can be combined with the pivot bearing 252', for example as an elastic support receiving the pivot bearing 252'.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56978723"
