In order to meet the increasing capacity requirement for the next generation systems, as specified by International Telecommunications Union - Radio Communication Sector (ITU-R), the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is now evolving the current Long Term Evolution (LTE) system towards the advanced version, the so called "LTE-Advanced".</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">LTE-Advanced requires a bandwidth of up to 100MHz, which is much wider than 20MHz of the current LTE system. The current spectrum utilization pattern excludes the possibility of assigning a contiguous wideband. Therefore, carrier aggregation (CA) of individual component carriers (CCs) has been proposed. This leads to a multi-carrier transmission system. In order to maintain backward compatibility, independent layer-1 (physical layer) transmission can be used, which is in coherence with the LTE Rel'8 assumptions on each CC, as proposed e.g. in <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>3GPP TR 36.814 v1.0.0, "Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Further advancements for E-UTRA Physical layer aspects," February, 2009</text></nplcit>.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">With independent layer-1 transmission on each CC, feedback of a channel quality information (e.g. Channel Quality Indicator (CQI)) and an acknowledgement e.g. Ack/Nack) per CC may be required, as proposed e.g. in <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>3GPP TS<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> 36.213 v8.6.0, "Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Physical layer procedures," March, 2009</text></nplcit>.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, such uplink signaling may contribute to a large amount of transmission overhead. Moreover, when multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission is used, the overhead is further increased because of the requirement for signaling additional control information (e.g. a Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI) and/or a Rank Indication (RI). In addition to inefficiency caused by heave uplink overhead, some cell-edge users that are power limited cannot support the uplink transmission over multiple CCs and will thus be in an outage situation. A problem is basically how to achieve better downlink performance for a multi-carrier system, while still trying to limit the uplink feedback overhead from CQI and Ack/Nack's.

Indeed, the invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be constructed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Although the specification may refer to "an", "one", or "some" embodiment(s) in several locations, this does not necessarily mean that each such reference is to the same embodiment(s), or that the feature only applies to a single embodiment. Single features of different embodiments may also be combined to provide other embodiments. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention is applicable to any base station device, access device, server device, corresponding component, and/or to any communication system or any combination of different communication systems that support component carriers or multiple carriers. The communication system may be a fixed communication system or a wireless communication system or a communication system utilizing both fixed networks and wireless networks. The protocols used, the specifications of communication systems, servers and user terminals, especially in wireless communication, develop rapidly. Such development may require extra changes to an embodiment. Therefore, all words and expressions should be interpreted broadly and they are intended to illustrate, not to restrict, the embodiment.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the following, different embodiments will be described using, as an example of a system architecture whereto the embodiments may be applied, an architecture based on an LTE-Advanced network without restricting the embodiment to such architecture, however.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A general architecture of a communication system providing an example of an environment where the present solution may be used, is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> which shows a simplified system architecture. It is apparent to a person skilled in the art that the communication system may also comprise other functions and structures. It should be appreciated that functions, structures, elements and protocols used in or for group communication, may be irrelevant to the actual invention. Therefore, those need not to be discussed in more detail here.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a communication system 100 comprises a user equipment (UE) 20 which may be e.g. a mobile or wireless user terminal, such as a mobile phone (mobile station), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a game console, a smart phone, a personal computer (PC), a laptop, a desktop computer or the like, capable of receiving/transmitting component carrier signalling. The communication system 100 further comprises an access network (such as an<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> evolved UMTS terrestrial radio access network of an enhanced cellular network (E-UTRAN)) which can be accessed via a network node or a component, such as a base station (enhanced Node B (eNB), E-UTRAN node B, eNodeB) 10, capable of transmitting/receiving component carrier signaling. Here it is assumed that the user equipment (UE) 20 is capable of communicating with the base station 10 by utilizing an air interface (also referred to as a radio interface). Respective arrows are depicted to indicate uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) directions. Transmission may be based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) as a modulation scheme to communicate data between a signal source, such as the base station 10, and a subscriber station, such as the UE 20. OFDM enables communication of a large amount of data over a limited bandwidth by allocating the data among multiple smaller sub-signals, and then simultaneously transmitting the sub-signals using different sub-carriers.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Although discussed as a primary example herein, the present solution is not limited to E-UTRAN, LTE, and/or 3GPP systems. Thus, the present solution may also be applicable to other communications systems such as WiMAX (worldwide interoperability for microwave access) and/or WLAN (wireless local area network) and/or other multi-carrier systems.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> shows a schematic flow diagram of a transmission chain for aggregated bandwidth, where a total system bandwidth or maximum bandwidth MB contains a set of component carriers CC1, CC2, ...CCN. The component carriers CC1, CC2, ...CCN may be next to each other (i.e. forming a single contiguous system bandwidth), or they may be arranged to have a carrier frequency spacing significantly larger than their individual bandwidths. Supposedly, LTE-Advanced in 3GPP is going to assume carrier aggregation to form bandwidths of up to 100 MHz by having aggregation of 5 CCs of 20 MHz each. Those CCs may be contiguous or non-contiguous.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, individual transport blocks of a transmission signal, which may be obtained from higher protocol layers (e.g. Medium Access Control (MAC) layer) can be forwarded on different CCs, are segmented into code blocks. Each code block is subjected to channel coding (e.g. turbo coding) and an error code (e.g. cyclic redundancy code (CRC)) can be added. Then, the enhanced code blocks are modulated (e.g. quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (16QAM) or 64QAM) and subjected to layer mapping for transmit diversity, to spatial multiplexing, and to<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> precoding. Finally, the resulting code blocks are mapped onto physical resource blocks (RB), which may be a subset of OFDM symbols or subcarriers. For extended or aggregated bandwidth, this structure is copied for each CC to provide frequency domain link adaptation on CC basis and better retransmission performance for wide bandwidth.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As LTE-Advanced should be backwards compatible, it is advantageous to have a DL radio resource management (RRM) framework, where independent transport blocks are transmitted on different CCs. This means that different modulation and coding schemes (MCS) may be used on different CCs, although transmitted to the same user. In order to facilitate such schemes with efficient frequency domain link adaptation scheduling, user terminals may provide frequency selective CQI feedback. In order to have a reasonable UL CQI overhead, new CQI reporting schemes may be used when the system bandwidth is extended from 20 MHz (which is the maximum bandwidth for LTE Rel'8) to 100 MHz.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">A proposed enhanced CQI compression scheme for LTE-advanced using multiple CCs has a relatively low uplink (UL) signalling overhead, and at the same time provides sufficient information to the base station for performing an efficient frequency domain link adaptation and scheduling. To achieve this, the UE monitors a set of different CC signals transmitted, e.g. in a message, from a serving base station. The monitored set may include all CC frequencies in the total system bandwidth MB, or it may be reduced to only include a sub-set of the available CC frequencies. Information on the configuration of the monitored set may be provided from the base station to the UE by using higher layer signalling. The base station only uses the monitored set of component carriers for scheduling user data. The UE can be arranged to identify the best CC among those in the monitored set. The identification of the best CC may be based on (but is not limited to) average signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) measurements per CC, or it may also be based on reference signal received quality (RSRQ) measurements. In LTE, the UE monitors so-called reference symbol (RS) signals when estimating CQI. For example, the best CC may be identified as the one with the highest SINR. SINR may be best when measuring the signals on the different CCs on the RS. A frequency selective CQI report may then be transmitted to the base station serving the UE, wherein the report may include e.g. identification information and channel quality information on the best CC. This kind of reporting may be carried out according to a so-called average best-M scheme, or it may include full CQI reporting for<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> individual sub-bands of k contiguous physical resource blocks (PRB), as well as a wideband CQI measure for the CC. In addition to sending the detailed CQI report reporting the best CC within the monitored set, the UE may also be arranged to transmit information expressing an average channel quality of the remaining worse CCs. Such information may be sent by having individual wideband CQI reports for the worse CCs, or by expressing the relative wideband CQI of the worse CCs compared to the wideband quality of the best CC. Thus, the base station receives detailed frequency selective channel quality information on the best CC, and may performs a frequency domain link adaptation and scheduling of resource blocks for the UE on the basis of the received CQI report. In cases where a much larger transmission bandwidth than a single CC is needed for the UE, it may be sufficient to know the average channel quality of the CCs, as in that case the base station anyway schedules the UE over large bandwidths.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The above CQI compression scheme has a clear advantage that it results in a tolerable size of the CQI reporting in the UL direction for multi-carrier systems, such as LTE-Advanced, while still providing the required information for the system to benefit from frequency domain link adaptation and scheduling. The CQI word size of the proposed scheme can be made significantly smaller than the CQI word size of scheme where the detailed CQI report is simply repeated for each component carrier. The UE may automatically adjust its reporting scheme according to the experienced channel conditions. That is, in case the channel coherence bandwidth is high (and multiple CCs are seen as "good"), the UE would do the reporting of the multiple CCs at lower resolution in the frequency domain. In cases where the channel coherence bandwidth is low, there would not be much sense in reporting with low granularity, and the UE would simply be reporting using the single-CC reporting.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Wireless digital communication always suffers from errors introduced by the channel. Error correction can be based on retransmissions e.g. by automatic repeat request schemes (ARQ). Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) is a variation of the ARQ error-control method. In standard ARQ, error-detection information bits are added to data to be transmitted (such as CRC). In HARQ, forward error correction (FEC) bits are also added to the existing error detection bits (such as Reed-Solomon code or Turbo code). As a result HARQ performs better than ordinary ARQ in poor signal conditions, but in its simplest form this comes at the expense of significantly lower throughput in good signal conditions.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Assuming a cell with multiple CCs, the base station has the freedom to schedule each LTE-Advanced user on multiple CCs. The transmission on each CC can have its own transport block and modulation and coding scheme. The default assumption may be that one Ack/Nack is sent in the UL direction for each transport block in the DL direction. Thus, scheduling a user on multiple CCs results in larger uplink overhead as more Ack/Nack's are sent. Similarly, in order to achieve the highest possible downlink frequency domain packet scheduling (FDPS gain), detailed frequency selection CQI information will have to be sent in the uplink for all CCs.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The overhead resulting from multiple Ack/Nack transmissions can be reduced by using uplink hybrid ARQ (HARQ) bundling. Here, only a single positive or negative acknowledgement (Ack/Nack) is sent in the UL direction, and a positive acknowledgement (Ack) is only sent if all transport blocks are received correctly.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">However, a penalty of using the above two CQI and HARQ compression techniques when scheduling users on multiple CCs is a drop in downlink performance.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In order to further optimize the system performance, it is proposed to decide per user which feedback overhead reduction technique(s) to use, and - as a further option - how to correspondingly modify the downlink packet scheduler to guarantee fairness and good cell-edge performance.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> shows a schematic block diagram of those components which are useful to describe an embodiment of the present invention. These components may be provided in a network node or a component, such as a base station (enhanced Node B (eNB), E-UTRAN node B, eNodeB) or other wireless network access device, capable of transmitting/receiving component carrier signalling. Such components can be, for example, integrated as a chip or chip set of the base station.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The exemplary components or blocks shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> comprise a radio frequency (RF) stage 12, user determination function or unit 13 (i.e. user categorizer or user categorizing means), an optional conventional scheduling function or unit (LTE-S) 14 (e.g. for conventional LTE users in the present embodiment), and an advanced scheduling function or unit (LTE-Adv-S) 15 (e.g. for LTE-Advanced user in the present embodiment). An UL signal received via the RF<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> stage 12 is supplied to the user determination function or unit 13 in order to discriminate whether the received UL signal belongs to a conventional user whose transmission is scheduled by the conventional scheduling function or unit 14 (i.e. conventional scheduler or scheduling means) or to an advanced user whose transmission is scheduled by the advanced scheduling function or unit 15 (i.e. advanced scheduler or scheduling means).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">According to an embodiment, the advanced scheduling function or unit 15 is arranged to decide for each user (which has been determined by the user determination function or unit 13 as an advanced user) individually based on received path loss measurements (or other signal or transmission quality indicators) if CQI compression and/or HARQ bundling shall be enabled, and whether the user is scheduled on single or multiple CCs. These path loss measurements can be detected and categorized by a path loss detection function or unit (PLD) 151 (i.e. channel categorizer or channel categorizing means) provided in or at the advanced scheduling function or unit 15 and arranged to trigger or activate different scheduling functions or units 152-1 to 152-3 which are then selected by the advanced scheduling function or unit 15 in response to the channel categorization output. Thereby, users with high experienced path loss can be scheduled to use a feedback compression technique such as cross CC CQI compression controlled by a CQI compression control function or unit (CQI-C) 152-2 and/or a feedback bundling technique such as HARQ bundling controlled by a HARQ bundling control function or unit (HARQ-B) 152-3, as those are the users likely to experience UL coverage limitations. Users at the very cell-edge (i.e. with path loss larger than a first threshold TS1) are best served by only scheduling them on a single CC con-trolled by a single CC control function or unit (SCC) 152-1. Thereby, low feedback signalling overhead can be achieved also.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As an additional option, respective weight selector function or units 153-1 to 153-3 (i.e. weighting means) may be provided to introduce an individual weighting based on the decided scheduling functions. In order to maintain fairness and good cell-edge performance, users scheduled only on a single CC, may have their scheduling metric weighted by a first weight selector function or unit 153-1 with β1, which is a value larger than 1. Weighting of the scheduling metric with β1 basically results in giving the user larger priority when assigning transmission resources to the user. Similarly, users with cross CC CQI compression and HARQ bundling also have their scheduling metric weighted by respective first and second weight selection functions or units 153-2 and 153-3<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> with β2 and β3, respectively, to compensate for potential loss from using uplink compression techniques.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">It is noted that the functions or units indicated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> can be implemented as discrete hardware circuits or as processing functions controlled by a processor or central processing unit (CPU) provided in the base station.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> shows a flow diagram of an enhanced scheduling procedure according to an embodiment. The selected individual scheduling functions may operate in different protocol layers and offer different levels of overhead reduction and/or protection.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">When a new user arrives, the procedure first categorizes the user in step S100 according to the terminal type, i.e. a LTE-Advanced terminal or a conventional LTE terminal (e.g. LTE Rel'8 terminal). The conventional LTE user supports the transmission on only one CC and the base station (e.g. the conventional scheduling function or unit 14 of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>) needs to select a proper CC, and assign it to the user (step S110). Then, in step S111, a weight scheduling metric by β1 is applied. Finally, in step S112, an independent layer-1 transmission is initiated per CC.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">If the user is determined in step S101 as an LTE-Advanced user, it can potentially be scheduled on all available CCs. Therefore, user quality or transmission quality is checked in step S102. According to the user quality (in the present embodiment, the path loss value to the user's serving base station is used as a quality indicator), a LTE-Advanced user will be assigned in step S103 to all CCs if it is determined in step S102 that its measured path loss is higher than a first threshold TS1. Otherwise, it will be assigned to only one CC in step S110. The selection of CC to those users with poor channel quality could be done in such a way that the load across the multiple CCs is balanced.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In order for the users that have only one CC to get comparable amount of resource as those with multiple CCs, their scheduling priority could be increased. This is done in step S111 by weighting the scheduling metric with a factor β1.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">For LTE-Advanced users that are scheduled in step S103 onto multiple CCs, the measured path loss is checked again in step S104. If it is determined that their path loss values lie above a second threshold TS2, their CQI feedback is controlled to be compressed (step S105). CQI compression may be performed by calculating a wideband CQI for each user on all CCs. Then, for the CC with the highest wideband CQI value, both the wideband CQI and the frequency<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> selective CQI values can be fed back. This means, one CQI value is signaled for each PRB group. According to the 3GPP specification, each PRB is constituted with 12 consecutive sub-carriers, and one PRB group contains 3 neighboring PRBs. For the remaining CCs with low wideband CQI, only one CQI value is fed back per CC, which is the wideband CQI.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In step S106, the scheduling priority for the users with CQI compression is increased by weighting the scheduling metric by β2 in order for fair completion of resources with those who have full CQI knowledge.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">For those LTE-Advanced users whose path loss values were less or equal the second threshold TS2, the measured path loss is checked again in step S107. If it is determined in step S107 that their path loss values lie above a third threshold TS3, adaptive HARQ bundling is applied in step S108, so that multiple Ack/Nacks are bundled into one Ack/Nack signal for users with poor path loss. For the remaining users with path loss values below the third threshold TS3, independent Ack/Nack feedback per CC is assumed. For the same reason of preventing the cell-edge users from a reduced downlink throughput, HARQ bundling could again be performed together with increased scheduling priority by weighting the scheduling metric by β3 in step S109. Finally, the flow proceeds to step S112 where an independent layer-1 transmission is initiated per CC.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">After having described the feedback reduction techniques, the problem of how to improve the scheduling priority for cell-edge users by weighting their scheduling metric is described. The packet scheduler used in layer-2 may apply a Proportional Fair (PF) approach, which corresponds to a channel aware scheduler. On each CC, it assigns resource to a user that maximizes the metric: <maths id="math0001" num="(1)"><math display="block"><msub><mi>k</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><munder><mi>arg max</mi><mi>k</mi></munder><mfenced open="{" close="}"><msub><mi mathvariant="italic">Metric</mi><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></mfenced></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="119" he="13" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> where k<sub>i,j</sub> is the selected user on the i<sup>th</sup> CC at the j<sup>th</sup> PRB group.

When users are assigned with different number of CCs, the independent packet scheduling per CC gives poor coverage performance. A solution to improve the coverage is to use the user throughput over all CCs in the denominator of equation 2. Furthermore, by weighting the scheduling metric with a factor β<i><sub>x</sub></i> (<i>x</i>∈ [1,2,3]), the scheduling priority for the cell-edge users with uplink overhead or outage reduction can be increased, and the new scheduling metric can be calculated as: <maths id="math0003" num="(3)"><math display="block"><msub><mi mathvariant="italic">Metric</mi><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>R</mi><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mrow><mstyle displaystyle="true"><munderover><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>N</mi></munderover></mstyle><msub><mover><mi>R</mi><mo>˜</mo></mover><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mfrac><mo>*</mo><mstyle displaystyle="true"><munderover><mo>∏</mo><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mn>3</mn></munderover></mstyle><msubsup><mi>β</mi><mi>x</mi><msub><mi>l</mi><mi>x</mi></msub></msubsup></math><img id="ib0003" file="imgb0003.tif" wi="134" he="24" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In equation 3, β<sub>x</sub> is the scaling factor for the proposed technique. I<sub>x</sub> equals 1 if the corresponding technique is used. Otherwise, it has the value of 0. N is the number of aggregated CCs in the system. It is noted that, it may not be necessary to switch on all the proposed techniques at the same time. Based on the trade-off between downlink performance and overhead or outage reduction, enabling of one or two of the proposed scheduling techniques may be enough.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">As can be gathered from <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>, two different path loss thresholds (TS2 and TS3) are used for deciding when CQI compression and HARQ bundling shall be enabled. The reason for proposing this solution is because the largest reduction in uplink signalling overhead is achieved via CQI compression, while at the same time it results in larger penalty of the downlink performance. On the contrary, using HARQ bundling leads to a smaller reduction of uplink signaling overhead, with only marginal loss in downlink performance. Hence, it makes sense to first use HARQ bundling for the coverage protection, then use cross CC CQI compression if a user's path loss is so high that HARQ bundling fails to provide the desired protection. For the users with extremely high path loss values, they should be scheduled with only one CC, so that the uplink overhead and transmit power is minimized.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In the proposed procedure of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>, TS1, TS2, and TS3 are path loss threshold parameters. Those parameters could be operator controlled, e.g. configured to a fixed value. Or they could be slowly adapted to further optimize the system<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> performance (e.g. using a self optimization scheme for dynamically tuning the settings of these parameters).</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Similarly, β1, β2, and β3 are scheduling metric scheduling parameters. Those parameters could either be fixed, or adaptively adjusted on a time-scale much slower that packet scheduling.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In the following, the amount of overhead required for the CQI and Ack/Nack feedback with the proposed techniques is quantified. Only single stream transmission is assumed, so that no PMI or RI feedback is required. The CQI reporting is assumed to be carried out periodically with a feedback interval of every 5 transmission time intervals (TTIs), whereas the Ack/Nack is assumed to be sent out every TTI.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The CQI reporting mode is assumed to be Mode 3-0 according to 3GPP specification TS 36.213 v8.6.0, which specifies that for each CC, the feedback should contain the wideband CQI value plus the selective CQI reporting for each sub-band. One sub-band contains k consecutive PRBs.

However, a further increase of β beyond a certain level (around 2.0∼2.5) will actually decrease the coverage performance. The reason is that increasing the weighting factor will cause the poor users to be scheduled even if their channel quality is poor. It thereby decreases the frequency domain packet scheduling gain as the diversity is not fully exploited. When the loss in frequency domain diversity is larger than the gain in additional transmission resources, even the coverage performance will decrease.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0050" num="0050"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5</figref> shows a schematic block diagram of an alternative software-based embodiment of the proposed functionalities at the base station.
