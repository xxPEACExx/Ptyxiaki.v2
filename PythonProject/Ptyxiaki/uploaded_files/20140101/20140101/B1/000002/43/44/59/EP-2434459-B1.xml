These symmetric components may be incorporated and/or interspersed in various areas and aspects of a geometric model. Individual symmetric components include and display a commonality in shape and structure whereby aspects and elements are repeated throughout the geometric model. Known symmetries or symmetrical relationships include reflective symmetry, duplication symmetry, and scaling symmetry. Reflective symmetry describes a symmetrical relationship where the geometry of a first component is the same size and shape as the geometry of a second component but is mirrored and/or reversed about an axis. Duplication symmetry describes a symmetrical relationship where the geometry of a component is repeated, but the orientation and position of the component is different for each instance or copy. Scaling symmetry refers to geometries that have the same elements and topology but are a different size from one another. These known symmetries or symmetrical relationships often occur within different portions or areas of a geometric model.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Known editing and/or interactive modeling systems do not track or monitor symmetries or symmetrical relationships automatically which, in turn, often results in additional editing and modeling effort to generate each geometric model.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6323879B"><text>US 6323879</text></patcit> discloses options for linking objects to be edited, one option in which changes to one object does not alter the other, another in which a change to either object reflects the same change in the other object and a final option in which a change in one object changes the other but a change in the other is not reflected in the first object.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">The systems and methods disclosed and discussed in this patent document provides an automated and/or user controlled mechanism for identifying, manipulating and managing symmetry relationships in a three-dimensional (3-D) graphical model.

The prototype may be a randomly selected instance of the object, the first instance of the object, a user-designated instance of the object, or any other identifiable one of the objects sharing a common symmetry. The prototype and the identified objects are linked or otherwise connected to update and change the features or elements of each object in order to maintain the common symmetry. The objects may each be subject to a differentiation function that incudes one or more parameters associated with the object. For example, the parameters may include the X, Y and/or Z translation of the object from a fixed point or a relative point defined with respect to the prototype. The parameters may further include a scaling function or value, an orientation, and/or a reflection value relative to the prototype. In other configurations, the parameters could include physical and lighting characteristics of the object such as mass, material, surface roughness, color, reflectivity, transparency and the like.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The disclosed systems and methods further provide for defining a geometry mask that may be utilized to filter a portion or section of a symmetry<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> object to prevent propagation of changes made within the filtered portion to the remaining linked objects. The geometry mask may define a regular or irregular boundary through the symmetry object. The portion of the symmetry object within the outside boundary are maintained in symmetry while the portion outside or within the boundary may be configured locally and customized as desired.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a layout and configuration for a generalized computer system 100, such as a computer aided design (CAD) workstation, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet computer, a smartphone, a computer, a server, or any of the other computing devices referenced herein.

In a particular embodiment, the computer system 100 may be implemented using electronic devices that provide voice, video and/or data communication. Further, while a single computer system 100 may be illustrated,<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the term "system" shall also be taken to include any collection of systems or subsystems that individually or jointly execute a set, or multiple sets, of processor-executable instructions to perform one or more functions via the network.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the computer system 100 includes a processor 102, such as, a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics-processing unit (GPU), or both.

The present disclosure may be considered to include any one or more of a computer-readable medium, other equivalents and successor media, in which data or instructions may be stored.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In other embodiments, dedicated hardware implementations, such as application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), programmable logic arrays and other hardware devices, may be constructed to implement one or more of the methods described herein. Applications that include the apparatus and systems of various embodiments may broadly include a variety of electronic and computer systems. One or more embodiments described herein may implement functions using two or more specific interconnected hardware modules or devices with related control and data signals that may be communicated between and through the modules, or as portions of an application-specific integrated circuit. Accordingly, the present system may encompass software, firmware, and hardware means for implementing and utilizing the teaching and disclosure presented and discussed herein.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a functional block diagram of processor-executable instructions configured to implement the symmetry module 200. The symmetry module 200 includes, in this exemplary embodiment, an identification and analysis module 202, a linking and maintenance module 204, a symmetry table 206, and a differentiation engine 208 that includes one or more parameters 210.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In this exemplary embodiment, the symmetry module 200 utilizes the identification and analysis module 202 to scan or evaluate a base object or prototype within the model in order to automatically identify a symmetry relationship between one or more objects and the prototype. Alternatively, the symmetry module 200 may utilize the identification and analysis module 202 to prompt the user to manually identify objects on which to infer a symmetry<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> relationship amongst one another or with a base object or prototype. In yet another embodiment, the identification and analysis module 202 may prompt the user to identify or correlate a symmetry relationship of one of the identified objects with the prototype. In another embodiment, the identification and analysis module 202 may prompt the user to create a first instance of the object.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">For example, the processor 102 implements and executes the symmetry module portion of the instructions 124 to facilitate the analysis and evaluation of a 3-D model including one or more prototypes, such as the three-dimensional sphere 300 shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref>. The sphere 300 is a basic geometric shape that displays or possesses symmetry across its entire structure. Thus, any given section of the sphere 300 through its center will be symmetric to any of the remaining sections. As used herein, symmetry describes any object or objects that are instances of an original base object or prototype. Symmetry objects are not required to be simple copies of the base or prototype object; rather, symmetry objects may differ from the base object or prototype as directed by a differentiation engine 208 stored and/or operable within the symmetry module 200.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The differentiation engine 208 utilizes a differentiation function to control the properties and presentation of the symmetry objects associated with the prototype. In this exemplary embodiment, the differentiation function is parameterized, which allows each instance or representation of the symmetry object (e.g., the sphere 302 in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3B</figref> and sphere 310 in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3C</figref>) to be modified by a different set or group of parameters 210. For example, the differentiation engine 208 may define a repeated or arrayed object that can be differentiated based on a single parameter, such as a translated position on the X-axis relative to the prototype. In other embodiments, the differentiation engine 208 may utilize one or more parameters 210 to distinguish and customize a symmetry object with respect to the prototype. The parameters 210 may be part of the differentiation engine 208 or may be stored in the memory 204 and accessible via the processor 102. The parameters 210 may include and/or differentiate the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> symmetry object from the prototype based on, for example, position, orientation, scaling, and reflection.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The linking and maintenance module 204 may utilize or cooperate with the symmetry table 206 to list and identify each of the prototypes and their identified symmetry objects. <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example of information and parameters 210 that may be stored in the symmetry table 206. For example, figure identification (Figure ID) 01 may be a unique object identification that represents the sphere 300. In this example, the sphere 300 is assumed to be the prototype or base object. Accordingly, the parameters 210 utilized by the differentiation engine 208 may be null values. In particular, the X, Y and Z translation may be assumed to be zero (0), the scale may be set to equal 1 and the overall orientation angle may be 0. Similarly, because the sphere 300, in the present example, is the prototype; there are no cross-references or boundary/geometry masks defined. A boundary/geometry mask operates as a filter to sallow portions of the object highlighted by the filter to be customized without replicating those changes to other linked objects or the prototype.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">For example, <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3B</figref> may correspond to Figure ID 31 listed in the symmetry table 206. In this embodiment, the symmetry object 302 is cross-referenced to the sphere 300. Specifically, the symmetry table 206 indicates that the Figure ID 31 is cross-referenced to Figure ID 01. These identifications may be automatically generated by the symmetry module 200 or may be defined by the user. The symmetry object 302 may, in this example, be associated with parameters 210 that indicate a Y-translation of 25 and a scale of 0.5. The parameters 210 may indicate that the symmetry object 302 is translated along the Y-axis 25 pixels, millimeters or any other distance unit. The translation may be relative to the prototype sphere 300 or may be relative to a fixed point within the model space. The parameters 210 may further indicate that the symmetry object 302 is scaled or decreased by a factor of 0.5 (i.e., the symmetry object 302 is 50% of the size of the prototype sphere 300.)<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3B</figref> and symmetry table 206 further indicate a geometry mask 304 cooperates with the symmetry object 302. In this embodiment, the geometry mask 304 is a vertical plane that bisects the sphere represented by the symmetry object 302. The geometry mask 304 defines and establishes a boundary having an inner boundary 306 and an outer boundary 308. The portion or elements of the symmetry object 302 that are within the inner boundary 306 of the geometry mask 304 are linked to the prototype sphere 300. The portion or elements of the symmetry object 302 within the outer boundary 308 are unlinked from the prototype. Besides using a geometric function, such as a plane, to establish the boundary, the symmetry table may list the elements of the instantiated geometry that constitute the border. For <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3B</figref>, the points and arcs constituting the copied portion of the sphere 302 may be associated with the corresponding elements of the prototype. Similarly, the boundary may be defined by listing the elements that are members of the border, marking elements as either out or in. The portion or elements of the symmetry object 302 within the outer boundary 308 may be considered local customizations of the object. Thus, the portions of the object that are not contained by the inner boundary 306 may be manipulated and altered without effecting the any of the linked or cross-referenced objects indicated in the symmetry table 206.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The geometry mask may, in other embodiments, be either a regular or irregular shaped area or construct that encompasses the element or portion of the symmetry object 302 to be customized. The geometry mask allows for local customization that: (1) does not propagate to linked or cross-referenced symmetry objects and prototype; and (2) can exceed or encompass elements not specified by the differentiation function utilized by the differentiation engine 208. In this way, the geometry mask provides additional flexibility and local customization options for each instance of an object utilized within the 3-D model.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3C</figref> may correspond to Figure ID 97 listed in the symmetry table 206. In this example, the symmetry object 310 is an instance of the sphere 300<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> that, in turn, includes a plurality of additional instances 312 to 318 based on the prototype sphere 300. In particular, the plurality of additional instances 312 to 318 represent symmetry objects arrayed around the surface 310a of the sphere 300. The arrangement or array of each instance 312 to 318 based on the sphere 300 may be uniquely specified by, for example, the X, Y and Z translations associated with each instance. Alternatively, the array may be specified utilizing a common distance such as, for example a radius R, in conjunction with one or more angles 320a to 320c. In this way, the plurality of symmetry objects or instances 312 to 318 may each be individually defined by the parameters 210 and cross-referenced to the prototype (Figure ID 01). Alternatively, the symmetry table 206 may include a nested entry that individually ties each of the symmetry objects 312 to 318 to the instance of symmetry object 310. In this case, the translations, orientations and scale may be relative to the symmetry object 310. In some cases, it is not necessary to create an intermediate prototype geometry when new instances are created from an instanced object. Each of the symmetry objects 312 to 318, in the present example, are cross-referenced to the prototype (i.e., sphere 300) as opposed to the instance of the symmetry object 310 because the elements of objects 312 to 318 are symmetric to the elements of 300. If the object 310 were modified in some manner such that it was no longer symmetric to object 300, then objects 312 to 318 would have to reference 310 specifically because of its local changes. In this manner, the processing and data handling of the processor 102 and instructions 124 can be enhanced because chains of prototypes are not created when not needed; rather, each linked instance of a symmetry object is associated with the most common base object or prototype that can serve.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In other embodiments, the symmetry objects 310 to 318 are different than the base on which the symmetry objects are placed. For example, a box or other shaped object is used and the symmetry objects 310 to 318 are positioned on the base of a different shape than the symmetry objects 310 to 318<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> themselves. In yet other embodiments, the symmetry objects 310 to 318 are defined in an arbitrary space or without reference to a base object.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The linking and maintenance module 204 is further configured to establish the cross-reference between symmetry objects and maintain the symmetry there between. For example, if a user modifies the symmetry object 314 shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3C</figref>, then each cross-referenced and linked symmetry object 300, 302, 310, 312, 316 and 318 will be similarly modified by the linking and maintenance module 204 in order to maintain the common symmetry. It should be noted that the modification of the symmetry object 314 results in a modification of the base object or prototype (i.e., the sphere 300 shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref>). The modification of the base object or prototype, in turn, effects and updates each of the linked symmetry objects cross-referenced and specified in the symmetry table 206. When an instance object is used to modify the prototype from which it derives, the recursive definition can be resolved by eliminating the final instance's link. For example, in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3C</figref>, if sphere 312 is merged with sphere 310, then sphere 300 will likewise gain a new merged sphere in a similar location. The modification to 300 will affect spheres 314, 316, and 318 but not 312. Because 310 and 312 are both instances of 300, one must lose its inheritance. The linking and maintenance module can use different criteria to choose which link to break such as using the last created object or allowing the user to choose. The link may either be broken entirely or broken implicitly by changing instance's geometry mask so that the modified portion is outside the boundary.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The linking and maintenance module 204 may further store one or more geometric or geometry masks for each instance of the symmetry objects identified in the 3-D model. In operation, if the linking and maintenance module 204 detects a change in a portion of the symmetry object contained within the outer boundary 308, then the linking and maintenance module 204 will not modify the base or prototype. Similarly, if the linking and maintenance module 204 detects a change to one or more of the parameters associated with the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> differentiation function 208, then the linking and maintenance module 204 changes the parameter for that instance of the symmetry model but does not update the base or prototype.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">When the change is one that can be propagated back to the prototype, the linking and maintenance module 204 modifies the prototype object. The modification of the prototype object results in an update and modification of each of the cross-referenced symmetry objects identified in the symmetry table 206. The linking and maintenance module 204 subsequently re-applies the individual differentiation functions to each of the cross-referenced symmetry objects to restore the localized changes indicated by the stored parameters 210.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The symmetry module 200 may prompt, via the display 126, the user to accept the change. The user may, in turn, accept the proposed change or direct the symmetry module 200 to sever the link between the object and the prototype. If the symmetry module 200 is directed to sever the link between the objects, the prototype is returned to the state or configuration prior to the initial change. Links are automatically severed when a modification involves multiple instances of the same prototype such that applying the differentiation would cause a loop. The user may also choose to sever a link before modification to direct the symmetry module to a desired configuration.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Upon severance of the link between the object and the prototype, the linking and maintenance module 204 can delete or remove the geometry mask associated with the object. Alternatively, if the linking and maintenance module 204 determines that the geometry mask encompasses the entire object (i.e., if no part of the prototype remains a part of the symmetry object), the link between the object and the prototype may be automatically severed and the cross-reference removed from the symmetry table 206. In this way, the geometry mask may be manually configured to encompass the object and thereby sever the relationship between the object and the prototype.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart 500 illustrating an exemplary operation of the symmetry module 200 implemented according to the teaching and disclosure<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> provided herein. In one embodiment, the symmetry module 200 may be implemented as a part of the design and definition process of a three-dimensional model on, for example, a computer aided design (CAD) workstation that includes the computer system 100 (502). The symmetry module 200 may automatically, or in response to a command provided by the user, scan or otherwise detects a first object or prototype that can provide the basis upon which a symmetry relationship may be established (504). In one embodiment, the user may specifically identify the first object or prototype from elements or components present within the three-dimensional model. In another embodiment, the user may select or indicate the first object or prototype from a list of elements or components compiled by the symmetry module 200. In yet another embodiment, the user creates the first object.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The symmetry module 200 next identifies, either manually or automatically, a second object or instance that possesses the same symmetry as the first object or prototype (506). This common symmetry between the prototype and one or more objects within the three-dimension model provides the basis for the symmetry relationship. Alternatively, the user causes the creation of the symmetric object from the first object. The symmetry module 200 may next utilize the identification and analysis module 202 to determine a differentiation function applicable and/or associated with the identified second object. The differentiation function defines one or more parameters 210 such as, for example, the translation, scale, orientation that may be applied to the second object by the differentiation engine 208 (508).</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The identified and parameterized objects can, at this point, be linked or cross-referenced by the identification and analysis module 202 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>) and stored in the symmetry table 206 (510). Once the first and second objects are linked, changes or customizations made to any one of the objects are propagated to each of the remaining objects to maintain the symmetry relationship. The extent of the linkage is determined by the shape and<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> configuration of the geometry mask defining a boundary around elements or components of each object.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">After defining the symmetry relationship between the objects and elements in the model, the symmetry module 200 loops or waits until a change in one of the linked objects is detected (512). Upon detection of a change or customization to one of the objects, the symmetry module 200 determines if the change occurred in the inner boundary 306 or outer boundary 308 defined with respect to the geometry mask 304. If the change occurred in the outer boundary 308, the change is defined as a local customization and the symmetry module 308 re-enters (see 512) the detection loop (514). A local customization represents a change or modification that is not propagated between each of the cross-referenced and linked objects. However, if the change occurred in the inner boundary 306, the change is propagated throughout the linked objects (516). The differentiation function can be reapplied to the each of the objects once the change has been propagated through the prototype object (518). The symmetry module 308 upon completion of the propagation and updating process re-enters the detection loop (see 512). By defining each of the objects with reference to a common base object or prototype, any change that affects the prototype will necessarily propagate to update the cross-references symmetry objects. This configuration eliminates the need for individual updates to each of the symmetry objects that, in turn, increases the processing efficiency of the processor 102. Instead, the updated prototype is subjected to the differentiation function by the differentiation engine 208 to return it to a localized condition. In this way, the operation of the computer system 100 and the processor 102 can be efficiently utilized.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
