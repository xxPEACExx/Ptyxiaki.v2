Particularly, the communication device relates to a device that uses one global address as a representative of global IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) addresses, shares and manages the representative global address, and makes a relay between a WEB client located in a global space and a plurality of WEB servers located in a local space. Further, the communication method relates to an address sharing communication procedure in the case of using one global address as a representative of global IPv4 addresses, sharing and managing the representative global address, and making a relay between a WEB client located in a global space and a plurality of WEB servers located in a local space.</p><heading id="h0003">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Generally, when a WEB client uses various applications via an IP network, the WEB client makes a peer-to-peer connection with a WEB server that stores an application via the IP network and communicates therewith in the global space. In such a connection, an IP address is assigned to the WEB server with respect to each application for identification. Further, the WEB server is often mounted for each application that executes program processing. Accordingly, the number of WEB servers is on the increase in the global spaces and the local spaces. The increase raises concerns about the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses. Thus, there is an increasing demand for sharing a single IP address among a plurality of WEB servers.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In order to meet such a demand, a gateway device with a given function incorporates a large-scale data center and uses high-volume memory, and therefore the gateway device with a certain function becomes very expensive. The given function is a NAT (Network Address Translator) function which is proposed in RFC (Request For Comments) 1631 as a means to solve the lack of network addresses.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Specifically, a plurality of WEB servers to which local IP addresses or<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> private IP addresses are assigned are connected to a local network (LAN). Hereinafter, a global IP address and a local IP address are referred to as a global address and a local address, respectively, for simplification. The NAT function communicates with a device that has an external global address by making shared use of a single global address for the respective WEB servers.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A device that performs address translation with use of the NAT function has been proposed. Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2002152260A"><text>2002-152260</text></patcit> discloses a communication device with address translation function and a multimedia communication method, and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2003324482A"><text>2003 - 324482</text></patcit> discloses a gateway device with address translation function and an address translation method of the same.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In such a case, it is desirable to use the gateway device with the given function as described in <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s" url="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2663.html"><text>M.

The gateway device with the given function has a function that terminates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with an HTTP (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol) client, analyzes an HTTP message and transfers it.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Further, IP masquerade or NAPT (Network Address Port Translation) is one of address translation methods. It is a similar function to the above-described NAT, and a different point is that NAPT translates a port number of TCP/UDP (Transmission Control Protocol/User Datagram Protocol) in addition to an IP address. By the translation function, a plurality of communication terminal devices or WEB servers on a LAN (Local Area Network) can establish an Internet connection by the simultaneous shared use of a single IP address.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, it is known that a multimedia application is unable to communicate when using the IP masquerade.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">As described above, communication up to the network layer in a one-to-many connection between a single device connected to a network in the global space and a plurality of devices connected to a network in the private space has been achieved until now. However, it should be noted that the IP masquerade is designed<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> so as to efficiently achieve one-way communication that makes concurrent access from a plurality of devices connected to a network in the local space to a single device connected to a network in the global space. The NAT function only specifies one-to-one address translation between a device in the global space and a device in the private space.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP1793563A1"><text>EP 1 793 563 A1</text></patcit> discloses an apparatus and a method for connecting service located behind a network address translator. There is disclosed an interconnection device for performing network translation and redirecting a request to the destination device. The interconnection device comprises a first interface to a first network a second interface to a second network routing means for routing a packet between the first interface, the second interface and the interconnection device, address translating means for translating a source address of a packet coming from the first network destined to the second network, and translating a destination address of a packet coming from the second network destined to the first network, and means for detecting whether a request from a second device located on the second network is destined to itself or to a first device located on the first network. The interconnection device comprises redirecting means for on detection of a request from the second device to access an application located on the first device, updating said address translation means, and indicating the modified destination address to the second device.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention is defined in the independent claims. The dependent claims define embodiments of invention.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Considering measures to respond to the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, one way is to place WEB servers in the local address space for response. In this case, a WEB client acquires a global address corresponding to FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) from a DNS (Domain Name System) server in advance.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">FQDN is a domain name that specifies a domain name, a sub-domain name, a host name or the like in full on a network, i.e. a TCP/IP network such as the Internet or intranet.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In order to establish communication with a WEB client, a device with a given function (gateway device) is required to have the full TCP information between the WEB client in the global space and WEB servers in the private space, which are connected to a local network.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Further, in the execution of a recent WEB application, there is a high tendency that the WEB application simultaneously establishes several dozen TCP sessions to display one screen. This indicates that, when a request is made from a WEB client in the global space, a plurality of WEB servers in the local space are likely to operate simultaneously in response to the received request.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">However, at the time of executing an application in a WEB server, a WEB client in the global space accesses the global address stored in a host header, namely, transmits an HTTP message having a destination domain name to the gateway device with the given function. At this time, when accessing the application layer, WEB servers are limited to use the port number "80" in the standard specification. Accordingly, the gateway device with the given function is unable to make connections to allow access from a plurality of WEB servers.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The gateway device with the given function receives TCP sessions, sequentially terminates the TCP sessions according to the operation of the WEB<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> application, analyzes or identifies each HTTP message, translates a global address obtained by analysis to a local address, and then transfers the HTTP message to the WEB server having the local address, as specified in the above-mentioned <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>M. Holdrege, "RFC2663- IP Network Address Translator (NAT) Terminology and Consideration</text></nplcit>.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the case of manually operating such a procedure, a WEB client needs to manipulate the gateway device with the given function a plurality of times, and it is forced to perform complicated operation. With the complicated operation, the gateway device with the given function suffers an increase in processing loads such as analysis of received data.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In light of the foregoing, it is desirable to provide a communication device and a communication method of the same which can deal with IPv4 addresses exhaustion, improve the usability of a WEB client, and reduce processing loads.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to the embodiments of the present invention described above, it is possible to provide a communication device which can

EMBODIMENT(S)</heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the appended drawings. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a communication device according to an embodiment of the present invention is characterized by a gateway device. In a gateway device 20, a host table 38 stores a global address and a global port corresponding to a host name of a WEB client, where the same value is set to the global address, a transfer table 36 stores a host name of a WEB client, and a global address, a global port, a local address and a local port corresponding to the host name, where the same value is set to the global address and the same value is set to the local port, and an IP packet analysis unit 34 analyzes a packet 48 from a WEB client, supplies the global address and the global port according to a result of analysis to the WEB client that has made a request to perform HTTP redirection, analyzes the HTTP-redirected global address and global port and a local address and a local port, translates the analyzed address and port and transfers a packet 56 based on the translated address and port. Further, in the IP packet analysis unit 34, a sorting unit 40 determines whether a destination address of the packet supplied from the WEB client has the given value of the global address and the global port provided from a server that has authenticated a host name and sorts the supply destination of the supplied packet, a redirection unit 44 extracts a host name of the destination from the supplied packet 50, searches the host table 38 for the extracted host name, and transmits the global address and the global port acquired by search to the WEB client that has made a request to perform HTTP redirection, and a translation/transfer unit 42 receives a packet 52 from the sorting unit 40, searches the transfer table 36 for a match with the destination global address and the destination global port of the received packet 52, changes the destination global address and the destination global port to a local address of the destination WEB server and a destination local port according to a search result, and transfers the changed packet 56 to the destination WEB server, and, reversely, receives a packet 56 from the WEB server, searches the transfer table 36 for a match with the source local address and the source local port of the received packet 56, changes the source local address and the source local port to a global address of the source WEB server and a source global port according to a search result, and transfers the changed<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> packet 60 to the WEB client. After that, the process after connection establishment is repeated. Because the global address can be thereby shared by a plurality of WEB servers without terminating the TCP connection between the WEB client and the WEB servers, it is possible to improve the usability of the WEB client. Further, because the processing is divided and executed in the redirection unit 44 and the translation/transfer unit 42, it is possible to reduce processing loads in the communication device.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">It should be noted that illustration and description of the part that is not directly relevant to the present invention are omitted. In the following description, a signal is indicated by a reference number of a connection line where it appears.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In this embodiment, the communication device according to the present invention is applied to a gateway device. Although the elements connected to a network are the same as before, the gateway device according to the embodiment only includes an element having a feature to address the above concern, Further, by applying the gateway device according to the embodiment, communication between a plurality of devices in a global space and a plurality of devices in a private space is established. Thus, the connection enables marty-to-many communication.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Basically, a communication device 10 is constructed by an IP network 12 and a local network (LAN) 14 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>. The IP network 12 is a network that communicates by using a global IPv4 address in a global space. The LAN 14 is a network that communicates by using a local address in a private space,</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A DNS server 16, a WEB client group 18 and the gateway device 20 are connected to the IP network 12. On the other hand, the gateway device 20 and a WEB server group 22 are connected to the LAN 14.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The DNS (Domain Name System) server 16 is a computer or server software that associates a format that allows a user to easily understand a host identifier, i.e. a domain name, with a format that allows a computer to easily understand it, i.e. an IP address. When a domain name or an IP address is requested from the WEB client group 18 or the gateway device 20 connected to the IP network 12, the DNS server 16 acquires the IP address in the global space corresponding to the domain name and transmits the acquired information to a device or software that has made a request.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The WEB client group 18 has N number of WEB client functions connected to the IP network 12. Each element of the WEB client group 18 is called a WEB client. The WEB client 24 includes a computer terminal device or a WEB browser. The WEB client 24 may include a plurality of WEB browsers 26 and 28 as software in a personal computer (PC), for example. The WEB client group 18 in this embodiment includes N number of WEB clients 24 and WEB browsers 26 and 28.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The gateway device 20 includes a global interface (IF) unit 30, a local interface (IF) unit 32, the IP packet analysis unit 34, the transfer table 36, and the host table 38. The global interface unit 30 has a function that enables two-way transmission between the gateway device 20 and the global address space. The local interface unit 32 has a function that enables two-way transmission between the gateway device 20 and the local address space.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The IP packet analysis unit 34 includes the sorting unit 40, the translation/transfer unit 42 and the redirection unit 44 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. The IP packet analysis unit 34 has a function that analyzes a packet from the WEB client 24, supplies a global address and a global port according to a result of analysis to the WEB client 24 that has made a request to perform redirection, analyzes the redirected global address and global port and a local address and a local port, translates the analyzed address and port and then transfers a packet based on the translated addresses and ports.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the IP packet analysis unit 34, the sorting unit 40 has a function that determines whether a destination IP address of the packet 48 which is supplied through the global interface unit 30, out of the packet 46 received from the IP network 12, is a given global address supplied from the DNS server 16 and whether a TCP port (global port) is a given value, i.e. a standard value 80, and sorts the packet to be supplied. The sorting unit 40 transmits an IP packet 50 to the redirection unit 44 under the applicable conditions, and transmits an IP packet 52 to the translation/transfer unit 42 under the other conditions, e.g. when it is after communication establishment and determined not to be a value from the DNS server 16.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The translation/transfer unit 42 has a function that, upon receiving the IP packet 52 from the sorting unit 40, searches for the entry of the transfer table 36 with<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the global address and the global port that match the destination IP address and the destination port number of the IP packet 52. The translation/transfer unit 42 has a translation function that outputs a search request signal 54 to the transfer table 36 and, if there is a matching entry, receives a search result 54 and changes the destination IP address and the destination port number of the IP packet 52 to the local address and the local port of the entry stored in the transfer table 36. The translation/transfer unit 42 then transmits the packet 56 that has changed to the local address and the local port to the local interface unit 32. The local interface unit 32 supplies the translated packet 56 to the destination WEB server as a packet 58.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Further, the translation/transfer unit 42 has a function that, upon receiving the IP packet 56 from the local interface unit 32, searches for the entry of the transfer table 36 with the local IP address and the local port that match the source local address and the source local port of the IP packet 56. The translation/transfer unit 42 has a function that outputs the search request signal 54 to the transfer table 36 and, if there is a matching entry, changes the source IP address and the source port number of the IP packet 56 to the global address and the global port of the entry stored in the transfer table 36, the IP masquerade or the NAPT function. The translation/transfer unit 42 then transmits the packet 60 that has changed to the global address and the global port to the global interface unit 30. The global interface unit 30 outputs the received packet 60 to the WEB client that has made a request as an IP packet 46.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The redirection unit 44 has a function that receives an HTTP request contained in the packet 50 from the sorting unit 40 and extracts a host header of the HTTP request. In the host header, a host name that is supplied as a destination is extracted. Further, the redirection unit 44 has a function that searches for a host name of the host table 38 based on the host name in the acquired host header. The redirection unit 44 outputs a search request signal 62 to the host table 38. The redirection unit 44 searches the host table 38 in response to the search request signal 62. The redirection unit 44 further has HTTP redirection function that transmits the global address and the global port acquired as a search result to the WEB client that has made a request for rewrite to the global address and the global port.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In practice, if the redirection unit 44 receives a search result 62 indicating the presence of the corresponding entry in the host table 38, it transmits a response<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> 64 for redirection to the WEB client that has made a request and executes HTTP redirection. The response 64 has a status code "3xx", for example. The response 64 contains a location header. The location header contains the IP address and the port number of the corresponding entry stored in the host table 38.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Particularly, the HTTP redirect function is a function that notifies a change in URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which is one type of a response from a server in HTTP that is used for data transmission and reception in www (world wide web). Status code 301 and 302 are codes for HTTP redirection, and "301 Moved Permanently" indicates that the page is permanently moved, and "302 Moved Temporarily" indicates that the page is temporarily prepared in another place. Note that it is changed to code 307 in HTTP 1.1. Most of WEB browsers automatically recognize the code and read the redirected URL. This is used in distinction from simple redirection.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The host table 38 has a data set made up of elements of a host name (FQDN) area 72, a global address area 74 and a global port area 76 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. In this embodiment, the global address area 74 uses the same value "1.1.1.1", and names in the host name area 72 are used for discrimination. By setting the same value to the values of the global address area 74 and setting different ports to the plurality of FQDNs, the exhaustion of IPv4 IP addresses and the limitation by the specification of the HTTP port "80" are prevented.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Note that, although the numeric value of the global port of www.n.com is "1000(n-1)", it is described as "10000+(n-1)" to avoid misinterpretation.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The transfer table 36 stores a data set made up of elements of a global address area 78, a global port area 80, a local address area 82 and a local port area 84 as one entry. In this embodiment, the global address area 78 uses "1.1.1.1", and the local port area 84 uses the value "80" which is specified in HTTP. The transfer table 36 is designed to enable connection and communication from the global space even when a plurality of WEB servers 66, 68 and 70 are included in the LAN 14. In this configuration, for a plurality of FQDN addressees, a single local server corresponding to the respective FQDNs performs NAPT with one another to thereby establish a connection with the WEB client.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The reason that the host table 38 and the transfer table 36 are placed in this<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> embodiment is described hereinbelow.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Usually, in the case of establishing communication between a device on the LAN 14 side as a transmission source and a device in the global space, a gateway device or a router can create a translation table and is thus able to communicate with the device in the global space by the NAPT function. On the other hand, in the case of establishing communication between a device on the IP network 12 side as a transmission source and a device in the local space, a gateway device or a router has no translation table and is thus unable to communicate with the device in the local space. Further, because a local address specified for use in the local space is not available in the global space, a gateway device or a router is unable to create a translation table unless communication is made from the device on the LAN 14 side.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">However, in the case of placing a WEB server on the LAN 14 side and making a connection from the global space, a broadband bundle router, for example, communicates with the WEB server on the LAN 14 side by translating the global port "80" in the device on the IP network 12 side to "192.168.0.2:80", for example, as address:port by the NAPT function. Further, in the case of making communication from the global space to a network camera on the LAN 14 side, it communicates with the network camera by translating the global port "8080" in the device on the IP network 12 side to "192.168.0.3:8080", for example, as address:port by the NAPT function. By exerting the NAPT function with use of a different port number, the WEB server and the network camera placed on the LAN 14 side become open to the device connected on the IP network 12 side.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">However, as described earlier, even when a plurality of WEB servers are placed in the local space, it is unable to make all of the plurality of WEB servers open to the device connected on the IP network 12 side. This is because the global port specified as the standard value in HTTP is already used in a broadband router, and it is thus unable to relay the communication received with the global port "80" to the second and third WEB servers.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The standard value specified in HTTP is briefly described. The global port "80" is one of "WELL KNOWN PORT NUMBER", and it relates to HTTP and is managed by IANA (Internet Assigned Number Authority).</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The WEB server group 22 is an aggregate of n-number of WEB servers 66,<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> 68, ···, 70, and it is connected to the LAN 14.

The destination of communication of the WEB client 24 shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is the WEB server 66 in the WEB server group 22, and the operation that accesses the WEB server 66 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006 f0007 f0008">FIGS. 5 to 8</figref>. The FQDN of the WEB server 66 is www.1.com.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The WEB client 24 acquires the global address "1.1.1.1" of the WEB server 66 as an address 0, for example, by the DNS server 16. After acquisition, at time T10, the WEB client 24 transmits a TCP packet 86 that contains the global address "1.1.1.1" and the port "80" in the post header to the WEB server 66 with FQDN: www.1.com as a destination. It is specified that the data contained in the host header may be written in alphanumeric characters such as "1.1.1.1:80". The TCP packet 86 is received by the global interface unit 30 of the gateway device 20.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">At time T12, the global interface unit 30 outputs the supplied TCP packet 88 to the sorting unit 40. At time T14, the sorting unit 40 outputs the supplied TCP packet 88 as a TCP packet 90 to the redirection unit 44. The operation of the global interface unit 30 is omitted.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">At time T16, the redirection unit 44 establishes one-to-one communication with the WEB client 24 (connection establishment 92). By the establishment of a connection, the first stage of the connection procedure ends, and the process immediately proceeds to the next connection procedures, i.e. the procedure of NAT processing and the procedure of NAPT processing, which are described later.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">At time T18, the WEB client 24 transmits an HTTP request 94 having the host header "www.1.com" to the redirection unit 44.

At time T22, the host table 38 transmits a search result 98 to the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> redirection unit 44. The redirection unit 44 determines the presence or absence of a desired FQDN based on the search result 98. If there is a desired FQDN, the redirection unit 44 acquires the value "1.1.1.1:10000" of the global address 74 and the global port 76 which are set corresponding to FQDN 72:www.1.com. If, on the other hand, there is no desired FQDN, the redirection unit 44 stores www.1.com into the FQDN 72, sets the value "1.1.1.1.1000n" of the global address 74 and the global port 76 corresponding to the FQDN and stores it into each data area, and acquires those values.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The redirection unit 44 generates a packet 100 that contains the value of the global address 74 and the global port 76 acquired corresponding to the desired FQDN.

By such operation, in response to access from the respective WEB clients 24, communication can be established for each of them without limited to either one. Because the global addresses of the WEB servers of the WEB server group 22 which are set to the respective FQDNs are represented by one value, it is possible to prevent the exhaustion of addresses.
