It is, in fact, known that there is a conflict between the requirement to transport folded clothes without their taking up too much room, and at the same time, without compressing them unduly, in order to avoid producing deep wrinkles and folds. This problem is particularly acute in the case of people who travel for work, with elegant, light-weight clothes (for example, a man's suit made of light-weight Tasmania fabric), because the two requirements cited above are particularly stringent.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">According to the known art, a plurality of solutions has been offered, based substantially on the use of rigid or semi-rigid suitcases. Various accessories are available, which can be put into suitcases in order to fold the clothes and hold them in place, without compressing the fabrics, which would inevitably produce unpleasant deep creases.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In other cases, padded elements have been proposed, some of which are of a highly complex shape, with predetermined folding lines, on the outside of which the garment is folded.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">These accessories, however, are in the form of compressible cushions, plates or bags, which are semi-rigid in some cases and which, in themselves, take up space inside the suitcase, thereby restricting its capacity. It is, in fact, considered, in the known art, that the operative principle of an anti-creasing device is substantially to connect, with broad radii of curvature, the area in which the garment is folded, thereby preventing the formation of small radiuses of curvature which, under pressure, would cause permanent creases.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As a result, the accessories offered by the known art thus far are intrinsically bulky. Further many of them provide predetermined folding lines, which make it difficult to use or to be matched to the clothes, especially if the cut of the garment does not correspond exactly to that provided for by the accessory.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It should also be pointed out that these accessories are normally configured for a specific type of suitcase and are therefore unsuitable for universal, generalised use.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The object of the present invention is therefore to overcome these problems, by providing an accessory which is efficacious but with a very small bulk and cost, and which can be used conveniently and universally, for the support and folding of garments inside suitcases.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary of the invention</u></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">Said object is achieved by means of a device, the basic features of which are described in the independent claim 1.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Other innovative aspects of the device are described in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the present invention, the insert has an outline substantially corresponding to that of the garment into which it is to be inserted.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to the present invention, the insert is made of foamed polyethylene or polyurethane, or a soft natural or semi-natural material such as a woven or nonwoven woollen-based fabric, terrycloth or pile or fabric.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to the present invention, the insert made of soft, flexible material has no predetermined fold lines. Finally, according to a final aspect of the invention, a suitcase is provided for garments, comprising an openable housing inside which an accessory as described above is installed.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5779111A"><text>US 5 779 111</text></patcit> discloses the preamble of claim 1.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>Brief description of the drawings</u></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">Further characteristics and advantages of the device according to the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description, which is provided by way of example and illustrated in the attached drawings, wherein:
<ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a plan view of a first embodiment of the invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a partially-interrupted perspective view of a second embodiment of the invention; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> is a perspective view of a exemplary spreading element of the invention.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><u>Detailed description of the preferred embodiments</u></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">The Applicant, through extensive experimentation, has been able to ascertain that, differently from what was believed in the field, it is not strictly necessary to ensure broad radii of curvature when folding clothes, in order to avoid the formation of creases. It has, in fact, been found that even slight thicknesses of soft, flexible padding, placed in correspondence to the area of folding of the garment, but inside said garment, enable one to avoid the formation of permanent creases.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Consequently, according to the invention, an anti-crease accessory is composed of a spreading and/or hanging structural element 1, such as a coat hanger, to which is coupled (optionally removably, as will be seen hereinafter) an insert 2, made of soft, flexible material (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) and intended to be inserted into the garment.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Preferably, insert 2 comprises a sheet of flexible material having the same outline as that of the garment for which it is<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> intended, or rather, corresponding to the internal profile of the garment in its flattened state (front and back), but not folded. Accordingly, if the garment to be folded is a jacket, the insert will preferably have a substantially rectangular central portion 2a, which is inserted into the torso area of the jacket and from which two lateral arms 2b project, which are inserted into the sleeves of the jacket. A similar insert can be used for shirts and blouses. Conversely, if the garment to be folded is a pair of trousers, the insert will substantially consist of two slightly divergent arms, joined at a common portion in an area at the extremity, intended to be inserted into the two legs of the trousers.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In an embodiment no part of the present invention, each insert 2 may consist of a single, thin sheet, fixed to said hanging and spreading structural element 1 in some way (for example, temporarily by means of clips, clamps or staples or, permanently, by means of glueing, welding ans so on) along a junction line 1a.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to the present invention, said insert 2 can consist of two paired sheets 2' and 2", in which case the two paired sheets are designated to be held together (by glueing, welding, stitching etc.) at least along the edge intended to co-operate with said structural element 1, which could simply be inserted (advantageously also removably) between the two sheets and held in that junction zone, without the need for further fastening means. Basically, according to a preferred embodiment (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>), the two sheets are superimposed on each other and joined at least along a welding line to form a type of envelope, into which said structural element 1 is simply inserted until it abuts an upper edge area, where said welding line is provided, in a position corresponding to the shoulders of the garment.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the two sheets are joined over the entire perimeter, except for a lower area and on one side, right up to a position below the arm attachment, into which said coat hanger 1 can be inserted, or from which it can be extracted.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The two sheets can be joined together along part of their perimeter, by means of welding, stitching or some other suitable<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> method, preferably finishing off the margins of the sheets with a folded binding 3, in the form of a small border, which improves the aesthetic appearance of the product and protects the thin edge of the sheet against ripping, fraying and wear.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Should one wish to join up the entire perimeter of the two sheets, said structural element 1 must be inserted between the two sheets, before completing the welding line.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Insert 2 consists, by way of example, of sheets of foamed polyethylene, both with closed cells and, preferably, with open cells (polyphrene); alternatively, one can use sheets made of other foamed plastic materials, such as foamed polyurethane, or soft natural or semi-natural materials, such as, for example, woven or nonwoven woollen-based fabrics, terrycloth, pile and so forth.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Sheets of polyethylene or polypropylene bubble wrap (pluriboll) could also be used, provided that the bubbles are of very small diameter (less than 5 mm) in order to ensure that the sheet is soft and flexible enough.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The total thickness of the insert (and therefore of the individual sheet or of the sum of the two paired sheets) must be sufficient to act as slight padding - in such a way as to absorb, locally and from the inside of the garment, pressure which would tend to crease the garment - but not to such an extend as to take up an undesirable amount of room in the suitcase. Typical thicknesses appropriate to the purpose, depending on the material, are approximately 0.5 mm to approximately 10 mm, preferably between 0.8 mm and 1.2 mm for each individual sheet.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Advantageously, because they are not necessary and are even counterproductive in some respects, no predetermined folding lines is provided on the surface of said insert 2.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Said hanging and/or spreading element 1 is preferably made in such a way as to be removable or foldable, in order to make the entire accessory easily collapsible, so that it can be tidied away into a small space, when not in use. For that purpose, the transverse portions can be reciprocally hinged (in the way shown schematically in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, or also in a different way),<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> in order to enable them to be folded away one on top of the other. Should the accessory assume the shape of a coat hanger, it is preferable for its hook, as well - which is designed to hook it onto a clothes rail, inside a wardrobe, for example - to be either of a collapsible type or mounted pivotably on its plane, in such a way that it can be hidden or folded away inside the garment when it is put into the suitcase.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">According to one embodiment of the invention, said flexible insert 2 constitutes a permanent suitcase accessory; in that case, said spreading element 1 can be a device integral with and hinged to the suitcase.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Whilst the original purpose of said insert 2 is to prevent the formation of permanent creases, by acting efficaciously from inside of the garment, the first, primary function of said hanging and/or spreading element 1 is to keep the garment stretched, at least at the initial stage of insertion into the suitcase, thereby preventing further accidental folding in a direction transverse to its main axis. Accordingly, said structural element has a substantially rigid configuration.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As a second primary function, said spreading element 1, when engaged with said flexible insert 2, renders the latter easier to handle and insert into the garment; in fact, because of its flexibility and softness, said insert 2 would otherwise be difficult to be inserted and positioned as desired inside the garment. From this point of view, said stretching element 1 could possibly be designed solely for initial use and then removed once the garment has been put into the suitcase. The spreading element 1 is hence removable from the flexible insert 2.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In use, when one has to put a garment back into a suitcase, it is sufficient to insert said structural element 1 into the garment (for example, by inserting the coat hanger into the shoulders of a jacket in the conventional way) to which said insert 2 is connected and which is therefore partially drawn inside the garment: after which, with the garment open, insertion of the various portions of which said insert 2 is composed is completed.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">At this point, the garment can easily be folded - along the desired folding lines, substantially aligned with the direction of rigidity of said structural element 1 - and put into a suitcase.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The very slight thickness and flexibility/softness of said insert 2 cause the accessory according to the invention to take up very little room inside the suitcase, with the result that the capacity thereof is not affected by it. Even when the suitcase is filled with various garments, the pressure which occurs in its interior once it is closed cannot give rise to significant permanent folds in the garment which is provided with the accessory according to the invention.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Advantageously, the accessory proposed herein is of the universal type and does not depend on the specific suitcase used. However, it is not excluded that a structural element 1 could possibly be developed especially to match with a specific suitcase (not shown) of which it would form a proprietary accessory.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Lastly, the simple composition and economy of production of the materials used are such that the device according to the invention is very economical, to the extent that it can be offered as a mass-produced accessory, at no extra cost, to purchasers of clothing. The wide area available on the insert also makes it possible for decorative motifs or advertising logos to be printed on it.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">It is understood that protection of the invention described above is not limited to the particular embodiment illustrated, but is extended to all other structural variants which come under the definition proposed in the attached claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56979479" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Reisezubehör zum Falten von Kleidungsstücken im Inneren eines Koffers, der Bauart, die zumindest ein ausgebreitetes und/oder hängendes strukturelles Element (1) aufweist, weiter umfassend einen Einsatz (2), der aus einem weichen, flexiblen Material hergestellt ist und dafür ausgelegt ist, in das genannte Kleidungsstück eingesetzt zu werden und mit dem genannten strukturellen Element (1) zusammenzuwirken, <b>dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass</b> der genannte Einsatz (2) aus zwei gepaarten Blättern (2', 2") besteht, die zumindest entlang eines Randes aneinander gehalten sind, der dazu bestimmt ist, mit dem genannten strukturellen Element (1) zusammenzuwirken.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0002" num="0002"><claim-text>Zubehör nach Anspruch 1, <b>dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass</b> der genannte Einsatz (2) eine gesamte Dicke von zwischen etwa 0,5 mm und etwa 10 mm und bevorzugt zwischen 0,8 mm und 1,2 mm für jedes einzelne Blatt aufweist.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0003" num="0003"><claim-text>Zubehör nach Anspruch 2, <b>dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass</b> die beiden gepaarten Blätter zumindest entlang einer Schweißlinie auf eine solche Weise miteinander verbunden sind, dass sie eine Art Umschlag bilden, wobei das genannte strukturelle Element (1) lediglich zwischen die beiden paarweisen Blätter und anstoßend gegen die genannte Schweißlinie eingefügt ist.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0004" num="0004"><claim-text>Zubehör nach einem der Ansprüche 1 bis 3, <b>dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass</b> der genannte Einsatz (2) einen Umriss aufweist, der im Wesentlichen dem des Kleidungsstücks entspricht, in das er einzusetzen ist.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0005" num="0005"><claim-text>Zubehör nach einem der vorangehenden Ansprüche, <b>dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass</b> der genannte Einsatz (2) aus geschäumtem Polyethylen des geschlossenzelligen oder offenzelligen Typs besteht.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0006" num="0006"><claim-text>Zubehör nach einem der Ansprüche 1 bis 4, <b>dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass</b> der Einsatz (2) aus geschäumtem Polyurethan besteht.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0007" num="0007"><claim-text>Zubehör nach einem der Ansprüche 1 bis 4, <b>dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass</b> der Einsatz (2) aus einem weichen natürlichen oder halbnatürlichen Material besteht, wie etwa ein gewebter oder nicht gewebter wollbasierter Stoff.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0008" num="0008"><claim-text>Zubehör nach einem der Ansprüche 1 bis 4, <b>dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass</b> der genannte Einsatz (2) aus einem Frotteestoff besteht.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0009" num="0009"><claim-text>Zubehör nach einem der Ansprüche 1 bis 4, <b>dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass</b> der genannte Einsatz (2) aus Flor- oder Fließstoff besteht.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0010" num="0010"><claim-text>Reisezubehör nach einem der vorangehenden Ansprüche, <b>dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass</b> der genannte Einsatz (2), der aus einem weichen, flexiblen Material besteht, keine vorbestimmten Faltlinien aufweist.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0011" num="0011"><claim-text>Koffer für Kleidungsstücke, umfassend ein zu öffnendes Gehäuse, innerhalb dessen ein Zubehör nach einem der vorangehenden Ansprüche angebracht ist.</claim-text></claim></claims><claims mxw-id="PCLM56979480" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --><claim id="c-en-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Travel accessory for the folding of garments inside a suitcase, of the type comprising at least one spreading and/or hanging structural element (1), further comprising an insert (2) made of soft, flexible material designed to be inserted into said garment and engaged with said structural element (1), <b>characterized in that</b> said insert (2) consists of two paired sheets (2', 2") held together at least along an edge intended to co-operate with said structural element (1).<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-01-0002" num="0002"><claim-text>Accessory as in claim 1), wherein said insert (2)<br/>
