However, undesirable substances, such as catalyst degradation products and reaction byproducts, may end up in catalyst recycle loops along with catalyst. When such catalyst degradation products and reaction byproducts are recycled along with catalysts, they tend to build up and cause loss of product yield and purity. Accordingly, there is a need to recycle catalysts, while retaining optimal product yield and purity.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">Buildup of catalyst degradation products and reaction byproducts is reduced by using separate catalyst recycle loops for recycling a catalyst used for hydrocyanating 1,3-butadiene and a catalyst used for hydrocyanating 3-pentenenitrile. A portion of the catalyst used for hydrocyanating 1,3-butadiene is purified in a liquid/liquid extraction treatment.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Pentenenitrile is made in a process comprising two steps. In the first step [i.e. step (a)], 1,3-butadiene is reacted with hydrogen cyanide in a first reaction zone (Z<sub>1</sub>) in the presence of a first catalyst comprising zero-valent nickel (Ni°) and a first phosphorus-containing ligand to produce a reactor effluent comprising 3-pentenenitrile (3PN) and 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile (2M3BN). In the second step [i.e. step (b)], at least a portion of the 2M3BN made in the first step is isomerized in a second reaction zone (Z<sub>2</sub>) in the presence of a second catalyst comprising zero-valent nickel (Ni°) and a second phosphorus-containing ligand to produce a reaction product comprising 3PN.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">An effluent stream comprising 3PN may be recovered from the second reaction zone (Z<sub>2</sub>). 3PN may also be recovered by distillation of the reaction product from the first reaction zone (Z<sub>1</sub>). The recovered 3PN may be contacted with HCN in a third reaction step [i.e. step (c)] in a third reaction zone (Z<sub>3</sub>) in the presence of a third catalyst, comprising zero-valent nickel (Ni°) and a third phosphorus-containing ligand. The reaction in the third reaction zone (Z<sub>3</sub>) takes place in the presence of Lewis acid promoter.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Catalyst introduced into a reaction zone flows into, through and out of the reaction zone along with reactants and products. Any Lewis acid promoter introduced into a reaction zone also flows through the reaction zone along with the flow of reactants, products and catalyst. The catalyst which flows through the first reaction zone is also referred to herein as the first catalyst. This first catalyst comprises zero valent nickel and a first phosphorus-containing ligand. The catalyst which flows through the second reaction zone is also referred to herein as the second catalyst. This second catalyst comprises zero valent nickel and a second phosphorus-containing ligand.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The first reaction zone is substantially free of Lewis acid promoter. The flow of recycled catalyst is controlled to avoid the introduction of Lewis acid promoter, which flows through the third reaction zone (Z<sub>3</sub>), into the first reaction zone (Z<sub>1</sub>).</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In addition to 3-pentenenitrile (3PN) and 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile (2M3BN), the reaction product of step (a) further comprises dinitriles. These dinitriles comprise adiponitrile (ADN) and methylglutaronitrile (MGN). Adiponitrile (ADN) may be formed by the reaction of 3-pentenenitrile (3PN) with HCN. Methylglutaronitrile (MGN) may be formed by the reaction of 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile (2M3BN) with HCN.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The formation of MGN in the first reaction zone (Z<sub>1</sub>) is especially problematic in that 2M3BN is converted before it can be recovered and isomerized into 3PN. In a process where 3PN is recovered and reacted with HCN to form ADN, the production of one mole of MGN in the first reaction zone (Z<sub>1</sub>) results in a loss of two moles of HCN and one mole of BD, which could otherwise be converted to ADN. Accordingly, unwanted production of MGN in the first reaction zone (Z<sub>1</sub>) results in unwanted reduction of ADN yield, based on moles of HCN and BD reacted.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As catalyst flows through the first and second reaction zones, the zero valent nickel content of the catalyst may be reduced and catalyst degradation byproducts may be produced.

Dinitriles produced in the first reaction zone (Z<sub>1</sub>) or recycled into this first reaction zone (Z<sub>1</sub>) also become concentrated in column bottoms of columns used to concentrate catalyst. Catalysts tend to be less thermally stable in solutions with high concentrations of these dinitriles, as opposed to catalyst solutions with high concentrations of mononitriles, such as 3PN and 2M3BN. When the production or build-up of dinitriles is excessively high, nickel/ligand complex of the catalyst may lack thermal stability and may break down releasing free ligand and non-complexed nickel in column bottoms, where the nickel/ligand complex is exposed to the highest temperatures. Nickel which is not complexed to ligand becomes insoluble and may plate out on high temperature surfaces such as exchange tubes and column walls,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> which, in turn, creates a host of problems including loss of active catalyst and loss of throughput capacity, ultimately requiring shut down of production.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">At least two, and, optionally, three separate liquid/liquid extraction steps are used to purify or regenerate catalysts. At least a portion of the concentrated catalyst from the first reaction zone is purified by removing catalyst degradation byproducts and reaction byproducts in a first liquid/liquid extraction step. A separate liquid/liquid extraction step is used to treat the product from the third reaction zone. Purified catalyst from the first liquid/liquid extraction step is recycled to the first reaction zone. Optionally, when the first catalyst and the second catalyst are the same, a portion of this purified catalyst may be recycled to the second reaction zone. Optionally, three separate liquid/liquid extracton sections are used for each catalyst. As used herein, the terms "extraction section" and "extraction zone" refer to the equipment and process steps for metering, charging, mixing, holding, separating and recycling components of a liquid-liquid extraction process. According to the option of using three separate extraction sections or zones, a portion of the first catalyst is extracted in a first liquid/liquid extraction zone, a portion of the second catalyst is extracted in a second liquid/liquid extraction zone, and at least a portion, for example, all, of the third catalyst is extracted in a third liquid/liquid extraction zone.

The ratio of atomic equivalents of Ni to moles of Lewis acid in the first reaction zone may be less than 10:1 during normal process operation, for example at least 50% of the time, for example, at least 95% of the production of 3-pentenenitrile.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The Lewis acid promoter in the third reaction zone (Z<sub>3</sub>) has a higher boiling point than adiponitrile. The reaction product, third catalyst and Lewis acid promoter flowing through the third reaction zone (Z<sub>3</sub>) in step (c) may be contacted with an extraction solvent in an extraction zone to produce a solvent phase comprising the third catalyst and a raffinate phase comprising adiponitrile product from step (c). The raffinate phase also comprises compounds which are not adiponitrile, such as (1) compounds with a higher boiling point than adiponitrile and (2) compounds with a lower<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> boiling point than adiponitrile. The raffinate phase may be distilled in one or more distillation steps to recover a purified adiponitrile product stream and to remove compounds which are not adiponitrile from the raffinate phase. For example, most of the Lewis acid promoter tends to partition into the raffinate phase, although at least a small amount of the promoter may also partition into the solvent phase. The partitioning of compounds between the two phases is discussed in United States Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0019" dnum="US3773809A"><text>3,773,809</text></patcit>. All of the Lewis acid promoter in the raffinate phase may be removed in distillation steps used to recover the adiponitrile product. The recovered adiponitrile product may be used to provide dinitrile to the extraction zone for the first catalyst as may be needed to promote separation. The extraction zone used to regenerate the first catalyst is different from the extraction zone used to regenerate the third catalyst.

The physical properties of the single catalyst during required separation steps may also create disadvantages. For example, reboiler temperatures at certain points in the product separation train may degrade less thermally stable catalysts.

While not to limit the scope of the invention by a recitation of theory, it is believed that the loss of the bidentate ligand component of the catalyst is due to thermal degradation. To maintain ligand inventory, the butadiene column bottoms (the first column after the first reaction zone) is controlled at at 125°C. Initially, this results in an unacceptably high level of unreacted butadiene in the pentenenitrile-enriched bottoms product. In an attempt to solve this problem, the butadiene column is upgraded for vacuum operation, and refrigeration equipment is installed for condensing the overheads. Additional monitoring equipment is installed to detect oxygen intrusion from the atmosphere and mitigate the risk of uncontrolled 1,3-butadiene polymerization in the presence of oxygen.</p><p id="p0320" num="0320">The process is carried out under continuous operating conditions, and the residual Lewis acid concentration in the catalyst increases.
