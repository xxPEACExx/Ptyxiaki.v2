load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to precision transfer equipment, more specifically, equipment that transfers a work table or a column of measuring equipment and a machine tool with a high precision for positioning.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>2. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Precision transfer equipment requiring a high motion accuracy (e.g., a precision positioning system, precision measuring equipment and a machine tool) has been designed to directly reflect a profile accuracy of a precisely finished guide rail to motion accuracy of an object to be moved.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Such precision transfer equipment is required to transmit a thrusting force only in a predetermined feed direction without transmitting vibration and the like from a driving source for transmitting a driving force by a drive mechanism to a movable body such as a table (an object to be moved). One of such transmission mechanisms exhibiting excellent performance is a static-pressure joint that supplies fluid between a pair of highly precise planes to form a static-pressure clearance.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Especially, a supplying-discharging static-pressure bearing that supplies fluid in an outer periphery of the static-pressure clearance and discharges the fluid in the middle, or a vacuum-balanced static-pressure air bearing can provide a strong rigidity in a compression direction and a tensile direction. Thus, there has been proposed to use a drive mechanism using the static-pressure bearing having such a high rigidity to increase geometric accuracy of motion of a high precision linear table (see Patent Literature 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2006205292A"><text>JP-A-2006-205292</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">According to Patent Literature 1, only the thrusting force is transmitted in noncontact from the rod (a driving body) to the table (the movable body) via a static-pressure air bearing, so that transmission of vibration from the driving source is avoidable and a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> high motion accuracy of the table is achievable. Further, by placing a thrusting axis from the rod near the centroid of the table, the motion accuracy of the table is maintainable even in driving for acceleration or deceleration.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The static-pressure joint disclosed in Patent Literature 1 further includes a thrust plate that is supported near the rod by a gimbal mechanism absorbing a motion error in a yawing direction and is supported near the table by a similar gimbal mechanism absorbing a motion error in a pitching direction. Through the joint, forces other than the force in the moving direction of the table are not transmitted.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In order for precision transfer equipment to enhance accuracy, it is crucial to accurately detect and control a position of the movable body in a feed direction, in addition to a high geometric accuracy of motion of the drive mechanism and the movable body.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In order to provide such a function, there has been known a technique for detecting a position of a movable body in a feed direction by setting a laser interferometer in the precision transfer equipment (see Patent Literature 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2000055617A"><text>JP-A-2000-55617</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to Patent Literature 2, a slider driving mechanism using a feed screw axis is provided under a table and a position detecting mechanism using a laser interferometer is provided on a side of the table. In this arrangement, a laser path extending from a light source of the laser interferometer to an end of the table is surrounded by a stretchable tube with a bellows, in which an inner pressure of the tube is reduced to eliminate an influence from air turbulence in the laser path, thereby achieving further high precision.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A simple combination of the precision transfer equipment disclosed in Patent Literature 1 and the positioning detecting mechanism disclosed in Patent Literature 2 entails the following problems.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">For a precise positioning by the precision transfer equipment of Patent Literature 1, it is desirable that an object to be precisely positioned is placed on a driving axis as well as on a laser optical axis (a measurement axis) of the laser interferometer. However, it is difficult to coaxially arrange the laser path of the laser interferometer of Patent Literature<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> 2 and the driving axis by the rod and the static-pressure air bearing of Patent Literature 1, where so-called offset is inevitable.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">For this reason, even if a high precision is achieved by the precision transfer equipment of Patent Literature 1, a highly precise positioning detecting mechanism by the laser interferometer as disclosed in Patent Literature 2 cannot be combined with the precision transfer equipment of Patent Literature 1, so that a highly precise movement and a highly precise positioning may not be sufficiently achieved in practical use.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Moreover, Patent Literature 2 discloses that the bellows is used for reducing the pressure in the laser path in order to eliminate an influence of a medium in the laser path, in which the end of the bellows needs to be hermetically connected to the table. Accordingly, even if deviation of the thrusting axis is resolved by the gimbal mechanism as disclosed in Patent Literature 1, a high precision may be impaired by being affected by the bellows.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">An object of the invention is to provide precision transfer equipment that allows a highly precise movement and a highly precise positioning based on a highly precise position-detection.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to an aspect of the invention, a precision transfer equipment includes: a base; a movable body that is supported by the base and is movable in a predetermined moving direction; a driving body that is connected to the movable body via a joint; a drive mechanism that moves the driving body forward and backward in the moving direction; and a displacement detector that detects a displacement of the movable body relative to the base, in which the joint is provided by a supplying-discharging static-pressure joint and includes: a movement surface that is connected to the movable body in a manner orthogonal to the moving direction; a drive surface that is connected to the driving body in a manner to face the movement surface; a fluid supply channel that supplies fluid into a static-pressure clearance formed between the movement surface and the drive surface; and a fluid discharge channel that discharges the fluid from the static-pressure clearance, and<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the displacement detector is provided by a laser interferometer having a laser path of which an optical path extends along the moving direction and is configured such that laser light passing through the laser path passes through the driving body and the drive surface and is reflected on the movement surface.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">With this arrangement, when the drive mechanism drives the driving body, the movable body is moved via the driving body and the joint. When a supplying-discharging static-pressure joint is used as the joint, influences of vibration from the driving source is avoided and a highly precise movement is conducted by driving only in the moving direction.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The movement of the movable body is detected by a displacement detector. Since the displacement detector exhibits a high precision with the use of the laser interferometer and avoids an off-set error owing to the laser path passing through the driving body, the displacement detector can improve a positioning accuracy of the movable body.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the above aspect of the invention, as the fluid used in the supplying-discharging static-pressure joint, not only air and other gases but also liquid is applicable. In the application of air, air is easily available and causes no problem in case air is leaked.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the above aspect of the invention, as the driving mechanism, a driving mechanism including a power source (e.g., a motor) and a transmission mechanism for transmitting power to the driving body is applicable. A friction roller exhibiting a high consecutiveness in operation is desirable as such a transmission mechanism. However, other transmission mechanisms are usable.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the above aspect of the invention, the driving body is desirably a tubular driving rod having an inside usable as the laser path, and a pressure of the inside is desirably reduced.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">With this arrangement, by aligning the laser path with a position of the center axis of the driving rod, the moving axis of the driving body and the positioning detecting axis can be aligned with the moving direction of the movable body.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the above aspect of the invention, the drive surface is desirably provided with a transparent plate that hermetically seals the laser path passing through the driving body from the static-pressure clearance and is inclined against an optical axis of the laser path.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">With this arrangement, the pressure in the laser path within the driving body can be set to the reduced pressure irrespective of the air pressure in the static-pressure clearance. Accordingly, even when the pressure of the static-pressure clearance is high relative to the high vacuum required for the laser path, in other words, when the fluid is provided by gas having a high pressure, or when the fluid is provided by liquid, the fluid of the static-pressure clearance can be avoided from flowing into the laser path.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Herein, since the transparent plate is inclined against the optical axis, any unnecessary reflection light is not returned to the laser interferometer in the measurement using the laser interferometer.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the aspect of the invention, it is not essential to provide the transparent plate for separating the static-pressure clearance from the laser path. For instance, when the pressure in the static-pressure clearance is sufficiently reduced, or when a vacuum degree of the laser path is low, the static-pressure clearance may be communicated with the laser path within the driving body.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0026" num="0026"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a schematic view showing an overall structure according to a first exemplary embodiment of the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a relevant part according to the first exemplary embodiment.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a schematic view showing an overall structure according to a second exemplary embodiment of the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a relevant part according to a third exemplary embodiment of the invention.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b>DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT(S)</b></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --><p id="p0027" num="0027">Exemplary embodiment(s) of the invention will be described below with reference to the attached drawings.</p><heading id="h0006">First Exemplary embodiment</heading><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref> show the first exemplary embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, precision transfer equipment 1 according to the first exemplary embodiment includes: a base 2; and a table mechanism 3, a drive mechanism 4 and a laser interferometer 5 provided on the base 2.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The base 2 is fixed on a stable foundation while an upper surface of the base 2 is formed horizontal.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The table mechanism 3 supports a table 31 (a movable body) and includes a guide rail 32 that is fixed on the base 2.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">A guide bearing 33 is provided on a bottom surface of the table 31. The table 31 is supported by the base 2 through the guide bearing 33 and the guide rail 32.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The guide rail 32 is continuously formed in a predetermined moving direction (in a predetermined direction for moving the table 31) while an upper surface of the guide rail 32 is made horizontal, flat and smooth.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The guide bearing 33 is a static-pressure air bearing that forms a static-pressure clearance between the upper surface of the guide rail 32 and the guide bearing 33 by supplying compressed air, and is preloaded with a load of the table 31.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The table 31 is movably supported by the table mechanism 3 and is smoothly movable in the above moving direction.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The drive mechanism 4 drives a rod 41 (a driving body) and includes a casing 42 that is fixed on the base 2.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The rod 41 is a hollow elongated tubular member that extends in the moving direction of the table 31. Both ends of the rod 41 (a base on the right and a tip end on the left in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) project beyond the casing 42. The tip end of the rod 41 is connected to a side of the table 31 via a joint 6. The joint 6 will be described in detail later.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The casing 42 includes a rod guide 43 through which the rod 41 is introduced and which smoothly and slidably receives a circumference of the rod 41, the rod guide 43<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> being provided at two positions. By being supported by the rod guides 43, the rod 41 is kept supported in the moving direction of the table 31 and is freely movable in a longitudinal direction of the rod 41.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In the casing 42, a drive roller 44 and a follower roller 45 are provided in a manner to interpose the rod 41 therebetween.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The drive roller 44 is rotatable in reciprocal directions by receiving a rotation power transmitted from a power source such as a motor (not shown). When the drive roller 44 is pressed onto the circumference of the rod 41, the drive roller 44 is adapted to transmit the rotation power to the rod 41, thereby driving the rod 41 in the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The follower roller 45 is supported by the casing 42 in a freely rotatable manner and is pressed onto the rod 41 from a side opposite to the drive roller 44 to apply the pressing force to the rod 41, the pressing force being equivalent to a pressing force of the drive roller 44 against the rod 41. This arrangement prevents the rod 41 from being distorted or generating unnecessary forces in other directions.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">With such a drive mechanism 4, the rod 41 can move forward or backward to any position in the longitudinal direction (moving direction) of the rod 41.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The laser interferometer 5 is a displacement detector of the invention and includes an interferometer body 51 that houses basic elements such as a light-receiving element and a splitter. An external laser source 53 is connected to the interferometer body 51 via an optical fiber 52.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">An emitting portion 54 of the interferometer body 51 is connected to the base of the rod 41 via a metallic bellows 55. Although a distance between the rod 41 and the interferometer body 51 fluctuates since the rod 41 moves forward and backward in the longitudinal direction as described above, the connection between rod 41 and the interferometer body 51 is maintained by expansion and contraction of the bellows 55.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">An inside of the bellows 55 and a hollow portion of the rod 41 intercommunicate with each other. Such a continuous space provides a laser path 56.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0046" num="0046">A laser light radiated from the emitting portion 54 passes through the laser path 56 to reach the joint 6 provided at the tip end of the rod 41, where the laser light is reflected. The reflected light passes through the laser path 56 to return to the interferometer body 51, where the laser light is received by the interferometer body 51.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In order to enhance measurement accuracy, an inner pressure of the laser path 56 is reduced to a high vacuum state. While being expansible and contractible in the longitudinal direction as the rod 41 moves, the bellows 55 securely has a predetermined rigidity in a radial direction by being made of metal. Accordingly, even if a difference between an internal air pressure and an external air pressure of the bellows 55 is large, the bellows 55 does not collapse.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the joint 6 connects the table 31 and the rod 41 and includes a movement member 61 that is connected to the table 31 and a drive member 62 that is connected to the tip end of the rod 41.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The movement member 61 and the drive member 62 are made of metal in a disc. One surface of each of the movement member 61 and the drive member 62 is polished so as to provide a highly precise flat surface.

The turn shaft of the movement member 61 and the turn shaft of the drive member 62 are orthogonal to each other. The movement surface 63 and the drive surface 64 are usually orthogonal to the above moving direction of the table 31. Even if the rod 41 is slightly inclined against the moving direction of the table 31, such an inclination is absorbed by the above gimbal mechanisms on the respective sides of the moving and driving bodies, so that the above movement surface 63 and the drive surface 64 are kept orthogonal to the moving direction of the table 31.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">To the movement member 61, a fluid supply channel 66 and a fluid discharge channel 67 are connected, whereby fluid is supplied to and discharged from the static-pressure clearance 65.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The fluid supply channel 66 supplies a compressed air (fluid) to the static-pressure clearance 65 through fluid restrictors provided at plural positions near the periphery of the movement surface 63.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The fluid discharge channel 67 discharges air from an area inside an area where the air is supplied near the periphery of the movement surface 63.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">With this arrangement, the air supplied near the periphery of the static-pressure clearance 65 from the fluid supply channel 66 is partially released toward the atmosphere from the periphery of the static-pressure clearance 65 while the air in the inside area is discharged from the fluid discharge channel 67.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Accordingly, in the inside area where the air is discharged, a tensile force to make the movement surface 63 and the drive surface 64 approach each other is generated and serves as preload as a static-pressure joint. In the air supply area near the periphery, a compression force is applied on an air layer having a certain thickness, thereby providing a supplying-discharging static-pressure bearing.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0059" num="0059">A through hole 68 is formed at the center of the drive member 62.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">A metallic bellows 75 is connected to the drive member 62 near the rod 41, specifically, connected to the periphery of an opening of the laser path 56 provided at the tip end of the rod 41.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">With this arrangement, the laser path 56 inside the rod 41, an inside of the bellows 75 and the through hole 68 intercommunicate with each other along the axis of the moving direction of the table 31.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">A glass transparent plate 69 is provided in the through hole 68 near the drive surface 64 and hermetically seals the inside of the through hole 68, the bellows 75 and the laser path 56 from the static-pressure clearance 65. The transparent plate 69 is transmissive of laser light from the laser interferometer 5. The laser light arriving through the laser path 56 is transmitted through the transparent plate 69 and is reflected by the movement surface 63 to be again transmitted through the transparent plate 69 to return to the laser path 56, where the laser light is detected by the laser interferometer 5.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">In this arrangement, since the movement surface 63 is kept orthogonal to the moving direction of the table 31 (i.e., an optical axis of the laser light passing through the laser path 56), the movement surface 63 can reliably reflect the laser light from the laser path 56.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">On the other hand, when the transparent plate 69 is fixed in the through hole 68, the transparent plate 69 is not orthogonal to the moving direction of the table 31 (i.e., the optical axis of the laser light passing through the laser path 56), but the transparent plate 69 is fixed so as to be slightly angularly-inclined against the optical axis of the laser light. With this arrangement, any reflected components generated on the transparent plate 69 are deviated from the optical axis of the laser light and never return to the laser interferometer 5.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">According to this exemplary embodiment, driving the rod 41 by the drive mechanism 4 enables moving of the table 31 through the rod 41 and the joint 6.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">In the exemplary embodiment, since the joint 6 is provided by a supplying-discharging static-pressure joint, influences (e.g., vibration) from a power source (e.g., a<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> motor) of the drive mechanism 4 can be avoided and a highly precise movement can be conducted by driving only in the moving direction of the table 31.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The movement of the table 31 is able to be detected by the laser interferometer 5 (a displacement detector). The laser interferometer 5 exhibits a high precision with the use of laser interference.
