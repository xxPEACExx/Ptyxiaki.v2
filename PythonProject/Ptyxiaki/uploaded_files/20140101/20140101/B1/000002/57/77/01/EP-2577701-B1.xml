By way of example, very fast transients are generated when transformers are switched on or off by means of vacuum circuit breakers. Transformers are often connected with circuit breakers by means of cables of a length of several dozen or several hundred meters. Low value of impedance and insignificant cable loss cause that the amplitude of the generated very fast transients magnified by wave reflections at the connection points, which can considerably exceed the rated value of the supply voltage, and the frequency of such transients can range from a few hundred kHz to as much as a few MHz. Then very fast transients can damage the transformer insulation or its windings. A voltage of a short risetime of a few dozen or a few hundred kV/µs and oscillations of frequencies ranging from several hundred kHz to many MHz that accumulate on the transformer winding degrade the insulation and, in consequence, lead to its breakdown and internal faults. Therefore there is a need to eliminate or reduce the damaging effect of very fast transients by using an additional protective component or device. Typically, varistor surge arrester, surge capacitors of capacitances in the order of a few hundred nF, RC filters and pre-insertion resistors, connected in parallel with the circuit breaker contacts are used as additional components or devices against the damaging occurrence of very fast transients.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The use of varistor surge arresters ensures great efficiency of transient amplitude reduction, but it does not change the rate of rise of the voltage wave. Moreover, due to the character of operation of this type of suppressors, additional high-frequency voltage components are generated.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Solutions based on surge capacitors characterized by large capacitance value and R-C filters are efficient, but these have large dimensions and weights which make placing them in a common housing with the protected device or circuit breaker fairly difficult. In addition, although R-C filters provide good protection against large amplitude interference, the rate of rise of the first voltage wave is in many cases not reduced, which significantly affects the level of protection of the protected facilities. It takes place particularly when the connection between the breaker and the protected equipment is relatively short. Then, pre-insertion resistances connected in parallel with the system of the circuit breaker contacts are difficult to install and they require additional contacts. Moreover, the large power emitted on such a resistor and problems connected with its dissipating are by no means insignificant.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Another solution used to reduce very fast transients are devices in the form of R-L reactors connected in series and having specially selected parameters. They act as a conductor of minute resistance for the low frequencies of the applied voltage and as an additional series impedance for higher frequencies that occur during connection phenomena. These devises are characterized by low voltage drop on their own impedance and by a small value of power dissipated during operation in stable condition. However, although these devices are very effective in suppressing very fast transients, they have a certain inconvenient feature, namely their dimensions depend on the value of current flowing through these devices, and the significant power dissipated during the flow of large-value fault current can result in their thermal destruction. The above mentioned inconveniences prevent the use of this type of solutions for installation in switchgears located in electric power substations connected with wind power plants by means of power cables.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">All the presented solutions either fail to ensure full protection, as is the case of varistor transient suppressors, or the presence of these devices in the power network during normal operating conditions, for the operating frequency of 50/60Hz, causes the dissipation of additional power in these devices. For that<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> reason, the presented solutions are not acceptable as devices that fully protect transformers working in power substations or in wind power plants. The inconvenient integration of such devices with switchgears and wind power plants prevents their use in such cases due to the limited space available in the nacelle gondola or in the tower of a wind generator.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Patent description <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6642806B"><text>US 6 642 806</text></patcit> reveals a method that allows a reduction in the frequency of occurrence of transients and/or in the amplitude value, which consists in placing a magnetic core of high magnetic permeability around a lead that conducts electric current. The use of the magnetic core allows to reduce the dimensions of the device which protects equipment against transients. If the device according to the presented solution is used, the efficiency can be insufficient due to the limited efficiency of the suppression of potential oscillations of transients only by the lossiness of the magnetic material of the core.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">An additional disadvantage of this type of solution is the saturation of the core and thereby loss of the functionality of the device before the process of generation of very fast transients ends.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Patent description <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2008040128A"><text>WO 2008/040128</text></patcit> reveals a method which allows to reduce the values of very fast transients, based on cores of a magnetic material arranged around a piece of a current-conducting lead and a resistor that shunts the piece of the current-conducting lead. An inconvenience of this solution is the need to make a galvanic connection between the shunting resistor and the current path, which requires a considerable modification of the current path.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Patent description of <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="GB1187410A"><text>GB1187410</text></patcit> reveals an arrangement counteracting voltage surges due to circuit breaker interruption.

A single-turn primary winding is a current path, therefore it is possible to construct a device having small dimensions.

The inventive bushing is characterized by small dimensions even for large values of the current flowing through this bushing. The bushing has a simple design and is handy in use. It can be used as additional equipment of existing switchgears and/or power substations, and its use does not require magnificent modifications.

It increases with the increase in the frequency of the applied voltage. For very large frequencies its value approaches the value resulting from the value of the resistance connected to the winding, converted to the side of the single-turn primary winding formed by the current-conducting lead. The larger the inductance of the device 1, 1 a , 1 b that contains a magnetic core or cores, the lower the frequency for which the resultant impedance approaches the limit value determined by the resistance of the suppressing resistors. Therefore it is beneficial to use a magnetic core in the device, which makes it possible to obtain a suitably large inductance for the single-turn coil formed by the current-conducting lead. Due to the fact that the impedance of the device for high frequencies has a resistive character and that it is connected in series between the source of transients that have large rates of rise whose source is the vacuum circuit breaker and the protected device, it is possible to obtain a considerable reduction in the rate of rise in voltage on the terminals of the protected device whose capacitance to earth and the cable capacitance, in case of the cable connection, together with the impedance of the VFT suppressing device form a low pass filter. The use of a resistor connected to the winding wound on a magnetic core eliminates the need to galvanically connect the resistor to the current-conducting lead. The value of the resistance of the suppressing resistor should be selected to obtain the maximum reduction in the rate of rise of voltage on the terminals of the protected piece of equipment, and at the same time to avoid oscillating transients in the circuit created by the inductance of the suppressing device and the capacitance of the protected equipment. Therefore, the selection of the resistance of the suppressing resistor must be done for the specific material and size of the magnetic core that is used, and for the capacitance of the protected equipment. Such selection with a view to meeting the above mentioned criteria is within the scope of electrical engineering expertise and skills.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56979095" lang="DE"
