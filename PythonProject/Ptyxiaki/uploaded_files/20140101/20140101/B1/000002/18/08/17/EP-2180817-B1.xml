However, and with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, some of the exhausted is not exhausted through the front of the dish washing machine, but rather flows to the rear and the sides of the dish washing machine.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Then, when the exhausted air flows to the rear and the sides of the dish washing machine, the air is not exhausted from the dish washing machine, because the rear and the sides of the dish washing machine are closed. As a result, the walls of the kitchen furniture "f', installed adjacent to the sides of the dish washing machine or the installation surfaces of the dish washing machine become deformed due to the relatively high-temperature, high-humidity air. Furthermore, the relatively high-temperature, high-humidity air is introduced into a gap defined between the bottom of the dish washing machine and the floor where the dish washing machine is installed, with the result that the bottom of the dish washing machine becomes covered with rust.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>Technical Solution</b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">Accordingly, one object of the present invention is directed to a dish washing machine that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Another object of the present invention is to provide a dish washing machine that is capable of preventing moisture from being formed on the bottom or the wall around the bottom of the dish washing machine and preventing the bottom or the wall of the dish washing machine from being deformed due to the moisture.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, the present invention provides in one aspect a dish washing machine including a tub configured to form a space for a dish to be washed, a door configured to open or close the tub, and an exhaust duct extended to an under portion of the door to exhaust air in the tub. Further, the exhaust duct has a lower end sloped with respect to an installation surface of the dish washing machine.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In another aspect, the present invention provides a dish washing machine including a tub configured to form a space for a dish to be washed, a door configured to open or close the tub, and an exhaust duct configured to exhaust air in the tub to an under portion of the door and toward an opening direction of the door.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.</p><heading id="h0006"><b>Advantageous Effects</b></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">As apparent from the above description, the present invention has several advantages.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">First, the air exhausted from the exhaust duct is directed in the opening direction of the door, and therefore, the air flows toward the open front of the dish washing machine. Consequently, the air is smoothly exhausted out of the dish washing machine without the introduction of the air to the sides and the rear of the dish washing machine, whereby the formation of moisture on the installation surface of the dish washing machine is minimized. In addition, the high-temperature air is smoothly exhausted out of the dish washing machine, and therefore, the deformation of the installation surface of the dish washing machine due to heat is minimized.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Secondly, the air exhausted from the exhaust duct flows toward the vertical center line of the door of the dish washing machine. Consequently, the flow of the air exhausted from the exhaust duct to the sides of the dish washing machine is prevented, whereby it is possible to solve the problems which may occur due to the contact of the high-temperature, high-humidity exhausted air with the walls of kitchen furniture installed at the sides of the dish washing machine.</p><heading id="h0007"><b>Brief Description of the Drawings</b></heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further understanding of the invention and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this application, illustrate embodiment(s) of the invention and together with the description serve to explain the principle of the invention.

A first water supply valve 255 for controlling the supply of water into the sump 205 is also mounted on the sump 205.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Further, the upper shelf 160 and the lower shelf 170 are mounted at the upper part and the lower part of the tub 150, respectively. Also, the upper spray arm 230 and the lower spray arm 220 are mounted at the upper part and the lower part of the tub 150 for spraying the water pumped by the pump 210 toward the upper shelf 160 and the lower shelf 170, respectively.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In addition, a top nozzle 240, for spraying the water pumped by the pump 210 from the upper part to the lower part of the tub 150, is mounted in the upper part of the tub 150. A connecting pipe 110 connects the pump 210 and the top nozzle 240. Further, in one embodiment, steam may be also sprayed or supplied into the tub 150 by the pump 210 and the spray arms 230 and 220 in addition to the washing water sprayed into the tub 150. In more detail, the washing machine includes a steam generator 300 which is driven separately from the sump heater 290 mounted in the sump 205.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the steam generator 300 communicates with a second water supply pipe 260 and also communicates with the tub 150 via a steam supply pipe 280. A second water supply valve 265 for controlling the supply of water into the steam generator 300 is also mounted on the second water supply pipe 260.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In addition, the steam generator 300 includes a steam heater 310 for heating water supplied into the steam generator 300 and a water level sensor 320 for sensing the water level in the steam generator 300. The water level sensor 320 may sense, for example, a low water level and a high water level.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In more detail, the low water level is established to protect the steam heater 310, and the high water level is established to prevent the overflow of the water supplied into the steam generator 300 from the steam generator 300. Also, the steam generator 300 may further include a steam supply valve (not shown) for controlling the opening and closing of the steam supply pipe 280 to supply steam at a desired time.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In addition, the dish washing machine may further include a contamination sensor (not shown) for sensing a contamination degree of washing water used to wash the dishes. For example, the contamination sensor may be mounted at one side of the sump 205 for sensing the contamination degree of washing water circulating in the tub.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Further, a control unit (not shown) for controlling the dish washing machine is electrically connected to electrically-operating components, such as the control panel 130, the pump 210, and the steam generator 300, to control the operation of the dish washing machine. In addition, the upper side of the tub 150 includes mounted components for exhausting high-temperature wet air in the tub 150, heated by the steam and the heated washing water, out of the dish washing machine.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGs. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>, the component for exhausting air inside the washing machine includes an exhaust fan 390 for suctioning high-temperature wet air from the tub 150, a housing 394 defining a space for receiving the exhaust fan 390, and an exhaust duct 392 for guiding the high-temperature wet air, suctioned by the exhaust fan 390, out of the dish washing machine.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Further, the exhaust fan 390 may be a bidirectional suction fan. Specifically, the exhaust fan 390 suctions the high-temperature wet air from the tub 150 into the housing 394, and, at the same time, suctions low-temperature, low-humidity air from the outside into the exhaust duct 392, such that the condensation of moisture is performed in the housing 394 or the exhaust duct 392.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Consequently, the amount of moisture contained in the exhausted air is reduced, and the temperature of the exhausted air is also lowered. Accordingly, the formation of moisture on the installation surface of the dish washing machine and the walls of the furniture installed adjacent to the dish washing machine are minimized.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Of course, the present invention is not limited to the above-described construction. For example, the exhaust fan 390 according to an embodiment of the present invention may be configured to suction and exhaust only the air in the tub 150. Further, the exhaust duct 392 may be coupled to one side of the housing 394 such that the exhaust duct 392 communicates with the housing 394.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Also, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, the exhaust duct 392 extends downward through the interior of the door 120 toward the installation surface of the dish washing machine. Consequently, air exhausted from the housing 394 is exhausted to the lower part of the door 120 along the exhaust duct 392. The exhaust duct 392 also includes ribs 399 for guiding the flow of air exhausted from the exhaust duct 392.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Next, <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the exhaust duct 392 according to an embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a sectional view illustrating the lower end of the exhaust duct of <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, one side of the middle part of the exhaust duct 392 includes a water recovering hole 393, which communicates with the tub 150 for recovering water flowing in the exhaust duct 392 to the tub 150. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIGS. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">6</figref>, the exhaust duct also includes a first bent part 397 such that a lower end 391 of the exhaust duct 392 is inclined at a predetermined angle with respect to the installation surface of the dish washing machine.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In addition, the first bent part 397 is formed adjacent to the lower end 391 of the exhaust duct 392. Consequently, the lower end 391 of the exhaust duct 392 is inclined at the predetermined angle to the installation surface of the dish washing machine such that the lower end 391 of the exhaust duct 392 is directed in the direction in which the door 120 is directed (i.e., the direction in which the door 120 is opened).</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Further, one reason why the lower end 391 of the exhaust duct 392 is directed in the direction in which the door 120 is directed is as follows. When the dish washing machine is installed in a built-in structure, the opposite sides of the dish washing machine are closed by the sides of the kitchen furniture "f" (see <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>), the rear of the dish washing machine is also closed by the wall, and an open space for opening and closing the door 120 is formed at the front of the dish washing machine. Therefore, the lower end 391 of the exhaust duct 392 is directed to the open space in the direction in which the door 120 is directed such that air exhausted from the exhaust duct 392 is exhausted toward the open space.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">As described above, the exhaust duct 392 is mounted in the door 120. In addition, the door 120 includes various parts, such as a frame for maintaining the strength of the door 120 and a noise isolation member for isolating noise. As a result, the interior space of the door 120 is limited. Consequently, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, the exhaust duct 392 is mounted in the door 120, such that the exhaust duct 392 is in tight contact with the inside of a panel 122 constituting the front of the door 120, for maximum spatial utilization.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">However, when the exhaust duct 392 having the first bent part 397 is mounted in the door 120 such that the exhaust duct 392 is in tight contact with the inside of the panel 122, the lower end 391 of the exhaust duct 392 protrudes outward from the front of the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> dish washing machine by the first bent part 397, which reduces the aesthetical appearance of the dish washing machine.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Consequently, as shown in FIG. and 6, the exhaust duct 392 includes a second bent part 398 at the exhaust duct 392 such that the inclined lower end 391 of the exhaust duct 392 is located in the door 120 of the dish washing machine. In addition, the second bent part 398 is formed at the upper side of the first bent part 397 of the exhaust duct 392. In more detail, the second bent part 398 is bent at least once in the rearward direction of the door 120, which is opposite to the direction in which the first bent part 397 is bent. Consequently, the first bent part 397, which is inclined to be directed toward the door 120, does not protrude outward from the dish washing machine, thereby increasing the aesthetical appearance of the dish washing machine.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">That is, the exhaust duct 392 is formed such that the second bent part 398 is bent in the direction opposite to the direction in which the door 120 is opened, and the first bent part 397 is bent in the direction in which the door is opened.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In addition, the present invention is not limited to the above-described construction. For example, when the inner space of the door 120 is sufficient, the exhaust duct 392 may be spaced by the protruding length of the inclined lower end 391 of the exhaust duct 392 from the panel 122 constituting the front of the door 120.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In addition, as discussed above, the exhaust duct 392 shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> includes the ribs 399 for guiding the flow of air exhausted from the exhaust duct 392. That is, one or more ribs 399 are preferable formed at the lower end 391 of the exhaust duct 392. The ribs 399 are also preferably inclined such that exhausted air flows not toward the sides of the dish washing machine, but toward a vertical center line C of the door 120 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">That is, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, the vertical center line C of the door 120 is an imaginary perpendicular line drawn perpendicularly to the installation surface at the outer middle part of the door 120. In addition, the ribs 399 being inclined minimizes the contact of the air exhausted from the exhaust duct 392 with the sides of the kitchen furniture located at the sides of the dish washing machine.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In addition, the present invention is not limited to the above-described construction. For example, the lower end of the exhaust duct may be inclined toward the vertical center line of the door.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Meanwhile, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, the exhaust duct 392 is mounted in the door 120, and preferably, the exhaust duct 392 is mounted in the door 120 such that the exhaust duct 392 is deviated to the left side or the right side when viewed from the front. The following description will be given on the assumption that the exhaust duct 392 is deviated to the left side.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In more detail, to reduce the flow loss of the air flowing in the exhaust duct 392, and<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGS. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>, the exhaust duct 392 is preferably formed such that the air is gradually diffused during the flow of the air in the exhaust duct 392. In addition, a sectional area of the exhaust duct 392 is gradually widened so the air is diffused in the exhaust duct.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Also, when the exhaust pressure of the air exhausted from the exhaust duct 392 is too low, the air is mixed with external air, the air is not sufficiently exhausted out of the dish washing machine, and is then diffused toward the bottom, the installation surface, and the sides of the dish washing machine. Consequently, an appropriate exhaust pressure is preferred.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In more detail, an appropriate exhaust pressure is related to the distance between the lower end 391 of the exhaust duct 392 and the outer surface of the door 120 of the dish washing machine, the sectional area and shape of the exhaust duct 392, and the blowing pressure of the exhaust fan 390. However, these factors may be changed depending upon the size or model of the dish washing machine.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">As previously described, the frame for maintaining the strength of the door and various components for noise isolation and watertightness are mounted in the door 120, with the result that the inner space of the door 120 is very small. Consequently, the cross section of the exhaust duct 392 is preferably gradually lowered along the downward direction of the exhaust duct 392, whereas the width of the exhaust duct 392 is gradually increased along the downward direction of the exhaust duct 392, to avoid interference with the components and to diffuse the air flowing in the exhaust duct 392.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Specifically, the cross section of an inlet end of the exhaust duct 392, which is coupled to the housing 394, is higher than the cross section of the lower end 391 of the exhaust duct 392 through which air is exhausted. Also, the width of the inlet end of the exhaust duct 392 coupled to the housing 394 is greater than the width of the lower end 391 of the exhaust duct 392 through which air is exhausted.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In addition, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, the exhaust duct 392 is also preferably formed in a structure in which the exhaust duct 392 has a step part 395 at least once such that the cross section of the exhaust duct 392 is gradually decreased along the downward direction of the exhaust duct 392.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">In addition, the step part 395 is preferably formed to avoid interference with the components mounted in the door 120. Also, the step part 395 may be formed to serve as a guide 396 for guiding the water flowing in the exhaust duct 392 to the water recovering hole 393 along the step part 395.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In addition, when the step part 395 is formed to serve as the guide 396, the top of the step part 395 is preferably formed to be inclined downward toward the water recovering hole 393. Specifically, the water flowing along the inside of the exhaust duct<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> 392 is guided to the water recovering hole 393 along the guide 396 of the step part 395.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">As previously described, the cross section of the exhaust duct 392 is gradually lowered along the downward direction of the exhaust duct 392, whereas the width of the exhaust duct 392 is gradually increased along the downward direction of the exhaust duct 392.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Further, the side (i.e., the right side) of the exhaust duct 392 facing the imaginary vertical center line C of the door 120 of the right and left sides of the exhaust duct 392 is preferably gradually inclined toward the vertical center line C of the door 120 along the downward direction of the exhaust duct 392.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Also, the side (i.e., the left side) of the exhaust duct 392 opposite to the side of the exhaust duct 392 facing the vertical center line C of the door 120 of the right and left sides of the exhaust duct 392 is preferably substantially formed perpendicularly to the installation surface. In addition, the point where the right side of the exhaust duct 392 starts to be inclined may be located above the middle height of the exhaust duct 392.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Further, because the right side of the exhaust duct 392 is inclined toward the vertical center line C of the door 120, and the left side of the exhaust duct 392 is substantially formed vertically, the width of the exhaust duct 392 is gradually increased along the downward direction of the exhaust duct 392. Consequently, the air flowing in the exhaust duct 392 is gradually diffused during the movement of the air to the lower end 391 of the exhaust duct 392, whereby flow loss or noise is reduced.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Also, the air exhausted from the exhaust duct 392 has inertia in which the air will diffuse in the exhaust duct 392. Consequently, the air exhausted from the exhaust duct 392 is exhausted toward the vertical center line C of the door 120, and therefore, the formation of moisture on the sides of the furniture located at the sides of the dish washing machine is minimized.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Consequently, the air in the tub of the dish washing machine according to an embodiment of the present invention is exhausted outside through the following process. In more detail, when the exhaust fan 390 is operated, high-temperature, high-humidity air in the tub 150 is suctioned into the housing 394 and is guided to the exhaust duct 392 by the exhaust fan 390.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">In addition, the side of the exhaust duct 392 facing the vertical center line C of the door 120 is inclined in the direction in which the exhaust duct 392 is widened. Consequently, the air flowing in the exhaust duct 392 is diffused in the direction in which exhaust duct 392 is widened, whereby flow loss or noise is reduced.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Meanwhile, moisture contained in the air is condensed in the exhaust duct 392 such that condensed water flows in the exhaust duct 392. Further, the condensed water flows along the inside of the exhaust duct 392, is guided to the water recovering hole 393 along the guide 396 formed at the step part 395, and is collected in the tub 150.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Also, the flow direction of air in the exhaust duct 392 is bent at the second bent part 398 of the exhaust duct 392 in the direction opposite to the direction in which the door is directed, and is bent at the first bent part 397 of the exhaust duct 392 in the direction in which the door is directed, i.e., in the opening direction of the door. Consequently, the air is exhausted from the exhaust duct 392 toward the front of the dish washing machine such that the flow direction of the air is at a predetermined angle to the installation surface.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">In addition, because the ribs 399 are formed at the lower end 391 of the exhaust duct 392, the air is exhausted toward the vertical center line C of the door 120.
