In use, the fluid mass present in the middle of the container is pushed downwards by the auger while being heated up by receiving heat from the bottom and side walls. The heating caused on fluid mass and solid granules determines, on one hand, a dissolution of the granules and, on the other hand, generates a convective motion which pushes the mass upwards thus determining, along with the forced motion generated by the auger, the bituminous material and dissolved granules mixing up.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The above-described mixing machines have various technical drawbacks.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Firstly, the dissolution of the solid granules may be obtained only by generating/transmitting high amounts of heat on/from the surfaces of the container, the latter being a particularly disadvantageous condition<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> because a great amount of energy is employed for heating the diathermic oil and thus it negatively affects the total production costs of the bituminous mix.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Furthermore, the above-described mixing machine is not very efficient when mixing solid granules characterized by a particularly high specific weight. Indeed, in this case, due to their weight the solid granules tend to deposit on the bottom wall of the container, not mixing homogenously with the remaining bituminous mix.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In addition, the above-described mixing machine is not very efficient whenever solid granules characterized by a series of inner impurities having a high toughness need to be mixed. Indeed, in this case, the complete dissolution of the granule and impurities may be obtained only by considerably increasing the thermal energy and extending homogenisation times, i.e. the working times of the auger. Unfortunately, both these conditions determine prohibitive energy costs. In addition, whenever the aforesaid complete dissolution condition is not achieved, solid impurities are deposited inside the bituminous mix which causes a weakening and a thus a deterioration of the inner structure thereof.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP62057636A"><text>JP62057636A</text></patcit> discloses an apparatus for high viscosity liquid wherein a raw material is fed through a feed port 6 into the reaction vessel 1 and is stirred and mixed by a ribbon screw 12 and plate vanes 19 via the driving shaft 7 which is driven by a motor 9.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5683178A"><text>US5683178</text></patcit> relates to an agitator blades formed by connecting a plurality of frame members are provided in a cylindrical or conical container to realize the agitator blade structure without rotary shaft.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="GB628891A"><text>GB628891</text></patcit> relates to a mixing machine of the rotary mill type and discloses a mixing machine according to the preamble of claim 1.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP1022332A"><text>JP1022332</text></patcit> discloses an agitating crusher wherein The material, such as ground fresh, is agitated and crushed by the spiral agitating and crushing member 10, and pushed upward along the peripheral side wall surface 9, and sent downward along the central axis after reached to the upper surface.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">It is an object of the present invention to provide a mixing machine for homogenising the bituminous liquid material with solid granules which is capable of overcoming the above-described drawbacks.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to the present invention, a mixing machine is provided for homogenising liquid bituminous material containing solid granules as set forth in claim 1 and preferably, but not necessarily, in any one of the claims either directly or indirectly depending from claim 1.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate a non-limitative embodiment thereof, in which:

During this<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> step, the rotation of the helicoidal blade 20 further subjects the components of the mix to a centrifugal force which tends to push them towards the inner surface 2a of container 2. In particular, during the rotation of the helicoidal blade 20, the solid granules having a higher specific weight than the remaining material conveniently tend to be accumulated on surfaces 2a.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">At this point, the rotation of pressure rollers 16 on surface 2a causes the crushing of the solid granules accumulated at the surface 2a itself, and at the same time the rotation of the helicoidal blade 20 determines the scraping of the crushed solid granules adhering onto surface 2a. Thereby, the crushed solid granules are thus detached from the surface 2a and gradually pushed upwards by the helicoidal blade 20.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Furthermore, during this step, the scraping blade 23 is also rotated, which conveniently scrapes the bottom surface 2b of container 2, thus canceling all possibilities of settling the bituminous mix or components thereof on the surface 2b.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The rotation of the helicoidal blade 20 clearly also determines a convenient mixing of the different components, in addition to the action of scraping the inner surface 2a, the action of lifting the components upwards, and the action of pushing the granules outwards.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">It is worth specifying that the motion impressed to the bituminous mix within the container has an ascending<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> component deriving from the action of the helicoidal blade 20 and a descending component associated with the convective motion of the mix itself. In particular, the helicoidal blade 20 moves the bituminous mix from the bottom surface 2b, along a vertical upward path Pu, towards the upper surface 2c. Once the bituminous mix has reached the upper surface 2c, by virtue of a convective motion, it follows a downward path Pd which crosses the central non-intercepting volume of the mix towards the bottom surface 2b.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The convective downward motion of the mix is generated by the temperature differential of the mix present in the container, which clearly has an appreciably lower temperature in the central part than the mix at the surface 2a.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The above-described mixing machine 1 has several advantages.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">First, the presence of the pressure rollers allows to perform a homogenous mechanical crushing of the solid granules regardless of the toughness thereof, thereby determining both a high homogenisation of the bituminous mix and thus an excellent quality thereof, and a reduction of the thermal energy required for dissolving the components.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In this case, laboratory tests demonstrated that the introduction of mechanical crushing of granules allows to remarkably reduce the total electric power employed. More in detail, the above-described machine<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> requires an electric power of about 30 kW, while the electric powers employed in currently known mixing machines is typically higher than 75 kW.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Second, the presence of the helicoidal blade increases the degree of homogenisation of the components, in addition to keeping the inner surface of the container constantly clean, with obvious advantages in terms of reduction of maintenance and cleaning operations of the container.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">It is worth adding that the scraping action performed by the helicoidal blade is advantageous even from the point of view of energy consumption because it prevents the formation of a surface layer of material on the inner surface. Indeed, such a layer would act as a thermal insulation, thus reducing the conduction heat exchange between the inner surface and the mix, thus determining a major reduction of the machine efficiency.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In addition to the above, the use of the scraping blade also allows to advantageously shape the container with a flat bottom surface instead of the tapered surface present in known mixing machines, thus allowing any sizing of the container in terms of diameter and height, and obtaining a volume however having the standard capacity required by the market.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In particular, by virtue of the use of the scraping blade, the container may be dimensioned so as to have an inner diameter of about 2000 mm and a height of 3500 mm, and thus a capacity of about 10 cubic meters, indeed<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> corresponding to the standard capacity required by the market. Laboratory tests demonstrated that a better thermal efficiency and a more effective mixing are determined by reducing the aforesaid dimensions of the container and increasing its height/diameter ratio.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">It is finally apparent that changes and variations may be made to the machine described and illustrated herein, without departing from the scope of the present invention as defined in the claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980109" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Bitumenmischvorrichtung (1), betreibbar zum Mischen einer flüssigen Mischung, die Bitumen mit festen Körnern enthält, zum Gewinnen einer homogenisierten flüssigen Bitumenmischung, wobei die Vorrichtung enthält:
