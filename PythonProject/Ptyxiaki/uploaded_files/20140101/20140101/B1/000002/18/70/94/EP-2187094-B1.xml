Description of Related Art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">There are two types of transmissions: variable (or multi-ratio) transmissions and continuously variable transmissions. Continuously variable transmissions can keep the motor in optimal working condition all the time so as to make the overall efficiency higher than the variable transmission. The existing continuously variable transmissions CVT, IVT both rely on friction to transfer power, so they are unsuitable for high power, heavy-duty vehicles or machines. Moreover, due to the presence of abrasion, the service life is shorter than that of variable transmission. In the existing art, a variable transmission generally includes no more than 16 shift gears. With more shift gears, the structure becomes more complicated, and volume, weight and cost are higher. Furthermore, a clutch is required when shifting gears, and power interruption and loss may take place during shifting, so it is not desirable to design too many shifts.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Reference may be made to <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2006122507A"><text>WO 2006/122507 (Zhang</text></patcit>), which constitutes the closest prior art, and <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US2669885A"><text>US 2669885 (Fedri</text></patcit>), which show variable transmissions in which the size of a gear is varied by inserting or withdrawing chain links.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">The present invention aims at providing an inner gear ring with variable tooth-number<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> and a variable transmission using the inner gear ring with variable tooth-number, which changes the transmission ratio of the planetary gear train through the tooth-number variation of the inner gear ring with variable tooth-number, thus realizing more steps of speeds than the existing multi-speed transmission.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The invention is defined in claim 1.

It comprises driver plates 29, 30; round pins 31 are configured on the driver plates 29, 30; several grooves 28 are mounted on the traction rod 27, and the diameter of the round pins 31 rotating around the shift driver plates (29, 30) is equal to the distance between the adjacent shift grooves 28, the distance of the grooves 28=( teeth<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> spacing of the inner gear ring B) × [1+1/(2π)<sup>2</sup>]<sup>1/2</sup>, namely, the movement of traction rod 27 by a distance of grooves 28 just push or draw out a tooth into or from the inner gear ring B. The shift driver plates 29, 30 are driven by the rotation of the supporting sliding rail 17 around the shaft of the main sun gear 11, and the rotating speed of the shift driver plates 29, 30 is a half of that of the supporting sliding rail 17 (= 1/2 of the quantity of outer planetary gears). When the outer planetary gear 13 passes through the first tooth 6 of the gear ring connecting interface A, the round pins 31 are just at the position aligning with the opening of the grooves 28; two shift driver plates 29, 30 can make axial movement through a mechanical or electromagnetic device. When the shift driver plates 29, 30 are in the original location, the round pins 31 are not in contact with the traction rod 27.

When the driver plate 29 rotates clockwise and the traction rod 27 work, the traction rod 27 moves in top-right direction as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 8</figref>; when the driver plate 30 rotates anticlockwise and the traction rod 27 work, the traction rod 27 moves in bottom-left direction as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 8</figref>. Therefore, when shifting is required, the shift driver plate 29 or 30 is pushed to the traction rod 27 through a mechanical or electromagnetic device, with the rotation of the driver plate 29 or 30, the round pins 31 enter into the grooves 28 to poke the traction rod 27 for movement, after the round pins 31 rotates out from the grooves 28, the shift driver plate 29 or 30 returns to the original location, round pins 31 deviate from the traction rod 27; during the shifting above, after the outer planetary gear 13 passes through the first tooth 6 of the gear ring connecting interfaces A, the traction rod 27 is moved to push or draw out teeth into or from the inner gear ring B, and drives the screws 19 to rotate to change the distance between the two tapered discs 7, 8.
