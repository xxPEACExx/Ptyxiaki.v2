Field of the Invention:</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to phosphorus compounds and methods for preparing the same, and more particularly, to a phosphorous compound with high solubility and a method for preparing the same.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of Related Art:</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In order to meet the demand for thin circuits and high density, laminates need excellent electrical property, mechanical performance and particularly resistance to thermal processing. As to a common FR4 laminate, its glass transition temperature is approximately 130°C after curing. During fabrication of printed circuit boards, laminates have cracking or a popcorn effect due to the processes of stripping and drilling over 200°C, or even welding processes over 270°C. Thus, there are developments on various types of laminate materials with high thermal stability and high glass transition temperatures. In addition, laminates have a further important property, flame resistance, which is advantageous to applications of laminates in some fields, for examples, transportation vehicles like planes, automobiles and public transportation vehicles. Hence, flame resistance of printed circuit boards is absolutely essential.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">To increase flame resistance of laminate materials, certain substances having the property of insolating flame to reduce burning are used. As to laminates, halogen compounds, especially bromide-containing epoxy resins and curing agents, are used conventionally with flame retardants such as antimony trioxide to meet the requirement of flame resistance (e.g., UL 94V-0 level). Generally, an epoxy resin must have up to<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> 17-21% bromide, and be used with antimony trioxide or other flame retardants to pass UL 94V-0. However, use of bromide-containing epoxy resins or antimony trioxide undoubtedly has adverse effects on human health, because antimony trioxide is reported as a carcinogenic compound. Further, during burning, bromide generates corrosive bromine radicals and hydrogen bromide, and high concentrations of aromatic compounds in bromide also generate highly toxic bromofurans and bromodioxins, thereby severely affecting human health and the environment.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Currently, the use of phosphorous compounds as the next generation of environmentally friendly flame retardant has been widely investigated and applied. For example, a flame-resistant epoxy resin composition formed from a phosphorus compound disclosed in Taiwanese Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="TW575633"><text>575633</text></patcit> passes UL 94V-0, and does not release corrosive and highly toxic gases upon heating. However, phosphorus compounds, due to their own structures, are nearly insoluble in solvents commonly applied to epoxy resin compositions, and it is soluble only in solvents with higher polarity. Consequently, solvents with higher polarity are necessary if phosphorous compounds are to be used, thereby causing inconvenience in processing or application.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP6166764A"><text>JP 06-166,764 A</text></patcit> discloses a reaction product obtained by three-dimensionally crosslinking polyester resin with the main terminal being a hydroxyl group and a specific organophosphorous compound making use of a curing agent which is reactive with hydroxyl group.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Wang et al. disclose in Journal of Polymer Science, vol. 36, p. 3051 to 3061 (1998</text></nplcit>) different phosphorous containing compounds, which shall be usable as a flame retardant.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly, there still exists a need for a flame-resistant additive with high solubility and a high pyrolysis temperature, which is capable of being applied to thermosetting or thermoplastic resins.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is an aspect of the present invention to provide a phosphorus compound with high solubility and a method for preparing the same.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is another aspect of the present invention to provide a phosphorus compound with a high pyrolysis temperature and a method for preparing the same.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It is a further aspect of the present invention to provide a phosphorus compound<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> that is capable of being used as a flame-resistant additive and a method for preparing the same.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In order to attain the above and other aspects, the present invention provides a phosphorous compound of formula (I):
