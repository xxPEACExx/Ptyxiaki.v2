load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention refers to a rotary hook for a lockstitch sewing machine, both for home and for industrial use, which comprises means to reduce the noise thereof.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">The invention further refers to a lockstitch sewing machine comprising means to reduce the noise of a rotary hook and to a method for reducing the noise of a rotary hook.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The rotary hook can be of the type with a horizontal axis of rotation or of the type with a vertical axis of rotation.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Lockstitch sewing machines and the associated rotary hooks are well known and therefore will not be described herein, where it will merely be recalled that the rotary hook comprises at least one hook body, which is connected to a shaft from which it receives motion and which comprises a cylindrical cavity, a basket free to rotate inside the cylindrical cavity of the hook body, a gib which helps to constrain the basket to the hook body and possibly a bobbin case which is placed inside the basket and which helps to constrain the bobbin to the basket.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The shaft can be integral with the hook body or housed in a hole present in the centre of the cylindrical cavity.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The basket is constrained to the hook body by a rib, formed on the outer surface thereof, which engages in a race, formed in the inner wall of the cylindrical cavity of the hook body, which prevents an axial and a radial translation of the basket with respect to the cylindrical cavity, but not a rotation thereof.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">This race of the hook body consists of a C-shaped groove delimited by two plane surfaces parallel to each other and by a cylindrical surface perpendicular to the plane ones.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The race of the hook body and the rib of the basket must be interrupted for a certain angular sector to allow the needle thread to pass and the stitch to be formed: these interruptions prevent the use of bearings, making necessary a coupling of the sliding type (or with sliding friction) between the race of the hook body and the rib of the basket and also causing, during the rotation of the hook body, noise (due to the play existing between the rib of the basket and the race of the hook body and to the fact that they are habitually made of metal materials) which is enhanced by vibration and resonance phenomena.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the current state of the art, it is not possible to eliminate said play and the causes of the noise are so interdependent with each other that they cannot be identified with certainty or eliminated by adopting suitable geometric shapes and/or by imposing more restrictive dimensional or surface tolerances, which would in any case increase the production cost of the rotary hook.</p><p id="p0010"

vertical axis in which the basket and the hook body are made of synthetic material (synthetic resins) and the basket is constrained to the hook body by magnetic elements inserted in the bottom wall of the basket and on the bottom of the cylindrical cavity of the hook body, allowing the structure of the hook to be simplified (for example, the gib and C-shaped race formed in the inner wall of the cylindrical cavity of the hook body are not provided) and the production costs thereof to be reduced.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US4429649A"><text>US

engages in a L-shaped race, provided in the inner wall of the cylindrical cavity of the hook body and delimited by only one plane surface and by a cylindrical surface perpendicular to the plane one, suitable to prevent merely the radial translation of the basket in the cylindrical cavity.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Said basket is free to fluctuate in axial direction and a magnet positioned at the bottom of the cylindrical cavity of the hook body provides to adjust the tension of the lower thread.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><patcit id="pcit0004"

hook in which, to reduce the friction between the rib of the basket and the race of the hook body, the rib of the basket is made to "float" in the race of the hook body by means of a cushion of air.

The reduction in friction leads to a reduction in the thread tension necessary for stitching and to a reduction in wear on parts.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Object of the present invention is to provide a rotary hook comprising means suitable to reduce the noise thereof within negligible noise limits with respect to the noise of the sewing machine; in particular, an object of the present invention is to provide a rotary hook whose noise is less than 45 db even in cases in which, in the absence of the above means, the noise of said hook would exceed 68 db.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">This object has been achieved by means of the rotary hook of independent claim 1, which comprises means suitable to apply to the basket an axial pressure which obliges the rib of the basket to lean against one of the two plane surfaces of the race present in the cylindrical cavity of the hook body, instead of vibrating freely in said race because of the play always present between said rib and said race.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">This axial pressure has the effect of stabilising the basket, preventing vibration and resonance thereof.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Further advantageous characteristics form the subject matter of the dependent claims.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In previously cited <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US7171914B"><text>US patent 7171914</text></patcit> (or <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="EP1640490A"><text>EP 1640490</text></patcit>) magnets are used to constrain to the hook body a basket made of synthetic material, which would otherwise be free to float, because of the simplification of the hook structure (L-shaped race instead of C-shaped race and related absence of the gib). This invention does not concern the problem of the noise in that, by using a basket and a hook body of synthetic material, the noise produced during the rotation of the hook body is already per se minimal.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In previously cited <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US4429649A"><text>US 4429649</text></patcit> a magnet is used to adjust the tension of the lower thread.
