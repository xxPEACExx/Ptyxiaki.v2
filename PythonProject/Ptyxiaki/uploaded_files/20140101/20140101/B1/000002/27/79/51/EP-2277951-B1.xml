load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">Technical Field</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a polyphenylene ether resin composition having a narrow molecular weight distribution, which is excellent in terms of fluidity during processing, and further, which suppresses the generation of gel and has excellent chemical resistance.</p><heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Polyphenylene ether (hereinafter also referred to as "PPE") is excellent in terms of processability and productivity, and products or components with desired shapes can be efficiently produced from such polyphenylene ether according to molding methods such as a melt injection molding method or a melt extrusion molding method. Accordingly, polyphenylene ether has been widely used as a material for products or components in the field of electric and electronic materials, automobiles, various types of industrial materials, and wrapping materials for food products. With the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> diversification of intended uses, it has been desired to produce many types of polyphenylene ethers which are excellent in terms of heat resistance and mechanical characteristics and further have different characteristics such as molecular weight and glass transition temperature.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In general, with regard to polyphenylene ether, there is known the phenomenon that its reduced viscosity increases during thermal processing (see Patent Literatures 1 and 2). Accordingly, a molecular design target at the polymerization stage of polyphenylene ether differs from a molecular design target after thermal processing, and thus, operations often become complicated. Therefore, it has been desired to produce polyphenylene ether, the reduced viscosity of which does not change before and after heating, and which maintains a narrow molecular weight distribution in order to maintain physical properties.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It has been generally thought that, when fluidity is required during processing, a wide molecular weight distribution is favorable. On the other hand, a narrow molecular weight distribution is desirable in terms of physical properties. Hence, it has been desired to produce polyphenylene ether, which achieves both good fluidity during processing and good physical properties, namely, has a narrow molecular weight distribution and excellent fluidity during processing. However, under the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> current circumstances, sufficient studies have not yet been done with regard to this matter.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent Literature 2 discloses a PPE composition, which is formed by adding monoamine to polyphenylene ether powder and then subjecting the obtained mixture to press molding at 250°C for the purpose of improving photostability.<br/>
In addition, Patent Literature 3 discloses a PPE composition, which is formed by subjecting polyphenylene ether that has been denatured with benzylamine to press molding in the presence of benzylamine at 280°C. In this publication, a PPE composition, which maintains mechanical strength and suppresses coloration and viscosity increase during heating, can be obtained.<br/>
Moreover, Patent Literature 4 discloses polyphenylene ether and polystyrene-based resin compositions, to which polyamine is added as a weld strength promoter for the purpose of improving weld strength.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006"><ul><li>Patent Literature 1<br/>

As a result, these methods are not suitable for mass and stable production. Moreover, since amine is not uniformly mixed with polyphenylene ether in press molding, the possibility that the effect of containing amine is unevenly distributed cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, the aforementioned publications contain no descriptions regarding the improvement of reduced viscosity after heating, molecular weight distribution, the generation of gel, and chemical resistance. Under the current circumstances, polyethylene ether, which achieves no generation of gel, good productivity, and no decreased chemical resistance,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> while maintaining a narrow molecular weight distribution, has not yet been produced by any methods.<br/>
Further, referring to Examples of Patent Literature 4, there is a linear relationship between the amount of a weld strength promoter and weld strength. As described in Examples, in order to obtain a sufficient weld strength, polyamine should be added in an amount of 5% by mass or more based on the mass of polyphenylene ether.<br/>
In this case, as described in Reference Examples later, since the addition of a large amount of polyamine deteriorates chemical resistance, it is impossible to achieve both chemical resistance and strength only by mixing polyamine with polyphenylene ether.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Under the above-mentioned circumstances, it is an object of the present invention to provide a polyphenylene ether resin composition having a narrow molecular weight distribution, which is excellent in terms of fluidity during processing, and further, which suppresses the generation of gel and has excellent chemical resistance.</p><heading id="h0007">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">As a result of intensive studies direct towards achieving the aforementioned object, the present inventors have found that the object can be achieved with<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> a polyphenylene ether resin composition obtainable by melt-mixing a polyphenylene ether (A) comprising specific structural unit(s) with a nitrogen compound (B) comprising a specific structure, wherein the polyphenylene ether (A) comprises 0.1% by mass or more and 1.5% by mass or less of at least one type of aromatic hydrocarbon containing 7 or 8 carbon atoms, even if wherein a content of the nitrogen compound (B) is extremely smaller than that in prior art techniques.

When the ratio of each solvent is within the aforementioned range, a scale of the precipitated particles to a reaction vessel becomes extremely small, and thus stable particles are generated. If the ratio of the good solvent is smaller than the aforementioned range, an extremely long polymerization time may be required to obtain a desired molecular weight, or heating from the outside may be required during polymerization. Thus, there may be a case in which polyphenylene ether cannot be efficiently obtained.

The polymerization solution preferably exhibits such a slurry state at a polymerization percentage between 55% and 99% based on the total amounts of the phenol compounds, although it depends on oxygen supply per unit time of polymerization or the ratio between the good solvent and the poor solvent used as the polymerization solvent. Polyphenylene ether having a narrow molecular weight distribution tends to be obtained by the phenomenon that the polymerization solution exhibits such a slurry state at the midpoint of polymerization. When the polymerization degree is increased in the state of a solution without exhibiting a slurry state, a viscosity in a polymerization tank is increased and it becomes difficult to produce polyphenylene ether, or amounts of the phenol compounds used for polymerization need to be decreased or large amounts of the solvents need to be used in order to avoid viscosity increase.

shown in Examples 1 to 38 each maintained a narrow molecular weight distribution as a result of the addition of a small amount of the nitrogen compound (B), and that these polyphenylene ether resin compositions achieved both good chemical resistance and fluidity during processing. Moreover, the generation of gel was not confirmed.<br/>
Furthermore, the granulated products of these resin compositions had a mean particle diameter of 1 mm or more,<!-- EPO <DP n="67"> --> without the generation of fine particles, and were excellent in terms of handleability such as no dust floating.<br/>
In contrast, since the polyphenylene ether resin compositions produced in Comparative Examples 1 to 4 did not contain such a nitrogen compound (B), they had a wide molecular weight distribution, and the generation of gel was also confirmed. Further, these polyphenylene ether resin compositions were inferior to the polyphenylene ether resin compositions of the above-mentioned Examples in terms of fluidity during processing and chemical resistance.<br/>
The polyphenylene ether resin compositions produced in Reference Examples 1 to 12 had excellent fluidity during processing, but had poor chemical resistance.<br/>
That is to say, these results show that, if a nitrogen compound (B) is added in an amount more than necessary, it becomes difficult to achieve both fluidity during processing and chemical resistance.<br/>
It is assumed that, since the polyphenylene ether resin compositions produced in Comparative Examples 5 to 7 did not contain a sufficient amount of aromatic hydrocarbon in the polyphenylene ether (A), the diffusion of the nitrogen compound (B) into the resin became insufficient. Thereby, these resin compositions had a wide molecular weight distribution, the generation of gel was confirmed, and further, a sufficient improvement was<!-- EPO <DP n="68"> --> not done with regard to fluidity during processing and chemical resistance.</p><p id="p0123" num="0123">The present application is based on a Japanese patent application (Patent Application No. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2008125231A"><text>2008-125231</text></patcit>), filed to the Japan Patent Office on May 12, 2008; the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><heading id="h0033">Industrial Applicability</heading><p id="p0124" num="0124">The polyphenylene ether resin composition of the present invention is excellent in terms of fluidity during molding and suppresses the generation of gel.
