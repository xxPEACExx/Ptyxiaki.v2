More particularly, the present invention relates to compositions for the oral delivery of corticosteroids.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Oral corticosteroids are used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis where they act principally topically to suppress the inflammatory response. The use of oral corticosteroids for the treatment of glomerulonephritis via local intestinal action has also been described (<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6239120B"><text>US 6,239,120</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Corticosteroids can cause undesirable side-effects if there is long-term systemic exposure, such as Cushings syndrome and osteoporosis. Therefore, corticosteroids are currently typically used to treat the acute symptoms of the diseases mentioned above but are not generally used for long-term treatment.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is desirable to minimise systemic exposure to corticosteroids. One approach is to use rectal dosage forms such as suppositories and enemas which are effective at delivering drug into the distal regions of the colon. Oral formulations which provide targeted drug delivery to the small intestine and colon have also been devised. These typically comprise tablets or pellets which are coated to prevent drug release in the upper regions of the gastrointestinal tract. Coatings described for this purpose include enteric (gastroresistant) materials which are insoluble in stomach acid and dissolve in intestinal fluid. Materials which are biodegraded by the microflora residing in the colon have also been described, such as in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6534549B"><text>US 6,534,549</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP0754452A"><text>EP-A-0754452</text></patcit> describes a pharmaceutical preparation which can release contents of a capsule at a lower part of the digestive tract, such as a coated capsule that can deliver its contents selectively to a desired site e.g. the large intestine and quickly release its contents thereat.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO9107172A"><text>WO 91/07172</text></patcit> describes an oral pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment of inflammatory bowl disease and the use of certain glucocosteriods in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment by the oral route of ulcerative colitis and certain aspects of Crohn's disease.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The listing or discussion of an apparently prior-published document in this specification should not necessarily be taken as an acknowledgement that the document is part of the state of the art or is common general knowledge.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide an oral drug delivery composition which allows a corticosteroid drug to reach an area to be treated, such as an inflamed part of the bowel in sufficient concentration and for a sufficient length of time to provide a local therapeutic effect. For example, in the case of Crohn's disease, this therapeutic effect may be required in the whole bowel or only in the small intestine or in the case of ulcerative colitis it may be required in the caecum, colon and the rectum. In the case of glomerulonephritis,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> sufficient drug concentration is required in the lower third of the small intestine and the upper quarter of the large intestine so that the drug can exert its effect through the intestinal wall of these parts of the intestine. In other words, it is an object of the invention to provide an oral drug delivery composition for delivering a corticosteroid drug to the intestine or to a particular part or parts of the intestine.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention provides compositions according to claim 1 for the oral delivery of a corticosteroid drug. The compositions of the invention are typically formulated so that in use, following oral administration, the drug is delivered to the intestine and in the intestine drug release is controlled to provide sustained release of the drug.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The compositions of the invention provide for delayed and controlled/sustained release of the drug. They comprise a delayed release component and a sustained release component. The delayed release component substantially prevents release of the drug in the stomach; rather release is delayed until the composition reaches the intestine after oral delivery. When the composition reaches the intestine the delayed release component dissolves or disintegrates to allow the sustained release component (and therefore the drug) to be released. The sustained release component prevents immediate release of all of the drug. The drug is released over a period of time as it passes through the intestine.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The invention provides an oral drug delivery composition comprising a sustained release component which comprises a corticosteroid drug and which is contained within a capsulé that has been treated so that the sustained release component is predominately released from the capsule in the intestine following oral administration.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Any suitable capsule may be used. Preferably the capsule is a hard capsule, for example, a gelatin, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, pullulan or starch capsule. Starch capsules are preferred.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present invention also provides an oral drug delivery composition comprising:
<ol><li>(a) a sustained release component comprising a corticosteroid drug, an alkali-containing ethyl cellulose material and an acid; and</li><li>(b) a delayed release component which substantially prevents release of the sustained release component until the composition reaches the intestine following oral administration.</li></ol><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Any suitable corticosteroid drug may be used in the present invention. Suitable drugs include, but are not limited to, aclometasone, beclomethasone, betamethasone, clobetasol, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, flunisolide, methylprednisolone, mometasone, prednisolone, triamcinolone, budesonide, fluticasone, ciclesonide and fludrocortisone. A preferred corticosteroid for use in this invention is budesonide, (16a,17-[(1RS)-butylidenebis(oxy)]-11β,21-dihydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione).

In humans, the small intestine comprises the duodenum, jejunum and ileum and the large intestine comprises the caecum and colon.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">By the use of phrases such as "delivering a corticosteroid drug to the intestine" or "delivering the sustained release component to the intestine" and "drug is predominately released from the capsule in the intestine" or "the sustained release component is predominately released from the capsule in the intestine" we mean that following oral administration substantially none of the drug is released in the upper regions of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the stomach. For example, no more than 15%, preferably no more than 10% and most preferably no more that 5% of the drug is released from the drug delivery composition before it reaches the intestine. Typically, drug release will start in the small intestine. However, drug release may be substantially delayed until the drug delivery composition reaches the large intestine or may be targeted to start in a particular part of the intestine such as the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum or colon.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The sustained release component controls the rate at which drug is released from the dosage form. More particularly, it controls the rate of drug release once the dosage form has reached the intestine after oral administration.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">By the term "sustained release" we mean that not all of the drug is released immediately on the delayed release component dissolving or disintegrating, rather the drug is released over<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> a period of time. The period of time over which the drug is released can be controlled (as will be explained in more detail below) and the desired length of the period over which the drug is release will depend, at least in part, on the condition to be treated.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">For humans, it typically takes orally administered substances from 3 to 5 hours to pass through the small intestine and 25 to 50 hours to pass through the large intestine.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">It will be appreciated that the release profile (<i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>) exhibited by the compositions of the invention will depend on the disease indication to be treated. For example, an appropriate <i>in vivo</i> profile for treatment of Crohn's disease would be minimal (e.g. &lt;5% of dose) release of drug in the stomach with significant release (&gt;5% of dose) beginning in the upper small intestine (duodenum/jejunum) and continuing for from about 6 to about 24 hours. For ulcerative colitis, an appropriate profile would be for significant drug release to begin in the lower small intestine (terminal ileum) or caecum and to continue for from about 6 to 24 hours. For glomerulonephritis, a suitable profile would be for significant drug release to begin in the ileum and to continue for from about 2 to 6 hours or so that drug release occurs predominately in the lower third of the small intestine and the upper quarter of the large intestine.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">An appropriate <i>in vitro</i> dissolution test would be to use the European Pharmacopoeia paddle or basket apparatus or United States Pharmacopeia apparatus 1 or 2 and a pH-change methodology such as 2 hours in acid medium followed by a simulated intestinal medium at 37°C e.g. pH 6.8 phosphate buffer. The table below provides examples of <i>in vitro</i> dissolution profiles which may be appropriate for treating different disease conditions:

Examples of suitable rate-controlling materials include, but are not limited to, cellulose derivatives, acrylic polymers and copolymers, vinyl polymers, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, ethylcellulose, cellulose acetate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvidone acetate, polyvinyl acetate, polymethacrylates, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A preferred rate-controlling polymer for use in the sustained release element of the compositions of this invention is ethylcellulose. Ethylcellulose is a hydrophobic polymer which forms an excellent barrier to drug diffusion. However, the material is water insoluble and will only form solutions in organic solvents such as chloroform and tetrahydrofuran. Some water-based ethylcellulose coating systems where the polymer is in the form of a latex which fuses to form a continuous layer when dried onto a surface have been developed. Proprietary aqueous ethylcellulose preparations include Surelease® (Colorcon, West Point, PA, USA) and Aquacoat® ECD (FMC Biopolymer, Philadelphia, USA).</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Surelease® is an alkali-containing ethylcellulose material. To produce Surelease®, ethylcellulose is blended with oleic acid and dibutyl sebacate, then extruded and melted. The molten plasticised ethylcellulose is then directly emulsified in ammoniated water. Ammonium oleate is formed in situ to stabilise and form a dispersion of plasticised ethylcellulose particles (<patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US4123403A"><text>US 4,123,403</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US4502888A"><text>US 4,502,888</text></patcit>). As a result of the inclusion of ammonia, Surelease® has an alkaline pH.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">When the delayed release component is a starch capsule that has been treated so that the sustained release component is predominately released from the capsule in the intestine the rate-controlling material preferably comprises an alkali-containing ethylcellulose material, more preferably an ammonia-containing ethylcellulose, such as Surelease®.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">For other compositions of the invention the rate-controlling material comprises an alkali-containing ethylcellulose material, preferably an ammonia-containing ethylcellulose, such as Surelease®.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The rate-controlling material may comprise one or more ingredients. For example, a combination of ingredients that control the rate at which the drug is released may be used. By appropriate selection of the or each ingredient of the rate-controlling material the time period over which the drug is released can be controlled.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The rate-controlling material typically comprises an alkali-containing ethylcellulose material. However, it has been found that some alkali-containing ethylcellulose materials, for example ammonia-containing ethylcellulose materials such as Surelease®, when used alone can provide a significant barrier to corticosteroid release allowing drug to be liberated only slowly. This may be suitable for some applications. However, if there is a need to provide a faster rate of corticosteroid release it is preferable that a water soluble material (ie a material that has a solubility of at least 10 mg/ml in water at 20 °C) is mixed with the alkali-containing ethylcellulose material in order to increase the permeability of the rate-controlling material when placed into an aqueous medium, such as the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Preferred water soluble materials for inclusion in the rate-controlling material include, but are not limited to, mannitol, dextrose, sucrose, polyethylene glycol, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, methylcellulose, triacetin and polyvinyl alcohol.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Although alkali-containing ethylcellulose materials, such as ammonia-containing ethylcellulose, for example Surelease®, form sustained release components with corticosteroids which have advantageous release profiles, their alkaline nature has been found to cause corticosteroid degradation such that the drug formulation has only a limited shelf life.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Surprisingly, the present inventors have found that the stability of corticosteroid drugs in the presence of an alkali-containing ethylcellulose material can be improved by the incorporation of an acid into the sustained release component of the compositions of the invention.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The acid used is preferably a weak acid. By the term "weak acid" we mean acids which have a pKa of less than about 6.5. Suitable acids include organic acids. Examples of suitable acids include citric acid, glutamic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid and monobasic sodium phosphate. Especially preferred acids are citric acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid and monobasic sodium phosphate. The most preferred acid is citric acid.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The sustained release component of the compositions of the present invention typically comprises a drug-containing core coated with one or more coating layers. However, other structures are possible. For example, two or more of the drug, the acid and the alkali-containing ethylcellulose material may be contained within a matrix together with one or more suitable inert matrix materials. Such matrixes may, for example, be in the form of microspheres, tablets or beads.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The core typically comprises: a) drug alone as individual or agglomerated crystalline or amorphous particles; b) particles containing a substantially uniform dispersion of drug in an inert matrix (ie the drug is distributed substantially evenly throughout the matrix); or c) inert particles to which a layer of drug has been applied. Cores of types b) and c) are preferred and type c) is especially preferred.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">If drug alone is the core then it is preferable that the particles are of substantially uniform size and shape as this can result in more even coating of the core particles.
