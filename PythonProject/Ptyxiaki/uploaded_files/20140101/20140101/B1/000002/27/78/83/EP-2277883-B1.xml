The coating may form a layer on a variety of components that need to withstand high and degrading temperatures. For example, the protective coating may be used as insulating tapes for coating thermoplastic automobile accessories. In addition, the protective coating may also be used in xerographic components, such as, fuser components, photoreceptor components, and the like. In embodiments, the coating is used in imaging apparatus members and components, for use in electrostatographic, including digital, apparatuses. More particularly, the present embodiments pertain to a fuser component having an outer coating comprised of a cross-linking composition that improves resistance to thermal degradation and extends the service life of the fuser component. In other embodiments, the outer coating comprising the cross-linking composition is incorporated as an outer protective layer in various other imaging apparatus members or components that operate under high temperature conditions.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">The components, including pressure components, fuser components, donor components, and heating components, and the like, are useful for many purposes including fixing a toner image to a copy substrate.

In other embodiments, the outer layer has an outer release layer thereon. In further embodiments, there is positioned between the substrate and the outer layer, an intermediate and/or adhesive layer. The present invention may be useful as fuser members in xerographic machines, including color machines.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In a typical electrostatographic reproducing apparatus, a light image of an original to be copied is recorded in the form of an electrostatic latent image upon a photosensitive member and the latent image is subsequently rendered visible by the application of electroscopic thermoplastic resin particles which are commonly referred to as toner. The visible toner image is then in a loose powdered form and can be easily disturbed or destroyed. The toner image is usually fixed or fused upon a support, which may be the photosensitive member itself, or other support sheet such as plain paper.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The use of thermal energy for fixing toner images onto a support member is well known and methods include providing the application of heat and pressure substantially concurrently by various means, a roll pair maintained in pressure contact, a belt member in pressure contact with a roll, a belt member in pressure contact with a heater, and the like. Heat may be applied by heating one or both of the rolls, plate members, or belt members. With a fixing apparatus using a thin film in pressure contact with a heater, the electric power consumption is small, and the warming-up period is significantly reduced or eliminated.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It is important in the fusing process that the materials used or incorporated into the fuser components can withstand high temperatures and are resistant to thermal degradation as such components operate in and/or generate high heat.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Known fuser coatings include high temperature polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene, perfluoroalkoxy, fluorinated ethylene propylene, silicone rubber, fluorosilicone rubber, fluoroelastomers, and the like. However, these coatings do not tend to stay clean during use. Further, the coatings often wear during use and/or become scratched during operation. In addition, these known surfaces often react with the toner, oil or debris from media, which causes the surface to become dirty and/or contaminated. The surface can, in turn, become physically damaged and results in a fuser member having a reduced useful function and short life.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Therefore, a need remains for fuser components for use in electrostatographic machines that have superior mechanical properties, including high resistance to thermal degradation.

The outer coating comprises a phosphonitrilic trimer and film-forming resin which cross-link in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a coating that is able to remain intact in temperatures that known coating compositions could not. The coating may form a layer on a variety of components that need to withstand high and degrading temperatures. In the present embodiments, the protective coating may be used in xerographic components, such as, fuser components, photoreceptor components, and the like. In particular embodiments, the protective coating is provided as an outer layer of fuser components, such as a fuser member. Such fuser members exhibit improved wear resistance and life extension.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Inorganic polymers comprised of phosphonitrilic compounds have been studied as alternatives to organic polymers. Phosphonitrilic polymers offer a relatively simplistic means of achieving structure-function relationship, which generates a broader range of physical properties compared to organic materials. Phosphonitrilic polymers have desirable properties (e.g., thermal resistance, electrical properties, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, biomedical applications, and the like) which can be tailored through syntheses based on the side chain groups of the respective monomer(s).</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The present embodiments are based upon cross-linking a new phosphonitrilic trimer with a film-forming resin to form a protective coating. The phosphonitrilic trimer has six alkoxyalkyl linkages and, in the presence of an acid catalyst, is able to cross-link with the resin to form a coating that is highly resistant to thermal degradation. In particular embodiments, the acid catalyst is selected from the group consisting of p-toluenesulfonic acid, dinonylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, dinonylnaphthalenedisulfonic acid, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, and the like and mixtures thereof. The new coating of the present embodiments demonstrate complete improved thermal stability (e.g., complete decomposition at temperatures of greater than 800 °C by thermogravimetric analysis), substantially higher than typically seen from organic resins such as melamine and polyol which generally degrade at about 600 °C. In addition, the coating exhibits excellent resistance against concentrated acids and is also harder than several commercially available polymers, such as high and low density polyethylene and polystyrene.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">As discussed above, the phosphonitrilic trimer prepared with six alkoxyalkyl groups. It has structural features that are similar to commercially available melamines (such as hexamethoxymethylmelamine, Cymel 303 available from Cytec Industries Inc. (West Paterson, New Jersey)), but with twice the potential cross-linking amino groups. In the presence of an acid catalyst, the phosphonitrilic trimer cross-links with a film-forming resin. This is similar to the reaction that some melamines have in which the melamines cross-link, in the presence of an acid catalyst, with hydroxyl-, carboxyl-, and/or amide containing compounds through alkoxy linkages. The phosphonitrilic trimer has the following structure:<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> -->

The phosphonitrilic trimer compound may be in gelatinous form and is miscible in organic solvents.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In further embodiments, the phosphonitrilic trimer is present in the outer coating or layer in an amount of from 5 percent to 95 percent, or from 50 percent to 75 percent by weight of the total weight of the outer coating or layer. In other embodiments, the film-forming resin is present in the outer coating or layer in an amount of from 5 percent to 95 percent, or from 25 percent to 50 percent by weight of the total weight of the outer coating or layer. In embodiments, a ratio of the phosphonitrilic trimer to the resin in the outer layer is from 0.5 to 3.

Specifically, photoreceptor 10 is charged on its surface by means of a charger 12 to which a voltage has been supplied from power supply 11. The photoreceptor is then imagewise exposed to light from an optical system or an image input apparatus 13, such as a laser and light emitting diode, to form an electrostatic latent image thereon.

A dry developer mixture usually comprises carrier granules having toner particles adhering triboelectrically thereto. Toner particles are attracted from the carrier granules to the latent image forming a toner powder image thereon.

The power source in this example provides AC 100 V, and the phase angle of the supplied electric power is controlled by a control circuit (not shown) in accordance with the temperature detected by the temperature detecting element 23.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">A film position sensor 42 in the form of a photocoupler is disposed adjacent to a lateral end of the film 24. In response to the output of the sensor, the roller 26 is<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> displaced by a driving means in the form of a solenoid (not shown), so as to maintain the film position within a predetermined lateral range.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Upon an image formation start signal, an unfixed toner image is formed on a recording material at the image forming station. The copy sheet 16 having an unfixed toner image Ta thereon is guided by a guide 29 to enter between the fusing belt 24 and the pressure roller 28 at the nip N (fixing nip) provided by the heater 20 and the pressure roller 28. Copy sheet 16 passes through the nip between the heater 20 and the pressure roller 28 together with the fusing belt 24 without surface deviation, crease or lateral shifting while the toner image carrying surface is in contact with the bottom surface with the fusing belt 24 moving at the same speed as copy sheet 16.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The heater 20 is supplied with electric power at a predetermined timing after generation of the image formation start signal so that the toner image is heated at the nip so as to be softened and fused into a softened or fused image Tb.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Fusing belt 24 is sharply bent at an angle theta of, for example, 45 degrees at an edge S (the radius of curvature is approximately 2 mm), that is, the edge having a large curvature in the heater support 21. Therefore, the sheet advanced together with the film 24 in the nip is separated by the curvature from the fusing belt 24 at edge S. Copy sheet 16 is then discharged to the sheet discharging tray. By the time copy sheet 16 is discharged, the toner has sufficiently cooled and solidified and therefore is completely fixed (toner image Tc).</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In this embodiment, heat generating element 22 and base 27 of heater 20 have low thermal capacity. In addition, heater element 22 is supported on support 21 through thermal insulation. The surface temperature of heater 20 in the nip quickly reaches a sufficiently high temperature, which is necessary in order to fuser, the toner. Also, a standby temperature control is used to increase the temperature of the heater 20 to a predetermined level. Therefore, power consumption can be reduced, and rise in temperature can be prevented.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The fusing belt is in contact with the heater. The distance between the outer layer of the fusing belt and the heater is preferably from 0.5 mm to 5.0 mm. Similarly, the distance between the fusing belt and the grounded rollers 25 and 26 is not less than 5 mm and is, for example, from 5 to 25 mm. These<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> distances prevent leakage of the charge applied to the copy sheet 16 by an image (not shown) forming station from leaking to the ground through the copy sheet 16. Therefore, possible deterioration of image quality due to improper image transfer can be avoided, or minimized.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In another embodiment of the invention, the fusing belt may be in the form of a sheet. For example, a non-endless film may be rolled on a supply shaft and taken out to be wrapped on a take-up shaft through the nip between the heater and the pressure roller. Thus, the film may be fed from the supply shaft to the take-up shaft at the speed, which is equal to the speed of the transfer material, reference <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5157446A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,157,446</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Another embodiment is depicted in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, wherein the fuser member is in the form of a fuser roller 37 having internal heater 38 positioned inside the fuser member.
