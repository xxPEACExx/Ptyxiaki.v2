The first and second switches are operated together in synchronism and a secondary winding is inductively coupled with but electrically isolated from the first and second primary windings through the closed flux path. Each switch conducts only a portion of the power produced in the secondary winding and the problems of current sharing are avoided.

Reference is made to these publications for the functioning of a converter of this type. Said switching cells of the converter may have other appearances than those shown in said publications, and it is for instance possible that each switching cell has more than one said energy storing capacitor, as long as it is possible to control the switching cell to be switched between the two states mentioned in the introduction.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention is primarily, but not exclusively, directed to such arrangements with Voltage Source Converters configured to transmit high powers, and the case of transmitting high<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> powers will for this reason mainly be discussed hereinafter for illuminating but not in any way restricting the invention thereto. When such a Voltage Source Converter is used to transmit high powers this also means that high voltages are handled, and the voltage of the direct voltage side of the converter is determined by the voltages across said energy storing capacitors of the switching cells. This means that a comparatively high number of such switching cells are to be connected in series for a high number of semiconductor devices, i.e. said semiconductor assemblies, are to be connected in series in each said switching cell, and a Voltage Source Converter of this type is particularly interesting when the number of the switching cells in said phase leg is comparatively high. A high number of such switching cells connected in series means that it will be possible to control these switching cells to change between said first and second switching state and by that already at said phase output obtain an alternating voltage being very close to a sinusoidal voltage. This may be obtained already by means of substantially lower switching frequencies than typically used in known Voltage Source Converters of the type shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig 1</figref> in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="DE10103031A1"><text>DE 101 03 031 A1</text></patcit> having switching cells with at least one semiconductor device of turn-off type and at least one free- wheeling diode connected in anti-parallel therewith. This makes it possible to obtain substantially lower losses and also considerably reduces problems of filtering and harmonic currents and radio interferences, so that equipment therefore may be less costly.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Said phase reactors connecting each half of the series connection of switching cells of a phase leg to said mid point are arranged for avoiding short-circuiting of these two halves and also contribute to a better shape of the voltage on the alternating voltage side of the converter.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Said transformer connecting the phase output of each phase to an alternating voltage phase line is arranged for obtaining appropriate levels of the voltages on the direct voltage side and<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the alternating voltage side of the converter, and the transformer is normally configured to raise the level of the voltage on the direct voltage side with respect to that on the alternating voltage side, but the opposite is also conceivable.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Arrangements of the type defined in the introduction are comparatively space demanding, and there is an ongoing attempt to reduce this demand of space, especially where such arrangements are to be used where space is very expensive, such as offshore.</p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The object of the present invention is to provide an arrangement of the type defined in the introduction which addresses the problem of the high space demand of such arrangements already known.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">This object is according to the invention obtained by providing such an arrangement in which said phase reactors of a said phase leg are built in in said transformer by forming a primary winding each of the transformer arranged to interact with a secondary winding thereof connected to said alternating voltage phase line, and said two primary windings are so located with respect to each other that a dc component of a current flowing from one of said poles to the other of said poles through said mid point runs in substantially opposite directions through these two primary windings.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">By using said phase reactors as windings of a transformer with two primary windings per phase the phase reactors will in fact disappear by being a part of the transformer, so that the Voltage Source Converter may be connected directly to the transformer without any intermediate phase reactors. This results in a considerable saving of space, since the phase reactors of voltage source converters of this type (M2LC) need quite some space. Accordingly, this constitutes a great advantage when using such<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> an arrangement where space is very expensive, such as offshore.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">By arranging the two primary windings so that a dc component of a current flowing through said phase output runs in substantially opposite directions through these two primary windings these phase reactors may be built in into the transformer, since this arrangement means that no saturation of a core of the transformer will then result as a consequence of said dc component of the current.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">It is pointed out that "primary winding" and "secondary winding" are not used for indicating how the transformation of the voltage takes place, but the relation of the number of turns of these windings may be any suitable, and the number of turns in the primary windings may be lower just as well as higher than the number of the turns of the secondary winding.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to another embodiment of the invention the number of the switching cells of said phase leg is ≥4, ≥12, ≥30 or ≥50. The use of a Voltage Source Converter of this type is, as already mentioned above, particularly interesting when the number of switching cells of a said phase leg is rather high resulting in a high number of possible levels of the voltage pulses delivered on said phase output, and the removal of said phase reactors will result in a higher gain of space the higher said number is.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to another embodiment of the invention said semiconductor devices of the switching cell assemblies are IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor), IGCTs (Integrated Gate Commutated Thyristor) or GTOs (Gate Turn-Off thyristor). These are suitable semiconductor devices for such converters, although other semiconductor devices of turn-off type are also conceivable.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to another embodiment of the invention said arrangement is configured to have said direct voltage side of the converter connected to a direct voltage network for transmitting High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) and the alternating voltage side connected to an alternating voltage phase line belonging to an alternating voltage network. This is due to the high number of semiconductor assemblies required a particularly interesting application of a converter of this type.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to another embodiment of the invention the converter is configured to have a direct voltage across said two poles being 1 kV - 1200kV, 10kV - 1200kV or 100kV - 1200kV. The invention is the more interesting the higher said direct voltage is.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> The invention also relates to a plant for transmitting electric power according to the appended claim therefore.

This converter has three phase legs 2-4 connected to opposite poles 5, 6 of a direct voltage side of the converter, such as a direct voltage network for transmitting high voltage direct current. Each phase leg comprises a series connection of switching cells 7 indicated by boxes, in the present case 16 to the number, and this series connection is divided into two equal parts, an upper valve branch 8 and a lower valve branch 9, separated by a mid point 10-12 forming a phase output being configured to be connected to an alternating voltage side of the converter. The phase outputs 10-12 may possibly through a transformer connect to a three phase alternating voltage network, load, etc. Filtering equipment is also arranged on said alternating voltage side for improving the shape of the alternating voltage on said alternating voltage side.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A control arrangement 13 is arranged for controlling the switching cells 7 and by that the converter to convert direct voltage into alternating voltage and conversely.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The Voltage Source Converter has switching cells 7 of the type having on one hand at least two semiconductor assemblies with each a semiconductor device of turn-off type, and a free-wheeling<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> diode connected in parallel therewith and on the other at least one energy storing capacitor, and two examples of such switching cells are shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig 2 and Fig 3</figref>. The terminals 14, 15 of the switching cell are adapted to be connected to adjacent switching cells in the series connection of switching cells forming a phase leg. The semiconductor devices 16, 17 are in this case IGBTs connected in parallel with diodes 18, 19. Although only one semiconductor device and one diode is shown per assembly these may stand for a number of semiconductor devices and diodes, respectively, connected in parallel for sharing the current flowing through the assembly. An energy storing capacitor 20 is connected in parallel with the respective series connection of the diodes and the semiconductor devices. One terminal 14 is connected to the mid point between the two semiconductor devices as well as the mid point between the two diodes. The other terminal 15 is connected to the energy storing capacitor 20, in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig 2</figref> to one side thereof and in the embodiment according to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig 3</figref> to the other side thereof. It is pointed out that each semiconductor device and each diode as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig 2 and Fig 3</figref> may be more than one connected in series for being able to handle the voltages to be handled, and the semiconductor devices so connected in series may then be controlled simultaneously so as to act as one single semiconductor device.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The switching cells shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig 2 and Fig 3</figref> may be controlled to obtain one of a) a first switching state and b) a second switching state, in which for a) the voltage across the capacitor 20 and for b) a zero voltage is applied across the terminals 14, 15.
