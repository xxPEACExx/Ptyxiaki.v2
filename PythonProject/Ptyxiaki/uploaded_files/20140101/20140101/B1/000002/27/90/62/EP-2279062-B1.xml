By reducing either the blade deflection or the blade vibration ("chatter"), the pegs improve overall shaving performance.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a razor blade cartridge or unit 10 having five blades designed for mounting on a handle having a pivotal connecting structure, e.g., by means of a connecting member, as shown at 35.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A razor blade unit with a connecting member is referred to herein as a razor blade assembly. Alternatively, the razor blade cartridge can be connected by other means to a reusable handle or permanently attached to a handle to form a disposable razor. A reusable handle, for example, is described in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US4573266A"><text>U.S. Patent Number 4,573,266</text></patcit> or in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US799940A"><text>U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/799,940</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Razor blade unit 10 includes housing 12, which may be plastic, guard 14 at the front of housing 12, cap 2 at the rear of the housing 12 and having disposed therein lubricating strip 16, and five blades 18, 20, 22, 23, and 25 in a blade mounting portion of housing 12 between guard 14 and lubricating strip 16. Primary blade 18 is nearest the guard, secondary blade 20 is next nearest the guard, and so on until the fifth blade 25 is furthest from the guard.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Alternatively, the razor blade unit can include two, three, four, or more than five blades. It is desirable to provide a plurality of blades to provide more closeness and control over shaving performance by providing a greater degree of precision adjustment in determining the shaving geometry.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref>, the cap 2 has an upper surface portion 3. Lubricating strip 16 is received in cap 2 at the rear of housing 12. Blades 18, 20, 22, 23, and 25 each include a separate leading edge generally directed towards the guard 14. The leading edges can be<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> formed as sharpened cutting edges. Metal clips 24 and 26 at the two sides of housing 12 retain the ends of blades 18, 20, 22, 23, and 25. Blades 18, 20, 22, 23, and 25 (which, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG 1B</figref>, can be made of a single piece of metal or as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 1C</figref> of a metal blade connected to a blade carrier, e.g., made of metal or plastic) can also be formed fixed in the housing 12, but may be resiliently mounted, and are biased to their raised, at-rest positions (that is, not loaded by shaving forces) via plastic leaf-spring arms (not shown) that are integral with plastic housing 12 and extend in from both sides thereof. The plurality of blades in the present invention may also be bent blades or blades that are bent without blade carriers (not shown) as described in detail in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6804886B"><text>U.S. Patent Number 6,804,886</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Guard 14 is typically a unitary molded member that can be formed of a rigid plastic at the bottom (14A), and an elastomeric material at the top (14B). The elastomeric material is chosen to provide flexibility for ribs 66, e.g., as is described in detail in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US5249361A"><text>U.S. Patent Number 5,249,361</text></patcit>. The tips of ribs 66 are in a plane that is about half-way between a plane that passes through the cutting edges of the blades 18, 20, 22, 23, and 25, and the top of clips 24, 26. The raised tips provide effective shielding of the blades. The tips also exert a traction force on the skin to stretch it and raise hairs before the primary blade, thus reducing overall cutting force.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">When the razor blade unit 10 includes a connecting member 35 which removably and pivotally connects the assembly 10 to a handle (not shown), it is referred to herein as a razor blade assembly. Such a razor blade assembly can be used with a reusable handle. Alternatively, the razor blade unit can be fixed to a handle in a relatively permanent fashion to form a disposable razor.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">During shaving, blades 18, 20, 22, 23, and 25 may be independently resiliently movable with respect to housing 12, and housing 12 pivots with respect to the handle with the result that the cutting edges tend to follow the contours of the skin surface. All three, four, or five (or more) blades can have sharp cutting edges to cut body or facial hairs at three, four, or five locations simultaneously. Furthermore, it may be advantageous to set the blades to have different exposures, e.g., increasing exposure progressing from the primary blade to the tertiary blade, e.g., as is described in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US6212777B"><text>US Patent<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> 6,212,777</text></patcit>. Additionally, different blade spans can be set between groups of two adjacent elements that contact the skin, e.g., as also described in detail in <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US6212777B"><text>US Patent 6,212,777</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As shown in detail in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG 1B</figref>, each blade of FIG. lAcan be made of a single piece of metal (metal blade 30). Each blade 30 has a cutting edge 34 and a tip 36. Blade 30 has a sharp top edge portion 35 and a bottom portion 40. The blade 30 has front and back sides, 31a and 31b respectively. Therefore, it follows that bottom portion 40 has a bottom front side and a bottom back side, or essentially two bottom sides.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Each blade of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref> can also include a blade 30 as in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 1C</figref> and a blade carrier (or support) 32, both made of metal, and permanently connected to each other, e.g., by welding, such as spot welding, adhesives, or other known methods. Blade 30 with carrier 32 similarly has a cutting edge 34 and a tip 36 and front and back sides, 33a and 33b respectively.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">When the blades include a blade carrier, the bottom portion 40 of blade 30 of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 1B</figref> is functionally equivalent to the bottom portion or base side 42 of the blade carrier 32 of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 1C</figref>. Similarly, the sharp top edge portion 35 of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 1B</figref> is functionally equivalent to the sharp top edge portion 38 of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 1C</figref>. As mentioned above, the blades of the present invention may also be of the bent blade type.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The razor blade unit further comprises one or more pegs. The purpose of the new pegs or pegged support members is to improve shaving performance. The system may have one, two, three, or more pegs for supporting a bottom side of each of the two or more blades (or bottom (base) side of the blade carriers) in the multi-blade cartridge. The pegs may or may not be arranged on a support member. Blades rest in between the pegs such that the bottom side of the blade is supported by a peg such that they intersect at a single point of contact or a single line of contact formed down the surface of the blade in accordance with the present invention. This is in contrast, as will be described below, with the support member 50 shown at <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 1D</figref>, where the intersection or point of contact for blades between slots is a two-dimensional surface 52, thereby providing surface to surface contact.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The embodiments described herein will describe intersections between pegs and blades that form a novel single line of contact.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 2</figref> shows a top view of a cartridge or razor blade unit 10 for holding five blades, in which the blades and their retaining clips 24, 26 (of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref>) have been removed. Plastic leaf-spring arms 28, 30, 32, 34, and 36 are depicted in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 2</figref> on both sides of the cartridge 10. Cartridge 10 includes a support member 72 with pegs 74, wherein the support member 72 is mounted onto or into the housing 12 of the cartridge 10. As shown, the support member 72 with pegs 74 is centrally located in the cartridge housing 12 and perpendicular to the housing 12. Support member 72 with pegs 74 however may be located anywhere in the housing and also support member 72 may be positioned in parallel with the blades or housing 12. In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, pegs 74 may be attached elsewhere on the housing without being disposed upon a support member 72. For instance, the pegs could be individually mounted to the housing via peg arms extending from the housing, without the need of a support member.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 2</figref>, the pegs 74 in support member 72 may be laid out in a slalom-like or zig-zag arrangement using six pegs 74. Five blades (not shown) can be positioned to rest up against the pegs 74 in the five openings 76 between the six pegs 74. The slalom-like arrangement allows for a robust steel layout in the tooling process.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In some embodiments, the number of pegs in the support member equals the number of blades in the cartridge, but in certain instances, the total number of pegs is one more than the total number of blades (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 2</figref>) where each blade would be supported by two pegs, one in the front side of the blade and one in the back side of the blade. Additionally, it is contemplated that in some embodiments for instance, in a three- blade cartridge, only the second blade, only the second and third blades or all three blades may be supported by one or more pegs of the support member. Or in a five-blade cartridge, only the second and fourth blades may be supported, or the second, third, and fourth blades, or the first, third, and fifth blades, or all five blades may be supported with the pegs.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Each peg contacts and supports the bottom portion (front and/or back sides) of one of the multiple blades (or the bottom side of the blade carriers), thereby restricting fore and aft blade movement, i.e., lateral movements in the plane of the blade. This control of blade movement reduces the amplitude of blade vibration ("chatter") and/or<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> blade deflection during shaving by about 40%, which in turn has been shown to improve overall shaving performance. Therefore, the pegs must be designed to be narrow enough to keep the blades from vibrating, but also to be loose enough so that they do not bind the blades. The pegs can have a width of, for example, from about 0.1 to about 0.3 mm, e.g., 0.15, 0.175, 0.2, 0.21. 0.225. The pegs may be as broad as the width of the support member, e.g., from about 2.0 to about 5.0 mm, e.g., 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, or 4.0 mm wide. The pegs can have a depth of about 1.5 to about 3.0 mm, e.g., 1.75, 2.0, 2.25, or 2.5 mm deep. Though parallel or straight sides on the pegs may be desirable, it is possible for the pegs to be designed otherwise, e.g. with about 1 degree of draft (wider from bottom to top).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As mentioned above, any number of pegs and any number of blades may be utilized. Additionally, since different blade spans can be set, it follows that in some embodiments, the pegs 74 will not be equidistant from each other because the openings 76 between pegs 74 may be set according to the different blade spans, and thus the width of one opening 76 may not be the same as another opening 76. This is shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 2A</figref>, where the distance between pegs or openings 76 varies across the length of the support member 72. For instance, the opening 76a between pegs 74a and 74b is larger than the opening 76b between pegs 74b and 74c.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As mentioned, the pegs aid in the control of the blades by potentially restricting both forward and rearward blade movement, which, in turn, reduces the amplitude of blade vibration and/or deflection during shaving. However, it is also contemplated that in different peg embodiments, one could constrain only rearward motion of the blades or only forward motion of the blades or any combination of blades constrained on forward motion while another combination of blades constrained on rearward motion. The level or amount of constraint could also be manipulated by varying the position of the blades in the openings and/or the position of the pegs to allow varying levels of deflection in either the forward or rearward direction.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, each peg 74 is cylindrical or rounded at least at the point of intersection or points of contact 37 with blade or blade carrier 39 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIGs. 3</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0008">5, 5A</figref> such that a single line is formed. It is this intersection 37 of the peg 74 and the bottom portion (front and/or back side) of the blade or blade carrier 39 which may form either a single line contact (or a single point of<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> contact, not shown) in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention. Rounded pegs are generally less complicated to mold, manufacture and assemble than other shapes. Furthermore, rounded pegs provide control and stability for the blades since the rounded pegs provides a desired line contact (or one line of intersection or contact) with the bottom side of the blade as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIGs. 3</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0008">5 and 5A</figref>; whereas if the pegs were rectangular or square such that the blade rested on a flat side of the rectangle or square, the pegs would provide a less desirable surface contact with the bottom side of the blade as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 1D</figref>. It has been determined that for assembly, it is less onerous controlling and predicting only one point or line of intersection or contact of a peg with a blade than controlling and predicting an entire flat surface of contact of a peg with a blade.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The present invention, however, contemplates that square or rectangular pegs may be arranged as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 4</figref> (e.g. to look more diamond shaped) to provide the desired line contact 37 down the surface of the bottom portion or bottom side of the blade 39. Any other shape of peg or combination of shapes of pegs could ostensibly be utilized to obtain the desired line contact at the intersection of the peg and blade, however, it should be noted that it may be more complicated to manufacture and/or arrange certain peg shapes over others.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Accordingly, though all types of peg shapes and combinations of peg shapes are contemplated in the instant invention, a key aspect of the invention is that the pegs should have one point of contact or a line contact at the intersection with the blade bottom sides, this providing improved control and predictability over surface to surface contact in the prior art, while also providing uncomplicated manufacturability</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The line of contact 37 between the pegs and blades is further depicted in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG 5</figref> which shows a side view of the pegs 74 on support member 72 and the bottom sides of the blades touching the pegs.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The width dimension of the single point of contact or single line of contact 37 in the present invention is less than about 0.05mm for plastic material. This dimension value may vary based on tolerances when using different materials and manufacturing methods. However, an intersection that forms a line that is greater than about 0.05mm wide may render the intersection to be greater than a line and trending towards becoming<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> more of a surface, requiring more precision for control and more complex manufacturability.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 5</figref>, non-rotated blade 39 essentially contacts the peg to form a full line of contact as depicted at intersection 37. The length dimension of the single line of contact 37 will change depending on the movement, rotation or tilt of the blades. Although the blades rotate varying amounts during use, they still contact the pegs and the blades slots, both of which prevent the blades from deflecting or translating. Thus, the extent of line contact that occurs between a rotated blade and the peg depends on the amount of rotation. For instance, if there is no blade rotation, there is substantially a full line of contact, while as the rotation or tilt increases, the line of contact likely becomes shorter than a full line of contact. Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 5A</figref>, a blade tilted back an angle A of about 26.5 degrees which effectively provides a full rotation back, shortens the substantially full line of contact 37 shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 5</figref> to an intersection line of contact 37 of about 0.34 mm. Accordingly, the line of contact length is typically going to be greater than about 0.34 mm.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Though the slalom-like arrangement provides a stable, easy-to-manufacture design, referring now to <figref idrefs="f0009 f0010">Figs. 6-9</figref>, pegs 74 in support member 72 may be laid out in several different embodiments as described below.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 6</figref>, rather than a slalom-like arrangement, a linear column of pegs 74 is shown.

Pegs 1112 provide support at the blade ends. It may be desirable that support member 1110 with pegs 1112 is located at both blade slot ends 1120 of the cartridge for symmetry and stability. In addition to support member 1110, <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG 11</figref> also depicts a centrally located support member 1140 with pegs 1150 arranged in a slalom-like fashion.
