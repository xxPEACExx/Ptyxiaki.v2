In particular, a great merit is provided that a cooling-related mechanism of a power semiconductor can be dispensed with. Development using SiC-based material as a substrate has been already made actively, and semiconductors such as GaN and SiC generally called "wide band gap semiconductor" attract the attention.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For example, as a semiconductor device having group III nitride semiconductor, a variety of transistor structures have been considered in which on a bulk GaN substrate of several hundreds micrometers thick, an epitaxial GaN layer or an AlGaN layer of about several micrometers is formed, and then a metal thin film gate electrode of about several hundreds nanometers, a source electrode and a drain electrode are formed (see <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004260140A"><text>JP-A 2004-260140</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Although various growth methods of semiconductor laser substrate have been conventionally studied as for the GaN substrate which forms a base, those having such low defect density that allows use as a power semiconductor substrate have not been obtained. As a power semiconductor substrate, a material in which characteristics of n-type and p-type are controlled is required, and at this time, the silicon, magnesium or the like dopant should be uniformly added to the substrate. Further, in a power semiconductor, it is often the case that each chip is several millimeters square or larger in size for switching of large electric current, and a bulk-like substrate of at least 3 inches, preferably 5 inches in diameter is demanded.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As a technique that brings a bulk GaN substrate into practical use, growth based on HVPE (Hydride Vapor Phase Epitaxy) method is currently known. This technique enables film formation at such high speed as 1 mm/hour at maximum, and for example, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2000012900A"><text>JP-A 2000-12900</text></patcit> proposes a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> method for obtaining a plurality of bulk-like GaN substrates by slicing process or polishing process after growing single-crystal GaN ingot using GaAs as a substrate (see <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2000012900A"><text>JP-A 2000-12900</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2001102307A"><text>JP-A 2001-102307</text></patcit> proposes to grow single crystal GaN wafer by facet growth using GaAs as a substrate while a mask shape is devised and growth speed is controlled, and to subject the wafer to etching process or polishing process to give a bulk-like GaN substrate. In this case, such an excellent characteristic as the etch pit density of not more than 10<sup>6</sup> per square centimeter is realized (see <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2001102307A"><text>JP-A 2001-102307</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In Japanese Patent No.<patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP3631724B"><text>3631724</text></patcit>, after heat treatment of a sapphire substrate on which nitride and a metal thin film are formed, a single-crystal GaN wafer is grown by the HVPE method and etching or polishing is effected, to give a bulk-like GaN substrate. Also in this case, such an excellent characteristic as the etch pit density of not more than 10<sup>6</sup> per square centimeter is realized (see Japanese Patent No.<patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="JP3631724B"><text>3631724</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Since these bulk GaN substrates partly include low defect density regions of not more than 10<sup>4</sup> per square centimeter, various approaches for controlling growth, for example, by mask pattern at the time of growth and crystal growing condition, have been considered. As a result, the technique has reached to sufficient level for practice of a substrate for semiconductor laser for applying voltage on a light waveguide which is several hundreds micrometers long and several micrometers width, and contributes mass<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> production of GaN-based ultraviolet and blue laser.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">However, the above substrate is not satisfactory as a bulk GaN substrate for power semiconductor for which low defect density of not more than 10<sup>4</sup> per square centimeter is required over the entire area of several millimeters square, and thus leads the problem of deterioration in high pressure resistance characteristic due to such defect.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As another technique that is essentially likely to produce a substrate of low defect density, developing a GaN substrate growing technique from liquid phase is actively attempted in recent years. <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US5868837A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5868837</text></patcit> discloses bulk GaN crystal growing technique by liquid phase method using metal sodium as a flux (hereinafter, referred to as sodium flux method). This method makes GaN crystals precipitate by causing Na and Ga metal charged in a crucible to react with nitrogen under high pressure, e.g., under several MPa at 600 to 900°C. Although growth speed is as low as several tens micrometers/hour, low defect density of not more than 10<sup>3</sup> per square centimeter is obtained over the entire material (see <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US5868837A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5868837</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As a growth method of bulk GaN ingot using this method, for example, <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="JP2003300799A"><text>JP-A 2003-300799</text></patcit> is known. This document discloses a technique in which when bulk GaN crystals are grown from seed single-crystals using sodium as a flux, the flux interface is controlled by evaporating Na from above with respect to the seed crystals.

Also, it is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus enabling mass production of bulk GaN substrates having diameter required for a power semiconductor substrate of 7,5 cm (3 inches) or more, preferably 12.5 cm (5 inches) or more.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Specifically, according to the present invention, the following apparatuses using the methods are provided.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">First, there is provided a growth method of group III nitride crystals comprising: forming a mixed melt containing at least group III element, a flux formed of at least one selected from the group consisting of alkaline metal and alkaline earth metal, in a reaction vessel; and growing group III nitride crystals from the mixed melt and a substance containing at least nitrogen, wherein after immersing a plurality of seed crystal substrates placed in an upper part of the reaction vessel in which the mixed melt is formed, into the mixed melt to cause crystal growth, the plurality of seed crystal substrates are pulling up above the mixed melt.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As the group III element, Ga (gallium), Al (aluminum), In (indium) or the like is used. As the flux, Na (sodium) which is alkaline metal is mainly used, and alkaline metals such as Li (lithium), K(potassium), Rb (rubidium) and Cs (cesium) and alkaline earth metals such as Ca (calcium),<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> Sr (strontium) and Ba (barium) may be added.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Here, in the group III nitride crystal growing method volume of the part where the seed crystal substrates are placed is not more than 70% of volume of melt. Further, it is not more than 40%.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Volume and ratio of the part where the seed crystals are provided are calculated in the manner as described below.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Now, considering the case where a crucible of metal tantalum having inner diameter of 150 mm is used as a reaction vessel, and the interior of the crucible is charged with about 2000 grams of metal Na and about 2000 grams of metal Ga and several grams of metal Si. Specific gravities of GaN crystal, melted sodium and melted gallium are known to be about 6.2, about 1, and about 6, respectively.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">For example, fifty seed crystal substrates of 100 mm in diameter and 500 µ m in thickness are arranged substantially horizontally at 2-mm interval on a member, and the seed crystal substrates are immersed into a cylindrical reaction vessel of 150 mm in diameter.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">At this time, when the melt interface is at about 150 mm from the bottom of the reaction vessel, the volume of the part where seed crystals are provided is 785 cubic centimeters, relative to the volume where melt exists<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> of about 2600 cubic centimeters, and thus the ratio is about 30%.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">At this time, the periphery and the center of the crucible may be made to have uniform melt composition by natural convection or by forced convection using stirring. However, in the condition that the ratio exceeds 70%, owing to temperature distribution inside the crucible, difference arises in thickness and silicon addition composition between inside and outside the substrate or between substrates. This makes mass production of semiconductor substrate intended in the present invention difficult.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Here, in the growth method of group III nitride crystal a ratio of group III elements which are to be crystallized as nitride crystals in the dissolved group III elements is not more than 90%.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">When crystals are grown to a thickness of about 800 µm in the above growth condition, GaN crystals grown on the total of fifty substrates come to about 2000 grams by 5×5×3.14×0.08×50×6.2, and consumed amount of Ga metal is about 1650 grams (Ga/GaN=0.833 ), so the ratio of crystallization is determined as being about 83%.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Crystallization in this interval, the flux composition of Ga/Na changes from about 1/3 molar ratio to about 1/20. Influence of Ga metal composition on crystal quality in the sodium flux method is known to be relatively small, however, it is obvious that the smaller the change of flux composition, the more uniform material may be obtained as a semiconductor<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> substrate of silicon addition composition, and the value of crystallization ratio may be variously selected depending on the intended characteristics of the semiconductor substrate.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Here, in the group III nitride crystal growth method a member in which a plurality of seed crystal substrates can be arranged at substantially regular interval, and the member is formed of a material that will not elute into the flux melt.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As the member on which the seed crystal substrates are arranged, processed materials of metal such as tantalum, niobium, molybdenum or tungsten, and ceramics such as alumina or yttria are used, and a material which will not elute into the flux melt or a combination of such materials may be used to construct a member.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In the group III nitride crystal growth method crystals are grown while an upper end of the part where the seed crystal substrates are arranged is dipped at 5 mm or more below the melt interface.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In the group III nitride crystal growth method a plate-like member is disposed above the part where the seed crystal substrates are placed, and the member is formed of a component which will not elute into the flux melt.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In this case, nitrogen as a GaN forming element is dissolved into a sodium flux solvent from high-pressure nitrogen gas in the atmosphere and is incorporated by dissolution and precipitation reaction in which it precipitates as GaN crystals on the seed crystal substrates. The dissolution speed increases with growth temperature and nitrogen pressure. In particular, since nitrogen concentration is high at about several millimeters from the melt and gas interface, when there are seed crystals in such part, growth proceeds dominantly in this part, so that a problem arises that crystals do not grow in uniform thickness.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">This may be soluble by setting the distance from the melt and gas interface to the seed crystal substrates at least 5 mm or more.
