operating the same.</p><heading id="h0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">Portable electronic devices, such as mobile terminals, increasingly provide a variety of communications, multimedia, and/or data processing capabilities. For example, mobile terminals, such as cellphones and personal digital assistants, may provide access to data in a wide variety of multimedia formats, including text, pictures, music, and/or video.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Text entry in mobile terminals may be difficult due to the limited input devices provided by mobile terminals. For example, while some computing devices, such as personal computers, may include a full QWERTY keyboard for alphanumeric text entry, some mobile terminals may be equipped with limited keyboards, where one key can represent more than one alphanumeric character. One such system, known as multi-tap, typically allows users to enter text using a conventional telephone key pad by pressing a key a varying number of times to cycle through several alphanumeric characters associated with the particular key.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">New sensing technologies have been developed that may alter the way a user interacts with mobile terminals and/or other handheld electronic devices. For example, touch sensitive hardware, such as capacitance-sensing touch sensors, can sense the size and motion of various touch-based user inputs. Many conventional portable devices may employ such touch sensors as an overlay on top of a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen. For example, Apple's iPhone® includes a capacitance-based touch sensor that can sense single-touch and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> multi-touch user inputs, and as such, uses only a single physical button in its user interface, which typically functions as a "home" button to bring up the main menu.<br/>

This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless expressly stated otherwise. It should be further understood that the terms "comprises" and/or "comprising" when used in this specification is taken to specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but does not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being "connected" or "coupled" to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being "directly coupled" or "directly connected" to another element, there are no intervening elements present. Furthermore, "connected" or "coupled" as used herein may include wirelessly connected or coupled. As used herein, the term "and/or" includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items, and may be abbreviated as "/".</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">It will also be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first user interface could be termed a second user interface, and, similarly, a second user interface could be termed a first user interface without departing from the teachings of the disclosure.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the present invention may be embodied as methods, devices, and/or computer program products. Accordingly, the present invention may be embodied in hardware and/or in software (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.). The program code may execute entirely on a single processor and/or across multiple processors, as a stand-alone software package or as part of another software package.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and/or the present specification and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">For purposes of illustration, embodiments of the present invention are described herein in the context of a mobile terminal. It will be understood, however, that the present invention is not limited to such embodiments and may be embodied generally as any portable and/or handheld electronic device including multiple user interfaces configured to be used in tandem as described herein.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As used herein, a touch sensor may refer to an electronic input device, such as a touchscreen, that is configured to detect touch and/or motion-based user inputs on an area within which the sensor is bounded. As such, touch sensors as described herein do not encompass button, toggle, or other physical switch-type inputs. Although described herein primarily with reference to capacitance-based touch sensors, it is to be understood that some embodiments of the present invention may employ one or more other touch sensing technologies, such as resistance, surface acoustic wave (SAW), infrared, strain gauge, optical imaging, dispersive signal, acoustic pulse imaging, frustrated total internal reflection, and/or other touch sensing technologies.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Some embodiments of the present invention arise from a realization that mobile terminals including conventional touch sensor-based user interfaces typically require two-handed operation. More particularly, one hand may be used to hold the mobile terminal, while the other hand may be used to touch the user interface. In addition, as the 'buttons' on a touch sensor-based user interface may be tactilely indistinguishable, a user may be required to look at the device during text entry. Also, capacitance-based touch sensors may not be ideal for multi-tap text entry, as they may not accurately detect multiple touches in rapid succession. Conventional touch-sensor based user interfaces may thereby require more of the user's focus and/or attention than other types of user interfaces, which may be inconvenient for the user. Accordingly, some embodiments of the present invention provide mobile terminals including multiple user interfaces, one or more of which include a touch sensor, that are configured to be used in tandem to enable one-handed mobile terminal operation. For example, by building in a second touch sensor on the back side of a mobile terminal that includes a touch sensitive display on the front side, combinations of touches on the front and<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> back of the mobile terminal can be used for character/symbol input and/or other mobile terminal functions. As such, mobile terminals including multiple user interfaces according to some embodiments of the present invention may be operated with less user attention, and as such, may offer greater convenience to the user.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIG. 1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a mobile terminal in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.

For example, where multiple alphanumeric characters and/or symbols are associated with each of the virtual 'buttons' <b>260</b> on the front <b>200a</b> of the housing <b>206</b>, the mobile terminal controller may be configured to capture and/or store a particular character and/or symbol responsive to detecting activation of one of the 'buttons' <b>260</b> on the first user interface <b>255a</b> in conjunction with detecting a touch and/or direction of movement on the second user interface <b>255b</b> along one or more axes <b>202x</b> and/or <b>202y</b>.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Other mobile terminal functions, inputs, and/or commands, such as launching programs, speed dialing particular phone numbers, navigating menus, and/or changing mobile terminal and/or application settings, may also be associated with particular combinations of the first and second user inputs. For example, a single tap on the first user interface <b>255a</b> in combination with a sliding motion on the second user interface <b>255b</b> along the axis <b>202y</b> may be associated with a command to launch a media player application. Such functions may also be assigned to particular input combinations by the user in some embodiments. For instance, a user may associate a single tap on the first user interface <b>255a</b> in combination with a heart-shaped motion on the second user interface <b>255b</b> as a command to dial the phone number of a spouse and/or significant other, and parameters generated by the first and second user interfaces <b>255a</b> and <b>255b</b> responsive to receiving the first and second user inputs may be stored in the mobile terminal memory as being associated with the command to dial the phone number. Also, particular combinations of the first and second inputs received via the first and second user interfaces <b>255a</b> and <b>255b</b> may be associated with different functions for different application programs and/or different operating modes of the mobile terminal <b>200</b>. For example, in the media player application, the single tap on the first user interface <b>255a</b> in combination with the upward/downward sliding motion on the second user interface <b>255b</b> along the axis <b>202y</b> may be associated with volume control. The mapping of such functions to particular combinations of inputs may be stored within the mobile terminal's memory (for example, in lookup tables), and may be accessed by the controller responsive to receiving user inputs via the first and second user interfaces <b>255a</b> and <b>255b</b>.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Still referring to <figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIGS. 2A-2B</b></figref>, the relative positions of the first and second user interfaces <b>255a</b> and <b>255b</b> on different faces of the mobile terminal housing <b>206</b> may facilitate one-handed operation of the mobile terminal <b>200</b>. More particularly, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIGS. 2A-2B</b></figref>, the first user interface <b>255a</b> is on a front <b>200a</b> of the housing <b>206</b>, while the second user interface is on a back <b>200b</b> of the housing <b>206</b> opposite the front <b>200a</b>. As such, when the mobile terminal <b>200</b> is held in a user's hand, the first user interface <b>255a</b> is operable by a user's thumb (<figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIG. 2A</b></figref>), while the second user interface <b>255b</b> is accessible by one or more of the user's fingers on the same hand (<figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIG. 2B</b></figref>). The user's remaining fingers are used to hold the housing <b>206</b> of the mobile terminal <b>200</b> during operation. The mobile terminal <b>200</b> may, thereby, be operated with one hand based on combinations of user inputs received via the user's thumb on the first user interface <b>255a</b> and via one or more of the user's fingers on the second user interface <b>255b</b>.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">For example, in one configuration, the 'buttons' <b>260</b> of the first user interface <b>255a</b> may be configured to display a standard telephone keypad, including different numbers 0-9 and different groups of the letters A-Z associated with each of the 'buttons' <b>260</b>. In a text messaging application program and/or mode of operation, the mobile terminal controller may, for example, detect activation of the '5' key (which is also associated with the letters 'J', 'K', and 'L) based on activation of the corresponding button of the first user interface <b>255a</b> via the user's thumb, and may substantially concurrently detect a sliding motion to the left along the axis <b>202x</b> based on detection of movement on the second user interface <b>255b</b> via the user's index finger. As such, the mobile terminal controller may enter the letter "j" in the text messaging application program based on the detected combination, and "j" may be displayed on a screen associated with the first user interface <b>255a</b>. Similarly, responsive to detecting activation of the '5' key on the first user interface <b>255a</b> substantially concurrently with detecting a sliding motion to the right along the axis <b>202x</b> on the second user interface <b>255b</b>, the mobile terminal controller may enter the letter "1" in the text messaging application program. Likewise, the mobile terminal controller may enter the letter "k" responsive to detecting activation of the '5' key on the first user interface <b>255a</b> and detecting a single tap and/or no input on the second user interface <b>255b</b>. Also, a capitalization function may be associated with detected movement along the axis <b>202y</b> in the text messaging application. For example, responsive to detecting activation of the 'S' key on the first user interface <b>255a</b> substantially concurrently with detecting a diagonal sweeping motion towards the right along<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> the direction <b>202x</b> and upward along the direction <b>202y</b> on the second user interface 255b, the mobile terminal controller may enter a capital "L" in the text messaging application program.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The first and second user interfaces <b>255a</b> and <b>255b</b> may also be configured to receive multiple touch inputs and/or multiple directional inputs.

The mobile terminal controller may also be configured to detect a handedness (i.e., right-handed or left-handed) of the user based on the detected inputs and/or a based on a user selection, and as such, may re-map the association of particular functions with particular combinations of user inputs received via the first and second user interfaces <b>255a</b> and <b>255b</b> based on the handedness of the user.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In some embodiments, the second user interface <b>255b</b> on the back <b>200b</b> of the housing <b>206</b> may be a secondary interface that is not operable without first receiving an input via the first (e.g., primary) user interface <b>255a</b>. The tandem use of the first and second user interfaces <b>255a</b> and <b>255b</b> may also reduce the likelihood of inadvertent inputs during handling of the mobile terminal <b>200</b>. For example, a tap on the first user interface <b>255a</b> may be used to initiate entry of a command, while a subsequent tap on the second user interface <b>255b</b> may signify completion of the command. As such, the command may include multiple touch and/or direction-based inputs received between the first tap on the first user interface <b>255a</b> and the second tap on the second user interface <b>255b</b>, regardless of the time between inputs. In other embodiments, however, the second user interface <b>255b</b> on the back <b>200b</b> of the housing <b>206</b> may be used alone to input a user command, the results of which may be displayed on a display of the first user interface <b>255a</b> on the front <b>200a</b> of the housing.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Although <figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIGS. 2A-2B</b></figref> illustrate an exemplary mobile terminal including multiple user interfaces configured to facilitate one-handed operation, it will be understood that the present invention is not limited to such a configuration but is intended to encompass any configuration capable of carrying out operations described herein.

For example, a thumb input may be received via the first user interface at Block <b>500</b> as the first user input, and a finger input may be received via the second user interface at Block <b>510</b> as the second user input.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Still referring to <figref idrefs="f0005"><b>FIG. 5</b></figref>, a combination of the first and second user inputs received via the first and second user interfaces is detected and/or recognized at Block <b>520</b>. For example, the detected combination of user inputs received via the first and second user interfaces at Block <b>500</b> and Block <b>510</b>, respectively, may be mapped to and/or associated with a particular mobile terminal function, for instance, based on a lookup table stored in the mobile terminal memory. Such a mobile terminal function may include launching a particular application or program, entering/capturing a particular character and/or symbol, dialing a particular phone number, moving an on-screen cursor, and/or changing a particular setting of the mobile terminal and/or an application thereof. Desired combinations of user inputs may also be assigned to particular mobile terminal functions by the user. For example, in a settings menu, parameters generated by the first and second user interfaces responsive to<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> receiving the first and second user inputs may be stored in a memory of the mobile terminal and associated with a particular function based on a user assignment.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Accordingly, the mobile terminal function corresponding to the detected combination of the first and second user inputs is performed at Block <b>530</b>. For example, responsive to receiving a tap on a '5' key of the first user interface (which is also associated with the letters 'J', 'K', and 'L') at Block <b>500</b> in conjunction with receiving a sliding motion to the right on the second user interface at Block <b>510</b> when executing a text messaging application on the mobile terminal, a user command to input an "L" in the text messaging application is recognized based on the detected combination at Block <b>520</b> and entered/captured in the text messaging application at Block <b>530</b> responsive to the detected combination of user inputs. In some embodiments, the second user interface on the back of the mobile terminal housing may be a secondary interface that is not configured to be used without the first user interface, and as such; no mobile terminal functions may be performed responsive to receiving the second user input without receiving the first user input. In other embodiments, however, a mobile terminal function may be performed at Block <b>530</b> responsive to detecting a corresponding input from only one of the first or second user interfaces.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">The flowchart of <figref idrefs="f0005"><b>FIG. 5</b></figref> illustrates the architecture, functionality, and operations of embodiments of hardware and/or software in electronic devices, such as mobile terminals, according to some embodiments of the present invention. In this regard, each block represents a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). It should also be noted that in other implementations, the function(s) noted in the blocks may occur out of the order noted in <figref idrefs="f0005"><b>FIG. 5</b></figref>.
