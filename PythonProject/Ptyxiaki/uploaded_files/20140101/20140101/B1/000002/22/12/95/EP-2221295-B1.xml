Most of the organic gelling agents are known as low-molecular weight compounds having a hydrogen bonding functional group (such as an amino group, amide group or urea) in their molecule and high-molecular weight compounds having a 3-D network structure in their molecule. Although the development of the former compounds was relatively later than the development of the latter compounds, there are known dialkylurea derivatives (refer to <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP8231942A"><text>JP-A 8-231942</text></patcit>) and perfluoroalkyl derivatives (refer to <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2007191626A"><text>JP-A 2007-191626</text></patcit> and <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>J.
