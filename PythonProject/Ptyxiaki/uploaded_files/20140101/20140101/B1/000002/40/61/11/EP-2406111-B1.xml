Each of the right and left drive wheels is provided with a ratchet wheel that rotates together with the electric motor. Grooves are formed in an outer circumference of the ratchet wheel at equal angular intervals.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The parking lock device is provided with a parking pawl having a base end pivoted on a shaft and an actuator which causes the parking pawl to turn around the shaft. A projection is formed on a tip of the parking pawl. By turning the parking pawl about the shaft, the projection engages with a groove of the ratchet wheel, thereby preventing the drive wheel from rotating.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">The parking lock device is required not to become active when the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> vehicle is running. For this purpose, the turning force applied to the parking pawl is limited so that the projection is bounced by the teeth of the rotating ratchet wheel and does not engage with the groove when the actuator turns the parking pawl in a state where a wheel rotation speed is higher than a predetermined rotation speed.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, when the parking lock device is activated in a state where a rotation speed of one of the right and left drive wheels exceeds the predetermined speed while a rotation speed of the other drive wheel is within the predetermined speed due to road surface conditions, for example, the rotation of the one of the drive wheels becomes locked while the rotation of the other drive wheel is not locked. Such discordance with respect to the locking state of the right and left drive wheels may promote unstable vehicle behavior.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Further, when both of the rotation speeds of the right and left drive wheels are within the predetermined speed, there may still be a difference between the rotation speeds of the drive wheels due to road surface conditions. In this case, rotation of both drive wheels can be locked by activating the parking lock device. However, when there is a large difference between the wheel rotation speeds, a discrepancy arises inevitably in the timings at which the wheels are locked, leading likewise to unstable vehicle behavior.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is therefore an object of this invention to ensure a stable vehicle behavior when the parking lock mechanism is activated to lock rotation of the right and left drive wheels.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">To achieve the above object, this invention provides a parking lock device for a vehicle having a right wheel and a left wheel, comprising a right parking lock mechanism which locks rotation of the right wheel, a left<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> parking lock mechanism which locks rotation of the left wheel, a sensor which detects a wheel rotation speed of the right wheel, a sensor which detects a wheel rotation speed of the left wheel, and a programmable controller which controls operations of the right and left parking lock mechanisms.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The right parking lock mechanism comprises a right inactivating mechanism that mechanically inactivates a locking operation of the right parking lock mechanism when a rotation speed of the right wheel exceeds a predetermined parking lock prevention wheel rotation speed. The left parking lock mechanism comprises a left inactivating mechanism that mechanically inactivates a locking operation of the right parking lock mechanism when a rotation speed of the left wheel exceeds the predetermined parking lock prevention wheel rotation speed.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The controller is programmed to determine whether or not a predetermined parking lock permitting condition is established on the basis of the rotation speed of the right wheel and the rotation speed of the left wheel, and prevent the right parking lock mechanism and the left parking lock mechanism from becoming active until the predetermined parking lock permitting condition is established.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The details as well as other features and advantages of this invention are set forth in the remainder of the specification and are shown in the accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of an electric-drive vehicle provided with a parking lock device according to a first embodiment of this invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a side view of a parking lock mechanism in an unlock state according to the first embodiment of this invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a side view of the parking lock mechanism in a lock state.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart describing a parking lock operation routine performed by a controller according to the first embodiment of this invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram showing characteristics of a parking lock operation permission range map stored by the controller.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref> is similar to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, but shows a second embodiment of this invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic diagram of an electric-drive vehicle provided with a parking lock device according to a third embodiment of this invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart describing a parking lock operation routine performed by a controller according to the third embodiment of this invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 9</figref> is a diagram showing characteristics of a parking lock operation permission range map stored by the controller according to the third embodiment of this invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 10</figref> is a flowchart describing a parking lock operation routine performed by a controller according to a fourth embodiment of this invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 11</figref> is a diagram showing characteristics of a parking lock operation permission range map stored by a controller according to a fifth embodiment of this invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 12</figref> is a schematic diagram of an electric-drive vehicle provided with a parking lock device according to a sixth embodiment of this<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 13</figref> is a flowchart describing a parking lock operation routine performed by a controller according to the sixth embodiment of this invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 14</figref> is a flowchart describing a parking lock operation routine performed by a controller according to a seventh embodiment of this invention.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> of the drawings, a rear drive type electric-drive vehicle which runs using electric power supplied from a battery BAT comprises a right front wheel 3FR, a left front wheel 3FL, a right rear wheel 3RR, and a left rear wheel 3RL. This invention may however be applied to a front drive vehicle or a four-wheel drive vehicle rather than a rear drive vehicle.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The right rear wheel 3RR is connected to an electric motor 1R via a gear 2R. The left rear wheel 3RL is connected to an electric motor 1L via a gear 2L. The electric motor 1R (1L) rotates in accordance with an electric power supplied from the battery BAT via an inverter 4 and drives the right rear wheel 3RR (left rear wheel 3RL) to rotate via the gear 2R (2L).</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A brake rotor is fixed to each of the wheels 3FR, 3FL, 3RR, 3RL. A friction brake 8 applies a braking force to the brake rotor of each of the wheels 3FR, 3FL, 3RR, 3RL.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Each of the right rear wheel 3RR and the left rear wheel 3RL is provided with a parking lock mechanism 6.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The parking lock mechanism 6 functions to prevent the wheel 3RR<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> (3RL) from rotating against a rotation torque input from the electric motor 1R (1L) or a rotation torque input from a road surface.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the parking lock mechanism 6 comprises a ratchet wheel 61, a parking pawl 62, a parking rod 63, and a parking lock actuator 12.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The ratchet wheel 61 is fixed onto an outer circumference of a rotation shaft 33 of the electric motor 1R (1L), thereby rotating together with the electric motor 1R (1L).</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The ratchet wheel 61 comprises teeth 61a formed in an outer circumference thereof at equal angular intervals. A groove 61b is formed between adjacent teeth 61a. The parking pawl 62 is a lever-like member, a base end of which is pivoted on a shaft 64 supported by a case 34 of the electric motor 1R (1L). A projection 62a is formed at a tip of the parking pawl 62 so as to project towards the ratchet wheel 61. The parking pawl 62, by turning around the shaft 64, causes the projection 62a to engage with one of the grooves 61b, thereby preventing the ratchet wheel 61 from rotating in any rotation direction.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The parking pawl 62 is biased by a torsion spring 65 supported by the case 34 towards a turning direction to release the projection 62a from engagement with the groove 61b, or in other words in an unlocking direction.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The parking rod 63 is driven by the parking lock actuator 12 to displace in right and left directions in the figure. The parking rod 63 comprises a tip portion 63a and a base portion 63b.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The tip portion 63a is wedged between a support 11 fixed to the case 34 and the parking pawl 62 biased by the torsion spring 65 in the unlocking direction.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The base portion 63b is connected to the parking lock actuator 12 via a link mechanism. The parking lock actuator 12 is constituted by an electric-drive or hydraulic type rotary actuator, for example. The link mechanism converts a rotation of the parking lock actuator 12 into a linear motion of the parking rod 63. The tip portion 63a is formed to have a larger diameter than the base portion 63b and a step 63e is formed at a boundary there-between.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A pusher 63c is fitted onto an outer circumference of the base portion 63b so as to be free to slide along the base portion 63b. The pusher 63c comprises a tapered face 63f which gradually decreases in diameter towards a tip.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A coil spring 63d is fitted onto the outer circumference of the base portion 63b to bias the pusher 63c towards the tip portion 63b. An end of the coil spring 63d is in contact with the pusher 63c on the opposite side thereof to the tapered face 63f and another end of the coil spring 63d is supported by a spring seat 63g which is fixed to the outer circumference of the base portion 63b. The step 63e functions as a stopper to stop the pusher 63c moving towards the tip portion 63a. An inclined surface is formed on each of the parking pawl 62 and the support 11 so as to face the tapered face 63f,</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the figure, the pusher 63c is detached from the parking pawl 62 and the support 11 and the parking pawl 62 biased by the torsion spring 65 in the unlocking direction grips the tip portion 63a of the parking rod 63. In this state, the projection 62a of the parking pawl 62 is not engaged with the groove 61 b of the ratchet wheel 61, and the ratchet wheel 61 is allowed to rotate arbitrarily. This state corresponds to an unlock state of the parking lock mechanism 6.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, when the parking lock actuator 12 drives the parking rod 63 in a linear direction, the pusher 63c is wedged between the inclined surfaces of the parking pawl 62 and the support 11 so as to turn the parking pawl 62 against the torsion spring 65 in a clockwise direction in the figure. As a result, the projection 62a of the parking pawl 62 engages with one of the grooves 61b of the ratchet wheel 61. In this state, the rotation shaft 33 is firmly locked and cannot rotate even when a rotation torque of the electric motor 1R (1L) or a rotation torque input from a road surface into the wheel 3RR (3RL) is exerted on the rotation shaft 33. This state corresponds to a lock state of the parking lock mechanism 6.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The reason why the pusher 63c is not fixed to the parking rod 63 but supported by the coil spring 63d is to limit a turning force which is exerted on the parking pawl 62 by the pusher 63c. In a state where a wheel rotation speed of the wheel 3RR (3RL) is higher than a predetermined parking lock prevention wheel rotation speed, when the parking lock actuator 12 applies a driving force on the parking rod 63 in a locking direction, the projection 62a of the parking pawl 62 is bounced by the teeth 61a of the rotating ratchet wheel 61 and prevented from engaging with one of the grooves 61b. The pusher 63c is thereby pushed back in the unlock direction against the biasing force of the coil spring 63d.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">As described above, by by using the coil spring 63d to support the pusher 63c on the parking rod 63resiliently, the parking lock mechanism 6 is prevented from being activated at a wheel rotation speed exceeding the predetermined parking lock prevention wheel rotation speed irrespective of the driving force of the parking lock actuator 12. Preventing the parking lock mechanism 6 from being activated at a wheel rotation speed exceeding the predetermined parking lock prevention wheel rotation speed is<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> preferable in terms of ensuring stability of vehicle behavior and protecting the parking lock mechanism 6. The predetermined parking lock prevention wheel rotation speed can be set arbitrarily by modifying a spring load of the coil spring 63d. Herein, the predetermined parking lock prevention wheel rotation speed is set at ten kilometers per hour (10km/hr).</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Referring again to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the operation of the parking lock actuator 12 is controlled by a parking lock operation control part 10 in a vehicle controller CU. It should be noted that the parking lock operation control part 10 is a virtual unit for the purpose of describing a special function of the vehicle controller CU, and does not exist as a physical entity.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The vehicle controller CU controls a driving force, a braking force, and steering of the vehicle. For this purpose, detection signals are input into the vehicle controller CU from a wheel rotation speed sensor 5R that detects a wheel rotation speed of the right rear wheel 3RR, a wheel rotation speed sensor 5L that detects a wheel rotation speed of the left rear wheel 3RL, a steering angle sensor S1 that detects a steering angle of the vehicle, an accelerator pedal depression sensor S2 that detects a depression amount of an accelerator pedal depressed by a driver of the vehicle, a brake pedal depression sensor S3 that detects a depression amount of a brake pedal depressed by the driver, a mode selection switch S4 that detects a running mode or a shift lever position designated by the driver, a yaw rate sensor S5 that detects a yaw rate of the vehicle, a lateral acceleration sensor S6 that detects a lateral acceleration of the vehicle, and a front-aft acceleration sensor S7 that detects a front-aft acceleration of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">With respect to driving force control of the vehicle, the vehicle controller CU calculates, on the basis of the input signals, torque command values for the electric motors 1R and 1L, and inputs the calculated torque<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> command values into a motor controller MCU. The motor controller MCU outputs command signals corresponding to the torque command values to the inverters 4 connected to the electric motors 1R and 1L, respectively. The inverter 4 supplies electric power corresponding to the command signal from the battery BAT to the electric motor 1R (1L).</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The vehicle controller CU is constituted by a microcomputer comprising a central processing unit (CPU), a read-only memory (ROM), a random access memory (RAM), and an input/output interface (I/O interface). The controller may be constituted by a plurality of microcomputers. The motor controller MCU is constituted by a similar microcomputer. It is possible to constitute one or both of the vehicle controller CU and the motor controller MCU by plural microcomputers. It is also possible to constitute the vehicle controller CU and the motor controller MCU by one sole microcomputer.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The parking lock operation control part 10 serving as a function of the vehicle controller CU controls operations of the parking lock actuator 12.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, a parking lock operation routine performed by the parking lock operation control part 10 will be described.
