It should be noted that for the sake of convenience the present document discusses the reservoir system in the context of a combined insulin infusion and glucose monitor based on a microdialysis probe arrangement; however, it should be appreciated that any system requiring storage and precise delivery of a plurality of liquids is included within the scope of the present invention. The reservoir system includes a system housing <b>1,</b> a primary piston <b>2</b> in axial alignment with a secondary piston <b>3</b> forming an overall piston arrangement, a spring <b>4</b> for biasing the piston arrangement to advance in housing <b>1,</b> a static projection <b>6,</b> a primary flow path <b>7,</b> a secondary flow path <b>8</b> which extends in part along static projection <b>6,</b> and a tertiary flow path <b>9.</b> Primary piston <b>2</b> includes a parallel piston wall <b>10,</b> typically of cylindrical form and terminating in a closure <b>2a,</b> that forms a primary cavity <b>13.</b> Similarly, secondary piston <b>3</b> includes a parallel piston wall <b>11,</b> typically of cylindrical form<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> and terminating in a closure <b>3a,</b> forming a secondary cavity <b>14.</b> The diameter of a cylindrical external surface <b>11<i>a</i></b> of wall <b>11</b> is less than the diameter of a cylindrical internal surface <b>10<i>a</i></b> of wall <b>10</b> so that primary and secondary pistons <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> can nest. Optionally, the two cylindrical walls may be configured to engage in sliding engagement, but preferably with flow channels formed in one or both surfaces to interconnect volumes <b>13</b> and <b>13<i>a</i>.</b> Alternatively, there may be a clearance there between. Static projection <b>6</b> is parallel walled, and preferably cylindrical, with an outer surface <b>6<i>a</i></b> configured to engage and seal against the inner surface <b>11<i>b</i></b> of wall <b>11,</b> thereby isolating storage volumes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> from each other. Primary cavity <b>13</b> and secondary cavity <b>14</b> each serve as liquid storage volumes not in fluid communication with each other because they are divided by floating, secondary piston <b>3</b> thereby enabling liquids to be dispensed from primary storage volume <b>13</b> while liquids in secondary storage volume <b>14</b> remain in storage as will be further discussed. The above-described piston arrangement is in axial alignment with spring <b>4</b> disposed at one end of housing <b>1.</b></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">At this point it is helpful to define some terms of reference used throughout the present document.
<ul><li>"Fluid Communication" refers to a flow arrangement between a plurality of liquid storage volumes in which liquid flows from one storage volume to another.</li><li>"Parallel Walls" refers to any wall arrangement in which the distance between opposing walls or opposing sections of a single wall is constant.</li><li>"Floating Piston" refers to a piston not acted upon by a mechanical linkage but rather is acted upon by liquids in which the piston is disposed.</li><li>"Distal" refers to a side most distant from a biasing element.</li><li>"Flange" refers to any surface extending outwards from the piston wall towards the housing.</li></ul>
Primary flange <b>17</b> is disposed at a distal end of the primary piston wall <b>10</b> and primary flange <b>17</b> extends radially to housing <b>1</b> where it slidingly engages it.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> Similarly, secondary flange <b>16</b> is disposed at the distal end of piston wall <b>11</b> and extends radially to housing <b>1</b> where it also slidingly engages it. Seals <b>26,</b> preferably implemented as "o-rings", are disposed in between flange surfaces in sliding contact with housing <b>1</b> and walls <b>6a</b> of static projection <b>6</b> to ensure a leak-free sliding engagement. Distal surface <b>19</b> of primary flange <b>17</b> and non-distal surface <b>20</b> of secondary flange <b>16</b> partially define an additional liquid storage volume <b>13a</b> that in the present non-limiting embodiment is in fluid communication with primary storage volume <b>13.</b> Distal surface <b>21</b> of secondary flange <b>16</b> partially defines tertiary liquid storage volume <b>15.</b> In a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, primary flow path <b>7</b> (shown here schematically) is in fluid connection with primary storage volume <b>13</b> and passes through the space circumscribed by spring <b>4</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>. Secondary flow path <b>8</b> is fluid communication with secondary liquid storage volume <b>14</b> and passes through static projection <b>6</b> as mentioned above. Tertiary flow path <b>9</b> is in fluid communication with tertiary liquid storage volume <b>15.</b> As mentioned above, spring <b>4</b> is disposed at one end of housing <b>1</b> and applies a bias to the piston arrangement. In this particular, non-limiting embodiment, spring <b>4</b> resiliently bears directly on non-distal surface <b>19</b> of primary flange <b>2</b> thereby pressurizing liquids in volume <b>13</b>, and indirectly, by the liquid pressure acting on surfaces of the floating secondary piston <b>3,</b> also pressurizes liquids in secondary and tertiary volumes <b>14</b> and <b>15,</b> respectively. Each flow path typically includes a valve and valve actuator (not shown) controlled by a control system in accordance with system parameters; closed valves maintain the liquids in liquid-storage volumes and open valves dispense the liquids as is known in the art. It should be noted that, in a non-limiting, exemplary embodiment, the housing is implemented as a cylindrical wall. However, non-cylindrical embodiments are included within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> depicts the reservoir system after dispensing of the liquid stored in the combined storage volumes <b>13</b> and <b>13<i>a</i>,</b> but where the liquids in storage volumes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> have not yet been dispensed. It will be noted that this state has been chosen for clarity of presentation, but there is no limitation as to the sequence<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> and relative rates of dispensing of the liquid in storage volume <b>13, 13<i>a</i></b> versus that in storage volume <b>14.</b> Independent dispensing commences when a valve in flow path <b>7</b> is opened. Primary piston <b>2,</b> biased by spring <b>4,</b> advances in housing <b>1</b> and expels liquids stored liquid-storage volume <b>13</b> as without affecting liquids stored in other storage volumes <b>14</b> or <b>15.</b> This independent type of liquid dispensing advantageously provides selective control of liquid delivery. In combined drug delivery and diagnostic testing applications, such as in a system for delivering insulin and performing microdialysis blood glucose analysis, such delivery schemes have special significance; insulin may be stored in liquid storage volume <b>13</b> and dispensed independently while dialysate (such as saline solution) and a reagent are held in stored and dispensed from volumes <b>14</b> and <b>15,</b> preferably in a linked dispensing mode to be described.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Linked-dispensing commences when valves disposed in flow paths <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> are opened. Secondary piston <b>3</b> and its distal flange surface <b>21</b> advance in unison in housing <b>1</b> thereby expelling liquids simultaneously from storage volumes <b>14</b> and <b>15.</b> Storage volumes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> are the same length to ensure that secondary piston 3 and its flange <b>16</b> fill each storage volume entirely when they reach a fully displaced position at the end of their range of movement. Given the constant length of volumes <b>14</b> and <b>15,</b> the cross-sectional area of each of each storage volume defines the amount of liquid expelled as piston <b>3</b> advances. Accordingly, the ratio of the cross-sectional surfaces of storage volumes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> defines the volumetric ratio at which the liquids are dispensed. In the above mentioned combined insulin administration and microdialysis unit, this feature again has special significance because saline solution and reagent, stored in either of storage volumes <b>14</b> and <b>15,</b> are dispensed in the required, fixed volumetric ratio. In some cases, control of both flow rates may be achieved by controlling a valve in only one of the outlet flow paths while the other remains continuously open. Since liquid is only released from storage volumes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> in fixed volumetric ratio, neither liquid flows unless both flow paths are open. It should be appreciated that embodiments in which linked dispensing precedes independent dispensing or both dispensing schemes are performed simultaneously are included within the scope of<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the present invention. Replacement liquid is injected into primary liquid storage volumes <b>13</b> and <b>13a</b> through septum <b>23</b> and similarly, additional replacement liquid is injected into liquid storage volume <b>15</b> through septum <b>25.</b> However, given that storage volumes <b>14</b> is non-contiguous with housing <b>1,</b> replacement liquid is introduced by way of an extended needle, or similar instrument, capable of spanning the entire length of storage-volume <b>13</b> and piecing septum <b>24.</b> Additional issues regarding the refilling of the storage reservoirs will be discussed later in the document.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref> depict a non-limiting, alternative embodiment including an associated valve control arrangement 210.

A flow path <b>22</b> is disposed in a flow conduit <b>22a</b> projecting through the space circumscribed by spring <b>4,</b> an opening in primary piston <b>2,</b> and through the majority of primary liquid storage volume <b>13.</b> Liquids in primary storage volume <b>13</b> are expelled through a flow path inlet disposed at the distal end of storage volume <b>13.</b> Primary piston <b>2</b> is in leak free, sliding engagement with flow path <b>22.</b></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The storage reservoirs of each embodiment are refilled with the appropriate liquids by way of their flow paths and/or by suitably positioned septum seals. For<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> example, liquid is injected though septum <b>23</b> into flow path <b>22</b> and into primary liquid storage volume <b>13.</b> Similarly, the appropriate liquids are injected through septum <b>25</b> directly into liquid storage volume <b>15</b> and through septum <b>24</b> into flow path <b>27</b> leading into liquid storage volumes <b>14.</b> It should be noted that, when refilling storage volumes involved in linked dispensing, both liquids most be replenished simultaneously to ensure that each volume is entirely filled. A void remaining in either of the storage volumes will distort the fixed volumetric ratio at which the liquids are to be delivered. Therefore, each liquid must be injected into the relevant storage volumes simultaneously at flow rates corresponding to the volumetric flow ratio defined by the structure, as discussed above. In practical terms, one replacement liquid is preferably injected into a first storage volume while the remaining flow path is in sealed, air tight connection with the second replacement liquid. The injected replacement liquid fills the storage volume, pushing the piston and its associated flange in unison thereby creating a partial vacuum that draws in the second liquid as the piston retracts.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 5-7 </figref>depict a third, structurally analogous, embodiment having resilient biasing spring <b>4</b> disposed in between axially aligned rearward piston <b>30</b> and forward piston <b>31,</b> biasing each piston towards its corresponding end of the housing.
