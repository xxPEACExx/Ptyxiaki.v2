Such particles which form the glitters comprise according to a first preferred embodiment a transparent foil, in particular a plastics foil, which is provided with a coating on either side, preferably of polyurethane or epoxide or aluminium. A coating of aluminium is preferably vapour deposited under vacuum in this instance. If an aluminium layer is applied to both sides of a transparent foil, in particular a plastics foil, according to another embodiment this is preferably covered in each case with a layer of polyurethane or epoxide.

In the variant according to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 3</figref>, the starting point is a plastics foil 1 which is provided on the two surfaces with the layers 2a, 2b of aluminium.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to another configuration, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 4</figref>, particles of glass are used as starting materials, as designated 8 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 4</figref>. A metal layer 9 is applied to this glass particle or this metal layer 9 is omitted.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the fluidised bed process described below, the particles according to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1 to 4</figref> are completely provided with a coating, which is designated 11 in each case.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In principle for the particles 8 of glass, it is possible to use irregularly broken fragments of silicate with a thickness ≥ 1µm The provision of metal coatings on these particles is carried out by means of chemical or physical application, for example, vapour deposition.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">If the particles comprise a carrier layer in the form of a plastics foil 1, as explained in connection with <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1 to 3</figref>, the particles are cut in a preferably hexagon-like shape.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Finally, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 5</figref>, it is also possible to use an aluminium foil as a carrier layer, which is designated 12 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 5</figref> and is provided on either side with a layer 3a or 3b of polyurethane or epoxide, or this layer is omitted. Such an aluminium foil 12 is also preferably cut in a hexagon-like shape and then further processed in the manner described below.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Generally, the different initial particles are treated using comparable parameters and are completely surrounded with the layer of protective material in the fluidised bed process so that all the cut edges or broken edges of the initial particles are enclosed. The precise adaptation of the parameters during the fluidised bed process is achieved through the densities and sizes of the respective materials.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the production of particles from a plastics foil with the coating mentioned above, the individual particles are cut from the foil, preferably in a hexagonal shape, so that cut edges are produced which are formed especially at the side of the foil. Whilst the carrier layer is chemically and physically resistant even at the uncoated side thereof, by means of vapour deposition of aluminium and an additional coating of polyurethane or epoxide, the desired optical effect is achieved on the opposite surface by adding colour. Both surfaces are physically and chemically resistant, whilst over the lateral cut edges, owing to weakening caused by solvents, such as water or the like and when used in paints and cosmetics, it is not possible to prevent a deterioration of the appearance. To this end, the glitters are provided, by means of a fluidised bed process, with a protective layer 11 which completely surrounds the glitters in each case.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">All of the particles shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1 to 5</figref> and explained above in greater detail are surrounded by means of a fluidised bed unit in the fluidised bed process with the layer 11 as a layer of protective material in such a manner that all the outer faces are completely enclosed.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">According to one example, using a WFP-8 unit fluidised bed unit from the company DMR Prozesstechnologie GmbH (Switzerland), five kilograms of glitter particles of polyester of the type 2510-52-3 hex are coated with an organically modified silane solution, that is to say, a clear hybrid paint. The particles of polyester were produced in this instance from a polyester foil which has a thickness of 25 µm and which was aluminised and subsequently coloured red. The particles were cut from this foil, for example, as hexagonal particles with a size of 200 µm, measured over the length of the mutually parallel cut edges. The thickness of the particles is on average 25-35 µm.These particles were swirled in the mentioned unit by means of process air which was preheated to 60 °C with an air throughput of 60m<sup>3</sup>/h in order to produce a so-called mixed bed to which an organically modified silane solution was supplied by means of bottom spray, that is to say from below.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The primary pressure (process air) and the secondary pressure were adjusted in the ratio 1: 2.5 in order to achieve good wetting of the entire mixed bed and consequently the glitter particles in the mixed bed. In this instance, the droplets of the clear hybrid paint are distributed finely and blown into the fluidised bed in a uniform manner. In this example, 1000 ml of clear hybrid paint is sprayed in within 60 minutes in order to counteract quick drying of the droplets on the particles. After this time has elapsed, it was possible to remove 5 kg of coated glitter from the unit and, by means of a subsequent 30 minute annealing operation at 120 °C, the coating was cross-linked in a stable manner. In this instance, there was a homogeneous coating of all the glitter particles and consequently also a coating in the region of the cut edges which prevents chemical or physical weakening of the glitter.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Depending on the particle size and the particle density of the glitters to be produced, different degrees of fluidisation are to be set in the fluidised bed. Depending on the weight of the glitters, with larger glitter particles a higher process pressure is required, both with respect to the process air which produces the swirling and with respect to the hybrid paint which is blown into the fluidised bed, than with smaller particles which form the glitters. Great<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> expansion of the fluidised bed is required in order to ensure sufficiently great spacing between the individual glitter particles, so that the individual glitter particles, which can be accessed separately, can be coated with the layer of protective material and on the other hand the particles do not become bonded together during the coating operation.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">As a coating layer, it is also possible to use an aqueous polyurethane solution instead of a hybrid paint, for example, an organically modified silane solution which is optionally or preferably coloured.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The fluidised bed is produced by means of jets which produce a primary flow, the pressure of this primary flow determining the length of the atomising cone, and by a secondary flow of which the pressure determines the width of the atomising cone.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">It has been found that the smaller the solution droplets or the finer the spray mist are to be, the greater the primary pressure should be set. In the case of relatively small particles, the droplets should be as fine as possible.
