The LTE system provides high-speed low-latency packet-based communications at a data rate of up to 100 Mbps. The LTE system includes an Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (EUTRAN) having a plurality of evolved Node-Bs (eNBs), which communicate wirelessly with a plurality of user equipment (UEs) though uplink and downlink radio channels.

The EUTRAN 1 comprises eNBs 100 and 102 controlling a respective cell and capable of providing a point-to-multipoint data service, and an eNB 12 controlling a cell and capable of providing<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> only a point-to-multipoint data service. Each eNB comprises at least one radio transmitter, receiver, control section, power supply, and an antenna system, e.g., a radio tower, building, and base station. The base station is a part of telecommunication network comprising a radio access network (RAN) coupled to one or more core networks (CN). The radio access network may be a first, second or third generation network such as a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) or Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), coupled to a packet data network and circuit switched core networks. The eNBs 100 and 102 provide a point-to-multipoint data service such as Broadcast/Multicast Service in 3GPP2, Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service MBMS in 3GPP, or other broadcasting technologies, where data are transmitted to multiple network recipients concurrently. The eNB 12 provides a point-to-point data service such as voice, multimedia, messaging, application data, and other unicast services, where data are transmitted to a single network destination identified by a unique network address.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In a Multimedia Broadcast over Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) 10, a time-synchronized multimedia broadcast data service such as Mobile TV is transmitted from a plurality of the eNBs 100 and 102 using the same set of resource blocks including transport carrier frequencies and transport intervals, so that the UEs 14 and 16 within the coverage of the MBSFN 10 can treat the multi-cell broadcast transmission in the same way as a single large cell broadcast transmission, with multipath effects. The eNB 12 communicates with the UE 14 through uplink and downlink radio channels through a plurality of carrier frequencies. The UEs 14 and 16 receive MBMS from eNBs 100 and 102 via carrier frequencies 1000 and 1020 and unicast data services from the eNB 12 via a carrier 120. The carrier frequencies are referred to as Components Carriers (CC) in the LTE technology. Both MBMS transmissions on the component carriers 1000 and 1020 are available to the UE 14.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The UEs 14 and 16 are any device used directly by an end-user for communications, e.g., handhold mobile phones, laptop equipped with broadband network adaptors, or any other device capable of communicating. The UE 14 is capable of receiving the point-to-multipoint data service and the point-to-point data service concurrently on multiple carrier signals, and aggregating several carrier signals to increase bandwidth of data transmission up to 100MHz, is referred to as Carrier Aggregation (CA). The UE 14 comprises a baseband module (not shown) and a radio frequency (RF) module (not shown). The baseband module may comprise hardware to perform baseband signal processing including digital signal processing, coding and decoding, and so on. The RF module may comprise hardware to perform analog to digital conversion (ADC), digital to analog conversion (DAC), gain adjusting, modulation, demodulation, and so on. The RF module may receive RF signals from the eNBs 120 and 122 and down-convert the received RF wireless signals to baseband signals to be processed by the baseband unit, or receive baseband signals from the baseband unit up-convert the received baseband signals to RF wireless signals for uplink transmission. The RF module may comprise a mixer to up-convert the baseband signals with a component carrier signal oscillated at a radio frequency of the wireless communications system. The radio frequency may be 900MHz, 1900MHz, or 2100MHz utilized in WCDMA systems, or may be 900MHz, 2100MHz, or 2.6GHz utilized in LTE systems, or others depending on the radio access technology (RAT) in use. The UE 14 receives the downlink point-to-multipoint or point-to-point data on one or more component carriers.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the LTE system, the logical connections between the UE 14 and the eNBs 100, 102, and 12 are determined by the radio resource control (RRC) connection states comprising an RRC idle mode and an RRC connected mode. In the RRC idle mode, the communication device UE 14 has no connection to the cells, and can establish an RRC<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> connection therebetween to enter the RRC connected mode when necessary. In the RRC procedures, radio bearers (RBs) including data RBs (DRBs) and signaling RBs (SRBs) are generated or released. Through use of the SRBs, the cells can exchange RRC messages for radio resource settings including a configuration of component carriers. After establishing the RRC connection, the UE 14 receives the configuration to configure the component carriers to receive the unicast data.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Prior to acquiring the MBMS from the MBSFN 10, the UEs 14 and 16 obtain limited MBMS control information on a Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH) to configure a Multicast Control Channel (MCCH), which carries MBMS control information that the communication device can use to obtain the MBMS user data in a Multicast Transport Channel (MTCH). The limited MBMS control information on the BCCH for the MCCH configuration is defined in <i>SystemInformationBlockType13.</i> The MBMS control information is broadcasted in the MBSFN periodically using a configurable repetition period defined in the <i>SystemInformationBlockType13.</i> The MBSFN 10 periodically provides Dynamic Scheduling Information (DSI) at a Media Access Control (MAC) layer to indicate the sub-frames used for the MTCH, so that the UEs 14 and 16 can determine and retrieve an MBMS data service of interest accordingly.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, illustrating a block diagram of an exemplary communication device 2, incorporated as the UE 14 in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. The communication device 2 comprises a control module 20, a communication module 22, a memory module 24, and an IO module 26. The communication module 22, the memory module 24, and the IO module 26 are all coupled to the control module 20.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The communication module 22 comprises at least one transmitter (not shown) and at least one receiver (not shown), capable of receiving transmission on multiple component carriers. The receiver receives a configuration comprising information of the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> component carriers after establishing the RRC connection, so that the control module 20 can configure the at least one receiver to receive data services on the component carriers 1000, 1020, and 120 from the eNBs 100, 102 and 12 respectively. The EUTRAN 1 may transmit the MBMS data on some of the component carriers in the received configuration. In one embodiment of the invention, the communication device 2 receives information on the MBMS supportability of the available component carriers (a plurality of carriers) and only receives the MBMS data from the component carriers that provide the MBMS data by selecting the component carrier indicated in the received information. The communication module 22 receives information indicating whether the component carriers 1000, 1020, and 120 carry the MBMS data. The information may be included in the system information on the BCCH to be broadcasted on the component carriers 1000 or 1002 or to be transmitted by the component carrier 120 carrying the unicast data dedicated only to the communication device 2. The control module 20 determines whether the component carriers 1000, 1020, and 120 carry the MBMS data, so that the communication device 2 interested in the MBMS can receive the MBMS data only from the component carriers 1000 and 1020 that carry the MBMS data. In the example in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the control module 20 determines that the component carriers 1000 and 1020 that carry the MBMS data based on the received information, and turns on the corresponding receivers to obtain the MBMS data. The received MBMS data can be stored in the memory module 24. The control module 20 then processes the MBMS data for playback on the IO module 26 such as an LCD or LED display. The playback operation comprises displaying text or image data on the IO module 26, or playing video or audio multimedia data. In one embodiment, the communication device 2 is capable of receiving data services from multiple component carriers; thus, the control module 20 turns on the at least one receiver corresponding to the component carriers carrying the MBMS data for data retrieval. In another embodiment, the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> communication device 2 only supports single component carrier; thus, the control module 20 determines that only one component carrier will carry the MBMS data and configures the communication module 22 to receive the MBMS data from the determined component carrier, i.e. one of the component carriers 1000 and 1020.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The communication device 2 receives the information of the MBMS supportability of the component carriers, thereby determining that the component carriers carrying the MBMS data for data retrieval. The communication device 2 interested in the MBMS camps only on the component carriers that provide the MBMS, resulting in increased MBMS data retrieval.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The EUTRAN 1 also broadcasts control information relevant to the cell access right of the UE in <i>SystemInformationBlockType1</i> and other control information on the BCCH. A cell is regarded by the UE as invalid when a cell status of the cell is set as barred in the <i>SystemInformationBlockType1</i> or a predetermined control information is missing. The cell status is set as barred when a <i>cellBarred</i> parameter is set as barred or a <i>cellReservedForOperatorUse</i> parameter is reserved in the <i>SystemInformationBlockType1.</i> In one embodiment, the communication module 22 receives the control information on the BCCH and the control module 20 determines whether the cell has been barred according to the received control information. The control module 20 may determine that the cell has been barred when the <i>cellBarred</i> parameter is set as barred or a <i>cellReservedForOperatorUse</i> parameter as reserved in <i>SystemInformationBlockType1.</i> The control module 20 may also determine that the cell has been barred when a number of the control information on the BCCH is less than a predetermined number of the control information. For example, the UE 14 expects to receive <i>MasterInformationBlock, SystemInformationBlockType1,</i> and <i>SystemInformationBlockType2</i> on the BCCH. The control module 20 determines that the cell has been barred when the communication<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> module 22 only retrieves none or a part of the <i>MasterInformationBlock, SystemInformationBlockType1,</i> and <i>SystemInformationBlockType2</i> control information on the BCCH, i.e., the predetermined number of the control information is 3, and the eNB has been barred when the received control information number is less than 3. The EUTRAN 1 may further broadcast control information indicating that the cell is only capable of providing the MBMS data in the <i>MasterInformationBlock, SystemInformationBlockType1, SystemInformationBlockType2,</i> or other control information on the BCCH. A UE supporting 3GPP standards before a certain release (e.g. release 10) recognizes that the cells of eNBs 100 and 102 are barred, so that the cells are not selected. On the contrary, the communication device 2 in the present invention continues to retrieve the MBMS data from the eNB 100 or 102 only being capable of providing the MBMS data. The communication module 22 receives the MBMS data from the cells 100 or 102 when the cells 100 or 102 are only capable of providing the MBMS. The received MBMS data can be stored in the memory module 24. The control module 20 then processes the MBMS data for playback on the 10 module 26 such as an LCD or LED display.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The communication device 2 continues to acquire the MBMS from the MBMS only base stations, when the communication devices compliant with 3GPP releases before the certain release are prevented from camping on the component carriers only supporting the MBMS.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> depicts another exemplary EUTRAN 3 in the LTE system, comprising eNBs 30 and 32. A MBSFN 320 comprises the cell of eNB 32 providing the MBMS. The cell of eNB 30 provides a unicast service within a unicast coverage 300, where a part of the unicast coverage 300 is overlapped with the coverage of the MBSFN 320. A UE 34 receives a downlink broadcast transmission 320 from the cell of eNB 32 and a downlink unicast transmission 300 from the cell of eNB 30. The EUTRAN 3 incorporates the communication device 2 in the <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> 2</figref> as an embodiment of the UE 34.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">When entering the unicast coverage 300 and the MBMS coverage 320 area, the UE 34 is registered to specific tracking area codes (TAC) corresponding to location of the UE 34 in the unicast network and the MBMS network. The UE 34 is registered in Mobility Management Entity (MME, not shown) coupled to the cells of eNBs 30 and 32 respectively. The tracking area code represents a geographical area in the network, such as the unicast network or the MBMS network. A Mobility Management Entity (MME, not shown) in the EPC initiates a paging procedure by sending a PAGING message to each eNB with cells belonging to the tracking area in which the UE is registered. The UE 34 registered to a tracking area does not need to trigger a tracking area update so long as it remains in the tracking area; otherwise, the UE 34 is required to perform a tracking area update so that the EPC can track the UE 34 in the updated tracking area.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The communication module 22 receives a first geographical information representing a location of the communication device in the point-to-point data service from the cell of eNB 30 and a second geographical information representing a second location of the communication device in the point-to-multipoint data service from the cell of eNB 32. The first geographical information is the tracking area code of the cell of eNB 30 that provides the unicast data service, and the second geographical information is the tracking area code of the cell of eNB 32 that provides the MBMS data service. The tracking area code of the cell of eNB 30 is then stored in the memory module 34, and the tracking area code of the cell of eNB 32 is discarded by the control module 20. The control module 20 stops updating the tracking area when the communication module 22 receives the second tracking area code. The geographical information may be a public land mobile network (PLMN) identifier identifying a service provider of the data service.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The communication device 2 ignores the tracking<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> area code or the PLMN identity of the MBMS only cell, so that the communication device 2 stops switching the tracking area codes or the PLMN identities between the two networks (the MBMS and the unicast data network).</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In another arrangement, the communication module 22 receives a service provider identifier identifying a service provider of a MBMS, and receives the MBMS data only when the service provider identifier is valid.
