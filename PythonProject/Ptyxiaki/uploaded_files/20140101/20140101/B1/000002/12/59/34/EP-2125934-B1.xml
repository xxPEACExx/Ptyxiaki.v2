In random polysiloxane/polyimide block copolymers the size of the siloxane block is determined by the number of siloxy units (analogous to g in Formula (I)) in the monomer used to form the block copolymer. In some non-random polysiloxane/polyimide block copolymers the order of the polyimide blocks and polysiloxane blocks is determined but the size of the siloxane block is still determined by the number of siloxy units in the monomer. In contrast, the polysiloxane/polyimide block copolymers described herein have extended siloxane blocks. Two or more siloxane monomers are linked together to form an extended siloxane oligomer which is then used to form the block copolymer. Polysiloxane/polyimide block copolymers having extended siloxane blocks and a siloxane content of 10 weight percent to 45 weight percent, based on the total weight of the block copolymer, have surprisingly high impact strength.

"Molar excess" as used in this context is defined as being in excess of the other reactant.

Techniques for irradiation are known the art and include e-beam techniques. The irradiation results in crosslinking within the siloxane domains of the copolymer. The cross linked material shows a surprising increase in heat distortion temperature and E' modulus.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">In some embodiments the cross linked material has an E' modulus at 200°C of 20 to 100 megaPascals and a heat distortion temperature of 180 to 210°C at<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> 0.44 megaPascals as determined by ASTM D4065-01 at a thickness of 300 micrometers. In some embodiments the cross linked material has an E' modulus at 200°C of 5 to 20 megaPascals and a heat distortion temperature of 90 to 150°C at 0.44 megaPascals as determined by ASTM D4065-01 at a thickness of 300 micrometers.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">In one embodiment, a conductive wire comprises a conductor and a covering disposed over the conductor. The covering comprises a composition and the composition comprises a cross linked polysiloxane/polyimide block copolymer as described above. The composition is applied to the conductor by a suitable method such as extrusion coating to form a covered conductor such as a coated wire. For example, a coating extruder equipped with a screw, crosshead, breaker plate, distributor, nipple, and die can be used. The melted composition forms a covering disposed over a circumference of the conductor. Extrusion coating may employ a single taper die, a double taper die, other appropriate die or combination of dies to position the conductor centrally and avoid die lip build up.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">In some embodiments it may be useful to dry the composition before extrusion coating. Exemplary drying conditions are 60 to 120°C for 2 to 20 hours. Additionally, in one embodiment, during extrusion coating, the composition is melt filtered, prior to formation of the coating, through one or more filters. In some embodiments the composition will have substantially no particles greater than 80 micrometers in size. In some embodiments any particulates present will be less than or equal to 40 micrometers in size. In some embodiments there will be substantially no particulates greater than 20 micrometers in size. The presence and size of particulates can be determined using a solution of 1 gram of composition dissolved in 10 milliliters of a solvent, such as chloroform, and analyzing it using microscopy or light scattering techniques. Substantially no particulates is defined as having less than or equal to 3 particulates, or, more specifically, less than or equal to 2 particulates, or, even more specifically, less than or equal to 1 particulate per one gram sample. Low levels of particulates are beneficial for giving a layer of insulation on a conductive wire that will not have electrically conductive defects as well as giving coatings with improved mechanical properties, for instance elongation.<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --></p><p id="p0070" num="0070">The extruder temperature during extrusion coating is generally less than the degradation temperature of the block copolymer. Additionally the processing temperature is adjusted to provide a sufficiently fluid molten composition to afford a covering for the conductor, for example, higher than the softening point of The composition, or more specifically at least 30°C higher than the melting point of The composition.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">After extrusion coating the covered conductor is usually cooled using a water bath, water spray, air jets or a combination comprising one or more of the foregoing cooling methods. Exemplary water bath temperatures are 20 to 85°C. After the covered conductor is cooled and optionally dried it is irradiated with a dosage of 16 to 130, or, more specifically, 32 to 64 megaGrays to form a cross linked covering.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">In one embodiment, the composition is applied to the conductor to form a covering disposed over and in physical contact with the conductor. Additional layers may be applied to the covering.

For instance, an optional adhesion promoting layer may be disposed between the conductor and covering. In another example the conductor may be coated with a metal deactivator prior to applying the covering. Alternatively, a metal deactivator can be mixed with the polysiloxane/polyimide block copolymers. In another example the intervening layer comprises a thermoset composition that, in some cases, is foamed.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">The conductor may comprise a single strand or a plurality of strands. In some cases, a plurality of strands may be bundled, twisted, braided, or a combination of the foregoing to form a conductor. Additionally, the conductor may have various shapes such as round or oblong. Suitable conductors include, but are not limited to, copper wire, aluminum wire, lead wire, and wires of alloys comprising one<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> or more of the foregoing metals. The conductor may also be coated with, e.g., tin, gold or silver. In some embodiments the conductor comprises optical fibers.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">The cross-sectional area of the conductor and thickness of the covering may vary and is typically determined by the end use of the conductive wire. The conductive wire can be used as conductive wire without limitation, including, for example, for harness wire for automobiles, wire for household electrical appliances, wire for electric power, wire for instruments, wire for information communication, wire for electric cars, as well as ships, airplanes, and the like.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">In some embodiments the covering may have a thickness of 0.01 to 10 millimeters (mm) or, more specifically, 0.05 to 5 mm, or, even more specifically 1 to 3 mm.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">A cross-section of an exemplary conductive wire is seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1.
