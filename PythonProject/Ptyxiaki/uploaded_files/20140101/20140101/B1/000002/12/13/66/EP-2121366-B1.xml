particular for a heavy vehicle fuel tank, comprising a housing defining a vent opening, which is provided with a vent membrane permeable for fuel vapour and air for venting the fuel tank.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Vehicle fuel to be supplied to a combustion engine of a vehicle is a highly volatile medium. In particular, when a vehicle fuel tank is filled with liquid fuel at a gas station by means of a typical fuel pump nozzle, fuel vapour above the liquid fuel in the interior of said fuel tank is to be displaced as the fuel level increases. Obviously, this vapour must be vented for the tank to be filed. Moreover, the fuel vapour resulting from an increase of the ambient temperature, in particular at a high ambient temperature level, also has to be vented.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The prior art document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6557719B1"><text>US 6,557,719 B1</text></patcit> discloses a fuel tank equipped with a gas evacuation system. The fuel tank includes an opening provided with a fuel vapour and gas permeable membrane, which is supported by means of a grid.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20050098160A1"><text>US 2005/0098160 A1</text></patcit> also discloses a fuel vent assembly having a rollover protection in order to avoid a flow-out of fuel when the vehicle is upside down due to an accident.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="DE4006465A1"><text>DE 40 06 465 A1</text></patcit> also discloses a fuel vent assembly for a fuel tank with a corresponding rollover protection.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Further vent assemblies are disclosed by <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP8200034A"><text>JP 8 200034 A</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO2005100832A1"><text>WO 2005/100 832 A1</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Although, the above described documents disclose a rollover protection and provide a fuel vapour venting function in order to permit an outflow of air and fuel vapour through the preamble membrane, these devices are not adapted to permit discharging of excessive pressure from the fuel tank. However, the occurrence of excessive pressure can lead to damages at the fuel vent assembly, in particular at the membrane.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a fuel tank vent assembly which allows a reliable venting of the fuel tank and which in addition provides a discharge function in case of excessive pressure within the fuel tank.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">This object is solved by a fuel tank vent assembly for a vehicle fuel tank, in particular for a heavy vehicle fuel tank, comprising a housing defining a vent opening which is provided with the vent membrane permeable for fuel vapour and air for venting the fuel tank, wherein said fuel tank assembly further comprises a membrane holding element movable between a closed position and a discharge position.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">By providing a movable membrane holding element which supports the membrane, it is possible to maintain the membrane in the closed position as long as the pressure within the fuel tank does not exceed a certain pressure limit. In said closed position, the conventional venting function of the fuel tank is provided due to the permeability of the membrane for fuel vapour and air. However, as soon as the pressure within the fuel tank exceeds a certain pressure limit, the membrane holding element is moved to the discharge position due to the high pressure. In said discharge position, the pressure can be discharged quickly by permitting a substantially free outflow of air and fuel vapour from the interior of the fuel tank.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the invention, said membrane holding element is held in said closed position by means of magnetic forces. This allows a reliable holding of the membrane holding element in said closed position. Moreover, said housing includes a first stop element defining said closed position of said membrane holding element. Said first stop element is magnetized. Said membrane holding element includes a magnetized region attracted by a complementary magnetic force of said magnetized first stop element.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Said magnetic attraction forces of said membrane holding element and said housing are adapted to permit a movement of said membrane holding element from said closed position to said discharge position, if the pressure within said fuel tank exceeds a predetermined pressure limit. Thus, the membrane holding element is held in its closed position as long as the pressure in the interior of the fuel tank is below the pressure limit. As soon as the pressure within the fuel tank exceeds the pressure limit, e. g. in a situation with a high ambient temperature leading to a substantial pressure increase within the fuel tank, the forces resulting from the pressure increase overcome the magnetic attraction forces. Thus, the membrane holding element is lifted and moved into its discharge position whereby a pressure discharge is permitted.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to a further embodiment of the invention, said housing includes second stop means defining said discharge position of said membrane holding element and limiting its movement. Thereby, losing the membrane holding element can be prevented.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to one embodiment of the invention, said membrane holding element is formed as a hollow cylindrical ring supporting said vent membrane. Moreover, said membrane holding element and said housing can abut to one another in a fluid-tight manner in said closed position. Thereby, it can be prevented that fuel flows out of the fuel tank, if the vehicle is upside down due to an accident or if the fuel tank is excessively filled with liquid fuel. It is to be understood that the magnetic attraction forces mentioned above and holding said membrane holding element in its closed position are adapted to maintain this fluid-tight abutment between the membrane holding element and said housing during such situations. This means that the pressure applied to the membrane by liquid fluid, in case the vehicle is upside down or alike, never exceeds the pressure limit for overcoming the magnetic attraction forces.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to a further embodiment of the invention, said housing is provided with at least one bypass recess surrounding said membrane holding element for discharge purposes, if the latter is in said discharge position. With regard to the membrane, the invention can further provide that said vent membrane is formed from fuel vapour permeable material, e. g. a membrane formed by an acrylic copolymer on nylon or by a polytetrafluoroethane on nylon or by silicone.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The invention further relates to a fuel tank equipped with the fuel tank vent assembly as described above.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the following one embodiment of the invention is described with regard to the figures, wherein:
<dl id="dl0001"><dt>Fig. 1</dt><dd>shows a perspective schematical view of a fuel tank vent assembly according to the invention;</dd><dt>Fig. 2</dt><dd>shows a cross section through the assembly according to <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1</figref> in its closed position, and<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></dd><dt>Fig. 3</dt><dd>shows the assembly according to <figref idrefs="f0001">figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref> in its opened (discharge) position.</dd></dl></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1</figref>, a fuel tank vent assembly 10 according to the invention is shown in a perspective view. The fuel tank vent assembly 10 includes a housing 12 defining a vent opening 14. The vent opening 14 is restricted by an upper flange 16 formed on the upper end of said cylindrical housing 12. Within the housing 12, a cylindrical membrane holding element 18 is received. The membrane holding element 18 is provided with a tensioned membrane arranged at the upper side of the cylindrical membrane holding element 18.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2</figref>, which is a cross section through the fuel tank vent assembly 10 according to <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1</figref>, the membrane holding element 18 is formed as a cylindrical ring and is movable within the hollow housing 12 in axial direction, as shown by arrow 22. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> shows a closed position in which the membrane holding element 18 rests on a lower flange 24 provided at the lower end of the housing 12. This lower flange 24 is magnetized. Moreover, the membrane holding element 18 is magnetized in a corresponding region 26 facing said flange 24. Thus, complementary magnetic attraction forces of the magnetized flange 24 and the lower region of the membrane holding element 18 result in a holding function such that the membrane holding element 18 is held in this closed position, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2</figref>, by the magnetic attraction forces. In this closed position according to <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2</figref>, the lower abutting surface of the membrane holding element 18 abuts in a fluid-tight manner against the upper abutting surface of the flange 24.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The membrane 20 is formed from a fluid-tight material but is permeable to fuel vapour as well as to air. It is formed, e. g. from a silicone material, a cellulose material, an acrylic copolymer on a nylon, a polytetrafluoroethane on nylon or the like.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Moreover, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2</figref>, a plurality of guiding bars 26 are provided on the inner surface of the housing 12 in its upper region. The guiding bars are arranged in a certain distance from one each other. Thereby, between two guiding bars 26 a bypass recess is formed in said housing 12, respectively.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">If the fuel tank vent assembly is arranged within a fuel tank wall 30, a pressure prevailing within the fuel tank acts on the membrane 20. This pressure results in a force F acting on the membrane 20. As long as this force F does not exceed the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> magnetic attraction forces resulting from the magnetized regions 24 and 25, the membrane holding element 18 is held in the closed position as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">However, as soon as force F exceeds these magnetic attraction forces, the membrane holding element 18 is lifted from said flange 24 and moved upwards as shown by arrow 22 in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2</figref>. Due to the force F, the membrane holding element 18 takes the discharge position shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 3</figref>. In this discharge position, the membrane holding element 18 is no longer in fluid-tight abutment with the flange 24. Instead it is lifted into abutment with the upper flange 16 of the housing 12. However, due to the bars 26 and recesses 28 arranged therebetween, there is a direct fluidic connection between the interior of the fuel tank and the ambience. Thus, air and fluid vapour depicted with dashed lines 32 can bypass the membrane holding element 18 and can stream from the interior of the fuel tank to the outside. Thereby, an excessive pressure within the interior of the fuel tank can be discharged. As soon as the excessive pressure has been relieved, the force F acting on the membrane decreases. Due to the gravity and the magnetic forces of the magnetized regions 24 and 26, the membrane holding element 18 returns to the closed position according to <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The invention provides a fuel tank vent assembly 10 as well as a fuel tank 30 equipped with such a fuel tank vent assembly 10, which guarantee a conventional and efficient venting function through a membrane which is permeable for fuel vapour and air. Moreover, it includes a membrane holding element 26 which is held by magnetic forces in a closed position, wherein the venting function is provided whereas an exit of liquid fuel is prevented, even if the vehicle is in an upside-down-position after an accident. However, in situations of an excessive pressure within the fuel tank, the fuel tank vent assembly 10 according to the invention provides a discharge function, wherein the membrane holding element 18 is moved into said discharge position (<figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2</figref>). In this discharge position, the membrane holding element can be bypassed by out-streaming fuel vapour and air.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980298" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Kraftstoffbehälterbelüftungsanlage (10) für einen Kraftstoffbehälter eines Kraftfahrzeugs (30), insbesondere für einen Kraftstoffbehälter eines Lastkraftfahrzeugs, umfassend ein Gehäuse (12), welches eine Lüftungsöffnung (14) definiert, die durch eine für Kraftstoffdampf und Luft zur Lüftung des Kraftstoffbehälters (30) durchlässige Lüftungsmembran (20) ausgebildet ist, und einen zwischen einer geschlossenen Stellung und einer Auslassstellung beweglichen Membranhalteelement (18),<br/>
