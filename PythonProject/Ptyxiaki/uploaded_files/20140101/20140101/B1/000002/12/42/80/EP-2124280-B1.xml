Then, whether catalyst for an anode electrode is degraded or not is decided based on<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> whether a shift component of the current/voltage characteristic after the increase of the hydrogen flow rate exceeds a predetermined value with reference to that before the increase of hydrogen flow rate. Further, current/voltage characteristics before and after an increase of an air flow rate are measured, and then whether catalyst for a cathode electrode is degraded or not is decided based on whether a shift component of the current/voltage characteristic after the increase of the air flow rate exceeds a predetermined value with reference to that before the increase of air flow rate. Such processing is not sufficient for a diagnosis as to whether the catalyst for each electrode is degraded or not. That is, when current/voltage characteristics of a fuel cell are measured while increasing air or hydrogen, air, water, or hydrogen affects electrode catalyst, so that the state of the electrode catalyst may be changed. Further, since a water-content state of electrolyte also affects the state of the electrode catalyst, there is a need to make a decision concerning degradation of electrode catalyst so as to be free from the water-content state.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Thus, in order to cope with the above-stated problems of conventional techniques, it is an object of the present invention to decide precisely whether electrode catalyst of a fuel cell is degraded or not.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In order to achieve the above-stated object, a fuel cell system according to claim 1 is provided, particularly a fuel cell system of the present invention includes a fuel cell that generates electricity in response to supply of reaction gas. The fuel cell system is configured so that a degradation state of electrode catalyst of the fuel cell can be decided based on a cyclic voltammetry characteristic of output current of the fuel cell detected associated with output voltage of the fuel cell being changed while a supply amount of the reaction gas supplied to the fuel cell being made constant.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">With this configuration, a degradation state of the electrode catalyst is decided based on a Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) characteristic closely<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> relating to an activation state of the electrode catalyst, e.g., voltammogram (a current-voltage hysteresis curve). The I-V characteristics used in conventional techniques, which are affected by a plurality of factors such as a loss incident to a cathode reaction, a loss incident to material transfer at a cathode, a loss incident to an anode reaction, and a loss incident to material transfer at an anode, are not accurate as an index to measure activity of the electrode catalyst. In this respect, the CV characteristic measured while stabilizing reaction gas, which shows a distinctive change characteristic depending on an oxidation reduction state of the electrode catalyst and the magnitude of voltage, can be an index showing a state of the electrode catalyst accurately by referring to a value and an effective area thereof. According to the present invention, a degradation state of electrode catalyst is decided based on this CV characteristic, and therefore catalyst degradation can be decided extremely accurately.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Herein, the CV characteristic has distinctive parts whose characteristic changes depending on a state of electrode catalyst, and therefore to detect a change in characteristic of these distinctive parts enables a decision concerning degradation of electrode catalyst. For instance, an integration value obtained by integrating the CV characteristic over a certain section may be calculated or a current value of a minimum point and a maximum point may be detected, which then may be compared with allowable thresholds.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">For instance, a degradation state of the electrode catalyst of the fuel cell preferably is decided based on a change in a minimum point indicated by output current of the fuel cell detected associated with a decrease of output voltage of the fuel cell. With this configuration, a change of characteristic in a distinctive part of the CV characteristic, which is the most susceptible to degradation of the electrode catalyst, can be detected.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">More specifically, the present invention includes: voltage conversion means that changes output voltage of the fuel cell; voltage detection means that detects output voltage of the fuel cell; current detection means that detects output current of the fuel cell; and decision means that decides whether electrode catalyst of the fuel cell is degraded or not based on the current detected by the current detection means. The decision means calculates a value corresponding to an effective area of the electrode catalyst based on current detected by the current detection means associated with a change of output voltage of the fuel cell while monitoring voltage detected by the voltage detection means under a condition that an activation treatment is conducted to the electrode catalyst, and compares a result of the calculation with a degradation decision value to decide whether the electrode catalyst is degraded or not.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">With this configuration, a value corresponding to an effective area of the electrode catalyst is calculated based on current detected associated with a change of output voltage of the fuel cell while monitoring output voltage of the fuel cell under a condition that an activation treatment is conducted to the electrode catalyst. A value corresponding to the effective area of the electrode catalyst is compared with a degradation decision value to decide whether the electrode catalyst is degraded or not. It can be decided that the electrode catalyst is degraded if the value corresponding to the effective area of the electrode catalyst is smaller than the degradation decision value.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In this way, measurement of cyclic voltammetry (CV) is conducted so as to measure current while scanning applied voltage to the fuel cell repeatedly within a certain range under the condition where the electrode catalyst is activated, whereby a value corresponding to an effective area of the electrode catalyst associated with degradation of the electrode catalyst can be detected<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> precisely, thus resulting in a precise decision whether the electrode catalyst is degraded or not.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The configuration of the fuel cell system

detects oxidation current as output current of the fuel cell.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">With this configuration, the measurement of cyclic voltammetry (CV) under the condition that oxidation current flows through the fuel cell leads to a reaction of Pt·H →H<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup> within a predetermined voltage range when Pt is used as electrode catalyst, and therefore when current obtained at this time is integrated, the electric quantity Q[C] associated with hydrogen desorption can be found, thus enabling a decision as to whether the electrode catalyst is degraded or not based on the electric quantity Q[C] associated with hydrogen desorption.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The voltage conversion means changes output voltage of the fuel cell under a condition that the current detection means detects reduction current as output current of the fuel cell.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">With this configuration, the measurement of cyclic voltammetry (CV) under the condition that reduction current flows through the fuel cell leads to a reaction of Pt·OH + 2H<sup>+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> → Pt + H<sub>2</sub>O as a reaction of OH<sup>-</sup> desorption within a predetermined voltage range, and therefore when current obtained at this time is integrated, the electric quantity Q[C] associated with water desorption can be found, thus enabling a precise decision as to whether
