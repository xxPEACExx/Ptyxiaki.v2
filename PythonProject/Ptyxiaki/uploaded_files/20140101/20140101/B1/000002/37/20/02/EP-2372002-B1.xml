The engagement of the sinkers with the knitting which achieves tensioning of the loop of knitting on the shank of the needle, in this step, also prevents the loop of knitting from following the needle in its extraction movement and achieves assuredly the opening of the latch and the passage of the loop below said latch. The knitting loop tensioning action on the shank of the needle by the sinkers is generally assisted by traction of the already-formed knitted fabric, which is performed generally by means of pneumatic traction devices in small-diameter circular machines and by means of mechanical devices in the other machines.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Usually, the sinkers are located in appropriately provided slots which are formed, at the end of the needle holder from which the needles protrude to engage the thread at a feed or drop of the machine, directly in the needle holder or in a supporting element which is fixed to the needle holder. The sinkers are generally actuated by means of appropriately provided cams,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> which face the region of the needle holder in which the sinkers are accommodated and define paths which can be engaged by heels of the sinkers, which protrude from the needle holder, as a consequence of a movement of the needle holder with respect to such cams.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In many types of high-gauge knitting machine, in which the space between the needles is extremely reduced, there are no sinkers.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In these machines, the absence of the sinkers, forced by size requirements, causes problems and drawbacks. The absence of the sinkers, during accidental breakage of the yarn being knitted, in fact prevents automatic resumption of the formation of knitting and forces manual intervention to release the new loops of knitting on the shank of the needles which, as a consequence of the breakage of the thread, have lost the knitting.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Moreover, owing to the fact that in these machines the tensioning action of the loops of knitting on the shank of the needles while said needles are extracted with their tip from the needle holder to engage the thread at a feed or drop of the machine is performed exclusively by the fabric tensioning device, this tension can be insufficient, also due to the large number of needles which engage the knitting, to ensure the passage of the loops of knitting below the latch of the needles while said needles are extracted from the needle holder, causing knitting errors.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In order to limit these problems, in some cases these machines are actuated by moving to knit in each instance, at a feed or drop of the machine, only one needle of every two contiguous needles, so that the needle that is not used to form knitting performs a retention action on the loops of knitting formed by the contiguous needles which are made to knit. However, this solution has the drawback of not allowing to use fully the production potential of the machine.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP0683257A"><text>EP 0 683 257 A</text></patcit> discloses a circular knitting machine with stitch retention sinkers that comprising a plurality of needles, which are accommodated in slots formed in at least one needle supporting element and are controllably movable along the longitudinal extension of the corresponding slot from an extracted position, in which the tip of the needles protrudes from a longitudinal end of the corresponding slot to engage at least one thread fed by a thread guide, to a retracted position, in which the tip of the needles is retracted into the corresponding slot so as to form a loop of knitting with the engaged thread, and vice versa. The machine comprises multiple sinkers that are arranged alternately between the needles and are each arranged laterally with respect to a needle. The end of each one of the sinkers that is located proximate to the longitudinal end of the corresponding slot from which the tip of the corresponding needle protrudes to engage the thread is provided with a beak that is directed towards the bottom of the slot.

num="0017">With reference to the figures, the knitting machine with latch needles and without sinkers, generally designated by the reference numerals 1, 101 in the two examples and shown only partially for the sake of simplicity, comprises a needle holder 2, 102, on one face of which there are multiple side-by-side slots 3, 103, which are open at one of their longitudinal ends onto a side of the needle holder 2, 102 which forms the knitting forming plane 4, 104, i.e., the plane on which the portions of loop linking knitting rest during the formation of the loops of knitting, as will become better apparent hereinafter.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">A needle 5 is arranged in each of the slots 3, 103 and can be actuated in a per se known manner along the corresponding slot 3, 103, with a reciprocating motion which is composed of an extraction motion, by means of which the needle 5 is extracted with its tip 5a and with a portion of its shank 5b from the longitudinal end of the slot 3, 103 formed in the knitting forming plane 4, 104 to release, onto its shank 5b, the previously formed loop of knitting and/or to engage the yarn or yarns dispensed at a feed or drop of the machine, and a retraction motion, by means of which the needle 5 retracts with its tip 5a into the slot 3, 103, thus forming a new loop of knitting and lowering the previously formed loop of knitting in order to form knitting.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The machine comprises, in at least part of the regions of the needle holder 2, 102 comprised between two contiguous slots 3, 103 and preferably in each region of the needle holder 2, 102 comprised between two contiguous slots 3, 103, a knitting retention element<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 6, 106, 156, which has a portion 6a, 106a, 156a which forms a stop shoulder 7, 107, 157 for the knitting. Said knitting retention element 6, 106, 156 can move on command from a first position, in which it does not interfere with the knitting being formed, to a second position, in which it is inserted, with its portion 6a, 106a, 156a, between two contiguous needles 5 in the region which faces the knitting forming plane 4, 104, in order to retain, by means of the stop shoulder 7, 107, 157, the portion of knitting that lies between two contiguous needles 5, so as to contrast the entrainment of the knitting by the needles 5 during their extraction motion. The machine is provided with actuation means for actuating the knitting retention element 6, 106, 156 in order to perform its transfer from the first position to the second position and vice versa in a manner which is coordinated with the actuation of the needles 5.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">More particularly, the knitting retention element 6, 106, 156 has a laminar shape and is arranged on a plane which is parallel to the side walls of the slots 3, 103 between which it is arranged.
