That is, for adjusting the resonance frequency of the magnetron of structure according to reference 2 to the resonance frequency of the magnetron of structure according to reference 1, the gap between the vanes 230 and the strap rings 241, 243 and the gap between the large and small strap rings 241, 243 have to be smaller, since thicker strap rings 241, 243 are required.

Therefore, only one copper sheet of which side is equal to the outer diameter of the first strap ring 41 is required for three strap rings 41-43 according to the example of this embodiment.

Therefore, time for manufacturing and cost for equipments can be reduced.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">According to reference 2, since two strap rings 241, 243 are located only one end of the vanes 230 in the direction of the axis 22, characteristics such as load stability and cathode back heat by electrons may be deteriorated. However,<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> according to this embodiment, since two strap rings 41, 43 are located at the first end and one strap ring 42 is located at the second end, the balance of the electronic potentials at the first and second ends and the characteristics such as load stability and cathode back heat by electrons are improved.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In accurate adjustment of the resonance frequency of the magnetron, the resonance frequency is measured after insertion of the antenna into a waveguide and is adjusted by deforming the strap ring at the input side (the second end side) to change the capacitance between the vanes and the strap rings. This adjustment method cannot be used if one of the strap rings 241, 243 is not located at the input side (the second end side) as in the magnetron according to reference 2.
