The invention also relates to strip material produced according to this process.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Usually steel strip material is subjected to a continuous annealing process after rolling, to provide the desired mechanical properties to the strip material. After annealing, the strip material can be coated, for instance by hot dip galvanising, and/or skin pass rolled to supply the desired surface properties to the strip material.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The annealing is performed by heating the strip at a certain heating rate, keeping the strip at a certain top temperature during a certain holding time, and cooling the strip at a certain cooling rate. For some purposes during the cooling of the strip the temperature is kept constant for a certain period of time to overage the strip. This conventional continuous annealing process provides mechanical properties for the strip which are constant over the length and width of the strip. Such a strip is cut into blanks, for instance for the automotive industry.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For certain purposes, mostly in the automotive industry, a blank is needed which has sections that have different mechanical properties. Such blanks are conventionally made by producing two or more strips having different mechanical properties, cutting blank parts from these strips and welding together the two or more blank parts having different mechanical properties to form one blank. It is also possible to weld the strips together and then cut blanks out of the combined strip. In this way a part for a body-in-white can be formed that, for instance, has mechanical properties at one end that are different from the mechanical properties at the other end.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, these so-called tailor welded blanks have the drawback that the welds form a special zone due to the heating during welding, hereby deteriorating the blank for instance during a forming step of the blank.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The Japanese patent application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2001011541A"><text>JP2001011541 A</text></patcit> provides a method for providing a tailored steel strip for press forming in which the mechanical properties differ over the width of the strip. According to a first option, the mechanical properties are changed over the width of the strip by changing the cooling rate over the width of the strip when the steel strip leaves the continuous annealing furnace. The Japanese patent application<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> as a second option mentions the changing of the mechanical properties over the width of the strip by adjusting the quantity of nitriding or carbonization over the width of the strip. A third option according to the Japanese patent application is the use of a steel strip having two or more sheet thicknesses over the width of the strip.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The options according to Japanese patent application <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2001011541A"><text>JP2001011541 A</text></patcit> have some drawbacks. The third option is only possible when the thickness of the strip is symmetrical over the width of the strip. The second option using nitriding or carbonising is not suitable for the fast processing as is nowadays required in the steel industry. The first option provides only a limited variation in the mechanical properties in view of the example given in this document.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2004314113B"><text>JP2004314113</text></patcit> discloses a high-tensile steel strip having different mechanical properties by controlling a rising temperature in a desired quantity in the width direction of a rough bar at a finish rolling entrance side or between a finish rolling stands</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is an object of the invention to provide a process for the heat treatment of strip material providing a variation in mechanical properties over the width of the strip that can be performed at economical velocities.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the heat treatment of strip material providing a variation in mechanical properties over the width of the strip that makes a wide variation in mechanical properties feasible.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is a further object of the invention to provide a process for the heat treatment of strip material providing a variation in mechanical properties over the width of the strip wherein other treatment methods are use than provided in the state of the art.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">It is also an object of the invention to provide strip material having mechanical properties that differ over the width of the strip</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">One or more of the objects of the invention are reached with a process for the heat treatment of metal strip material providing mechanical properties that differ over the width of the strip, wherein the strip is heated and cooled and optionally over-aged during a continuous annealing process, characterised in that at least one of the following parameters in the process differs over the width of the strip:
<ul><li>heating rate</li><li>top temperature</li><li>top temperature holding time</li><li>cooling trajectory after top temperature</li></ul>
or, when over-aging is performed, that at least one of the following parameters in the process differs over the width of the strip:<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> -->
<ul><li>heating rate</li><li>top temperature</li><li>top temperature holding time</li><li>cooling trajectory after top temperature</li><li>over-aging temperature</li><li>over-aging temperature holding time</li><li>lowest cooling temperature before over-aging</li><li>re-heating rate to over-aging temperature</li></ul>
and wherein at least one of the cooling trajectories after top temperature follows a non-linear temperature time path.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The inventors have found that each of the above parameters alone or in combination, when given a value that differs over the width of the strip, results in mechanical properties that differ over the strip as well. This invention thus provides a variety of processes to obtain strip material having mechanical properties that vary over the width of the strip, and the invention makes it possible to tailor the mechanical properties of the strip material over the width of the strip exactly to the wishes of the end-user of the strip that uses the tailored blanks, for instance the car manufacturer who uses such blanks to form parts for a body-in-white. With a non-linear temperature-time path is meant that the cooling rate is changed on purpose shortly after the start of the cooling trajectory, above 200°C.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to a preferred embodiment the top temperature is different over two or more width zones of the strip, and optionally also the cooling trajectory after the top temperature holding time is different over these two or more width zones of the strip. The top temperature of the heat treatment has a strong influence on the mechanical properties of the strip and therefore is very suitable to provide different mechanical properties in different width zones of the strip. The cooling trajectory after the top temperature holding time can add to that, as elucidated above.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Preferably, the top temperature in at least one width zone is between the Ac1 temperature and the Ac3 temperature, and the top temperature in at least one other width zone is above Ac3 temperature. The use of these temperature ranges provides a strong variation in mechanical properties.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Alternatively, the top temperature in at least one width zone is below the Ac1 temperature, and the top temperature in at least one other width zone is between the Ac1 temperature and the Ac3 temperature. Whether this or the above preference is used of course depends on the type of metal and the purpose for which it will be used.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to an alternative the top temperature in at least one width zone is above the Ac3 temperature, and the top temperature in at least one other width zone is below Ac1 temperature. For this alternative the same holds as above.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to another alternative the top temperature in at least two width zones is between the Ac1 temperature and the Ac3 temperature, and there exists a temperature difference of at least 20° C between the two top temperatures in these two width zones. Whether this alternative will be used or one of the above possibilities again depends on the type of steel used and the purpose for which the strip material will be used.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to another preferred embodiment the cooling trajectories are different over two or more width zones of the strip and at least one of the cooling trajectories follows a non-linear temperature-time path. This means that for instance in one width zone the cooling rate changes from 5 to 40°C/s after a first cooling stretch, whereas another width zone is cooled at 40°C/s from the start.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to a preferred embodiment an over-aging step is performed, the over-aging temperature being different over two or more width zones of the strip and/or the lowest cooling temperature before over-aging being different over these two or more widths of the strip. In this way the over-aging process step is used to vary the mechanical properties over the width zones of the metal strip. Often, the different over-aging temperatures are used in combination with different top temperatures.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to this embodiment preferably the over-aging temperature holding time is between 10 and 1000 seconds, more preferably the over-aging temperature holding time being different over two or more width zones of the strip. This measure provides an accurate way to vary the mechanical properties over the width zones of the strip.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to still another preferred embodiment the heating rate and/or the re-heating rate to over-aging temperature is different over two or more width zones of the strip. The heating rates provide a good way to vary the mechanical properties, often in combination with other parameters.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to a special embodiment at least one of the parameters in the process varies gradually over at least part of the width of the strip. In this way also the mechanical properties vary gradually over the width of the strip, which can be very advantageous for the parts produced from blanks cut from such a strip. Such gradually varying properties cannot be provides by tailor welded blanks.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In most cases the strip is a steel strip, preferably a steel strip having a composition of a HSLA, DP or TRIP steel. However, the process according to the invention could also be used for aluminium strips.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to a further preferred embodiment the at least one parameter that differs over the width of the strip is changed in value at at least one moment in time during the processing of the strip. According to another preferred embodiment at least one other parameter is chosen to differ over the width of the strip at at least one moment in time during the processing of the strip. In these ways the mechanical properties of the strip are also varied over the length of the strip, so in one strip two or more stretches are produced having different varying properties over the length of the strip. This can be advantageous when strip is produced that is many hundreds of meters long and only relatively small series of parts have to be produced.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The invention also relates to strip material having mechanical properties that differ over the width of the strip, produced according to the process as elucidated hereinabove.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The invention will be elucidated referring to four examples, of which the temperature-time cycles and the schematic zone distribution of the tailor annealed strips are shown in the accompanying drawings.

One way to achieve different amounts of total elongation is by making varying dual-phase microstructures with different volume fractions of martensite in a ferrite matrix. Increasing the volume fraction of martensite increases the strength and decreases the total elongation.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The different volume fractions of ferrite-martensite are made by heating up to different top temperatures as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1a</figref>. The example shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 1b</figref> is a steel strip that is tailor annealed for a roof-bow component in an automotive body-in-white. There are three zones (not including the transitional regions), where the two outer zones have the same temperature-time cycle and the middle zone is different. L denotes the length direction of the strip. The outer zones (A1 and A2) require higher ductility and are therefore heated to a top-temperature of about 780°C for 30 seconds, while the centre region (B) is heated to a higher temperature of 830°C for 30 seconds. The different top-temperatures result in different amount of austenite at the end of the temperature-time cycle. After the heating at the top temperatures, the whole strip is cooled with a rate of 30°C/s down to less than 200°C and thereafter naturally cooled. The dash shape in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 1b</figref> shows the form of a blank to be cut out from the strip, which will be used to form the component. The chemistry of the example material is given in Table 1 and the properties after the above processing are give in Table 2.

Instead of martensite, a fully bainitic microstructure which forms at slower cooling rates can be used, which has lower strength but more ductility. Such extremes may be useful to utilise the maximum ductility for a given material in certain regions of a component where high formability is required, while other regions have low ductility requirements and maximum strength is preferred.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">Figure 2</figref>, tailor annealing using the principle of different top temperatures below and above Ac3 is used to manufacture steel strip optimised for a bumper-beam component. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 2b</figref>, the strip is annealed with three different width zones where the two outer zones (A1 and A2) have the same temperature below Ac3 (720°C) and the middle zone (B) is at a higher temperature (860°C, in this case greater than Ac3, see the temperature-time diagram of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 2a</figref>. L denotes the length direction of the strip. The original condition of the strip is cold-rolled and during the annealing, the material in zones A1 and A2 recrystallises to become equiaxed ferrite with coarse carbides and pearlite. The cooling rate from this temperature is not critical but for convenience is 20°C/s. Zone B is heated to a higher temperature and in this case is above Ac3 so that it transforms entirely into austenite. This region is cooled at 80°C/s to form a wholly bainitic microstructure. The dash shape in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 2b</figref> shows the form of a blank to be cut out from the strip, which will be used to form the component. The chemistry of example material is given in Table 3 and the properties after the above processing are give in Table 4.

Slower cooling at higher temperatures increases the amount of ferrite formation for a given period compared to a cooling at a constant, faster rate. The following example uses this phenomenon and is an example of three different width zones within the strip. This example of tailor-annealed strip is optimised for an A-Pillar reinforcement component shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 3b</figref>. The dash shape shows the form of a blank to be cut out from the strip, which will be used to form the component. L denotes the length direction of the strip.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Three width zones are desired with increasing ductility requirements from A, B to C. First, the whole strip is heated by the same heating rate up to above Ac3 temperature, during a holding time long enough time to fully transform the steel strip into austenite. Zone A has the lowest ductility requirement that can be sufficiently met with a fully bainitic microstructure that forms when the steel is cooled at a rate of 40°C/second, showing a linear cooling trajectory above 200°C in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 3a</figref>. Zones B and C are both cooled at a relatively slow rate of about 5°C/s, but for different periods defined by the time when a particular temperature is reached, see the temperature-time diagram of <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 3a</figref> showing the non-linear cooling trajectories for zones B and C.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">When zone B reaches 720°C the cooling rate is increased to 40°C/s and similarly for zone C the cooling rate is increased to 40°C/s when it reaches 600°C. During the cooling at 5°C/s in zones B and C, the austenite is transforming into ferrite. When the cooling rate is increased, further transformation to ferrite is retarded and once the remaining austenite is cooled to a temperature below about 350°C it transforms in martensite. Compared to zone B, zone C is held at higher temperatures for longer times due to the extended period with the slower cooling rate. This means more ferrite forms in zone C and thus zone C has greater formability. The chemistry of example material is given in Table 5 and the properties after the above processing are give in Table 6.

Dual-phase microstructures deliver good strength-ductility, but ferrite-bainite mixtures deliver better hole-expansion than those with ferrite-martensite. The example shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 4b</figref> is a solution for a rear longitudinal component in an automotive body-in-white. L denotes the length direction of the strip.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In this example, the whole strip is heated at the same heating rate and then held at the same top temperature of 840°C/s for the same holding time of 30 seconds until it totally transforms into austenite, see <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 4a</figref>. Thereafter the whole strip is uniformly cooled at the same cooling rate of 30°C/s until about 540°C is reached. During this first cooling stage, ferrite re-grows to become the majority phase again. Upon reaching 540°C the temperature of zone A is held for 30 seconds at this temperature, while zone B is cooled further down to 400°C and then held at this temperature for about 30 seconds. After the intermediate annealing hold, the two zones are cooled to at least below 200°C with a cooling rate of at least 20°C/s.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">For the chemistry shown in Table 7, different proportions of bainite will form between the two different intermediate temperature used for zone A and B. For the higher intermediate holding temperature in zone A, the transformation kinetics of austenite to bainite are relatively slow and thus the final fraction consists mostly of ferrite and martensite with a relatively small fraction of bainite. In zone B with the lower intermediate holding temperature, the transformation kinetics of austenite to bainite are relatively fast and thus the final fraction consists mostly of ferrite and bainite with a relatively small fraction of martensite.
