However, the road transportation demands limiting the width of the sowing machine in its transportation position to a maximum of three meters.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">On the other hand, the market also demands the sowing machine to be of variable pitch, i.e. that with the same machine it can be sowed with a different distance between rows. E.g. to sow corn keeping a distance between rows of 75 cm and also beet, keeping a distance between rows of 50 cm.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">To satisfy the market needs, variable pitch sowing machines have been designed, whose frame includes a chassis that can be telescopically retracted, until a width not greater than three meters. In these kinds of machines, in transportation position, all the sowing elements are placed at the central part of the frame, and in the working position, the elements are placed along said frame, keeping a preset distance among them. Such a machine is described in document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1514465A"><text>EP 1 514 465</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The sowing machines described in the previous paragraph have the drawback that the number of rows that can be done at each pass is limited to the number of elements that can be housed on the extensible chassis in transportation position, for not exceeding three meters. Furthermore, in the specific case of beet seed, in which the number of sowing rows must be a multiple of six (because of the kind of sowing machines in the market), in the practice, the sowing is limited to passes of six rows, because the existing variable pitch frames do not permit to place twelve elements.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">To solve this problem variable pitch sowing machines have been designed, such as those disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="ES2324574"><text>ES2324574</text></patcit>, comprising an additional number of external sowing elements arranged in lateral chassis that can be vertically moved to permit the road transportation of the machine.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">At the working position, the external sowing elements are aligned with<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> respect to the sowing elements of the extensible central chassis, permitting the farmer to do twelve rows at once (per pass).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, the machines disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="ES2324574"><text>ES2324574</text></patcit> have the drawback that are not adapted to sowing any kind of seed, because the position of the external sowing elements is conditioned by the position in which are placed the lateral chassis once aligned with the extensible central chassis.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Therefore, e.g. it is impossible to use the same machine for sowing twelve corn rows, with a distance between rows of 75 cm, or for sowing twelve beet rows, with a distance between rows of 50 cm, because the distance to which the lateral chassis are placed is very different in one or the other case, and it is necessary to use lateral chassis with arms of different length to adapt the machine to both kinds of sowing.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The object of the present invention is to solve said drawbacks, developing a frame for a variable pitch sowing machine and a sowing machine including said frame, which can be transported with no problems and has the advantage that can be used for sowing at once twelve rows of very different seeds, such as e.g. corn, beet, sunflower, etc.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to this object, according to a first aspect, the present invention provides a frame for a variable pitch sowing machine comprising a first chassis provided with a first plurality of sowing elements, said first chassis including at least one portion horizontally extensible from a transportation position to a working position, said frame comprising at least a second chassis provided with a second plurality of sowing elements and vertical movement means of said sowing elements from an upper transporting position to a lower working position in which the sowing elements of said second chassis are placed aligned with respect to the sowing elements of the first chassis, characterized in that said second chassis is joined to the extensible portion of said first chassis, so that said second chassis can be horizontally moved with said extensible portion to adapt the position of its elements to the kind of sowing.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The frame of the present invention has the advantage that is adapted to any kind of sowing, because the position of the external sowing elements of the second chassis can be changed horizontally, extending more or less the extensible portion of the first chassis, which is joined to the second chassis.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Actually, in the frame of the present invention, differently from the prior art frames, the second chassis can be horizontally moved to adapt the position of the external sowing elements to the kind of sowing. This way, the same frame can be used for sowing at once up to twelve rows of any kind of seed, e.g. corn seeds, keeping a distance between rows of 75 cm, or beet seeds, keeping in this case a distance between rows of 50 cm.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Thanks to this feature, the farmer can have a sowing machine that can be transported easily, it has a high performance, and it is also very versatile, because it permits to sow any kind of seed.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Preferably, said frame comprises a support structure for said second chassis associated with said extensible portion, the vertical moving means of the sowing elements being hinged to said support structure.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">This support structure makes possible a secure anchoring of the second chassis and provides suitable pivoting points for the vertical moving means of the external sowing elements.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Also preferably, said vertical moving means of the external sowing elements of the second chassis include a hinged parallelogram mechanism comprising a first arm hinged at one end to said support structure and at the other end to a support piece of the elements, means for driving said arm, and a second arm hinged at one end to said support structure and at the other end to said same support piece of the elements, said second arm permitting to keep fixed the relative position of said support piece with respect to the sowing elements during the movement of said first arm, so that said sowing elements can be vertically moved keeping their horizontal position.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The hinged parallelogram mechanism is simple and occupies a little space, presenting in this case the added advantage that it can be designed with a reduced length of the arms, which permits a lower weight of the machine.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to a preferred embodiment, said frame includes a first central chassis provided with at least two extensible portions, and two second side chassis joined each to a extensible portion of an end of said central chassis, said central chassis including at least eight sowing elements and said side chassis at least two sowing elements each.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Advantageously, said first chassis comprises a pair of extensible portions mounted at an end of said chassis, said two portions determining a fork to which is attached the support structure of said second chassis.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Therefore, the support structure of the second chassis remains fixed in a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> securely way to the first chassis, said fork compensating the traction stresses to which the first chassis is subjected.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to the same embodiment, said frame comprises a first pair of extensible portions mounted at an end of a first central chassis to hold as a fork a support structure of a second side chassis, and a second pair of extensible portions at the other end of the first chassis to hold as a fork a support structure to the other second side chassis.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Advantageously, each of said extensible portions is a telescopic arm of said first chassis.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Preferably, said second chassis includes at least a guide on which a plurality of support structures of said sowing elements is mounted, and moving means of said support structures along said guide, said moving means including a worm associated to the guide that is provided with a plurality of dragging devices of said support structures.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">This dragging device permits to move easily the external sowing elements of said second chassis along the guide to fix the distance between them according to the sowing type, or e.g. to adapt the distance to the wheel pitch.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Advantageously, said dragging devices comprise, for each of said sowing elements, a dragging piece integrally attached to the support structure of the sowing element and mounted movable along the worm, a dragging nut of said piece that is fitted to the worm, and locking means of said dragging nut to permit the movement of said piece when the worm is driven when the nut is locked.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Also advantageously, said locking means includes a pin associated to said dragging piece to prevent the integral rotation of the nut with the worm.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Preferably, said first chassis comprises at least one guide on which a plurality of support structures of said sowing elements are mounted, and moving means of said support structures along said guide, said moving means including a plurality of attaching struts between the elements, each of said sowing elements comprising a support piece of said struts that is attached to the support structure of said element, said struts being associated at least to a extensible portion of said chassis to be driven by said same chassis.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Advantageously, the attaching struts between elements include each a female rod movable inside a male rod of an adjacent sowing element, and a stop element of the female rod associated to the male rod to extend said female rod a preset distance according to the kind of sowing.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The attaching struts between sowing elements of the first chassis permit to extend said elements a preset distance along a guide while the telescopic arms of the chassis are extended from their transportation position to their working position.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The frame of the present invention has the added advantage that it does not require additional struts that limit the aperture length of the extensible portions of the first chassis, so that the total length of the first chassis coincides with the sum of the partial lengths that establish the attaching struts between elements. This is thanks the fame/female configuration of the struts and to the fact that said struts are mounted on a support piece that is attached to the support structure of the elements. This configuration and said support piece provide the necessary resistance to the struts for supporting the pressure of the fluid-dynamic cylinder that extends the portions, so that it is not necessary to provide additional struts for the chassis to support this pressure.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">According to a preferred embodiment, said first chassis comprises for each element that is mounted on the guide, a worm that is attached to the support piece of the struts by a tightening nut, said worm being attached integrally to the support structure of the sowing element, said chassis including a rotating nut of said worm, being susceptible of moving the worm and the support structure of each element with respect to the support piece of the struts when said rotating nut drives the worm and said tightening nut is loosed.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Therefore, once the struts are extended, it is possible to move the sowing elements of the first chassis with respect to said struts to set the distance between elements.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p id="p0034" num="0034">For a better understanding of what has been described some drawings are attached in which, diagrammatically and only as a non-limitative example, a practical embodiment is shown.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In said drawings,

Said device 18 also includes a dragging nut 20 of said piece 19, which is fitted with the worm 17, and a locking pin 21 associated with said dragging piece 19 to prevent the integral rotation of the nut 20 with the worm 17, and to permit the horizontal movement of the nut 20 and the piece 19 when the worm 17 is driven by a rotation nut 22.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In the locking position of the pin 21 shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>, the dragging nut 20 cannot rotate integrally with the worm 17, so that the driving of the worm 17 horizontally moves the dragging nut 20 of the piece 19 integral with the structure 16 of the element 5 and, with it, the movement of the support structure 16 of the element 5 along the guides 15.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">As stated previously, the sowing elements 3 of the central chassis 2 are susceptible of being placed along said chassis 2 keeping a preset distance between them.

This worm 30 is susceptible of moving inside a hole provided in this piece 26 when said worm 30 is driven by a rotating nut 32 and said tightening nut 31 is loosened.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The worm 30 is integrally attached to the support structure 25 through side plates 33. Therefore, the support structure 25 of an element 3e, 3f, 3g, 3h can be moved when the worm 30 is driven by said rotation nut 32.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">This mechanism has the advantage that permits to move the sowing elements of the fixed portions of the central chassis 2 with respect to the struts 23 to set the distance between elements 3e, 3f, 3g, 3h, once these elements have been moved by the struts 23.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Even though a specific embodiment of the present invention has been described and shown, it is apparent for a person skilled in the art can introduce variants and modifications, or substitute the details for other technically equivalent ones, without departing from the scope of protection defined by the attached claims.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">E.g. even though reference is made in the present specification to a central chassis 2 provided with four telescopic arms 7 that are extended at the ends,<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> determining each two telescopic arms 7 a fork 8 to which is attached a support structure 9 of the side chassis 4, the same central chassis 2 could be constituted e.g. only by two telescopic arms 7 reinforced to attach at their ends said support structures 9 of the side chassis 4.
