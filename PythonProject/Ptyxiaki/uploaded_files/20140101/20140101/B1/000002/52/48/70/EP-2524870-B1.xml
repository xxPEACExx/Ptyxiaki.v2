The design of said rear fuselage shall therefore take into account such events and guarantee its capability for maintaining stability and proceed to a safe landing, i.e. shall be an impact resistant and damage tolerant fuselage.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the prior art, non-moving pylons attached to the rear part of the aircraft fuselage are basically made with metallic materials.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As it is well known, weight is a fundamental aspect in the aeronautic industry and therefore there is a current trends to use composite material instead metallic material even for primary structures.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The composite materials that are most used in the aeronautical industry consist of fibers or fiber bundles embedded in a matrix of thermosetting or thermoplastic resin, in the form of a preimpregnated or "prepreg" material. Its main advantages refer to:
<ul><li>Their high specific strength with respect to metallic materials.

Hereby it is achieved a multi-spar pylon which is a fail safe for those considered failure events.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In another preferred embodiment, the attachment means comprise rows of tension fittings between, respectively, the upper and lower skins of the external<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> boxes and the upper and lower skins of the central box with tension bolts crossing the fuselage skin; and rows of tension fittings between, respectively the lateral spars of the external boxes and the lateral spars of the central box with tension bolts crossing the fuselage skin.

Hereby it is achieved an efficient union between the central box and the interrupted frames that allows the full transfer of loads between them.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In another preferred embodiment, the device is a pylon located in an aircraft rear fuselage supporting an aircraft propulsion system with propeller blades, having the central box within the mid fuselage section.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Other characteristics and advantages of the present invention will be clear from the following detailed description of embodiments illustrative of its object in relation to the attached figures.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a partial perspective view of an aircraft with a propeller propulsion system attached to the rear fuselage through an upstream pylon according to the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref> is a frontal view of the aircraft shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 3, 4</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0003">5</figref> are sectional views of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref> following, respectively, planes A-A, B-B and C-C.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 6</figref> is a schematic partial perspective view of the pylon central box showing its attachment means to the frames and to the external lateral boxes.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref> is a perspective view of an internal section of the pylon central box, <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7a</figref> is enlarged view of its interface with the fuselage and <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7b</figref> is an enlarged view of one of the upper zone of said interface.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0005"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">In an aircraft 11 having a propulsion system 13 with propeller blades 15 attached to the rear fuselage 17 by means of an upstream pylon 19, the rear fuselage 17 shall be an impact resistant and damage tolerant fuselage.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The pylon 19 is a high loaded structure due to the big distance between the propulsion means 13 and the fuselage 17. Particularly, the interface between the fuselage 17 and the pylon 19 is affected by high torsional and bending moments and, in cases of crash landing and dynamic landing, to high thrust and vertical loads. On the other hand, the pylon 19 should be a structure suitable to be replaced in cases of very different events such as damages due to disc debris events, fire, fatigue failures or engine replacements.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1-2</figref>, in the pylon 19 attachment zone, the rear fuselage 17 has generally a close transversal section of a curved shape with at least a vertical symmetry plane D-D and a central longitudinal axis 29 and its structure comprises a skin 31 and frames 33 dimensioned for maintaining the aircraft stability required to proceed to an aircraft safe landing in the event of the release of a propeller blade 15 or any other of the above-mentioned failure events.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Following <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figures 2-5</figref> it can be seen that in a preferred embodiment according to the invention, the pylon 19, fully made with composite material, comprises a central box 41 inside the aircraft fuselage 17 and two external lateral boxes 51, 61 at its both sides that are attached to the aircraft fuselage 17 at medium height in a rigid manner keeping a full continuity in the fuselage skin 31. In this respect it shall be noted that in the prior art the fuselage includes openings allowing the passage of the pylon supporting the propulsion system.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The three boxes 41, 51, 61 are configured as multi-spar boxes with upper and lower skins 43, 45; 53, 55; 63, 65. Both the lateral spars 57, 59; 67, 69 and the central spars 58; 68 of said lateral boxes 51, 61 have a C-shaped configuration.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The lateral spars 47, 49 of the central box 41 have a C-shaped configuration and the central spars 48 of the central box 41 have a double T-shaped<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> configuration (a suitable configuration for providing continuity to the intermediate frames 33' interrupted by the central box 41).</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The central box 41 is joined to the external boxes 51, 61 by means of:
<ul><li>Rows of tension fittings 71 between, respectively, the upper and lower skins 53, 55; 63, 65 of the external boxes 51, 61 and the upper and lower skins 43, 45 of the central box 41 with tension bolts crossing the fuselage skin 31.

The tension and shear loads are transmitted from the tension and shear fitting 81 to the back fitting 83 by means of bolts.

In damage events, the mid spars have the role of closing the torsion boxes.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Regarding the central box 41, its lateral spars 47, 49 have the same C-shaped configuration than the lateral spars 57, 59; 67, 69 of the external boxes. Any other configuration of said lateral spars 47, 49 allowing a piano-type union such as Double T-shaped lateral spars, X-shaped lateral spars, Double Lambda-shaped lateral spars, Double Pi-shaped lateral spars, W-shaped lateral spars, Omega-shaped lateral spars, or even a corrugated spar box structure, will be acceptable.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The configuration of the central spars 48 in shape and position depends on the above-mentioned interrupted intermediate frames 33' in order to provide the above-mentioned load transfer, that is, intermediate frames 33' load continuity by means of said central spars 48.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">It is considered that this structural design of the pylon 19 reinforces the rear fuselage 17 torsional strength to deal with a failure event such an event of detachment of a propeller blade 15 from an engine 13 causing the failure of a part of any of boxes 41, 51, 61 because the multi-spar structure of said boxes allows maintaining a closed box to withstand the torsion moment produced in said event.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Secondly it is considered that this structural design of the pylon 19 provides a reinforced interface with the fuselage for maintaining the aircraft stability in any failure event.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with preferred embodiments, it is evident that modifications may be introduced within the scope thereof, not considering this as limited by these embodiments, but by the contents of the following claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977775" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Nichtbeweglicher Propellertriebwerkhalterungspylon (19), der an einem Luftfahrzeugrumpfteil (17) angebracht ist, das einen geschlossenen Querschnitt mit einer gekrümmten Form besitzt, eine Haut (31) und mehrere Spanten (33) umfassend, <b>dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass</b>:
