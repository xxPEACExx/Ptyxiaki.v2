In such a case, the slice plane to be observed by the ultrasonic probe changes. If the slice plane changes, a situation may occur in which a tissue in the specimen observed in the first frame are not observed in subsequent frames. The reason for the occurrence of such a situation can be that the tissue observed in the first frame is either very small or is distantly-positioned from the ultrasonic probe.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As described above, in the conventional ultrasonic observation apparatus, there is a problem in that the relative positional relationship with the target of observation changes with time, and therefore, it is impossible to observe a desired tissue over an extended period of time.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention has been made in view of the above and it is an object of the present invention to provide an ultrasonic observation apparatus, an operation method of the ultrasonic observation apparatus, and an operation program of the ultrasonic observation apparatus capable of observing a desired tissue over an extended period of time even if the relative positional relationship with the target of observation changes with time.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">In order to solve the abovementioned problem and achieve the object, an ultrasonic observation apparatus according to the invention transmits ultrasonic sound waves to a specimen and receives ultrasonic sound waves reflected<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> from the specimen.

An ultrasonic observation apparatus 1 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is an apparatus for observing the tissue characterization of a target specimen for observation using ultrasonic sound waves.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The ultrasonic observation apparatus 1 includes an ultrasonic probe 2 that outputs an ultrasonic pulse to the outside and receives an ultrasonic echo obtained by reflection on the outside; a transmitting-receiving unit 3 that transmits electrical signals to and receives electrical signals from the ultrasonic probe 2; a processing unit 4 that performs predetermined processing on electrical echo signals which are obtained by means of conversion of the ultrasonic echo; an image processing unit 5 that generates a variety of image data using the electrical echo signals which are obtained by means of conversion of the ultrasonic echo; an input unit 6 that is configured with an interface such as a keyboard, a mouse,<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> or a touch-sensitive panel, and that receives input of a variety of information; a display unit 7 that is configured with a liquid crystal display panel or an organic EL display panel, and that displays a variety of information including the images generated by the image processing unit 5; a memory unit 8 that is used to store a variety of information including information related to the tissue characterizations of known specimens; and a control unit 9 that controls the operations of the ultrasonic observation apparatus 1.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The ultrasonic probe 2 converts electrical pulse signals that are received from the transmitting-receiving unit 3 into ultrasonic pulse (acoustic pulse signals), and includes a signal converting unit 21 for converting the ultrasonic echo that is obtained by reflection from an outside specimen into electrical echo signals. Meanwhile, the ultrasonic probe 2 can be configured to have an ultrasonic transducer performing scanning in a mechanical manner or can be configured to have a plurality of ultrasonic transducers performing scanning in an electronic manner.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The transmitting-receiving unit 3 is electrically connected to the ultrasonic probe 2. With that, the transmitting-receiving unit 3 transmits pulse signals to the ultrasonic probe 2 and receives echo signals representing reception signals from the ultrasonic probe 2. More particularly, based on a predetermined waveform and a predetermined transmission timing, the transmitting-receiving unit 3 generates pulse signals and transmits those pulse signals to the ultrasonic probe 2.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The transmitting-receiving unit 3 is electrically connected to the ultrasonic probe 2. With that, the transmitting-receiving unit 3 transmits pulse signals to<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> the ultrasonic probe 2 and receives echo signals from the ultrasonic probe 2. More particularly, based on a predetermined waveform and a predetermined transmission timing, the transmitting-receiving unit 3 generates pulse signals and transmits those pulse signals to the ultrasonic probe 2. Moreover, the transmitting-receiving unit 3 performs operations such as amplification and filtering on received echo signals, performs A/D conversion of those echo signals to generate digital RF signals, and outputs those digital RF signals. Meanwhile, when the ultrasonic probe 2 is configured to have a plurality of ultrasonic transducers performing scanning in an electronic manner, the transmitting-receiving unit 3 is configured to include a multichannel circuit for performing beam synthesis corresponding to the ultrasonic transducers.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The processing unit 4 includes a frequency analyzing unit 41 that performs frequency analysis of echo signals by carrying out fast Fourier transformation (FFT) of the digital RF signals that are output by the transmitting-receiving unit 3; and includes a feature data extracting unit 42 that extracts feature data of the specimen by performing attenuation correction and approximation with respect to the frequency spectrum calculated by the frequency analyzing unit 41 so that there is a decrease in the contribution of attenuation, which occurs due to the reception depth and the frequency of ultrasonic sound waves being propagated.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The frequency analyzing unit 41 calculates a frequency spectrum with respect to each acoustic ray (line data) by performing fast Fourier transformation of an FFT data group having a predetermined volume of data. Depending on the tissue characterization of the specimen, the frequency spectrum demonstrates a different tendency.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> That is because of the fact that a frequency spectrum has a correlation with the size, the density, and the acoustic impedance of the specimen that serves as a scatterer which scatters the ultrasonic sound waves. Herein, for example, "tissue characterization" points to any one of a cancer, an endocrine tumor, a mucinous tumor, a normal tissue, and a vascular channel. If the specimen is pancreas, then chronic pancreatitis and autoimmune pancreatitis are also considered as tissue characterizations.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The feature data extracting unit 42 further includes an approximating unit 421, which performs approximation with respect to the frequency spectrum calculated by the frequency analyzing unit 41 and calculates pre-correction feature data that is the feature data prior to performing attenuation correction; and includes an attenuation correcting unit 422, which extracts feature data by performing attenuation correction with respect to the pre-correction feature data obtained by approximation by the approximating unit 421.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The approximating unit 421 performs linear approximation with respect to the frequency spectrum by means of regression analysis so as to extract feature data that characterizes the approximated linear expression. More particularly, by means of regression analysis, the approximating unit 421 calculates a gradient a<sub>0</sub> and an intercept b<sub>0</sub> of the linear expression, as well as calculates the intensity at a specific frequency within the frequency band of the frequency spectrum as the pre-correction feature data. In the first embodiment, it is assumed that, at the central frequency f<sub>MID</sub>=(f<sub>LOW</sub>+f<sub>HIGH</sub>)/2, the approximating unit 421 calculates c<sub>0</sub>=a<sub>0</sub>f<sub>MID</sub>+b<sub>0</sub> as the intensity (Mid-band fit). However, that is only one example. Herein, the intensity points to any one parameter<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> of parameters such as voltage, power, acoustic pressure, and acoustic energy.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Of the three components of feature data, the gradient a<sub>0</sub> has a correlation with the size of the scatterer that scatters the ultrasonic sound waves. Generally, it is thought that larger the scatterer, smaller is the value of the gradient. The intercept b<sub>0</sub> has a correlation with the size of the scatterer, the difference in acoustic impedances, and the density (consistency) of the scatterer. More particularly, it is thought that larger the scatterer, greater is the value of the intercept b<sub>0</sub>; greater the acoustic impedance, greater is the value of the intercept b<sub>0</sub>; and greater the density (concentration) of the scatterer, greater is the value of the intercept b<sub>0</sub>. The intensity c<sub>0</sub> at the central frequency f<sub>MID</sub> (hereinafter, simply referred to as "intensity c<sub>0</sub>") is an indirect parameter derived from the gradient a<sub>0</sub> and the intercept b<sub>0</sub>, and represents the spectrum intensity at the center of the valid frequency band. Thus, it is thought that the intensity c<sub>0</sub> has a correlation not only with the size of the scatterer, the difference in acoustic impedances, and the density of the scatterer, but also with the luminosity values of B-mode images to a certain extent. Meanwhile, the approximation polynomial calculated by the feature data extracting unit 42 is not limited to a linear expression. Alternatively, it is also possible to use an approximation polynomial of second-order or more.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The following explanation is given for the correction performed by the attenuation correcting unit 422. An attenuation amount A of ultrasonic sound waves can be expressed as: <maths id="math0001" num="(1)"><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">A</mi><mo>=</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">αzf</mi></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="143" he="10" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
where, α represents the attenuation rate, z represents the<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> reception depth of ultrasonic sound waves, and f represents the frequency. As is clear from Equation (1), the attenuation amount A is proportional to the frequency f. Regarding a living body, the specific value of the attenuation rate α is in the range of 0 to 1.0 (dB/cm/MHz) and desirably is in the range of 0.3 to 0.7 (dB/cm/MHz), and is determined according to the organ to be observed. For example, if the organ to be observed is pancreas, then the attenuation rate α is set to 0.6 (dB/cm/MHz). Meanwhile, in the first embodiment, the configuration can also be such that the value of the attenuation rate α can be modified by an input from the input unit 6.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The attenuation correcting unit 422 corrects the pre-correction feature data (the gradient a<sub>0</sub>, the intercept b<sub>0</sub>, and the intensity c<sub>0</sub>), which has been calculated by the approximating unit 421, in the following manner: <maths id="math0002" num="(2)"><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">0</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">αz</mi></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="141" he="7" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> <maths id="math0003" num="(3)"><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">b</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">b</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">0</mn></msub></math><img id="ib0003" file="imgb0003.tif" wi="141" he="8" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> <maths id="math0004" num="(4)"><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">0</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">αz</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">f</mi><mi>MID</mi></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mfenced separators=""><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">f</mi><mi>MID</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">b</mi></mfenced></math><img id="ib0004" file="imgb0004.tif" wi="141" he="7" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
As is clear from Equations (2) and (4) too, greater the reception depth of ultrasonic sound waves, greater is the amount of correction during the correction performed by the attenuation correcting unit 422. Meanwhile, with reference to Equation (3), the correction related to the intercept points to identical transformation. That is because of the fact that the intercept is a frequency component corresponding to the frequency 0 (Hz) and does not get attenuated.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The image processing unit 5 includes a B-mode image data generating unit 51 that generates B-mode image data from echo signals; and includes a feature-data image data generating unit 52 that generates feature-data image<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> data containing information related to feature data.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The B-mode image data generating unit 51 generates B-mode image data by performing signal processing on digital signals using a known technology such as bandpass filtering, logarithmic conversion, gain processing, or contrast processing, and by performing data thinning according to the data step width that is decided in accordance to the display range of images in the display unit 7.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The feature-data image data generating unit 52 generates, in a temporally continuous manner, feature-data image data by referring to the B-mode image data generated by the B-mode image data generating unit 51 and by referring to the feature data extracted by the feature data extracting unit 42. More particularly, in a feature data space in which it is possible to set a coordinate system having at least some of the feature data extracted by the feature data extracting unit 42 as coordinate components, when a feature point of a frequency spectrum at a particular data position moves with the passage of time from a predetermined first type area closer to a second type area having low priority for image display than the first type area; the feature-data image data generating unit 52 sets a virtual feature point at a position that is far off from the second type area as compared to the position of the latest feature point and that is within or around the first type area, and assigns visual information corresponding to the virtual feature point to the same data position mentioned above so as to generate in a continuous manner the feature-data image data that contains information related to feature data. Herein, it is desirable that the first type area is set as an area corresponding to a tissue characterization of high<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> importance such as cancer that should get detected during the observation.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In the first embodiment, with respect to the first type area, a virtual feature point is set as described above for the purpose of displaying a residual image. However, with respect to the second type area, no virtual feature point is set even in the case when a feature point of a frequency spectrum at a particular data position moves away from the second type area with the passage of time. In other words, the feature-data image data generating unit 52 performs residual image processing only with respect to the feature points present in the first type area in the feature data space.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The memory unit 8 includes a known-specimen information storing unit 81 that is used to store known specimen information including the feature data of known specimens; includes a window function storing unit 82 that is used to store a window function used during frequency analysis performed by the frequency analyzing unit 41; includes a correction information storing unit 83 that is used to store correction information which is referred to by the attenuation correcting unit 422 while performing attenuation correction; a feature-data-space information storing unit 84 that is used to store information related to feature data space which is set on the basis of the feature data of known specimens stored in the known-specimen information storing unit 81; and a feature data information storing unit 85 that is used to store information related to the feature data that is calculated as coordinate values of points in the feature data space which is stored in the feature-data-space information storing unit 84.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The known-specimen information storing unit 81 is<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> used to store the feature data of frequency spectrums extracted for known specimens and the tissue characterizations of those known specimens in a corresponding manner. Herein, it is assumed that the feature data of a known specimen is extracted by performing an identical operation to that explained in the first embodiment. However, the feature data extracting operation for a known specimen need not be performed in the ultrasonic observation apparatus 1. Meanwhile, with respect to feature data of the frequency spectrum related to a known specimen, the known-specimen information storing unit 81 is also used to store the average and the standard deviation calculated for each group, which is classified on the basis of the information including the tissue characterization of that known specimen, along with all feature data of that known specimen. In the first embodiment, the average and the standard deviation of feature data of a frequency spectrum of ultrasonic reception signals reflect the changes at a cellular level such as enlargement or anomaly of the nucleus in the specimen or reflect the tissue-level changes such as fibrotic growth in the interstitium or substitution of parenchymal tissues with fibers.

Moreover, areas G<sub>µ</sub> and G<sub>v</sub> represent groups in which a known specimen stored in the known-specimen information storing unit 81 has tissue characterization of µ and v, respectively. A point µ<sub>0</sub> in the area G<sub>µ</sub> is a representative point of the feature points that serve as elements of the area G<sub>µ</sub> and a point v<sub>0</sub> in the area G<sub>v</sub> is a representative point of the feature points that serve as elements of the area G<sub>ν</sub>.

Such<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> feature points include the feature points extracted by the feature data extracting unit 42 as well as include residual image feature points that are virtual feature points determined according to the positions of feature points. Moreover, the feature data information storing unit 85 also stores, in a predetermined memory area thereof, a residual image area flag that takes different values depending on whether or not a feature point used at the time of calculating a pixel value is present in the residual image area. For example, when either a feature point present in the residual image area or a residual image feature point is used in calculating a pixel value, the feature data information storing unit 85 stores "1" as the value of the residual image area flag. On the other hand, when either a feature point present outside the residual image area or a residual image feature point is used in calculating a pixel value, the feature data information storing unit 85 stores "0" as the value of the residual image area flag.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Meanwhile, in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, an h-axis (reference axis) is also illustrated that passes through the representative points µ<sub>0</sub> and ν<sub>0</sub> and that has the direction µ<sub>0</sub>→ν<sub>0</sub> as the positive direction. When the feature-data image data generating unit 52 determines a pixel value of a pixel in a frame, the h-axis is used in determining whether to use the latest feature point or to use the pixel value of a residual image feature point that is already stored.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In the case illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, in the feature data space, the two groups G<sub>µ</sub> and G<sub>ν</sub> are present in mutually exclusive areas.

Therefore, as compared to the case of not performing attenuation correction, each group in the feature data space can be obtained in a more distinctly separated state.

In the following explanation, i (=1, 2, ...) serves as the variable for identifying the frames.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, firstly, the ultrasonic observation apparatus 1 sets the variable i for identifying the frames to "1" (Step S1). Then, the ultrasonic observation apparatus 1 makes a measurement of a new specimen using the ultrasonic probe 2 (Step S2).</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Subsequently, the B-mode image data generating unit 51 generates B-mode image data using echo signals for B-mode images output by the transmitting-receiving unit 3 (Step S3).</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Subsequently, the control unit 9 performs control so that the display unit 7 displays a B-mode image corresponding to the B-mode image data generated by the B-mode image data generating unit 51 (Step S4). <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a B-mode image displayed<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> by the display unit 7.

Herein, the operation performed by the frequency analyzing unit 41 at Step S5 is explained in detail with reference to a flowchart illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>. Firstly, the frequency analyzing unit 41 sets an acoustic ray number L of the acoustic ray to be initially analyzed to an initial value L<sub>0</sub> (Step S21). The initial value L<sub>0</sub> can be assigned, for example, to the acoustic ray received at the start by the transmitting-receiving unit 3 or to the acoustic ray corresponding to the boundary position on any one of the left and right sides of the area of concern set via the input unit 6.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Then, the frequency analyzing unit 41 calculates the frequency spectrum of all data positions set on a single acoustic ray. Regarding that, firstly, the frequency analyzing unit 41 sets an initial value Z<sub>0</sub> of a data position Z (equivalent to reception depth) that is representative of a sequence of data groups (FFT data groups) obtained for the purpose of FFT (Step S22). <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram that schematically illustrates data arrangement of a single acoustic ray. In an acoustic ray LD illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, a white rectangle or a black rectangle represents a single set of data. The acoustic ray LD is discretized by time intervals corresponding to the sampling frequency (such as 50 MHz) used during A/D conversion performed by the transmitting-receiving unit 3. In <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, it is illustrated that the first set of data on<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> the acoustic ray LD is set as the initial value Z<sub>0</sub> of the data position Z. Meanwhile, <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is only an example, and the position of the initial value Z<sub>0</sub> can be set in an arbitrary manner. For example, the data position Z corresponding to the position at the top edge of the area of concern can be set as the initial value Z<sub>0</sub>.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Then, the frequency analyzing unit 41 obtains the FFT data group at the data position Z (Step S23) and implements the window function, which is stored in the window function storing unit 82, to the FFT data group that has been obtained (Step S24). By implementing the window function to the FFT data group, it becomes possible to avoid discontinuity at the boundary in the FFT data group. As a result, artifacts can be prevented from occurring.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Subsequently, the frequency analyzing unit 41 determines whether or not the FFT data group at the data position Z is a normal data group (Step S25). Herein, it is necessary that the number of sets of data in an FFT data group is in power-of-two. In the following explanation, it is assumed that the number of sets of data in the FFT data group is 2<sup>n</sup> (where n is a positive integer). When an FFT data group is normal, it means that the data position Z is the 2<sup>n-1</sup>-th position from the front of the FFT data group. In other words, when an FFT data group is normal, it means that there are 2<sup>n-1</sup>-1 (=N) number of sets of data prior to the data position Z, and there are 2<sup>n-1</sup> (=M) number of sets of data subsequent to the data position Z. In the example illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, FFT data groups F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, and F<sub>K-1</sub> are normal data groups; while FFT data groups F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>K</sub> are abnormal data groups.

To the FFT data group that is determined to be not normal at Step S25, the window function is implemented prior to the addition of zero data. Hence, even if zero data is inserted, discontinuity in data does not occur. Once the operation at Step S26 is completed, the system control proceeds to Step S27.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">At Step S27, the frequency analyzing unit 41 - performs FFT using the FFT data groups and obtains the frequency spectrum (Step S27). <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8</figref> are diagrams illustrating examples of the frequency spectrum calculated by the frequency analyzing unit 41. In <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8</figref>, the horizontal axis f represents the frequency and the vertical axis I represents the intensity. In frequency spectrum curves C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8</figref>, respectively; a lower limit frequency f<sub>LOW</sub> and a high limit frequency f<sub>HIGH</sub> of the frequency spectrum are parameters determined on the basis of the frequency band of the ultrasonic probe 2 and the frequency band of the pulse signals transmitted by the transmitting-receiving unit 3. For example, f<sub>LOW</sub> is equal to 3 MHz and f<sub>HiGH</sub> is equal to 10 MHz. Meanwhile, regarding a straight line L<sub>1</sub> illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> and a straight line L<sub>2</sub> illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8</figref>, the explanation is given later while explaining the feature data extracting operation. In the first embodiment, curve lines and straight lines are formed of sets of discreet points. The same is the case in other embodiments<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> described later.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Subsequently, the frequency analyzing unit 41 adds a predetermined data step width D to the data position Z, and calculates the data position Z at the FFT data group to be analyzed next (Step S28). Herein, it is desirable that the data step width D is matched with the data step width used at the time when the B-mode image data generating unit 51 generates B-mode image data. However, when the object is to reduce the amount of operations in the frequency analyzing unit 41, it is also possible to set the data step width D to a larger value than the data step width used by the B-mode image data generating unit 51. In <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, it is illustrated that D=15.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Subsequently, the frequency analyzing unit 41 determines whether or not the data position Z is greater than a final data position Z<sub>max</sub> (Step S29). Herein, the final data position Z<sub>max</sub> can be set to the data length of the acoustic ray LD or to the data position corresponding to the lower edge of the area of concern. If the determination result indicates that the data position Z is greater than the final data position Z<sub>max</sub> (Yes at Step S29), then the frequency analyzing unit 41 increments the acoustic ray number L by 1 (Step S30). On the other hand, if the determination result indicates that the data position Z is equal to or smaller than the final data position Z<sub>max</sub> (No at Step S29), then the system control returns to Step S23. In this way, with respect to a single acoustic ray LD, the frequency analyzing unit 41 performs FFT for [{(Z<sub>max</sub>-Z<sub>0</sub>)/D}+1] (=K) number of FFT data groups.

For example, the final acoustic ray number L<sub>max</sub> can be assigned to the final acoustic ray received by the transmitting-receiving unit 3 or to the acoustic ray corresponding to the boundary position on any one of the left and right sides of the area of concern. In the following explanation, the total number of times for which the frequency analyzing unit 41 performs FFT with respect to all acoustic rays is (L<sub>max</sub>-L<sub>0</sub>+1)×K and is referred to as "P".</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Subsequent to the frequency analyzing operation performed at Step S5 as described above, the approximating unit 421 performs, as an approximation operation, regression analysis of the P number of frequency spectrums calculated by the frequency analyzing unit 41 and extracts the pre-correction feature data (Step S6).

The straight line L<sub>1</sub> illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> and the straight line L<sub>2</sub> illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8</figref> are regression lines obtained by performing regression analysis of the frequency spectrum curve C<sub>1</sub> and the frequency spectrum curve C<sub>2</sub>, respectively, at Step S6.<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --></p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Then, the attenuation correcting unit 422 performs attenuation correction of the pre-correction feature data extracted by the approximating unit 421 (Step S7). For example, when the data sampling frequency is 50 MHz, the time interval for data sampling is 20 (nsec). If the velocity of sound is assumed to be 1530 (m/sec), then the spacing among data sampling is equal to 1530 (m/sex)x20 (nsec)=0.0153 (mm). If "k" is assumed to be the number of data steps from the first set of data of the acoustic ray LD up to the data position of the FFT data group to be processed, then the data position Z thereof is equal to 0.0153k (mm). The attenuation correcting unit 422 substitutes the value of the data position Z, which is obtained in the manner described above, in the reception depth z specified in Equations (2) to (4) mentioned above, and calculates the gradient a, the intercept b, and the intensity c. <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 9</figref> is a diagram illustrating a straight line that is determined from the feature data obtained upon performing attenuation correction of the feature data related to the straight line L<sub>1</sub> illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref>.

In contrast, regarding a feature data image 800 for which attenuation correction is performed using the same B-mode image, it can be seen that the image has got a uniform brightness throughout the screen.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">According to the first embodiment of the present invention described above, in a feature data space, when a feature point of a frequency spectrum at a predetermined data position is present within a predetermined first type area in the i-th frame (where i is a positive integer) and moves closer to a second type area, which has a lower priority for image display than the first type area, in the subsequent (i+1)-th frame; feature-data image data that contains information related to feature data is generated by setting a virtual feature point at a position that is<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> far off from the second type area as compared to the position of the latest feature point and that is within or around the first type area, and by replacing visual information corresponding to the latest feature point in the (i+1)-th frame of the predetermined data position with visual information corresponding to the virtual feature point. Then, images corresponding to the feature-data image data that has been generated are displayed in a sequential manner. With that, it becomes possible to display, for as long periods of time as possible, the images having pixel values corresponding to the feature points close to the area of high priority for image display Therefore, even if the relative position relationship with the target of observation changes with time, the desired tissues can be observed over an extended period of time.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">Moreover, according to the first embodiment, the feature data is extracted by performing attenuation correction with respect to pre-correction feature data of a frequency spectrum that has been obtained by analyzing the frequencies of received ultrasonic sound waves. That extracted feature data is used along with feature data of frequency spectrums that is extracted on the basis of ultrasonic sound waves reflected from a plurality of known specimens. Hence, without having to make use of the strain amount or the degree of elasticity of the body tissues, it becomes possible to make clear distinction between different tissues. As a result, tissue characterizations can be distinguished with accuracy and the measurement result can be enhanced in terms of reliability.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">Moreover, according to the first embodiment, even at the time of obtaining the feature data of known specimens, attenuation correction is performed with respect to pre-correction feature data of frequency spectrums<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --> obtained by means of frequency analysis, and the feature data obtained by performing such attenuation correction is used as the index to classify and determine tissue characterizations. Hence, it becomes possible to make distinction between mutually different tissue characterizations. Particularly, in the first embodiment, the feature data extracted by performing attenuation correction is used. Therefore, as compared to the case of using feature data that is extracted without performing attenuation correction, the area of each group in the feature data space can be obtained in a more distinctly separated state.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">During ultrasonic elastography, the pressure applied by pressing does not easily reach the inferior regions of vascular channels such as blood vessels or lymph vessels. For that reason, if a tumor is formed in the vicinity of a vascular channel, the boundary of the tumor remains ambiguous and it is difficult to identify the invasion of the tumor into the vascular channel. Hence, there are times when the specimen cannot be observed with accuracy. Moreover, during ultrasonic elastography, the amount of pressure or the pressing speed that gets applied while pressing the body part to be examined can easily differ from person to person who is conducting the examination. That leads to a low degree of reliability in the observation result. In that regard, according to the first embodiment, as described above, since a specimen is observed with a high degree of accuracy, it is possible to achieve enhancement in terms of reliability. As a result, it becomes possible to provide a technology that is suitable in resolving the issues specific to ultrasonic elastography.</p><heading id="h0012">(Second embodiment)</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --><p id="p0097" num="0097">In a second embodiment of the present invention, the feature-data image data generating operation performed by a feature-data image data generating unit is different than the first embodiment.
