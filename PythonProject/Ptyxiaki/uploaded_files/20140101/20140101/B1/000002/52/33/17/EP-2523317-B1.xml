At the same time it consists of an induced circuit formed by a coil placed within a hollow cylindrical shell, made of ferromagnetic material, which is generally called the stator, which lies on grooves exposed for this effect, while the aforementioned inductor circuit is formed by a coaxial cylindrical blade with the stator to which a continuous current is supplied to generate the inductor field commonly called excitation.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Following the aforementioned basic explanation of what an electrical energy generator is, upon rotating the blade using an external mechanical force, a variation of the flow is achieved, passing the energy generated from the excitation of each semi-cycle of the induced frequency, in such a way that the external mechanical energy applied to the axle is directly proportional to the opposite of the excitation's magnetic field and to that generated by the intensity that circulates through the induced coil, with the objective of rotating the blade and in this way generating the work frequency of the generator.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the construction of the current generators, the shell is formed by magnetic locks placed flat one on top of the other, making the slopes that have to form the grooves coincide for the placement of the induced coil. The blade locks are also flat and placed on top of each other, being affected by a central hole placed to introduce the axle of the generator.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">This construction is also used in the engines, so that current generators can work as engines.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">For this reason, the external mechanical energy applied to the generator's axle is directly proportional to the electrical energy generated, while in the engines, the mechanical force of the axle is directly proportional to the electrical energy supplied.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Among the most important Patent documents in relation to the concrete state of the art of the request, one can cite the <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO03073590A"><text>WO03/073590</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO9213383A"><text>WO92/13383</text></patcit> Patents, which present the problem that each circuit has an excitation coil and an induced coil, which means that the generator has to include many excitation coils.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Document <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="DE19908557"><text>DE 199 08 557</text></patcit> discloses an electrical generator having several radial magnetic circuits, each of them with a lower magnetic radius and an upper magnetic radius.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Particularly in the <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO03073590A"><text>WO 03/073590</text></patcit> Patent it has been checked that in each magnetic circuit only a quarter of the amperes/turn of the inductor coil pass to the induced coil, which is why if it has 100 amperes/turn in the excitation of the inductor coil, in the induced one it only induces 25 amperes/turn, although the advantage that this generator has in the aforementioned Patent is that if the blade rotates at 3,000 rpm, the circulation of the magnetic flow opens and closes in each circuit 36,000 times per minute, which generates a large electromotor force.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As a result, what we have is that the induced electromotor force is directly proportional to the variation of the magnetic flow, in such a way that a part of the amperes/turn of the excitation coil pass to the induced coil generating a magnetic flow that supposes the flow that it generates, according to the Lenz Law, which is why the best generator is that which makes the variations of the magnetic flow quickest and where also the inductor and induced magnetic fields offer the best force possible in terms of the rotations of the axle.</p><heading id="h0003">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The electrical energy multigenerator which is advocated, based on that described in this Invention Patent <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO03073590A"><text>WO 03/073590</text></patcit>, or that which is the same in the Faraday induction<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> principle and through the variation of the reluctance, will only work as a generator and not as an engine, with the external energy no longer being applied to the axle directly proportional to the generated electrical energy.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Taking into account that if in a thermal power plant the turbine of the generator group is uncoupled and if the pony motor is coupled to take the generator to nominal revolution, upon coupling it to the network it can generate reactive energy. Since, in the multigenerator of this invention what is established is that the pony motor acts as the turbine and this is enough due to the little opposition of the magnetic fields that the rotors generate, for the generation of electrical energy.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As a result of this, through the multigenerator of the invention, the steam turbine or the turbines of the dams can be removed, being able to install in the consumption places and with the high and mid voltage transport lines not being necessary.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">On the other hand, the multigenerator is considered to create clean electrical energy, where necessary, without contamination, being able to be applied to all means of transport, industry, homes, etc, solving in this way an environmental and energy problem.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">More precisely, the electrical energy multigenerator of the invention is of the type of which has radial magnetic circuits, each one of which is formed by two columns joined by a lower magnetic radius and by a upper magnetic radius, each one being the radius' provided by a rotor to open/close and change the circulation of the magnetic flow, while the external column is provided with an induced coil and the central column, common to all the multigenerator radius' is provided with an excitation coil, fed by a continuous current, in such a way that in determined cases this central column may be made of a permanent magnet that causes the excitation.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The rotational movement of the rotors is done by means of a mechanical coupling to a main motorized wheel, and an external mechanical force is applied to its axle, generated by a motor, to vary the circulation of the magnetic flow, which is generated by the electromotor force in the induced coils.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Starting from these characteristics, the multigenerator of this invention is characterized because the column of the central nucleus is common to all the radial magnetic circuits of<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the multigenerator, and this is provided with a central excitation coil that is fed by a continuous current, which creates the magnetic flow to induce, alternatively, an electromotor force in all the induced coils of the external columns corresponding to the radial magnetic circuits that they form. The induced electromotor force will be directly proportional to the revolutions of the rotors.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Another characteristic that the invention's multigenerator has is that the central column with is excitation coil may be substituted by a column with a permanent magnet, where the regulation of the power will be made by the variation of the revolutions in the motorized wheel. This application is interesting for small means of transportation.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">It is also a new characteristic in the invention's electrical energy multigenerator the fact that is has a rotor on each radial magnetic circuit, all of these with the objective of opening, closing and varying the circulation of the magnetic flow, and in the case that the energy of the central excitation coil passes to all the external radial coils it generates, alternatively, an electromotor force in the induced coils.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In terms of the magnetic locks that the invention's multigenerator's rotor form, these are flat and are placed end to end. In the central part, the axle of the rotor is placed parallel to them, with 90° inclination from these, continuing to place the magnetic locks on top of each other, until reaching the form of the rotational group. These magnetic locks will be separated by an insulating varnish, incorporating diamagnetic materials in the construction of the rotor, to guarantee a permanent determined sense of rotation for this.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The essence of the rotor is that its construction shape sets that the circulation of the magnetic flow varies from a quicker way, having less opposition to the sense of the rotations and that the inductor and induced magnetic flows of the rotor help the sense of rotation, needing very little external mechanical force applied to the axle of the group to pass excitation energy to the induced circuit coils.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Another new characteristic of the invention is the fact that the inductor coil and the induced coils are fixed on the corresponding columns.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">On the other hand, it has been foreseen that the multigenerator's rotors are mechanically synchronized on the central axle, as this only serves to vary the circulation of the magnetic flow of the radial magnetic circuits, without the incorporation of any coil whatsoever.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Finally, it is worth saying that the power of the invention's electrical energy multigenerator can vary in terms of its use, varying the power in the excitation coil when it needs to always have the same electromotor force, likewise varying the revolutions of the rotors, or both at the same time for some applications in certain forms of transportation.</p><heading id="h0004">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0026" num="0026">To complement the description being made and with the purpose of aiding better comprehension of the characteristics of the invention, a figure accompanies this description as a non-limiting, illustrative drawing which represents the following:
