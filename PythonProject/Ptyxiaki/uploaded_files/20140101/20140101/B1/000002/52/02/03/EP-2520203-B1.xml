load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an apparatus for preparing a beverage starting from a powder material contained in a sealed cartridge.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">More specifically, the present invention relates to an apparatus for preparing by infusion a coffee beverage starting from a coffee powder dose contained in a sealed cartridge, defined by a cup body closed at an end portion thereof by a bottom wall and, at the other end portion thereof by a sealing wall rigidly connected with an annular flange outside of the cup body.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It should be pointed out that the present apparatus is suitable to be used for percolating any beverages prepared supplying pressurized hot water through a powder material contained in any desired types of sealed cartridges.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the coffee machine field is already known to use a coffee preparing machine including a pressurized hot water delivery element and a cup facing the delivery element and designed for housing therein a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> sealed rigid cartridge or capsule containing a single dose of powder coffee.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Several espresso coffee machines comprising a water tank, a water delivery pump and a boiler, a hot water supplying or feeding assembly and filter supporting means for housing a single-dose capsule or cartridge are already known.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The above mentioned espresso coffee machines require a cartridge or capsule loading and locating system for properly arranging the coffee capsule or cartridge in the filter holder.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Another problem to be solved is that of ejecting a used cartridge or capsule.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The machines in which the above operations are performed manually are dangerous and difficult to be operated by a user.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In fact, a manual arranging of the coffee capsule or cartridge in the infusion place represents a serious danger for the user fingers.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">With respect to the withdrawing or ejecting of the used capsule, a further drawback should be pointed out.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In fact, if a user desires to prepare a coffee cup immediately after having prepared another coffee<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> cup, he/she must wait some minutes to allow the coffee load to be properly cooled and handled, or it must be used dedicated tools, such as grippers, which renders this operation a very complex one.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In other coffee machines the used coffee cartridge ejection, and, if desired, a loading of a new capsule, are performed in an automatic manner, thereby the user must simply arrange a coffee cartridge at a machine cartridge inlet and operate said machine either by a motor driven means or by manually controlled implements.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2008096385A"><text>WO 2008/096385</text></patcit> discloses substantially the preamble of Claim 1.</p><heading

the apparatus according to the present invention, which has been generally indicated by the reference number 1, has been designed for<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> preparing a beverage starting from a powder material contained in a sealed cartridge or capsule 2, of a type conventionally used in espresso coffee preparing machines.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">More specifically, the sealed cartridge 2 comprises a cup body made of a thermoplastic material and having a side wall 3, of a frustum of cone configuration, including a bottom wall 4 and a sealing wall 5, usually constituted by a metal or metalized film material.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The apparatus 1 shown in the figures extends along a middle horizontal axis, and comprises a framework consisting of two half-shells 7 and 8, which enclose therebetween a hot pressurized water delivery assembly 6, being fed or supplied from a water boiler, not shown in the figures, designed for receiving pressurized water from a pump withdrawing water from a water tank.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The delivery assembly 6 comprises a shower element or assembly, adapted to receive pressurized hot water from said water boiler.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The shower element is arranged in a movable position coaxial with the middle axis of the apparatus and being movable between a withdrawn rest position and<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> a projecting percolating position.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The delivery assembly 6 comprises a perforating device, including a plurality of perforating needles 11, which are rigid with the front wall and arranged about a central hole, to project from the front wall toward the shower element, being aligned with the holes of the shower element.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The length of the needles 11 and thickness of the shower element front wall are so designed that, with the shower element being arranged at its projecting position, said needles 11 will be arranged inside the respective holes, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As the shower element or assembly is brought to its withdrawn position, said needles 11 will partially project from the wall toward the sealing walls 5 of the cartridge in a percolating position thereof.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The apparatus 1 according to the invention further comprises, in addition to the delivery assembly 4, a percolating assembly 9 facing the delivery assembly 6 and comprising, in turn, a percolating cup 10.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Said percolating cup is adapted to house therein, at least partially, a cartridge 2 and comprises a discharging or outlet duct formed in the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> body of the percolating assembly 9.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The percolating assembly 9 is movable along the middle or central axis of the apparatus framework, between at least two operating positions: a loading position thereat the percolating cup 10 is spaced at a distance from the delivery assembly 6 and a delivery position, thereat the percolating cup 10 closes the cartridge 2 between itself and the delivery assembly.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Said percolating cup 10 comprises an inner bush 12 which is axially movable under a biasing or urging spring 13, thereby holding the cartridge 2 in a cartridge position partially projecting from the percolating cup, with said percolating cup not abutting on the delivery assembly 6.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Said percolating cup 10 comprises moreover a further perforating device, including a plurality of perforating needles 14, which are adapted to perforate, in operation, the bottom wall 4 of the cartridge 2, outward deformed by the delivered pressurized hot water entering the cartridge, thereby the percolated coffee will exit the cartridge 2 and arrive, through a plurality of throughgoing holes formed in said needles 14, at a discharging duct of said percolating cup 10.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The horizontal movement of the percolating<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> assembly 9 is driven by a linear actuator consisting of a leverage manually operated through an outer handle 15, which latter is pivoted to the apparatus framework and comprises an arm 16 in turn pivoted to a lever 17 having its other end portion pivoted to a crank pin 18 of a crank 19.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The crank pin 18 is pivoted to a head portion of a connecting rod 20, the foot portion of which is associated with the percolating assembly 9 thereby driving the latter.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In the handle opened or raised condition, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>, the percolating assembly 9 is arranged at a loading position, thereat the percolating cup 10 is located at a distance from the delivery assembly 6.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In the closed, or lowered, handle condition, on the other hand, the percolating assembly 9 is arranged at a delivery position, thereat the percolating cup 10 closes the cartridge 2 between said percolating cup 10 and delivery assembly, as schematically shown in <figref idrefs="f0016">Figure 21</figref>.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">According to the present invention, the apparatus further comprises a cartridge loading and unloading device, consisting of a pair of jaws 21 and<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> 22 adapted to grip and restrain a cartridge 2 at an infusion position during the infusion operation, and to discharge or eject said cartridge, at the end of the infusion operation, to provide a free space to receive a new cartridge therein.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Said jaws are symmetrical with respect to one other and each jaw comprises a top end portion 23, pivoted to the apparatus framework, and e free end portion 24.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Each jaw is pivoted about a longitudinal axis, parallel to the longitudinal middle or central axis of the apparatus.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The inner part of the free end portion 24 is so contoured as to abut against the conical sidewall 3 of the cartridge 2.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Said jaws 21 and 22 define, by swinging about their pivot axis, the above mentioned jaw open position and jaw closed position.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In the jaw closed position, said jaws will restrain a cartridge 2 therebetween, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Figures 13</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0011">15</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0012">17</figref>, whereas in their open position, said jaws will be spread apart so as to allow the cartridge 2 to downward fall.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The movement of the jaws between the two above<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> mentioned closed and open positions is controlled by telescopic cam elements 25, engaging in engagement slots 26 formed on each said jaw 21 and 22.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Each said cam element 25 consists of a main cam element 27, including a tapering tip 28, and a telescopic cam element 29 sliding in the main element 27.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Said telescopic element 29 comprises a telescopic element tooth 30 facing outward and including a front tip portion.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Thus, the tooth 30 allows the telescopic element 29 to facilitate the telescopic cam in entering the slot 26, during the feeding step, while slowing down the exiting movement of said cam during its return operating step.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In fact, during the closing movement of the percolating assembly 9, that is as the percolating assembly is driven from its loading position, thereat the percolating cup 10 is arranged at a distance from the delivery assembly 6, to the delivery position, thereat the percolating cup 10 closes the cartridge 2 between itself and the delivery assembly, said telescopic cams 25, being rigid with said percolating assembly 9, will enter the slots 26 thereby spreading<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> apart the jaws 21 and 22 to bring them to their loading position.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048"><figref idrefs="f0013">Figures 18</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0016">21</figref> schematically show the above driving movement.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">As said percolating assembly performs its return movement, the telescopic cams 25 disengage from the sots 26 to cause the jaws 21, 22 to return to their cartridge locking closed position.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In this return movement, the telescopic elements are held for a distance by the teeth 30 engaging or latching on the jaws surfaces about the slots 26 thereby said jaws will be spread apart to allow the percolating assembly 9 to fully return to its starting loading position.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">As shown, each said jaws 21 and 22 comprises moreover a restraining resilient element comprising, in this embodiment, a restraining spring 31 formed as a single body with the respective jaw, on the inner side of the latter.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The two springs 31 restrain the cartridge 2 at an insertion position, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Figure 12</figref>, thereby a small pressure will resiliently deform said springs thereby causing the cartridge 2 to fall to a gripping position, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Figure 13</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0053" num="0053"><figref idrefs="f0008">Figures 8, 9</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0011">14 and 15</figref> show a modified embodiment of said springs.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In this modified embodiment, the jaws, herein indicated by the reference numbers 121 and 122, are identical to the thereinabove disclosed jaws 21 and 22, with the exception that the springs 131 are separated from the jaw body.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The operation of the jaws 121 and 122 is identical to that of the jaws 21 and 22 and, even in this case, the springs 131 operate as a temporary restraining element for temporarily restraining the cartridge before pushing the latter to its gripping position.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056"><figref idrefs="f0009">Figures 10, 11</figref>, <figref

id="p0057" num="0057">In this embodiment, the cartridge 2 is caused to fall between the gripping jaws at a gripping position thereof, the jaws being not restrained as in the preceding embodiments.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">In operating the apparatus according to the present invention, the operating cycle is started, with the handle 15 at an open position thereof, as shown in<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>, by inserting a cartridge 2 between the jaws 21 and 22 in their closed position.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">This condition is schematically shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Figures 13</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0011">15</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0012">17</figref> and corresponds to the percolating assembly 9 loading position, thereat the percolating cup 10 is spaced at a distance from the delivery assembly 6.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Thus, by operating the handle 15, the percolating assembly 9 is displaced toward the delivery assembly thereby causing the telescopic cams 25 to be engaged in the slots 26 of the jaws so as to spread apart said jaws.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">The telescopic cams 25 are so contoured that the spreading apart of the jaws is performed only with the cartridge 2 arranged at its percolating position, between the percolating assembly 9 and delivery assembly 6 (see <figref idrefs="f0015">Figures 20</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0016">21</figref>).</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In this position, the shower element or assembly contacts the cartridge 2 to perforate the sealing wall 5 by the perforating needles 11 entering the cartridge 2.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Then, pressurized hot water is delivered through the cartridge 2 to outward deform the bottom wall 4 and causing the needles to perforate the<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> cartridge, and the beverage to percolate through the needles 14 and outlet duct of the percolating assembly.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">At the end of a coffee cup preparing operation, the user, as he/she desires to prepare another coffee cup or remove from the apparatus 1 the used cartridge 2, operates the handle 15 to move away the percolating assembly 9 from the delivery assembly 6.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">In this operating step, the percolating assembly 9 causes the telescopic cams 25 to disengage from the jaw slots, thereby the jaws are spread apart to allow the cartridge 2 to fall therefrom.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">As disclosed, said jaws are held in a spread apart condition during a substantial part of the percolating assembly return movement, thereby allowing the cartridge to properly downward fall.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The spread apart extended condition, in particular, is assured by the fact that, as the telescopic cams 25 disengage from the slot 26, the telescopic elements are restrained for a time by the restraining teeth 30 engaging or latching with the surfaces of the jaws about the slots 26, to hold said jaws spread apart up to a return of the percolating assembly 9 to its starting loading position.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">At this time, the apparatus will be ready again<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> to receive a novel cartridge for a novel infusion operation.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">It has been found that the invention fully achieves the intended aim and objects.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">In fact, the invention has provided an apparatus for preparing beverages starting from a powder material contained in a sealed cartridge, which comprises a fully automatic cartridge loading and unloading system which is very simple and reliable.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">The cartridge loading and unloading system is suitable for both a motorized and a manual operation.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">In practicing the invention, the used materials, as well as the contingent size and shapes can be any, depending on requirements.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977805" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Apparat (1) zur Herstellung
