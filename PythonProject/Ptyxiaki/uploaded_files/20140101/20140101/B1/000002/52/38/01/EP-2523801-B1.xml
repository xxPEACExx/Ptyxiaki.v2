mxw-id="PDES63956763" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention concerns a stereolithography machine comprising a modelling plate.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">As is known, the stereolithography technique makes it possible to produce three-dimensional objects by superimposing a succession of layers obtained by means of a liquid resin that solidifies when subjected to a predefined stimulation.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Each layer of the object is obtained by selectively stimulating the resin so as to solidify it in the points that make up a corresponding section of the object to be produced.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As is known, a stereolithography machine generally comprises a tank suited to contain the liquid resin, a device suited to stimulate a liquid resin layer having a predefined thickness and a moving modelling plate that supports the three-dimensional object during its formation.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">To create the first layer of the object, the surface of the plate is brought to the level of the above mentioned liquid layer to be stimulated, so that the first layer of the object is formed against the plate and adheres to it.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">To create each successive layer, the plate moves the object away from the previous position, so as to allow the resin to restore the liquid layer that will serve to form the successive layer.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Then the plate moves the object back to such a position that the last layer is against the liquid resin layer, so that the latter solidifies while adhering to the previous layer.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The stereolithography machines of known type pose the drawback that it is not easy to remove the finished object from the modelling plate.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In particular, since the object adheres to the plate and is very fragile, it must be detached using a sharp metal blade that is slided over the plate to separate the object from the surface of the plate itself.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">This operation involves the risk of deforming or breaking the object and therefore it must be carried out manually and with great care, with the double<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> drawback of increasing labour costs and the risk of rejects.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The blade poses another drawback lying in that some surface particles are removed from the plate.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Besides damaging the plate, this causes another drawback, represented by the fact that the above mentioned particles contaminate the residual liquid resin present in the tank, thus affecting the soundness of the objects that are produced successively.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Further drawbacks are posed by the stereolithography machines in which the stimulation device is positioned under the tank, which is provided with a bottom that is transparent to stimulation.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In this variant, the stimulation device is configured so as to solidify the resin layer adjacent to the bottom of the tank itself, so that the object is formed under the modelling plate and on creation of each successive layer the plate is progressively lifted from the bottom of the tank.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The vertical movements of the plate cause the resin to flow from the centre of the plate towards its sides and vice versa, depending on the direction of movement.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Due to the viscosity of the resin and its consequent difficulty in flowing, the movement of the plate exerts a certain pressure on the bottom of the tank, which increases in proportion to the viscosity of the resin, the plate movement speed and the proximity of the plate to the bottom of the tank.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In particular, during the formation of the first layers, the modelling plate is arranged at a distance from the bottom of the tank in the order of a few hundredths of a millimetre.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Therefore, during the formation of the first layers, the pressures determined by the movements of the plate are so high that it is necessary to limit the plate speed, with the inconvenience of considerably increasing the processing costs. The problem described above is addressed in the Italian patent application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="ITVI20080311A"><text>VI2008A000311</text></patcit>, in the name of the same applicant who filed the present application, and in document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20080174050A"><text>US 2008/0174050</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">These documents disclose a stereolithography machine as per the preamble of claim 1 comprising a plate provided with through holes that, allowing the resin to flow from one face of the plate to the other, prevent the resin from flowing towards the sides of the plate. Therefore, advantageously, the presence of the holes reduces the amount of pressure exerted on the bottom of the tank and makes it possible to increase<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the plate movement speed even during the formation of the first layers. Furthermore, the holes prevent the plate from adhering to the bottom of the tank, producing the so-called "sucker effect" described in detail in the above mentioned document of the known art.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">However, the holed plate poses the same drawbacks described above with reference to the removal of the object and to the cleaning of the plate, as well as adding new drawbacks.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">It is known, in fact, that in order to make the layers adhere to the surface of the plate it is necessary to stimulate a layer of resin slightly thicker than is strictly required.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Consequently, when a holed plate is used, part of the resin belonging to the first layers of the object solidifies inside the holes and remains stuck therein, thus hindering the successive removal of the plate at the end of the processing cycle.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In particular, if the object is removed by means of the above mentioned sharp metal blade, there is the inconvenience that the portions of resin that solidified in the holes are separated from the rest of the object and remain stuck in the holes.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Therefore, after removing the object, a further operation is necessary to remove the resin that is stuck in the holes.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Differently from the variant embodiment described above, a further variant embodiment of a stereolithography machine has the stimulation device arranged over the tank and configured so as to solidify the surface layer of the resin.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In this embodiment, the object is formed over the plate, which is progressively lowered as the construction of the object proceeds.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Even if this variant embodiment does not pose the drawbacks related to the pressure exerted on the bottom of the tank, it nevertheless poses the drawbacks related to the removal of the object from the plate and to the cleaning of the latter, described with reference to the previous variant embodiment.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The present invention intends to overcome all the drawbacks of the known art as outlined above.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In particular, it is a first object of the invention to provide a stereolithography machine with a modelling plate that allows the finished object to be removed more<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> comfortably than allowed by the plates of known type.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">It is a further object of the invention to provide a machine with a plate that is easy to clean.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">It is also the object of the invention to provide a machine with a plate that, when used on a stereolithography machine provided with a stimulation device arranged under the tank, facilitates the flow of the resin from the centre of the plate towards its sides, and vice versa, compared to the plates of known type.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The objects described above are achieved by a stereolithography machine according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Further characteristics and details of the invention are described in the corresponding dependent claims.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Advantageously, making it easier to remove the object from the plate means reducing the need for labour and the number of rejects.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Furthermore, making it easier to clean the plate means reducing the risk of contaminating the resin and thus also means offering the corresponding advantages.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Still advantageously, the easier flow of the resin allows plate movement speeds to be adopted that are analogous to those achievable with holed plates of known type.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Therefore, it is possible to reduce the processing time of a single object and thus reduce its cost.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The said objects and advantages, together with others which will be highlighted below, are illustrated in the description of preferred embodiments of the invention which are provided by way of non-limiting examples with reference to the attached drawings, wherein:

num="0040">The above mentioned selective stimulation <b>4</b> is generated through emission means <b>5</b> that convey it towards the tank <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Preferably but not necessarily the liquid substance <b>3</b> is a light-sensitive resin and the emission means <b>5</b> comprise a laser emitter associated with scanner means <b>5a</b> of any known type suited to direct the laser beam on the points of the layer of resin <b>3</b> to be solidified.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Obviously, variant embodiments may include other known types of emission means <b>5</b>,

<b>6</b> is arranged with the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> work surface <b>7</b> facing upwards and the three-dimensional object <b>A</b> is formed over the plate.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The plate <b>6</b> comprises a plurality of grooves <b>8</b> made in the work surface <b>7</b> along corresponding development trajectories parallel to one another and preferably rectilinear, as shown in

preferably uniform and substantially equal to the width of the corresponding groove <b>8</b> of the plate <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">In this way, advantageously, each elongated element

num="0091">The thickness <b>18</b> of the elongated elements <b>16</b> with respect to a direction orthogonal to the reference plane Y is preferably uniform along the direction of development of the

advantageously make it possible to comfortably insert the elongated elements <b>16</b> between the three-dimensional object <b>A</b> and the plate <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">It is also preferable that the thickness <b>18</b> of the elongated elements <b>16</b> be less than the depth <b>9</b> of the grooves <b>8</b>, so as to facilitate the penetration of the elongated elements <b>16</b> even when the resin <b>3</b> solidifies partially inside the grooves <b>8</b>, as described above.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">According to a variant embodiment, not illustrated herein, the elongated elements <b>16</b> have increasing cross section from the end towards the supporting body <b>15</b>, thus serving as wedges.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">The elongated elements <b>16</b>

force to be exerted on the object <b>A</b> during removal from the plate <b>6</b>, so as to reduce the risk of damaging it.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">The elongated elements <b>16</b> in plastic material offer a further advantage lying in that their hardness is lower than the hardness of the materials commonly employed for the modelling plates, normally aluminium or other materials with similar hardness.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">The reduced hardness of the elongated elements <b>16</b> prevents them from removing from the surface of the plate <b>6</b> some metal particles that may contaminate the resin <b>3</b> during the successive processing cycles, and also from damaging the plate <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">The tool <b>14</b> can obviously be entirely made of a plastic material, with the advantage of reducing costs.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">For this purpose the depth <b>9</b> of the grooves <b>8</b> should preferably exceed 0.5 mm, and preferably be in the order of 1 mm, so that the thickness of the tool <b>14</b> is compatible with the use of a plastic material.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">It is also evident that, in variant embodiments, the tool <b>14</b> can be made of any material.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">Obviously, the plate <b>6</b> and the tool <b>14</b> can be supplied in a kit intended to be used in a stereolithography machine <b>1</b>, which incorporates the advantages of both components.</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">In practice, after the construction of the three-dimensional object <b>A</b> has been completed, it can be comfortably removed from the plate <b>6</b> without damaging it, using the cleaning tool <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">In particular, the ends <b>16a</b> of the elongated elements <b>16</b> are inserted in the corresponding grooves <b>8</b> of the plate <b>6</b> and are then slided along the grooves <b>8</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref>.</p><p id="p0105" num="0105">During the sliding operation, the tool <b>14</b> is kept slightly inclined, so as to thrust the three-dimensional object <b>A</b> towards the outside of the plate <b>6</b> until it comes off.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">Advantageously, as the three-dimensional object <b>A</b> is thrusted at the level of its base, it remains intact during separation from the plate <b>6</b>, leaving no solid<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> residue of resin <b>3</b> stuck in the grooves <b>8</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p0107" num="0107">Therefore, advantageously, the modelling plate <b>6</b> does not require further cleaning operations before being used for the production of a new three-dimensional object.</p><p id="p0108" num="0108">The above clearly shows that the stereolithography machine of the invention achieves all the set objects.</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">In particular, the grooved modelling plate makes it particularly easy to

id="p0111" num="0111">Furthermore, the grooves of the plate facilitate the flow of the resin during the processing cycle, limiting the stress on the bottom of the tank and thus making it possible to increase the processing speed.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">Where technical features mentioned in any claim are followed by reference signs, those reference sings have been included for the sole
