In this fitting, characteristics related to the hearing aid processing of the hearing aid (hearing aid characteristics) are set to suit the hearing ability of the hearing aid user. That is, first of all, the hearing ability of the user is measured over a range from low to high audible frequencies. Then, the hearing aid characteristics are adjusted on the basis of the hearing level data obtained by this measurement. More specifically, a value is set for hearing aid processing parameters that will determine the hearing aid processing to be executed by the hearing aid.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, the work of adjusting a hearing aid often ends up taking a long time even for an experienced hearing aid adjuster.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Specifically, our perception of how we hear sounds varies from one person to the next, and this is also greatly affected by the measurement environment (such as the climate and the size of the measurement space), the time of day when the measurement is conducted, the physical condition of the hearing aid user, and so forth. These factors combine to make<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> adjustment a time-consuming process. More specifically, once adjustment has proceeded a certain amount, the hearing aid adjuster gradually decides that the hearing aid processing parameters have been narrowed down to their final values that are suited to the hearing aid user.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Meanwhile, how a user hears sounds will sometimes vary compared to when the adjustment was started, due to external or internal factors. For instance, the user may conclude that a previous test sound was better than the current test sound. Therefore, the adjustment work frequently has to back up and the same work repeated, which tends to result in the adjustment taking a longer time.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In view of this, there have been attempts in the past at utilizing an interactive genetic algorithm (GA) in an effort to find an adjustment value semi-automatically, taking into account such subjective swings in evaluations of hearing (see Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 2001-175637, for example).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A conventional method involving a GA makes use of an initial value set of hearing aid processing parameters given randomly over a range in which excessively loud or soft sounds are not outputted. The hearing aid processing parameters included in the initial value set are subjected to a hearing test and evaluation by the hearing aid user, and hearing aid processing parameters with high evaluation marks are extracted. A new hearing aid processing parameter set is produced by using "selection," "intersection," and "mutation," which are the basic GA operations, on the extracted hearing aid processing parameters. Then, the new hearing aid processing parameters are subjected to a hearing test and evaluation by the hearing aid user, and hearing aid processing parameters with high evaluation marks are extracted. The extracted hearing aid processing parameters become the basis for creating the next new hearing aid processing parameters by basic GA operation.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Thus, with a hearing aid adjustment method featuring a GA, a set of hearing aid processing parameters is subjected to a series of operations, namely, a hearing test, evaluation, and GA operation, over and over to find the suboptimal<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> hearing aid processing parameters for a user. In other words, with a hearing aid adjustment method featuring a GA, variance in a hearing aid user's decisions is taken into account to a certain extent, while attempting to narrow down the hearing aid processing parameters that will be the object of the hearing test.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">However, if this narrowing down by GA is unsuccessful, the hearing test and evaluation have to be repeated dozens of times, or in some cases hundreds of times, until the adjustment of the hearing aid is finished. As a result, with an adjustment method featuring a GA, adjustment of a hearing aid ends up taking a tremendous amount of time, although the hearing aid processing parameters can be found semi-automatically.<br/>

In order to fit a hearing aid for a new user, those hearing adjustment results are selected which were determined for users with similar hearing ability data in the past. The selected hearing adjustment results are clustered from each of the cluster, representative hearing adjustments are extracted. Then, the new user performs a hearing test using all extracted hearing adjustments to select in initial adjustment for the fine tuning of the hearing aid.</p><heading id="h0003">TECHNICAL PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">In light of the above problems, it is an object of the present invention to efficiently find hearing aid processing parameters that reflect how a hearing aid user hears sounds, while reducing the number of times the hearing aid user has to undergo hearing testing and evaluation.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0004">SOLUTION TO PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">The hearing aid adjustment device disclosed herein has a comparator and a setting section.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The comparator compares a first evaluation given by a hearing aid user in response to sound obtained by hearing aid processing based on a specific method and the hearing level data for the user, and a second evaluation acquired ahead of time and corresponding to each of a plurality of reference users, and given by the reference users in response to sound obtained by hearing aid processing based on the specific method and the hearing level data for the reference users. The setting section sets the value of a first parameter designating hearing aid processing to be given to the user, to a value that is the same as the value of a second parameter that is acquired ahead of time and designates hearing aid processing suited to those reference users who gave a second evaluation that matched or was similar to the first evaluation, out of the plurality of reference users.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The hearing aid adjustment method disclosed herein involves acquiring, from a data storage section, second evaluation information expressing a second evaluation given by a plurality of reference users in response to sound that is stored ahead of time in the data storage section and corresponding to each of the reference users and that is obtained by hearing aid processing based on a specific method and hearing level data for the reference users. This hearing aid adjustment method also involves comparing the second evaluation information acquired from the data storage section with first evaluation information expressing a first evaluation given by the user in response to sound obtained by hearing aid processing based on a specific method and hearing level data for the user. This hearing aid<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> adjustment method further involves setting the value of a first parameter designating hearing aid processing to be given to the user, to a value that is the same as the value of a second parameter that has been stored ahead of time in the data storage section and designates hearing aid processing suited to those reference users who gave a second evaluation that matched or was similar to the first evaluation, out of the plurality of reference users.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">With this hearing aid adjustment device and hearing aid adjustment method, a hearing aid user and a plurality of reference users evaluate a sound obtained by hearing aid processing based on the same specific method. Here, if a first evaluation given by the user is similar to a second evaluation given by the reference users, it can be concluded that the individual preference of the user as related to hearing aid processing is similar to the individual preferences of the reference users as related to hearing aid processing. Therefore, the value of a first parameter designating the hearing aid processing to be given to a user is set to a value that is the same as the value of a second parameter designating hearing aid processing suited to reference users who gave a second evaluation that matches or is similar to the first evaluation given by the user. As a result, the subjective preferences of the user as related to hearing aid processing are reflected in the first parameter.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Consequently, the subjective preferences of the user as related to hearing aid processing can be reflected in the first parameter merely by having the user evaluate a sound obtained by hearing aid processing based on a specific method and hearing level data for that user. Therefore, there is no need for extra repetition of adjustment of the hearing aid processing parameters in order to find the subjective preferences of the user.</p><heading id="h0005">ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --><p id="p0016" num="0016">Thus, when a hearing aid is adjusted to suit a hearing aid user, hearing aid processing parameters that reflect how the hearing aid user hears sounds can be found efficiently, while reducing the number of times the hearing aid user has to undergo hearing testing and evaluation.</p><heading id="h0006">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> shows the configuration of a hearing aid adjustment device 1 pertaining to an embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a control block diagram of the hearing aid adjustment device 1 in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a concept diagram showing the fitting theories stored in a fitting theory database 9;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a concept diagram showing an example of the data stored in a customer database 10;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart of hearing aid adjustment in the hearing aid adjustment device 1 in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> shows an example of a screen display in the hearing aid adjustment device 1 in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> shows an example of a screen display in the hearing aid adjustment device 1 in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> is a concept diagram of processing in a recommended parameter specification section 22; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> shows an example of a screen display in the hearing aid adjustment device 1 in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><heading id="h0007">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><heading id="h0008">Configuration</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">The configuration of the hearing aid adjustment device 1 pertaining to this embodiment will be described through reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the text that follows, a user for whom related data has been recorded in a customer database 10 (discussed below) will be called a reference user in order to distinguish from a user T (an example of a user) that is having the fitting done.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the hearing aid adjustment device 1 pertaining to this embodiment comprises an input section 2, a display section 3, and a sound output section 4.
