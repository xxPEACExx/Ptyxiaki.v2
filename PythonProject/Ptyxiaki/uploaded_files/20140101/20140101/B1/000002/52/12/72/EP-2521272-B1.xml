load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b><u>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><heading id="h0002"><u>Field of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an antenna diversity receiver for radio communication systems, and more particularly to a reduced-complexity antenna arrangement disposed to utilize a single processing chain of the associated diversity receiver.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Background Information</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">It has recently been proposed that both the performance and capacity of existing wireless system could be improved through the use of so-called "smart" antenna techniques. In particular, it has been suggested that such techniques, coupled with space-time signal processing, could be utilized both to combat the deleterious effects of multipath fading of a desired incoming signal and to suppress interfering signals. In this way both performance and capacity of digital wireless systems in existence or being deployed (e.g., CDMA-based systems, TDMA-based systems, WLAN systems, and OFDM-based systems such as IEEE 802.11a/g) may be improved.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It is anticipated that smart antenna techniques will be increasingly utilized both in connection with deployment of base station infrastructure and mobile subscriber units (e.g; handsets) in cellular systems in order to address the increasing demands being placed upon such systems. These demands are arising in part from the shift underway from current voice-based services to next-generation wireless multimedia services and the accompanying blurring of distinctions among voice, video and data modes of transmission. Subscriber units utilized in such next-generation systems will likely be required to demonstrate higher voice quality relative to existing cellular mobile radio standards as well as to provide highspeed data services (e.g., as high as 10 Mbits/s). Achieving high speed and high quality of service, however, is complicated because it is desireable for mobile subscriber units to be small and lightweight, and to be capable of reliably operating in a variety of environments<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> (e.g., cellular/microcellular/picocellular, urban/suburban/rural and indoor/outdoor). Moreover, in addition to offering higher-quality communication and coverage, next-generation systems are desired to more efficiently use available bandwidth and to be priced affordably to ensure widespread market adoption.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In many wireless systems, three principal factors tend to account for the bulk of performance and capacity degradation: multipath fading, delay spread between received multipath signal components, and co-channel interference (CCI). As is known, multipath fading is caused by the multiple paths which may be traversed by a transmitted signal en route to a receive antenna. The signals from these paths add together with different phases, resulting in a received signal amplitude and phase that vary with antenna location, direction and polarization, as well as with time (as a result of movement through the environment). Increasing the quality or reducing the effective error rate in order to obviate the effects of multipath fading has proven to be extremely difficult. Although it would be theoretically possible to reduce the effects of multipath fading through use of higher transmit power or additional bandwidth, these approaches are often inconsistent with the requirements of next-generation systems.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As mentioned above, the "delay spread" or difference in propagation delays among the multiple components of received multipath signals has also tended to constitute a principal impediment to improved capacity and performance in wireless communication systems. It has been reported that when the delay spread exceeds approximately ten percent (10%) of the symbol duration, the resulting significant intersymbol interference (ISI) generally limits the maximum data rate. This type of difficulty has tended to arise most frequently in narrowband systems such as the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The existence of co-channel interference (CCI) also adversely affects the performance and capacity of cellular systems. Existing cellular systems operate by dividing the available frequency channels into channel sets, using one channel set per cell, with frequency reuse. Most time division multiple access (TDMA) systems use a frequency reuse factor of 7, while most code division multiple (CDMA) systems use a frequency reuse factor of 1. This frequency reuse results in CCI, which increases as the number of channel sets decreases (i.e., as the capacity of each cell increases). In TDMA systems, the CCI is predominantly from one or two other users, while in CDMA systems there may exist many strong interferers both within the cell and from adjacent cells. For a given level of CCI,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> capacity can be increased by shrinking the cell size, but at the cost of additional base stations.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The impairments to the performance of cellular systems of the type described above may be at least partially ameliorated by using multi-element antenna systems designed to introduce a diversity gain into the signal reception process. There exist at least three primary methods of effecting such a diversity gain through decorrelation of the signals received at each antenna element: spatial diversity, polarization diversity and angle diversity. In order to realize spatial diversity, the antenna elements are sufficiently separated to enable low fading correlation. The required separation depends on the angular spread, which is the angle over which the signal arrives at the receive antennas.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the case of mobile subscriber units (e.g, handsets) surrounded by other scattering objects, an antenna spacing of only one quarter wavelength is often sufficient to achieve low fading correlation. This permits multiple spatial diversity antennas to be incorporated within a handset, particularly at higher frequencies (owing to the reduction in antenna size as a function of increasing frequency). Furthermore, dual polarization antennas can be placed close together, with low fading correlation, as can antennas with different patterns (for angle or direction diversity). However, each antenna element deployed in a wireless handset requires a separate chain of signal processing electronics, which increases the cost and power consumption of the handset.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="GB2367199A"><text>GB 2 367 199 A</text></patcit> discloses that an apparatus for receiving ranging signals (e.g. signals from Global Positioning System satellites) has a receiver coupled to a plurality of spaced antennas. The receiver includes a signal combiner which receives, from a processing circuit, signal components individually representative of a characteristic of the received ranging signals (e.g. signal-to-noise ratio) at a respective antenna and weights the said components to produce a range estimate of improved accuracy in difficult reception conditions.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The invention is defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">One example comprises a method, and means for accomplishing the method, of receiving a signal, the method including the steps of :

Furthermore, the phrase "in one embodiment" will be used repeatedly, however the phrase does not necessarily refer to the same embodiment, although it may.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In order to configure a mobile device to process signals from multiple antenna elements, the cost and power consumption of the associated electronics within the device should desirably be capable of implementation in a cost-effective manner. In this regard the present invention is directed to a system and method for implementing multiple antenna elements within mobile devices in a manner that potentially reduces costs, which typically accompany multi-element antenna arrangements. The present invention is not limited to mobile devices and may also be applied to infrastructure elements (e.g., base stations and access points). In addition, the present invention is applicable to nearly all known wireless standards and modulation schemes (e.g., GSM, CDMA2000, WCDMA, WLAN, fixed wireless standards, OFDM and CDMA). As will be described below, various advantages offered by the present invention derive from the multiplexing of the signals received from a number of antenna elements onto a common receive chain processing path in order to reduce overall power consumption and cost.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">For example, the present invention according to several embodiments provides a reduced-complexity, plural-element antenna arrangement and associated receiver design capable of being implemented at low cost. In some embodiments, the antenna arrangement and receiver design does not materially increase power consumption relative to single-element approaches, thereby rendering it particularly suitable for implementation within wireless handsets.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, samples from plural antenna elements are time-multiplexed onto a single RF processing path using orthogonal switching functions. Demultiplexing is then performed in the digital domain along with channel selection and spatial and time processing.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In order to facilitate appreciation of the principals of the invention, a brief overview of various conventional multi-element antenna systems designed to mitigate delay spread, interference and fading effects is provided with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">FIGS. 1- 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Referring first to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, shown is a block diagram of a conventional diversity receiver 100 in which the signals received by multiple antenna elements are weighted and combined in order to generate an output signal. Shown in the conventional diversity receiver 100 are a collection of M antenna elements 102, and coupled with each respective antenna element are parallel receive chains 104, 106, 108 that include respective weighting portions 110, 112, 114. The receive chains 104, 106, 108 all couple with a combiner 116 and a combined single 118 exits from the combiner 116.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">With M antenna elements, such an array generally provides an increased antenna gain of "M" as well as a diversity gain against multipath fading dependent upon the correlation of the fading among the antenna elements. In this context the antenna gain is defined as the reduction in required receive signal power for a given average output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while the diversity gain is defined as the reduction in the required average output SNR for a given bit error rate (BER) with fading.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">For interference mitigation, each of the M antenna elements 102 are weighted at the respective weighting portions 110, 112, 114 and combined in the combiner 116 to maximize signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). This weighting process is usually implemented in a manner that minimizes mean squared error (MMSE), and utilizes the correlation of the interference to reduce the interference power.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Turning now to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, a block diagram is shown of a conventional spatial-temporal (ST) filtering arrangement 200.

In general, since the CCI is unknown at the receiver, optimum space-time (ST) equalizers, either in the sense of a minimum mean square error (MMSE) or maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), typically include a whitening filter, e.g. linear equalizers (LE) 206, 208 that whitens the CCI both spatially and temporally, and the filtering arrangement of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> is typical of such systems.

Using ST processing (STP) techniques, SNR gains of up to 4 dB and SINR gains of up to 21 dB has been reported with a modest number of antenna elements.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Referring next to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, shown is a generic representation of a multiple-input/multiple-output antenna arrangement within a wireless communication system. Shown are a transmitter (TX) 302 coupled to multiple transmit antennas 304, and the multiple transmitter antennas 304 are shown transmitting a signal via time varying obstructions 306 to multiple receive antennas 308 that are coupled to a receiver (RX) 310.

<ul><li>Single-input/single-output (SISO) systems, which include transceivers (e.g., mobile units and a base station) with a single antenna for uplink and down link communications.</li><li>Multi-input/single-output (MISO) systems, which include one or more receivers, which downlink via multiple antenna inputs, and one or more transmitters, which uplink via a single antenna output.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></li><li>Single-input/multi-output (SIMO) systems, which include one or more receivers, which downlink via a single antenna input, and one or more transmitters, which uplink via multiple antenna outputs.</li></ul></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">One aspect of the attractiveness of multi-element antenna arrangements, particularly MIMOs, resides in the significant system capacity enhancements that can be achieved using these configurations. Assuming perfect estimates of the applicable channel at both the transmitter and receiver are available, in a MIMO system with <i>M</i> receive antennas the received signal decomposes to <i>M</i> independent channels. This results in an <i>M</i>-fold capacity increase relative to SISO systems. For a fixed overall transmitted power, the capacity offered by MIMOs scale with increasing SNR for a large, but practical, number of <i>M</i> of antenna elements.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In the particular case of fading multipath channels, it has been found that the use of MIMO arrangements permits capacity to be scaled by nearly <i>M</i> additional bits/cycle for each 3-dB increase in SNR. This MIMO scaling attribute is in contrast to a baseline configuration, characterized by <i>M</i>=1, which by Shannon's classical formula scales as one more bit/cycle for every 3-dB of SNR increase. It is noted that this increase in capacity that MIMO systems afford is achieved without any additional bandwidth relative to the single element baseline configuration.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">However, widespread deployment of multi-element antenna arrangements in wireless communication systems (particularly within wireless handsets) has been hindered by the resultant increase in complexity and associated increased power consumption, cost and size. These parameter increases result, at least in part, from a requirement in many proposed architectures that a separate receiver chain be provided for each for each antenna element.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">For example, <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> depicts one conventional architecture of a multiple receive antenna system in the RF domain. As shown, the implementation of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> includes a separate receive chain 402, 404, 406 for each of <i>M</i> antenna elements, and each receive chain 402, 404, 406 includes elements to perform amplification, filtering and mixing. As a consequence, the cost of implementing a system with this architecture is higher than a system with a single receive chain.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">This approach is further disadvantageous because analog phase shifters and variable gain amplifiers are utilized, which renders it relatively expensive and susceptible to performance degradation as a result of aging, temperature variation, and deviation from<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> prescribed tolerances. In addition, because the implementation of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> makes use of a phase relationship between the received and transmitted antenna elements (i.e., the path differential delay is maintained throughout each receive processing chain), rigid adherence to tolerances and accurate calibration is required in each RF processing chain.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Referring next <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>, shown is a block diagram representing a digital equivalent to the circuit of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>. In general, the performance of the digital circuit arrangement of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. <sub>5</sub> 5</figref> is degraded for substantially the same reasons as was described above with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>. That is, the duplication of the entire receiver chain (i.e., from RF to baseband) associated with each antenna element leads to an increase in size, cost, complexity and power consumption relative to single antenna approaches. As a result, multi-element antenna configurations have heretofore been unsuitable for deployment in the handsets and other mobile terminals used within wireless communication systems.</p><heading id="h0007"><b>Overview and System Architecture</b></heading><p id="p0037" num="0037">As is described in further detail below, several embodiments of the reduced-complexity antenna arrangement and receiver of the present invention are premised on consolidating the RF processing operations associated with each antenna element into a single processing chain, and in some embodiments RF processing operations are consolidated into a single processing chain as soon as is practicable.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In some embodiments, this consolidation is achieved by multiplexing samples from a switch element connected to a pair of antenna elements onto a single RF processing chain. Upon completion of the RF processing effected by this single RF chain, the incident signals are passed through matched filters operative to reduce the applicable sample frequency to the appropriate base band rate. Upon recovery of the signals initially received by each antenna element in the digital domain, the recovered signals are then subjected to conventional spatial processing. The structure may be generalized for use with more than a pair of antenna elements by modifying the structure of the multiplexer/demultiplexer and the sample spacing of the signal streams provided to the matched filters associated with each antenna element.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram, which illustratively represents a receiver front end incorporating a plural-element antenna processing module 600 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0023">FIG. 23</figref>, each of the square waves reverses polarity during each cycle. It should be recognized, however, that switching-square waves need not reverse polarity during each cycle, but by employing square waves that reverse polarity during each cycle (i.e., that more closely resemble a sin wave), fewer harmonics are produced during the multiplexing process, and as a consequence, less rigorous filtering of the multiplexed signal is required.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In other embodiments, as discussed further with reference to <figref idrefs="f0024">FIGS. 24</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0025">25</figref>, the frequency spreading is performed in accordance with complex Walsh coding principals.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As one of ordinary skill in the art recognizes, the multiplexer 608 may be implemented using various combinations of hardware and software/firmware.
