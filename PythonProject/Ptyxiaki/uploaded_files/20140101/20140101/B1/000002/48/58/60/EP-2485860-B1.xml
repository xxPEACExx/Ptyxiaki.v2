In sand casting, foundry shapes called molds, exterior casting forms, and cores, interior casting forms, are made from a mixture of a foundry aggregate, such as sand, and a binder. The two categories of sand molds are "green" and "rigid." Green sand molds are bonded with clay and water. Rigid sand molds are bonded with organic resins and can be hardened using one of several methods, including baking, curing with a chemical reagent, and flushing with a reactive gas. Molten metal is poured into and around the foundry shapes after they have hardened. The binders, e.g., phenol formaldahyde resins, or phenol-isocyanate (polyurethane) resins, used to form foundry shapes typically contain a significant amount of organic solvent, which can emit noxious fumes, as well as free reactants, e.g., formaldehyde or isocyanate and free phenol, that are detrimental to the cast metal and the foundry environment.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A urethane binder resin, when used in combination with a foundry aggregate such as sand, typically has three parts: a polymerizable polyol component, an isocyanate component, and a catalyst component. The polymerizable polyol compound, e.g., a polyol, such as ethylene glycol, and isocyanate react to form a cross-linked polymer which increases the tensile strength and/or hardness of the sand/binder mixture. The catalyst prompts the polymerizable components of the binder to polymerize, allowing for rapid conversion of the foundry mix into a hard and solid cured state suitable for forming shapes from molten metal poured therein.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Humic substances containing a plurality of hydroxyl groups have been asserted to represent an alternative reactant to the conventional phenol reactant for reactions with isocyanates in the formation of binder resins (<i>see</i> <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2009065018A1"><text>WO 2009/065018 A1</text></patcit>). Humic substances include humic acid, fulvic acid, hymatomelanic acid, ulmic acid, and humin. As stated in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2009065018A1"><text>WO 2009/065018 A1</text></patcit>, humic substances contain hydroxyl groups that react with an<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> isocyanate to form polyurethane resins. Humic acid has previously been included in foundry sand compositions. See <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US3023113A"><text>U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,023,113</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US3832191A"><text>3,832,191</text></patcit>. Humic acid can be derived from several sources, including lignite, leonardite, peat, and manure. Lignite and leonardite are preferred sources because they are rich in humic acid and readily mined. Lignite is an organic mineraloid that is the lowest rank of coal. Known as "brown coal," lignite has a high inherent moisture content of up to 66 wt. % and a high ash content compared to other forms of coal. Lignite has previously been used as an additive in foundry sand compositions comprising an additional binding agent such as bentonite clay. See <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US3445251A"><text>U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,445,251</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US4359339A"><text>4,359,339</text></patcit>. When lignite becomes highly oxidized, leonardite is formed. Oxidation increases the humic acid and carbonyl group content. Leonardite particles are generally anionically charged and composed primarily of the mixed salts of humic acid, ulmic acid, and fulvic acid. The humic acid in leonardite is soluble in alkaline solutions and can be extracted from a solid phase source using a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A humic substance containing composition, for use as a polyol component in urethane resin for use as a foundry sand binder is described in <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="WO2009065018A1"><text>WO 2009/065018 A1</text></patcit>. This prior art composition was found to have a short shelf life, with the composition showing gross separation (settling) of humic solids, and/or turning into a stiff (i.e. no fluidity) gel within a short duration of storage. The separation of the humic solid prevents the ready standardization of the addition of the humic solids to foundry aggregate over the course of normal foundry mold and core production. These variations in the composition of the foundry mix can affect casting performance of the foundry shape thereby impacting the cost and quality of the resultant casting in a negative manner. To provide a consistent and repeatable amount of humic solids to the foundry mix, the humic solids are herein provided in a stable liquid form. The multi-component kits described herein include a lignite-isocyanate suspension that contains a lignite, an isocyanate, a stabilization agent. Unlike reported lignite-polyol examples, lignite-isocyanate suspensions described herein are stable against separation of suspended solids. Furthermore, the addition of the stabilization agent would be expected to impair the performance of the foundry mix; however, the resin compositions surprisingly have been found to have improved binder performance compared to the binders of the prior art.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US6291550B"><text>US 6,291,550</text></patcit> discloses a foundry binder system that includes a polyol component, a polyisocyanate component, and a liquid tertiary amine catalyst. <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US4851457A"><text>US 4,851,457</text></patcit> discloses a foundry binder that uses lignin in combination with an isocyanate. <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="WO2009065095A"><text>WO 2009/065095</text></patcit> discloses a foundry binder that includes a monofunctional alcohol.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>SUMMARY</u></b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">Described herein, in the preferred embodiment, is a lignite-containing polyurethane resin binder that may be used, among other applications, as a binder of foundry aggregate, e.g., sand, for producing molds and cores for metal castings. The herein described kit can be used to make foundry molds and cores using the separate components of (a) a lignite, a polymerizable isocyanate, a stabilization agent; wherein the lignite has a mean particle size of about 50 nm to about 500 µm (b) a polymerizable polyol; and (c) a catalyst. The components (a), (b), and (c) are, preferably, separately stored. In another preferred embodiment, the components are admixed with a foundry aggregate to form a foundry mix which can be pressed or molded into a foundry shape.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">Foundry shapes can be formed from foundry mix, e.g., from stable ligniteisocyanate suspensions by the <i>in situ</i> reaction of the isocyanate with a polymerizable polyol, admixed with a foundry aggregate. In a preferred embodiment, a stable lignite-isocyanate suspension, a polymerizable polyol, and a polyurethane polymerization catalyst are provided as a multi-component kit for admixing with a foundry aggregate, to form a foundry mix. The formation of the foundry mix typically involves the stepwise addition of the kit components to the foundry aggregate, e.g. sand, with mixing, to form a foundry mix that sets over the course of a predetermined time, typically minutes. The admixing of the kit components can be either stepwise in the foundry aggregate or some of the kit components, e.g., the polyol component and/or the catalysts component, can be admixed prior to admixing with the foundry aggregate. The kit components form a lignite-polyurethane resin that binds the foundry aggregate and permits the formation of a foundry shape useful in metal casting. Another aspect of the multi-component kit described herein is to provide foundry mixes utilizing the binder components.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The multi-component kits perform exceptionally well as binders in sand castings. Finished metal castings were produced from molds formed to a desired shape with the multi-component kits admixed with the foundry aggregate, as described in further detail below. Compared to conventional phenol-formaldehyde and phenol-isocyanate resin binders, the herein described foundry shapes made from the herein described multi-component kits, possess three significant benefits: 1) superior sand shakeout and better core bum out; 2) non-noxious smoke at during pouring, cooling, and shakeout; and 3) very low odor at mixing. Moreover, the herein described foundry shapes exhibit limited thermal shock and<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> subsequently have a very high hot strength making them superior molds for metal casting. The quality of shakeout is an important consideration because aggregate and binder residue on the finished casting can impair the quality and/or performance of the finished casting.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The multi-component kits described herein comprise an organic solid having an insoluble component that is completely combustible. In this instance, insoluble means that one of ordinary skill using solvents typical of the art cannot fully solvate the organic solid and completely combustible means that the high temperature pyrolysis of the organic solid leaves little to no inorganic residue. Preferably, the organic solid is humic organic matter, wherein humic organic matter is a catchall term for biopolymers occurring in soil, sediment, and water. Typically, the humic organic matter is a humic substance, e.g. a humic acid-containing or humic acid salt-containing ore. More preferably, the humic organic matter is a lignite, even more preferably leonardite, previously described in this Assignee's <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="US5695554A"><text>U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,695,554</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="US5688313A"><text>5,688,313</text></patcit>, and hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Another important aspect of the multi-component kit is the stability of the kit over time. The separation of the lignite solids (particles) from the lignite-isocyanate suspension after preparation would be detrimental to the transport, storage, and utility of the suspension. Herein, the described lignite-isocyanate suspensions are stable over a sufficient time to allow remote manufacturing of the suspension, and subsequent transport, storage, and use without reagitation of the suspension.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The lignite-isocyanate suspension is an admixture of a lignite, a polymerizable isocyanate, and optionally a stabilization agent. Preferably the lignite-isocyanate suspension has good stability against separation; low-shear viscosity and shear-thinning rheology, e.g., wherein the viscosity of the suspension decreased by about 50% when the shear rate is increased from about 0.5 rpm to about 100 rpm; and good performance in urethane polymerization. As used herein, the lignite-isocyanate admixture is termed a suspension, this is used in a broad sense; the suspension can be a homogeneous mixture, a heterogeneous mixture, an emulsion, and the like.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Here, the lignite-isocyanate suspension is shear thinning. As used herein, shear thinning means the viscosity of the lignite-isocyanate suspension decreases with increasing shear force. The effect of shear thinning can be observed by measuring the viscosity of the suspension at various shear rates. The specific viscosity of individual lignite-isocyanate suspensions are dependant on the numerous factors, including the concentration of the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> components in the suspension, the lignite average particle size, and the chemical structure of the isocyanate. Preferably, the viscosity of the lignite-isocyanate suspension decreases by at least 50 % when the shear rate is increased from about 5 rpm to about 100 rpm, as measured with a Brookfield Viscometer.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The humic substance is preferably a lignite, preferably leonardite, as previously described in this Assignee's <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="US5695554A"><text>U.S. Pat.

Preferably, the catalyst component is tris (3-dimethylamino) propylamine.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">A preferred process for preparing the lignite-isocyanate suspension described herein comprises: 1) heating a mixture of an isocyanate and a dispersing agent to 70 °C in a suitable vessel; 2) mixing the isocyanate with lignite in a high-shear mixer at 70 °C; 3) adding a molten thickening agent; and 4) cooling the batch under agitation to ambient temperature. In a preferred embodiment, the dispersing agent is PEG-100 stearate at a concentration of about 0.1 to 25 wt. % based on the total weight of the lignite, dry basis, more preferably about 0.5 to about 5 wt. %. The isocyanate is incorporated at a concentration of about 15 to about 90 wt. %, based on the total final weight of the lignite-isocyanate suspension, more preferably about 40 to about 70 wt. %. The thickening agent is preferably a waxy compound, e.g. PEG-150 distearate, at a concentration of about 0.1 to about 10 wt. %, based on the total weight of the lignite-isocyanate suspension, more preferably of about 0.5 to about 4 wt. %.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The type of aggregate and amount of binder used to prepare foundry mixes can vary widely and is known to those skilled in the art. One preferred aggregate is silica sand. Other suitable aggregate materials include olivine, zircon, chromite, carbon, fluid coke, related materials, and aggregate mixtures.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The multi-component kits are preferably used as binders in combination with foundry aggregate at concentrations at about 0.1 to about 10 wt. %, more preferably at about 1 to about 2.5 wt. %, based on the dry weight of the aggregate.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In one preferred embodiment for preparing a foundry shape, the components of the multi-component kits are individually admixed with the foundry aggregate. The resultant foundry mix is then mixed until nearly homogeneous, and then formed into a foundry shape. In another preferred embodiment the lignite-isocyanate suspension and the polyol components are premixed, then admixed with the foundry aggregate. In yet another embodiment, the lignite-isocyanate suspension is premixed with the catalyst component, then<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> admixed with the foundry aggregate. In still another embodiment, the polyol is premixed with the catalyst component and then admixed with the foundry aggregate.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The foundry mix is then formed into a foundry shape. Generally in the art, the mold and the core are made from different foundry mixes. The mold mix commonly comprising a clay binder and the core mix commonly comprising a polymer binder. After casting, the majority of the spent foundry shape is removed from the cast shape by shake-out. During shake-out the majority of the mold breaks free from the casting and some of the core is removed. Often the core-binders are not destroyed during casting and must be physically broken from the internal areas of the core. Following the shake-out process and core-removal, the casting is cleaned, wherein residual aggregate is removed by primarily shot blasting. Here, metal flashing and aggregate is removed from the surface of the casting and metal is often adhered to the aggregate. This multi-step process for isolating a metal casting is time consuming, costly, as well as energy and material intensive. The herein described materials and methods significantly reduce the time and energy necessary for the isolation of a metal casting by improving the shake-out, the core removal process, and the number of foundry mixes necessary to make a foundry shape. Preferably, the mold and the core are manufactured with the herein described foundry mix and after casting are cleanly broken from the metal casting during shake-out.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In a preferred embodiment the core is manufactured from the herein described foundry mix. Preferably, the binders in the core shape are fully destroyed by the heat of the liquid metal and following the solidification of the metal flow freely from the core area during shakeout. More preferably, about 30 to about 60 % more aggregate is removed during shake-out when the herein described foundry mix is used to form the foundry shape. Even more preferably and possibly due to improved bum-out of the binder, the reclamation costs for the aggregate are decreased by about 20 to about 50 %.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The metal casting (an article of manufacture) is preferably formed by pouring liquid metal into the foundry shape. The metal making up the casting and/or the liquid can be any metal capable of being cast in an aggregate shape. Examples of metals include iron, steels, carbon steals, stainless steels, chromium steels, alloys, aluminum, titanium, zinc, copper, silver, gold, platinum, palladium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the liquid metal is poured at a sufficiently high temperature to facilitate the burnout of the core resin.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The compositions and processes described herein have been primarily described and illustrated in terms of their use in the foundry art, but those skilled in the art will recognize that the binder resins and binder resin-containing compositions described herein may also be utilized in other fields, including adhesives, coatings, and composites.</p><heading id="h0005">Example</heading><p id="p0035" num="0035">General Procedure: Leonardite was milled so that 100% of the leonardite passed a 200 mesh screen (74 micron). The milled leonardite was then dried so that the residual moisture content, as determine by a moisture teller, was less than 1 wt.%. Separately, the indicated quantity of isocyante was mixed with a high shear, rotor stator homogenizer (Silverson Homogenizer). A quantity of dried, milled leonardite was incrementally to the isocyanate over about four minutes and the suspension was continuously mixed at 6,000 rpm for about 20 minutes.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The stability of the lignite-isocyanate suspension without the addition of a thickening agent, the sample, was tested allowing the sample to sit, undisturbed, for at least 24 hours. A small laboratory spatula was then inserted into the sample and the bottom of the beaker was scraped. If settled material was readily apparent, e.g. the supernatant appears clear and the bottom of the beaker is thickly coated with solid, the solid adheres to the spatula upon removal from the suspension, and/or the spatula encounters increased resistance across the bottom of the beaker, then the sample is determined to have failed this test. Correspondingly, the sample passes the test if there is no observable material and/or no material adhering to the spatula. Additionally, samples were allowed to sit, undisturbed for seven days and tested for settled solids, as outlined above. The compositions of the samples and the results of the static settling test are presented in Table 1.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Table 1 additional shows observations from the mixing of the lignite and the isocyanate. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the reaction of an isocyanate with an alcohol is an exothermic reaction and that the lack of an exotherm is indicative of little to no reaction between a reagent and an isocyanate.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> -->
