desorption process and an absorption or desorption method using a rotating packed bed.</p><heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Packed beds are known in the art for their applications in gas-liquid separations such as air from water or absorption/desorption processes such as the absorption of a particular gas from an exhaust gas. The performance of packed beds, also referred to as packed columns, is primarily given by the porosity of the material used for the packing, its total surface area of the packed bed, as well as the total height of the column. Typically, a gas and a liquid are directed through stationary packed beds in counter-current flow direction to one another, because a higher separation efficiency can be achieved in a counter-current-flow process compared to co-current-flow process.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In stationary packed beds the liquid passing through the packing is only acted on by gravity, which results in the fact that the columns must be designed with a considerable height in order to achieve a desired degree of separation.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Rotating packed beds, as for example first presented by its initial inventor in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4400275A"><text>US patent US 4,400,275</text></patcit> consists of a packing arranged on a shaft, through which gas and liquid are passed. The rotation of the packed bed on the shaft allows to increase the specific surface area per volume acting in the separation process such that the total volume of the packed bed for a given performance may be smaller compared to that of a stationary packed column. While the volume specific contact area and the mass transfer coefficient for a rotating bed is beneficially increased, the pressure loss suffered across the bed however is increased.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In a stationary packed column, gravity acts on the liquid flow through the packing and a difference in total pressure of the gas allows it to flow through the packing in upward direction. A rotating packed bed on the other hand requires additional energy for acceleration of the gas through the packed bed while overcoming the frictional forces as well as to operate the rotating system.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>D.P.

The gas flows from a first gas plenum extending along the shaft between the shaft and the inner radius of the first bed, to a second gas plenum at the outer radius of the first bed extending along the outer radius of both the first and second bed such that the gas can flow from the first to the second bed. The gas flows from this second gas plenum through the second bed into a third gas plenum at the inner radius of the second bed along the shaft and then exits the apparatus through an outlet.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In a method according to the invention for the absorption of a gas in a liquid or the desorption of a gas from a liquid, a gas is first directed co-currently with a liquid in a radially outward direction through a first rotating packed bed and the same gas is directed through a gas plenum to a second packed bed, from where it is directed in counter-current flow to a liquid in a radially inward direction through a second rotating packed bed.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The RPB according to the invention combines counter-current and co-current flow in one rotating packed bed apparatus. The invention utilizes the advantages of both co-current and counter-current flow processes and thereby allows an optimization of the process efficiency of the RPB.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The gas flowing co-currently with the liquid through the first packed bed in the radially outward direction is accelerated together with the liquid under the influence of centrifugal force. The subsequent pressure build-up is utilized to force the gas through the second packed bed overcoming the pressure losses incurred during the flue gas flow through the second bed. Energy to accelerate the gas through the packed bed in co-current direction with the liquid is recovered when it is forced through the second packed bed. Effectively, the operation of the rotating packed bed according to the invention requires less energy<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> compared to RPBs of the prior art operated only with counter-current flow of the gas and liquid.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The arrangement of two packed beds on one rotating shaft with a serial direction of the gas flow through both beds, allows the gas-liquid interaction, be it either an absorption or a desorption process, to take place on a larger scale, i.e. along a longer effective flow path. The actual dimension of the apparatus however, specifically the diameter of the RPB, can remain small. This feature allows greater flexibility in the design of the RPB. For example, the number of rotating packed beds arranged in series on a single shaft may be increased while keeping their diameters small. This enables a fabrication at both reduced effort and lower cost. Moreover, the reduced dimension of the apparatus allows an extended range of operation and application of the RPB.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The combination of two packed beds arranged for co-current flow combined with counter-current flow allows for several further possibilities of optimizing the apparatus and process efficiency. The combination of two beds allows the combination of different packing types, different relative packing sizes including radial heights, cross-sectional areas, and radial position of the individual packed beds.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Furthermore, the apparatus allows for different liquid-to-gas mass flows through two packed beds.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Finally, the apparatus allows for either the same or different liquids to be used for the two beds.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The number of parameters to influence the overall mass transfer coefficient of the RPB as a whole can be significantly increased compared to that of an RPB of the prior art. All the parameters are available for further optimization of process efficiency, cost, size, and manufacturability and thereby significantly increase the design flexibility available for the apparatus,</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In an exemplary embodiment of the apparatus, the first and second liquid inlets are configured for the same liquid to be directed through both packed beds. This means that the liquid directed through the first packed bed is recirculated and directed through the second bed as well. For this, the apparatus comprises means to direct the liquid exiting from the first packed bed from the outer radius of that packed bed to the second packed bed and at the rotating shaft.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In a particular embodiment, the inlet for the liquid through the second packed bed is<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> configured to direct a liquid of same type as was used for the first packed bed, where this liquid is however a fresh liquid and not recirculated from the first bed. Thereby, the overall efficiency of the separation or absorption process will be improved as the fresh solvent is used.. The direction of a fresh liquid through the second packed bed can offset the reduced separation efficiency achieved in the first packed bed due to the co-current flow of the liquid and gas.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In this case however, the first and second liquid inlets for first and second packed beds can be both connected to the same source of liquid.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In a further exemplary embodiment, the first and second liquid inlets are configured and arranged for two different liquids to flow through the two beds. These two liquids can differ either in their type or temperature.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">For example, the two liquid inlets can be connected each to different sources each containing a liquid of different composition.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In a variant, the liquid inlets are connected to liquid sources of different temperature. This allows a further possibility of fine-tuning the process efficiency.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In an exemplary embodiment, the liquid inlets for both the first and second packed beds are configured with means of liquid distributors such as spray nozzles or jets.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The RPB according to the invention is applicable to separation processes including absorption processes such as for example CO2 absorption from a flue gas resulting from a combustion process, desorption processes, gas stripping processes or deaeration processes such as deaeration of make-up water for a water-steam cycle of a power plant, or desulphurization.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In a particular embodiment of the invention, the RPB can be extended to any number of packed beds arranged on the same shaft in addition to the first and second beds described, where the gas is directed in series through each of the packed beds, consistently alternating from a co-current flow to a counter-flow and again to a co-current flow with the liquid. Such arrangement allows a yet higher degree of separation or absorption and the use of a larger variety of different packed bed parameters in combination and a greater degree of process optimization.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In a further embodiment of the invention, the gas inlet can be arranged at the peripheral plenum of the RPB between casing and outer radius of the first bed instead of at the shaft. The liquid inlets are still in the rotating shaft. In this configuration, the first packed<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> bed is operated in counter-current flow where the gas flows radially inward in counter-current flow to the liquid. The gas thereafter flows in co-current flow with the liquid through the second packed bed. The gas exits the apparatus through a gas outlet via a peripheral plenum between casing and outer radius of the second bed and through an gas outlet in the casing.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In all embodiments of the invention, the rotating shaft may be arranged either horizontally or vertically.</p><heading id="h0004">Brief Description of the Drawings</heading><p id="p0034" num="0034"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of a rotating packed bed according to the invention having two packed beds arranged in series.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> shows a rotating packed bed according to the invention extended to more than two packed beds.</li></ul></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Same numerals in the figures indicate same elements.</p><heading id="h0005">Best Modes for Carrying out the Invention</heading><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows a cross-section of a rotating packed bed 1 having a casing 10 and arranged on a horizontally aligned shaft 2 driven by a motor.

The gas to be processed is directed into the apparatus through the gas inlet G<sub>in</sub> and passes through the first packing 21 in co-current flow with the liquid, followed by a counter-current flow with a liquid through the second packing 22, again a co-current flow through the third packing 23 and a counter-current flow in the last packing 24 as indicated by the arrows within each of the packings 21-24. The liquid or liquids can be directed through one or more inlets L<sub>in</sub> at the rotating shaft and is or are directed via distributor means 5a' and 5b' to the surface of the packings 21-24. The example illustrates one of numerous design possibilities given by the concept according to the invention, where the number of the packings, packing types, and packing dimensions including the radial extents, inner and outer radii as well as the radial positions of the individual packings can be varied and optimized for a particular application or operation.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Reference numerals used in figures
