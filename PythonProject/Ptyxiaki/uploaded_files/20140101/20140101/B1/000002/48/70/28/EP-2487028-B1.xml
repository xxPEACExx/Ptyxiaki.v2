Therefore, it is required that a temperature of the exhaust pipe connected to an engine can be raised to the catalyst activation temperature in a short time from engine start.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For example, Patent Document 1 discloses an exhaust pipe provided with a can-type base material made of metal and a surface coating layer comprising a crystalline inorganic material and an amorphous binder material (amorphous inorganic material), which is formed on the peripheral face of the base material.<br/>

When as described above, the surface coating layer is exposed to a high-temperature in a conventional exhaust pipe described in Patent Document 1, the amorphous inorganic material composing the surface coating layer is softened. As a result of this, in a conventional exhaust pipe described in Patent Document 1, a problem that the surface coating layer is peeled off from the base material arises.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Moreover, a conventional exhaust pipe described in Patent Document 1 causes a problem that when the surface coating layer is exposed directly to high-temperature exhaust gases, the surface coating layer of the exhaust pipe is corroded by at least one of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulfur oxide (SOx) contained in the exhaust gases.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> The present invention was made to solve the above-mentioned problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a structured body excellent in heat resistance while securing heat insulating properties, and a method for manufacturing the structured body. Further, the structured body of the present invention is particularly suitable for the case where the structured body is used as an exhaust pipe.</p><heading id="h0006">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, the structured body according to claim 1 is a structured body including:
<ul><li>a base material made of metal; and</li><li>a surface coating layer formed on the surface of the base material,</li><li>wherein</li><li>the surface coating layer includes:
<ul><li>a first layer which is formed on the surface of the base material and contains an amorphous inorganic material; and</li><li>a second layer which is formed as an outermost layer of the surface coating layer and contains a crystalline inorganic material having a softening point of 950°C or higher,</li><li>said amorphous inorganic material contained in said first layer of the surface coating layer being a low melting point glass having a softening point of 300-1000°C, and</li><li>said crystalline inorganic material contained in said second layer of the surface coating layer being one of zirconia and alumina,</li><li>said second layer of the surface coating layer is formed by thermal spraying.</li></ul></li></ul></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the structured body according to claim 1, the surface coating layer is formed on the surface of the base material made of metal. As the surface coating layer, first, the first layer containing an amorphous inorganic material is formed on the surface of the base material. The thermal conductivity of the amorphous inorganic material composing the first layer of<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the surface coating layer is lower than that of the metal composing the base material. Accordingly, when the base material of the structured body is heated, a heat transfer rate of the base material is high, but a heat transfer rate, at which heat is transferred from the base material through the surface coating layer to the outside of the structured body, is low.<br/>
Accordingly, particularly in a low-temperature (approximately less than 500°C) region in which heat conduction largely contributes to heat transfer, heat is hardly released to the outside of the structured body. As a result of this, a temperature of the structured body can be quickly raised when the structured body is heated. Thus, the structured body according to claim 1 is excellent in heat insulating properties.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Moreover, in the structured body according to claim 1, the second layer containing a crystalline inorganic material having a softening point of 950[deg.]C or higher is formed as an outermost layer of the surface coating layer. Accordingly, even when the surface coating layer of the structured body is exposed to a high-temperature, the crystalline inorganic material existing in the outermost layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body hardly softens. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the surface coating layer from peeling from the base material made of metal. Thus, the structured body according to claim 1 is excellent in heat resistance.<br/>
As described above, since the structured body according to claim 1 is excellent in heat insulating properties and heat resistance, it can be suitably used, for example, as an exhaust pipe.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the structured body according to claim 1, the crystalline inorganic material contained in the second layer<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> of the surface coating layer is one of zirconia and alumina. Zirconia or alumina is a crystalline inorganic material having excellent heat resistance. Therefore, even when the surface coating layer of the structured body is exposed to a high-temperature, zirconia or alumina existing in the outermost layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body hardly softens, and therefore it is possible to prevent the surface coating layer from peeling from the base material made of metal.<br/>
Further, zirconia or alumina is also a crystalline inorganic material having excellent corrosion resistance.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> Therefore, when the surface coating layer of the structured body is exposed directly to high-temperature exhaust gases, it is possible to prevent the surface coating layer of the structured body from being corroded by at least one of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulfur oxide (SOx) contained in the exhaust gases. Further, if the surface coating layer of the structured body is composed of only a first layer, the surface coating layer causes a problem that foreign matters adhere to the surface coating layer in softening, leading to degradation of the surface coating layer, in addition to acid corrosion, but the above problems can be prevented by the second layer of the surface coating layer.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the structured body according to claim 3, a total thickness of the first layer and the second layer of the surface coating layer is 1 to 2000 μm.<br/>
When the total thickness of the first layer and the second layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body is 1 to 2000 μm, a heat insulating property of the structured body is excellent.<br/>
When the total thickness of the first layer and the second layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body is less than 1 μm, the structured body hardly ensures an adequate heat insulating property since the thickness of the surface coating layer is too small. Further, when the total thickness of the first layer and the second layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body is more than 2000 µm, the surface coating layer is vulnerable to a break since a degree of thermal impact to the surface coating layer increases.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the structured body according to claim 4, the thermal conductivity at room temperature of the first layer of the surface coating layer is 0.05 to 2 W/m·K.<br/>
When the thermal conductivity at room temperature of the first layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body is 0.05 to 2 W/m·K, a heat transfer rate, at which heat is<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> transferred to the outside of the structured body across the surface coating layer, can be slow. Consequently, the heat insulating properties of the structured body can be more enhanced.<br/>
It is technically difficult that the thermal conductivity at room temperature of the first layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body is brought into less than 0.05 W/m·K. Further, when the thermal conductivity at room temperature of the first layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body exceeds 2 W/m·K, the thermal conductivity of the first layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body is too large and therefore the structured body hardly ensures an adequate heat insulating property.<br/>
In addition, in the present specification, the room temperature refers to 25°C.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the structured body according to claim 5, the first layer of the surface coating layer further contains a crystalline inorganic material.<br/>
A thermal expansion coefficient of the crystalline inorganic material is low, and a thermal expansion coefficient of the amorphous inorganic material is high. Therefore, the thermal expansion coefficient of the first layer of the surface coating layer can be controlled by adjusting a mixing ratio between the crystalline inorganic material and the amorphous inorganic material. Accordingly, by approximating the thermal expansion coefficient of the first layer of the surface coating layer to that of the base material made of a metal, adhesion between the first layer of the surface coating layer and the base material made of a metal can be improved.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In the structured body according to claim 6, the crystalline inorganic material contained in the first layer of the surface coating layer is an oxide of at least one of aluminum, manganese, iron, copper, cobalt and chromium.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> -->Since a thermal expansion coefficient of the oxide of at least one of aluminum, manganese, iron, copper, cobalt and chromium described above is lower than a thermal expansion coefficient of the amorphous inorganic material, the thermal expansion coefficient of the first layer of the surface coating layer can be controlled by adjusting a mixing ratio between the above-mentioned oxide and the amorphous inorganic material. Accordingly, by approximating the thermal expansion coefficient of the first layer of the surface coating layer to that of the base material made of a metal, adhesion between the first layer of the surface coating layer and the base material made of a metal can be more improved.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the structured body according to claim 7, the base material is a tubiform.<br/>
Such a structured body can be used as an exhaust pipe.<br/>
In addition, in the present specification, the tubiform refers to a body in which a shape of a cross section perpendicular to its longitudinal direction is closed. Accordingly, in the present specification, the tubiform includes not only a body in which a shape of a cross section perpendicular to its longitudinal direction is round-shaped, but also bodies in which a shape of a cross section perpendicular to its longitudinal direction is elliptic or polygonal such as rectangular. That is, specific examples of the tubiform include a cylindrical body, an ellipsoid and a square-tube-shaped body.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the structured body according to claim 8, the surface coating layer is formed on an inner face of the tubiform.<br/>
When the structured body according to claim 8 is used as an exhaust pipe, the surface coating layer is exposed directly to the exhaust gases. Even in such a case, in the structured body according to claim 8, the crystalline inorganic material existing in the outermost layer of the surface coating layer<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> hardly softens, and therefore it is possible to prevent the surface coating layer from peeling from the base material made of metal.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the structured body according to claim 9, the surface coating layer is further formed on an outer face of the tubiform.<br/>
For example, by selecting the type of the crystalline inorganic material existing in the outermost layer of the surface coating layer formed on an outer face of the tubiform, the emissivity of the surface coating layer can be controlled. Specifically, in the structured body in which zirconia is used as the crystalline inorganic material existing in the outermost layer of the surface coating layer and stainless steel provided with an oxidized film formed on the surface is used as an metal composing the base material, the emissivity of the surface coating layer can be lower than that of the base material. Thus, when the surface coating layer is further formed on an outer face of the tubiform, heat dissipation to the outside of the structured body can be prevented. As a result of this, the heat insulating properties of the structured body in a low-temperature region can be enhanced.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the structured body according to claim 10, the surface coating layer further includes:
<ul><li>a third layer including inorganic fibers; and</li><li>a fourth layer containing an amorphous inorganic material,</li><li>the third layer is formed on the surface of the first layer, and</li><li>the fourth layer is formed between the third layer and the second layer.</li></ul>
The third layer of the surface coating layer has a very large porosity since it includes inorganic fibers. Accordingly, a thermal conductivity of the surface coating layer can be significantly decreased. As a result of this,<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> since a difference between the thermal conductivity of the surface coating layer and a thermal conductivity of the base material can be increased, the heat insulating properties of the structured body can be more improved.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the structured body according to claim 1, the above-mentioned second layer of the surface coating layer is formed by thermal spraying.<br/>
Thermal spraying is a method in which a material to be a coating is melted or softened by heating and formed into fine particles, and the fine particles are accelerated and sprayed onto the surface of an object to form a coating.<br/>
In the thermal spraying, it is thought that a coating of almost every material can be formed as long as the material is melted or softened by heating. Thus, the second layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body can be easily formed by thermal spraying.<br/>
Further, in the structured body, in which the second layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body is formed by thermal spraying, the first layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body can mitigate thermal stress generated in the second layer (thermal-sprayed layer) of the surface coating layer of the structured body in an environment in which thermal impact such as rapid temperature rise or rapid temperature drop is added to the structured body. The reason for this is likely that if the second layer of the surface coating layer, having heat resistance, is formed by thermal spraying, high-temperature and high-speed particles to become a thermal-sprayed layer impinge on the first layer of the surface coating layer containing an amorphous inorganic material, and the particles to become a thermal-sprayed layer are engaged in the first layer of the surface coating layer, and consequently the second layer of the surface coating layer can firmly adhere to the first layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body. Accordingly, in the structured body according to claim<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> 1, peeling of the surface coating layer due to thermal impact can be prevented.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The method for manufacturing a structured body according to claim 11 is a method for manufacturing the structured body according to any of claims 1 to 9, including processes of:
<ul><li>preparing a base material made of metal; and</li><li>forming a surface coating layer on the surface of the base material,</li><li>wherein</li><li>the process of forming the surface coating layer includes:
<ul><li>a process of forming a first layer of the surface coating layer, containing an amorphous inorganic material, on the surface of the base material; and</li><li>a process of forming a second layer of the surface coating layer, containing a crystalline inorganic material having a softening point of 950°C or higher, as an outermost layer of the surface coating layer, wherein</li><li>said amorphous inorganic material contained in said first layer of the surface coating layer is a low melting point glass having a softening point of 300-1000°C, and</li><li>said crystalline organic material contained in said second layer of the surface coating layer is one of zirconia and alumina, and</li><li>said second layer of the surface coating layer is formed by thermal spraying.</li></ul></li></ul>
In the method for manufacturing the structured body according to claim 11, a structured body excellent in heat resistance while securing heat insulating properties can be manufactured, as described in the structured body according to any of claims 1 to 9.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the method for manufacturing the structured body according to claim 12, the above-mentioned process of forming the surface coating layer further includes:

Further, if the second layer of the surface coating layer, having heat resistance, is formed by thermal spraying, high-temperature and high-speed particles to become a thermal-sprayed layer impinge on the first layer of the surface coating layer containing an amorphous inorganic material, and the particles to become a thermal-sprayed layer are engaged in the first layer of the surface coating layer, and consequently the second layer of the surface coating layer can firmly adhere to the first layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body. Accordingly, the first layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body can mitigate thermal stress generated in the second layer (thermal-sprayed layer) of the surface coating layer of the structured body in an environment in which thermal impact such as rapid temperature rise or rapid temperature drop is added to the structured body, and as a result of this, peeling of the surface coating layer due to thermal impact can be prevented.</p><heading id="h0007">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0025" num="0025"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view schematically showing an example of the structured body of the first embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 2 (a), 2 (b) and 2 (c)</figref> each are a cross-sectional view schematically showing another example of the structured body of the first embodiment of the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 2 (a), 2 (b) and 2(c)</figref> each are a cross-sectional view schematically showing another example of the structured body of the first embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 3 (a), 3(b) and 3 (c)</figref> each are a cross-sectional view schematically showing further example of the structured body of the first embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view schematically showing an example of the structured body of the second embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref> is an exploded perspective view schematically showing an automobile engine and an exhaust manifold connected to the automobile engine in relation to the structured body of the third embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6(a)</figref> is an A-A line cross-sectional view of an automobile engine and an exhaust manifold shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6(b)</figref> is a B-B line cross-sectional view of an exhaust manifold shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6(a)</figref>.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0008">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0026" num="0026">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described specifically.

Therefore, the thermal expansion coefficient of the first layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body can be controlled by adjusting a mixing ratio between the crystalline inorganic material and the amorphous inorganic material. On the other hand, among the materials composing the base material, a thermal expansion coefficient of stainless steel is 10x10<sup>-6</sup>/°C to 18x10<sup>-6</sup>/°C.

Specifically, for example, roughening processes such as sand blasting, etching, and high temperature oxidation may be performed. These processes may be used singly or in combination of two or more of them.<br/>
After the roughening process, a cleaning process may be further carried out.</p><heading id="h0011">(2) Process of Forming First Layer of Surface Coating Layer</heading><p id="p0056" num="0056">First, the crystalline inorganic material and amorphous<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> inorganic material are mixed to prepare a raw material composition for the first layer of the surface coating layer.<br/>
Specifically, for example, a powder of the crystalline inorganic material and a powder of the amorphous inorganic material are adjusted so as to have a predetermined particle size and particle shape, and the respective powders are dry-mixed at a predetermined rate to prepare a mixed powder. Water is added to the mixed powder, and the resulting mixture is wet-mixed with a ball mill to prepare a raw material composition for the first layer of the surface coating layer.<br/>
Here, a mixing ratio of the mixed powder to water is not particularly limited, but it is desired that the amount of water is about 100 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the mixed powder. The reason for this is that this mixing ratio yields viscosity suitable for application to the metal base material. Further, as required, the dispersion medium such as an organic solvent and the organic binder may be added to the raw material composition for the first layer of the surface coating layer.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Next, the surface of the metal base material is coated with the raw material composition for the first layer of the surface coating layer.<br/>
As a method of coating the base material with the raw material composition for the first layer of the surface coating layer, a method such as spray coating, electrostatic coating, ink-jet, transfer using a stamp or a roll, brush painting and electrodeposition coating may be used.<br/>
Or, the metal base material may be coated with the raw material composition for the first layer of the surface coating layer by immersing the metal base material in the raw material composition for the first layer of the surface coating layer.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Subsequently, the metal base material coated with the raw material composition for the first layer of the surface coating<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> layer is subjected to firing process.<br/>
Specifically, the metal base material coated with the raw material composition for the first layer of the surface coating layer is dried, and then fired by heating to form a first layer of the surface coating layer.<br/>
A temperature of the firing is desirably a softening point of the amorphous inorganic material or more, and desirably 700 to 1100°C, varying depending on the type of the amorphous inorganic material mixed. When the firing temperature is set at a temperature of a softening point of the amorphous inorganic material or more, the amorphous inorganic material can firmly adhere to the metal base material, and the first layer of the surface coating layer firmly adhering to the metal base material can be formed.</p><heading id="h0012">(3) Process of Forming Second Layer of Surface Coating Layer</heading><p id="p0059" num="0059">The second layer of the surface coating layer, containing a crystalline inorganic material having a softening point of 950°C or higher, is formed on the surface of the first layer of the surface coating layer which has been formed in the above process (2).<br/>
In the method for manufacturing a structured body of the first embodiment of the present invention, the second layer of the surface coating layer is formed by a thermal spraying method since by this method, formation of a layer is easy and adhesion between the first layer and the second layer of the surface coating layer is excellent. However, the second layer of the surface coating layer may be formed, for example, by an electron beam physical vapor deposition method other than the thermal spraying method.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">As the thermal spraying method, a method of plasma spraying, flame spraying, high speed flame spraying, vacuum spraying, arc spraying, wire spraying or explosion spraying can<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> be employed. Among these, plasma spraying which can form a coating excellent in heat resistance is preferred, and gas plasma spraying is more preferred.<br/>
In the methods using gas plasma spraying, the second layer of the surface coating layer is formed on the surface of the metal base material with the first layer of the surface coating layer formed on the metal base material by thermal-spraying a powder of the crystalline inorganic material composing the second layer of the surface coating layer by use of gas plasma of Ar-H<sub>2</sub> or the like.<br/>
When the second layer of the surface coating layer is formed by using gas plasma spraying, spraying conditions such as a spraying current, a spraying voltage, a spraying distance, a powder-supply rate, amounts of Ar/H<sub>2</sub> are appropriately selected in accordance with a temperature of the sprayed particle (particle of the melted or softened crystalline inorganic material) and a desired thickness of the second layer of the surface coating layer.<br/>
Further, when the second layer of the surface coating layer is formed by using gas plasma spraying, a temperature at the time when the sprayed particles adhere to the surface of the first layer of the surface coating layer is maintained at a softening point of the amorphous inorganic material composing the first layer of the surface coating layer, or more. Thereby, the high-temperature and high-speed sprayed particles to become a thermal-sprayed layer (second layer of the surface coating layer) impinge on the first layer, containing an amorphous inorganic material, of the surface coating layer, and the sprayed particles to become a thermal-sprayed layer are engaged in the first layer of the surface coating layer, and consequently the second layer of the surface coating layer can firmly adhere to the first layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In addition, when the second layer of the surface coating<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> layer is formed, it is more preferred to perform the thermal spraying with the amorphous inorganic material (glass, etc.) composing the first layer of the surface coating layer softened by heating the metal base material with the first layer of the surface coating layer formed on its surface. The reason for this is that by performing thermal spraying with the amorphous inorganic material composing the first layer of the surface coating layer softened, the sprayed particles to become a thermal-sprayed layer are more engaged in the first layer of the surface coating layer, and consequently the second layer of the surface coating layer can firmly adhere to the first layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">By the above procedure, a structured body 1B, which is an example of the structured body of the first embodiment of the present invention and is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2(a)</figref>, can be manufactured.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">In addition, when the structured body 1A shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is manufactured, the raw material composition for the first layer of the surface coating layer can be prepared in the same manner as in preparation of the raw material composition for the first layer of the surface coating layer described above except that the crystalline inorganic material is not added and dry mixing is not carried out.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Further, when the structured body 1C shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2(b)</figref> and the structured body 1D shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2 (c)</figref> are manufactured, as a method for forming pores in the first layer of the surface coating layer, a method, in which a pore-forming material, containing at least one of a pore-forming agent, a foaming agent, hollow fillers and inorganic fibers, is mixed in the raw material composition for the first layer of the surface coating layer to prepare a raw material composition for the first layer of the surface coating layer, can be used.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> -->Among these, the pore-forming agent is preferably used.<br/>
As the pore-forming agent, for example, balloons which are fine hollow spheres composed of oxide base ceramic, spheric acrylic particles, and graphite can be used.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Further, an example of a method for manufacturing the structured body, in which a base material is a tubiform and a surface coating layer is formed on the inner face of the tubiform like a structured body 1F shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3 (b)</figref>, will be described below.<br/>
First, as the metal base material, a first half-cut member and a second half-cut member obtained by cutting a tubiform in half are prepared. Next, the surface on a smaller area side of each of the first half-cut member and the second half-cut member is coated with the raw material composition for the first layer of the surface coating layer. Subsequently, the first half-cut member and the second half-cut member are subjected to a firing process to form a first layer of the surface coating layer on the surface of the first half-cut member and the second half-cut member, respectively. Then, with respect to the first half-cut member and the second half-cut member, a second layer of the surface coating layer, containing a crystalline inorganic material having a softening point of 950°C or higher, is formed on the surface of the first layer of the surface coating layer by using a method such as thermal spraying. Thereafter, the first half-cut member is joined to the second half-cut member by welding etc. to form a tubiform.<br/>
By the above procedure, a structured body, in which the metal base material is a tubiform and the surface coating layer is formed on an inner face of the tubiform, can be manufactured.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Moreover, when as with the structured body 1G shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3 (c)</figref>, a structured body, in which the metal base material is a tubiform and the surface coating layer is formed on an outer face of the tubiform, is manufactured, a can-type metal base<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> material may be employed as a metal base material, or the above-mentioned first half-cut member and second half-cut member may be employed.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Hereinafter, the effects of the structured body and the method for manufacturing the structured body of the first embodiment of the present invention will be enumerated.
<ol><li>(1) In the structured body of the present embodiment, the surface coating layer is formed on the surface of the base material made of metal. As the surface coating layer, first, the first layer containing an amorphous inorganic material is formed on the surface of the base material. The thermal conductivity of the amorphous inorganic material composing the first layer of the surface coating layer is lower than that of the metal composing the base material. Accordingly, when the base material of the structured body is heated, a heat transfer rate of the base material is high, but a heat transfer rate, at which heat is transferred from the base material through the surface coating layer to the outside of the structured body, is low.</li></ol>
Accordingly, particularly in a low-temperature (approximately less than 500°C) region in which heat conduction largely contributes to heat transfer, heat is hardly released to the outside of the structured body. As a result of this, a temperature of the structured body can be quickly raised when the structured body is heated. Thus, the structured body in the present embodiment is excellent in heat insulating properties.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068"><ul><li>(2) In the structured body in the present embodiment, as the surface coating layer, the second layer containing a crystalline inorganic material (crystalline inorganic material having a softening point of 950°C or higher) having a higher softening point than that of the amorphous inorganic material composing the first layer is formed as an outermost<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> layer of the surface coating layer. Accordingly, even when the surface coating layer of the structured body is exposed to a high-temperature, the crystalline inorganic material existing in the outermost layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body hardly softens. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the surface coating layer from peeling from the base material made of metal. Thus, the structured body in the present embodiment is excellent in heat resistance.</li></ul>
As described above, since the structured body in the present embodiment is excellent in heat insulating properties and heat resistance, it can be suitably used, for example, as an exhaust pipe.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069"><ul><li>(3) In the structured body in the present embodiment, the crystalline inorganic material contained in the second layer of the surface coating layer is zirconia or alumina.</li></ul>
Zirconia or alumina is a crystalline inorganic material having excellent heat resistance. Therefore, even when the surface coating layer of the structured body is exposed to a high-temperature, zirconia or alumina existing in the outermost layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body hardly softens, and therefore it is possible to prevent the surface coating layer from peeling from the base material made of metal.<br/>
Further, zirconia or alumina is also a crystalline inorganic material having excellent corrosion resistance. Therefore, when the surface coating layer of the structured body is exposed directly to high-temperature exhaust gases, it is possible to prevent the surface coating layer of the structured body from being corroded by at least one of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulfur oxide (SOx) contained in the exhaust gases. Further, if the surface coating layer of the structured body is composed of only a first layer, the surface coating layer causes a problem that foreign matters adhere to the surface coating layer in softening, leading to degradation of the surface coating layer, in addition to acid corrosion, but the above problems can be<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> prevented by the second layer of the surface coating layer.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070"><ul><li>(4) In the structured body in the present embodiment, the total thickness of the first layer and the second layer of the surface coating layer is 1 to 2000 μm.</li></ul>
When the total thickness of the first layer and the second layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body is 1 to 2000 μm, a heat insulating property of the structured body is excellent.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071"><ul><li>(5) In the structured body in the present embodiment, the thermal conductivity at room temperature of the first layer of the surface coating layer is 0.05 to 2 W/m·K.</li></ul>
When the thermal conductivity at room temperature of the first layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body is 0.05 to 2 W/m·K, a heat transfer rate, at which heat is transferred to the outside of the structured body across the surface coating layer, can be low. Consequently the heat insulating properties of the structured body can be more enhanced.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072"><ul><li>(6) In the method for manufacturing the structured body in the present embodiment, the above-mentioned second layer of the surface coating layer is formed by thermal spraying.</li></ul>
In the thermal spraying, it is thought that a coating of almost every material can be formed as long as the material is melted or softened by heating. Thus, the second layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body can be easily formed by thermal spraying.<br/>
Further, if the second layer of the surface coating layer, having heat resistance, is formed by thermal spraying, high-temperature and high-speed particles to become a thermal-sprayed layer impinge on the first layer coating layer, containing an amorphous inorganic material, of the surface, and the particles to become a thermal-sprayed layer are engaged in<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> the first layer of the surface coating layer, and consequently the second layer of the surface coating layer can firmly adhere to the first layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body. Accordingly, the first layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body can mitigate thermal stress generated in the second layer (thermal-sprayed layer) of the surface coating layer of the structured body in an environment in which thermal impact such as rapid temperature rise or rapid temperature drop is added to the structured body, and as a result of this, peeling of the surface coating layer due to thermal impact can be prevented.</p><heading id="h0013">(EXAMPLES)</heading><p id="p0073" num="0073">Hereinafter, examples in which the first embodiment of the present invention is more specifically disclosed will be described.

However, the surface coating layer may be formed only on a part of the inner face of the base material.<br/>
Further, in the structured body of the third embodiment of the present invention, the surface coating layer may be formed on the outer face in addition to the inner face, or may be formed only on the outer face.</p><p id="p0130" num="0130">An example of the exhaust manifold has been described as the structured body of the third embodiment of the present invention, but the application of the structured body of the third embodiment of the present invention is not limited to the exhaust manifold, and it can be suitably used as an exhaust pipe, a pipe composing the catalytic converter, a turbine housing or the like.</p><p id="p0131" num="0131">When the structured body of the third embodiment of the present invention is manufactured, it can be manufactured in the approximately same manner as in the structured body of the first embodiment or the second embodiment of the present invention except that the shape of the base material is different.<br/>
In addition, in the structured body of the third embodiment of the present invention, when the surface coating layer is formed on the inner face of the base material, as described in the first embodiment of the present invention, it is preferred to use the base material composed of the first half-cut member and the second half-cut member.<!-- EPO <DP n="63"> --></p><p id="p0132" num="0132">Also in the third embodiment of the present invention, the effects (1) to (6) described in the first embodiment of the present invention, and the effect (7) described in the second embodiment of the present invention can be exerted.</p><heading id="h0034">(Other Embodiment)</heading><p id="p0133" num="0133">In the structured body of the first embodiment of the present invention, the first layer of the surface coating layer is formed on the surface of the base material, and the second layer of the surface coating layer is formed on the surface of the first layer of the surface coating layer.

However, in the structured body of the present invention, a configuration between the first layer and the second layer of the surface coating layer is arbitrary as long as the first layer of the surface coating layer is formed on the surface of the base material and the second layer of the surface coating layer is formed as the outermost layer of the surface coating layer.<br/>
However, in the case where the structured body of the present invention is used as an exhaust pipe, when the surface coating layer is formed on an inner face of the tubiform, if many layers are present between the first layer and the second layer of the surface coating layer, a diameter of the exhaust pipe becomes small, and the exhaust gases become hard to pass.

When the mixed amount of the amorphous inorganic material contained in the first layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body is less than 50 wt%, since the amount of the amorphous inorganic material contributing to the adhesion between the surface coating layer and the base material of the structured body is too small, the surface coating layer tends to exfoliate in the structured body manufactured. On the other hand, when the mixed amount of the amorphous inorganic material contained in the first layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body exceeds 99.5 wt%, since the amount of the crystalline inorganic material is small, the adequate effect of improving the adhesion between the surface coating layer and the base material of the structured body is hardly achieved.<br/>

When the mixed amount of the crystalline inorganic material contained in the first layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body is less than 0.5 wt%, since the amount of the crystalline inorganic material contributing to the adhesion between the surface coating layer and the base material of the structured body is too small, the adequate effect of improving the adhesion between the surface coating layer and the base material of the structured body is hardly achieved. On the other hand, when the mixed amount of the crystalline inorganic material contained in the first layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body exceeds 50 wt%, the amount of the amorphous inorganic material contributing to the adhesion between the surface coating layer and the base material of the structured body is small, and the surface coating layer may exfoliate in the structured body manufactured.</p><p id="p0136" num="0136">Examples of the dispersion medium capable of being mixed in the raw material composition for the first layer of the surface coating layer, which is used in manufacturing the structured body of the present invention, include water and organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, acetone and the like.

The reason for this is that this mixing<!-- EPO <DP n="66"> --> ratio yields viscosity suitable for application to the base material.<br/>
Examples of the organic binder capable of being mixed in the raw material composition for the first layer of the surface coating layer include polyvinyl alcohol, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, and the like.

When the thickness of the base material of the structured<!-- EPO <DP n="67"> --> body is less than 0.2 mm, strength of the structured body is insufficient. When the thickness of the base material of the structured body is more than 10 mm, a weight of the structured body increases, and therefore it become difficult to mount the structured body on vehicles such as automobiles and the structured body is not suitable for practical use.</p><p id="p0140" num="0140">In the structured body of the present invention, the surface of the base material may be a roughened surface at which bumps and dips are formed.<br/>
In this case, the surface roughness Rz<sub>JIS</sub> of the roughened surface of the base material of the structured body is preferably 1.5 to 15 μm.<br/>
The surface roughness Rz<sub>JIS</sub> of the roughened surface of the base material of the structured body is ten-point mean roughness defined by JIS B 0601 (2001).<br/>
When the surface roughness Rz<sub>JIS</sub> of the roughened surface of the base material of the structured body is less than 1.5 μm, adequate adhesion between the base material and the surface coating layer is hardly attained since a surface area of the base material becomes small. On the other hand, when the surface roughness Rz<sub>JIS</sub> of the roughened surface of the base material of the structured body exceeds 15 μm, the surface coating layer is hardly formed on the surface of the base material. The reason for this is likely that if the surface roughness Rz<sub>JIS</sub> of the roughened surface of the base material of the structured body is too large, slurry (raw material composition for the first layer of the surface coating layer) does not penetrate into a valley portion of bumps and dips formed at the surface of the base material to produce voids there.<br/>
In addition, the surface roughness Rz<sub>JIS</sub> of the roughened surface of the base material of the structured body can be measured according to JIS B 0601 (2001) by use of HANDY SURF E-35B manufactured by Tokyo Seimitsu Co.., Ltd.</p><p id="p0141" num="0141"><!-- EPO <DP n="68"> --> In the structured body of the present invention, the surface coating layer does not necessarily have to be formed on the entire surface of the base material.<br/>

When the surface coating layer is formed on the inner face of the tubiform as a base material, the surface coating layer do not have to be formed on the entire inner face of the tubiform as a base material, and the surface coating layer may be formed on at least an area with which the exhaust gases contact directly.</p><p id="p0142" num="0142">In the structured body of the present invention, when the surface coating layer includes the third layer, a shape of a cross section of the inorganic fibers composing the third layer of the surface coating layer is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include a circular cross section, a planiform cross section, a hollow cross section, a polygonal cross section and a core-sheath cross section.

When an average fiber length of the inorganic fibers contained in the third layer of the surface coating layer of<!-- EPO <DP n="69"> --> the structured body is less than 0.1 mm, fibers hardly tangle with one another and mechanical strength of the resulting third layer of the surface coating layer tends to deteriorate. On the other hand, when an average fiber length of the inorganic fibers contained in the third layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body is more than 50 mm, the effect of reinforcing the surface coating layer is achieved, but the inorganic fibers cannot closely tangle with one another or single inorganic fibers alone curl, and thereby continuous cavity is easily produced, and therefore, heat insulating properties tend to deteriorate.</p><p id="p0144" num="0144">In the structured body of the present invention, when the surface coating layer includes the third layer, a desired lower limit of an average fiber diameter of the inorganic fibers composing the third layer of the surface coating layer is 1 μm, and a more desired lower limit is 2 μm.

When an average fiber diameter of the inorganic fibers contained in the third layer of the surface coating layer of the structured body is less than 1 μm, mechanical strength of the inorganic fibers theirself deteriorates.
