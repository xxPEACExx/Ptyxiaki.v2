For example, mouthguards act to prevent the teeth in the lower jaw from contacting the teeth in the upper jaw. This means that there is less likelihood of a tooth breaking, a tooth being knocked out, concussion, fracture of the jaw or damage to the soft tissue of the mouth when a force is applied to the lower facial area.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">One type of mouthguard is known as a "stock mouthguard". This type of mouthguard is supplied to the user in the form in which it is to be used. However, this means that the mouthguard is not suited to the shape of the user's mouth and may, for example, not cover all of the user's teeth.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Furthermore, in view of the bad fit between the mouthguard and the user's teeth it is usual for the mouthguard to not be retained by the user's teeth. This means that the mouthguard is loose and users may need to use their lower jaw, tongue or lips to hold the guard in place. This makes it more difficult for the user to speak and may possibly impair breathing.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to overcome these limitations so called "boil and bite" mouthguards are used in place of stock mouthguards. Boil and bite mouthguards are made from thermoplastic materials. On heating, often in boiling water, all or part of the mouthguard becomes soft and pliable. The mouthguard can then be inserted into user's mouth and pressure applied so that the material adapts to the shape of the user's teeth.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">"Boil and bite" mouthguards provide an improved fit over that of the stock mouthguards. However, one of the drawbacks of this type of mouthguard is that thinning of the base of the mouthguard, which covers the occlusal surface of the teeth, can occur due to a user exerting excess pressure on the mouthguard during moulding i.e. biting too hard on the mouthguard. This reduces the amount of protection that the mouthguard is capable of providing.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The most effective mouthguards are custom mouthguards which are made individually for each user. Custom mouthguards are made by taking an impression of the user's teeth which can then be used to form a cast of the user's mouth's hard and soft tissues. The custom mouthguard is then fabricated, often in a laboratory, onto the cast of the user's mouth. The use of a cast ensures the mouthguard accurately fits over the user's mouth.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Furthermore, as the mouthguard is not formed by a user biting down on the material of the mouthguard the base of the mouthguard which is formed over the occlusal surface of the teeth does not become thinned. However, these mouthguards are expensive and it is therefore advantageous to make a "boil and bite" mouthguard which has many of the attributes of a custom made mouthguard.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">One method that has been used to attempt to reduce thinning of the base of a boil and bite mouthguard is the use of multiple plastics within the mouthguard. One example of such a mouthguard incorporates a harder plastic material into the base of the mouthguard. The "harder" plastic material does not deform at the temperature the mouthguard is heated to during fitting; thus, the base of the mouthguard is at least as thick as the thermosetting plastic insert and a minimum depth of the base is ensured. Another method, such as that described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE19844628"><text>DE19844628</text></patcit> is to provide a mouthguard having sufficient material between the teeth of the upper and lower jaw to prevent bite through (column 5 lines 12 to 14).<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Although the inclusion of the harder plastic material acts to reduce thinning of the mouthguard's base, the presence of the harder plastic material also reduces the effectiveness of the mouthguard. In particular, the harder plastic material will be less effective at distributing forces than the "softer" material the mouthguard is made from. Thus, any external forces applied to the mouthguard are transmitted in greater amounts to the teeth of the user which is undesirable.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to an aspect of the invention there is provided an apparatus as recited in claim 1. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a mouthguard as recited in claim 11.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The apparatus may comprise: a mouthguard including: a base, an inner wall extending from the outer side of the base, and an outer wall extending from the inner side of the base; the apparatus also comprising a tool made from a material which is resilient at a temperature when the mouthguard is malleable, wherein the base of the mouthguard includes at least one receiving means arranged to receive at least part of a tool. By having a tool which is resilient to changes in shape while the mouthguard is malleable a user can bite down on the mouthguard and have their jaw only able to close a predetermined depth (equal to the depth of the tool). Thus, the depth of at least a part of the base is guaranteed to be at least the depth of the tool.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The receiving means may be a recess in the bottom surface of the base of the mouthguard. Alternatively, the receiving means includes a cavity configured to receive a portion of the tool within the base. The receiving means may, further, be a combination of one or more recesses and one or more cavities.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Optionally, the cavity may be arranged to hold the portion of the tool in frictional engagement with the mouthguard. The cavity may extend through the mouthguard between the outer wall and the inner wall.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Preferably, the tool is made from thermosetting plastic.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The tool may include an elongated handle suitable for user manipulation of the tool and may include a projection configured to be received by the recess or the cavity. Preferably, the projection is configured to be held in frictional engagement by the cavity.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The tool may also include a stopping means configured to abut the outer wall of the mouthguard when the tool is engaged with the mouthguard.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The mouthguard may comprise a base, an inner wall extending from the outer side of the base and an outer wall extending from the inner side of the base wherein the base includes at least one receiving means arranged to receive at least part of a tool; the tool being made from a material which is resilient at a temperature when the mouthguard is malleable.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The receiving means may be a recess in the bottom surface of the base of the mouthguard. Alternatively, the receiving means includes a cavity configured to receive a portion of the tool within the base.

The cavity may extend through the mouthguard between the outer wall and the inner wall.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of fitting a mouthguard to a user's mouth comprising the steps of:
<ol><li>i) heating a mouthguard,</li><li>ii) removably engaging a tool with the mouthguard,</li><li>iii) inserting the mouthguard and tool into the user's mouth,</li><li>iv) instructing the user to bite down on the mouthguard,</li><li>v) removing the mouthguard and tool from the user's mouth,</li><li>vi) allowing the mouthguard to cool, and</li><li>vii) removing the tool from engagement with the mouthguard,</li></ol>
wherein steps i) and ii) are carried out prior to steps iii) and iv) and steps v), vi) and vii) are carried out after steps iii) and iv). As will be understood by the skilled person steps i) and ii) and steps vi) and vii), at least, are interchangeable.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Other aspects and features of the present invention will become apparent to those ordinarily skilled in the art upon review of the following description of specific embodiments of the invention in conjunction with the accompanying figures.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:-
<ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> illustrates a front view of the mouthguard of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref> is a birds-eye view of the mouthguard;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> illustrates a side view of the mouthguard;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref> is a birds-eye view of the tool of the present invention; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref> illustrates a side view of the tool.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">Figures 1 to 3</figref> illustrate a mouthguard 10 according to the present invention. The mouthguard is generally U-shaped is provided with a base 12 from which an inner wall 14 and an outer wall 16 extend. The base 12 is designed to be adjacent to the occlusal surface of the teeth when the mouthguard 10 is in use. The inner wall 14 is adjacent to the palatal surface of the teeth. The outer wall 16 is adjacent to the buccal surface of the teeth and can be seen when the mouthguard 10 is in use.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The base 12 of the mouthguard 10 is provided with a cavity 18 which extends into the base 12 from the outer wall 16 of the mouthguard 10. The cavity 18 is configured to receive part of a tool (illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 4 and 5</figref>) and hold it in frictional engagement.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The base 12 is further provided with two recesses 20, 22 or indentations which also traverse from the outer wall 16 to the inner wall 14 of the mouthguard 10. The recesses 20, 22 are portions of the bottom wall of the base 12 that are in a different plane to the rest of the base 12. Preferably, the difference between the two planes is equal to the depth of the parts of the tool received in the recesses 20 and 22. This means that when the tool is engaged with the mouthguard 10 the parts of the tool placed within the recesses have a bottom wall in the same plane as the bottom wall of the base 12 of the mouthguard 10.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The mouthguard 10 is preferably formed from a thermoplastics material which becomes ductile and malleable when heated.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 4 and 5</figref> illustrate a tool 30 in accordance with the present invention. The tool 30 is generally trident shaped and has a head 32 for engagement with the mouthguard 10 and an elongate handle 34.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The head 32 of the tool 30 has three protrusions 36, 38 and 40. The central protrusion 38 is adapted to form a frictional engagement with the cavity 18 of the mouthguard 10 to hold the tool 30 in engagement with the mouthguard 10. The two outer protrusions 36, 40 have a length corresponding to the width of the recesses 20, 22 of the mouthguard 10. Additionally, as discussed previously, the depth of the outer protrusions 36 and 42 substantially corresponds to the depth of the recesses 22 and 24 in the base 12 of the mouthguard 10.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Thus, when the mouthguard 10 and tool 30 are engaged and bitten down upon during the process of moulding the mouthguard the user's jaw is never able to come closer together than the depth of the protrusions 36 and 40 of the tool 30. In this way, the reduction in the depth of the base 13 of the mouthguard is minimised; the depth of the base being at least the depth of the protrusions 36 and 40 of the tool 30 in the parts of the base 12 where the recesses and cavities are not present.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The head 31 of the tool 30 is preferably provided with a ridged stop 42 which contacts the outer wall 16 of the mouthguard 10 when the protrusions 36, 38 and 40 have been fully engaged in the correct positions with the cavity 18 and recesses 20 and 22. The ridged stop 42 minimises the opportunities for a user to mis-site the tool on the mouthguard 10. Although the ridged stop is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 4 and 5</figref> as a single raised portion the skilled person will understand that it may be formed from several separate raised portions or a single portion which does not extend along the entire width of the head 32 of the tool 30.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Preferably, the tool 30 is formed from a harder plastics material. For the purposes of this application the term "harder plastics material" defines a plastics material which retains its shape at a temperature where the material of the mouthguard is malleable. This harder plastics material may, for example, be a thermosetting plastic. This means that if the tool 30 is heated along with the mouthguard 32, the tool 30 does not become deformable or malleable. Alternatively, the tool 30 may be made from any suitable material with a deformation temperature greater than the deformation temperature of the material forming the mouthguard 10. The deformation temperature being the temperature at which a material exhibits ductile properties.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">One method of moulding a mouthguard 10 of the present invention will now be described with reference to the Figures. Before heating the mouthguard 10, the tool 30 is removably engaged with the mouthguard 10. The central protrusion 38 is frictionally engaged with the cavity 18 and the two outer protrusions 36 and 40 are received within the recesses 20 and 22 of the mouthguard 10.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The mouthguard 10 is then heated, typically heated by being placed in boiling water, until it has the required amount of ductility. Once it has the desired amount of ductility, the mouthguard 10, with the tool 30 still engaged, is placed in a user's<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> mouth and bitten down on. The presence of the tool's projections in the recesses stops the users jaw from fully closing; thus, preventing the user from reducing the depth of the base 12 of the mouthguard 10. The depth of the base 12 of the mouthguard 10 will therefore always be at least the depth of the tool 30.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">As will be understood by the skilled person, the mouthguard may comprise any number and combination of cavities and recesses. For example, it may be provided with a single recess in the centre of the mouthguard or two recesses with no cavity. In an alternative embodiment the mouthguard may not be provided with any recesses but be provided with one or more cavities, each cavity operable to receive a projection from the tool.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Furthermore, the recesses and/or the cavity may extend only partially into the base of the mouthguard or project completely between the outer wall and the inner wall. However, the projection(s) should extend sufficiently between the outer wall and the inner wall that they prevent closure of a jaw when a mouthguard with the tool engaged is bitten into. The exact length of the extension of the projection(s) will depend on the placement of the projection(s) in the user's mouth. The length of the projections will be smaller if the projection(s) extends between the rear teeth as there is less of a gap between the upper and lower teeth at the rear of the mouth; conversely the length of the projections will be greater if the projections are situated to prevent closure of the front teeth as there is a greater gap between the upper and lower teeth at the front of the mouth.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Optionally, the recesses and projections may not be equal depths but may be of different depths. For example, the depth of the projections may be less than the depth of the recesses such that some indentation is made by the lower teeth into the base of the mouthguard. Preferably the projections have a depth of 0.5 to 1 mm less than the recesses. Alternatively, it may be advantageous to have the depth of the projections greater than those of the recesses.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56978522" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Vorrichtung, die Folgendes umfasst:
