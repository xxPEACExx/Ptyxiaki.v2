For instance, surfaces of a part are sometimes measured utilizing Photogrammetry. The Photogrammetry process may allow large surfaces to be measured in a timely manner. However, Photogrammetry processes may not have the desired precision, particularly over large areas. Laser tracking processes are also sometimes used to measure surfaces of a part. The laser tracking process may allow precision surface measurements. However, laser tracking processes may take substantial time, particularly when measuring many points on large surfaces areas, and/or may have other problems.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">A surface measuring process is needed which may allow the measurement of a large number of points over a large surface with great precision and sufficient speed to meet production requirements.

The targets 20 may be installed into the holes utilizing a snap-fit or other installation mechanism or device known in the art. Each of the thirty-two targets 20 may have reflectors (not shown) which are adapted to reflect Photogrammetry light beams, and separate reflectors (not shown) which are adapted to reflect lasers emitted from laser tracking devices.

The Photogrammetry devices 22 may comprise one or more V-Star cameras, available from Geodetic Systems, Inc. of Melbourne, Florida, U.S.A. In one embodiment, two V-Star cameras may be utilized. In other<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> embodiments, any number or type of Photogrammetry devices may be utilized. The substantial simultaneous measurements of a portion of the mandrel 100 is indicated by step S102 in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 8</figref>.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In order to measure the entire outer surface 26 of the mandrel assembly 10, various portions of each mandrel section 12 may be measured separately (step S104). By rotating the mandrel assembly 10 (step 106) a predetermined angle a predetermined number of times, the entire outer surface 26 of the mandrel assembly 10 may be measured. In one embodiment, the mandrel assembly 10 may be twenty-four feet long. A twenty-four foot long rectangular frame 27, containing ten additional targets 28 distributed around the frame 27, may be placed in close proximity to a portion of one 30 of the mandrel sections 12. One laser tracker 24 may be placed nearby the mandrel assembly 10. Two Photogrammetry devices 22, which may comprise two linked V-Star cameras, may be joined to a Pro-Spot light projector 34, available from Geodetic Systems, Inc., of Melbourne, Florida, U.S.A., and to a track 36 extending along a length of the mandrel assembly 10.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The laser tracker 24 may simultaneously measure the locations of three targets 38 at the forward portion of the mandrel section 30 being measured, the locations of three targets 40 at the aft portion of the mandrel section 30 being measured, and the locations of the ten targets 28 distributed around the frame 27. Simultaneously, the Pro-Spot projector 34 may emit one or more light beams defined by hundreds of dots onto an eight-foot long portion 42 of the surface 44 of the mandrel section 30 covered by the frame 27. The two linked V-Star cameras 22 may take a combined digital photograph covering a six-foot long area 46 within the frame 27. The combined digital photograph may show the positioning of the hundreds of dots on the surface of the mandrel section. As such, the position of the light beams emitted by the Pro-Spot projector 34 may be measured utilizing Photogrammetry.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The digital Photogrammetry photograph, in conjunction with the laser tracker measurements of the targets 20, may allow a determination to be made as to the surface measurements in X, Y, and/or Z planes of the portion of the mandrel section within the digital photograph. The Pro-Spot projector 34 and the two linked V-Star cameras 22 may move in six foot increments horizontally along the track 36, in order to take three more digital photographs which may cover the length of the mandrel section 30. The mandrel assembly 10 may be rotated, for example, with a repositioning tool 106 (see <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref>), a total of ten times in thirty-six degree increments in order to take a total of forty digital photographs of the entire outer surface 26 of the mandrel assembly 10. In such manner, measurements, in X, Y, and/or Z planes, of the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> entire outer surface of the mandrel assembly may be determined utilizing Photogrammetry.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">After, or during, each of the ten rotations of the mandrel assembly 10, the laser tracker 24 may simultaneously measure the locations of the ten targets 28 distributed along the frame 27 in addition to the locations of the six targets 38 and 40 located at the forward and aft portions of each respective mandrel section. In such manner, by rotating the mandrel assembly 10 a total of ten times in thirty-six degree increments, measurements of the locations of each of the targets distributed around the entire outer surface of the mandrel assembly may be determined utilizing laser tracking.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The Photogrammetry and laser tracking measurements of the locations of the targets 20 and of the outer surface 26 of the mandrel assembly 10 may be integrated together utilizing one or more computers. The computers may be described as a single functional block "computer" or "computer section" as indicated by reference numeral 102 in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref>. On or more output devices 103 may be provided in communication with the computer section 102. In one embodiment, the location measurements in the X, Y, and/or Z planes taken by the laser tracker may be downloaded from the laser tracker computer 102 to a Photogrammetry computer 102, which may combine the data into one or more combined measurements. The laser tracker computer 102 may be a spatial analyzer lap-top and the Photogrammetry computer may be a V-Stars Photogrammetry lap-top, available from Geodetic Systems, Inc., of Melbourne, Florida, U.S.A. The Photogrammetry measurements (also referred to as point-cloud) may be transformed to the laser tracking measurements to determine a more accurate, and/or more efficient combined measurement of the outer surface 26 of the mandrel assembly 10.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">One or more software programs may be utilized by computer 102 to create a three-dimensional computer generated image of the outer surface 26 of the mandrel assembly 10. By utilizing Photogrammetry and laser tracking devices simultaneously, relatively quick and accurate measurements of the mandrel assembly's outer surface 26 may be determined. In many embodiments, the entire outer surface 26 of the mandrel assembly 10 may be measured in, for example, approximately fifty minutes, comprising approximately five minutes per each of the ten mandrel sections. In other embodiments, the measurement process may take less than an hour, or a differing amount of time, and may follow differing steps in order to measure the outer surface 26 of the mandrel assembly 10 simultaneously utilizing both Photogrammetry and laser tracking.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, after measuring the outer surface 26 of the mandrel assembly 10, the targets 20 may be removed from the forward and aft mandrel holes 14 and 18. A fiber<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> placement lay-up machine 104 may be used to distribute curing material around the outer surface 26 of the mandrel assembly 10. The mandrel assembly 10 may be inserted into an auto-clave to cure the material around the outer surface 26 of the mandrel assembly 10 in order to manufacture a barrel. The lay-up and curing process is indicated by step S108 in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 8</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> depicts a fully-cured barrel 50 disposed over the outer surface 26 of the mandrel assembly 10 which may be produced after removing the mandrel assembly 10 from the auto-clave.

In one embodiment, the barrel 50 may be rotated (step S116) thirty-six degrees ten separate times to fully measure the outer surface 52 of the barrel 50. At each rotated position, four digital Photogrammetry photographs may be taken incrementally along the length of the barrel 50 utilizing two V-Star cameras 22, the Pro-Spot light projector 34, the frame 27, and the track 36, all working in conjunction with each other as previously described in the discussion of the mandrel assembly 10 measurement process. In one embodiment where the barrel is twenty-four feet long, four digital Photogrammetry photographs may be taken with each photograph covering a distance of approximately six to eight feet of the length of the barrel 50.
