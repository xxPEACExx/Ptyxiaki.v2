Invention</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventionally, aromatic diamine compounds are widely used as raw materials for functional high molecular weight materials such as bismaleimide, polyimide and thermosetting epoxy resins. In recent years, higher performance has been required in these fields so that higher physical properties have been more and more required as functional high molecular weight materials. As such physical properties, for example, heat resistance, weather resistance, chemical resistance, low water absorption properties, high fracture toughness, low dielectric constant, low dielectric loss tangent, moldability, flexibility, dispersibility in solvent and adhesive properties are required.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the fields of information communications and calculators, for example, the signal band of information communication apparatus such as PHS and mobile phones and the CPU clock time of computers reach the GHz band. For inhibiting electric signals from damping because of insulators, a material having a small dielectric constant and a small dielectric loss tangent is desired for the insulators.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the fields of printed wiring boards and semiconductor packages, for example, a temperature at soldering<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> increases because of the recent introduction of lead-free solders. Therefore, high heat resistance, low water absorption properties, etc. are necessary to constituent materials of printed wiring boards, semiconductor packages or electronic parts for securing higher soldering reliability.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Further, the aromatic diamine compounds are used in the form of varnishes in these electronic material applications in most cases so that excellent solubility in solvent is desired in view of workability.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A variety of aromatic diamines and aromatic dinitro compounds, which are raw materials for the aromatic diamines, have been proposed for coping with these requirements. For example, aromatic diamines having fluorine atoms give high molecular weight materials having a low dielectric constant and a low dielectric loss tangent. However, the aromatic diamines having fluorine atoms have a problem about a decrease in heat resistance. It is known that aromatic diamines having fluorene skeleton give high molecular weight materials having a low dielectric constant and high heat resistance. However, a problem is that workability such as solubility in solvent is poor (for example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP10152559A"><text>JP-A-10-152559</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is thought that development of an aromatic diamine compound which has an oligomer structure and is excellent in low dielectric characteristics, heat resistance, low water absorption properties and solubility in solvent can cope with the above requirements about properties.
