load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to semiconductor pixel arrays for use in image sensors and, in particular, image sensors which are suitable for Time Delay Integration (TDI) operation.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Solid-state detectors such as charge coupled devices (CCD) or CMOS Active Pixel Sensors are widely used in a variety of imaging applications. Typically, the sampling elements (pixels) are arranged in rows and columns to convert the electromagnetic radiation from a scene into charges that are converted into electrical signals. A linear array consists of only one row of pixels (one dimensional, 1D) while an area array consists of an array of pixels with multiple rows and columns (two dimensional, 2D).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A 2D array is typically used to image a two dimensional scene. This scene should in general be fixed during the period the pixels integrate (accumulate/collect) the photo-generated charges (integration period). If the scene is moving with respect to the detector and the corresponding movement during the integration period on the detector is considerable with respect to the pixel pitch, the resulting image will be blurred. In many imaging applications the image scene moves relative to the detector with a constant or predictable velocity. For example, a stationary camera placed above, or adjacent to, a conveyor belt can image the objects on the conveyor belt. This principle can be generally used in machine vision applications, as well as fax machines, document copiers and similar machines. Another well known application is pushbroom imaging from a satellite or aircraft where the camera images the ground scene. In such cases, a 1D array can be used to generate 2D images by repeatedly exposing and integrating on the single row of pixels while moving the detector in a direction orthogonal to the long dimension of the array. The direction of the motion is called 'along-track', while the direction orthogonal to this motion direction is called 'across-track'. One significant problem of the scanned reading mode is that - because of the relative motion - the exposure time for each image 'slice' is limited, restricting the image performance in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In line scan applications where the light level is low, or where the relative speed of the movement is large, Time Delay Integration (TDI) image sensors are useful. In a TDI sensor a 2D pixel array is used. The pixel signals delivered by the pixels of the same column (along-track direction) are in that case adequately delayed and added synchronously with the optical scanning. Thus, the light from a given point in the scene impinges successively on each pixel of the given corresponding column. As the light of the scene impinges on each row in succession, the signals from each of the rows are added to increase the final SNR. A simple example of the TDI principle is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. A 1D image sensor comprising a column of pixels (Pixel 1, pixel 2, pixel 3) 20 is shown. A subject 22 is moved past the image sensor 20 in the direction 21. Five separate integration periods are shown. During the first integration period, the first element of subject 22 is detected by pixel 1 of the sensor 20 and stored in a first storage device of processing circuitry 24, which can be located on or off-chip. During the second integration period, the first element of subject 22 is detected by pixel 2 of the sensor 20 and is summed (integrated) with the previously stored copy of the same element in the first storage device of processing circuitry 24 (which now shows a count of "2"). In addition, the second element of subject 22 is detected by pixel 2 of the sensor 20 and is stored in a second storage device of processing circuitry 24. The process continues over subsequent integration periods, with each storage device in processing circuitry 24 accumulating multiple detected copies of the same elements of subject 22.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The TDI principle has typically been addressed with CCD sensors where the TDI functionality is more or less intrinsically available by shifting the charge packets along the CCD synchronously with the moving image. This addition process is in a CCD also nearly noise free. This is not so easily implemented in CMOS APS. However, there are compelling reasons to implement this functionality in CMOS because of the advantages of process accessibility, reduced cost, additional circuit functionality on-chip, simpler system design etc.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Attempts at performing TDI in non-CCD image sensors are described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6906749B"><text>US 6,906,749</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP1667428A2"><text>EP 1 667 428 A2</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5828408A"><text>US 5,828,408</text></patcit>. A CMOS TDI sensor implementation having active pixels with snapshot shutter capability has been described by <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Pain et al. ("CMOS Image Sensors Capable of Time-Delayed Integration," NASA Tech Brief Vol. 25, No. 4</text></nplcit>) and in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US7268814B"><text>US 7,268,814</text></patcit>. The snapshot shutter capability means that all pixels start and stop their integration period<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> simultaneously. As a ground pixel moves its focus from pixel to pixel along the column of the APS array, the signal from this ground pixel is multiply sampled, and each sample is integrated onto the storage capacitor on one integrator in the integrator array. Since the ground pixel moves from pixel to pixel in the imaging array, the TDI imager must continually keep track of which pixel's output is added to which integrator. After a given ground pixel has moved through all rows, the output of the corresponding integrator is sent to the ADC for digitization, and the integrator is reset so that it can begin the integration of the new ground pixel that moves into the field of view. Of course, all pixels in the column must be connected in turn to the appropriate integrators in the time it takes for a ground pixel to move from one imager pixel to the next. The signal is dumped in a snapshot mode that eliminates motion artefacts that would otherwise be caused by the fact that each imager pixel is addressed at a slightly different time. The drawback of implementing a snapshot shutter pixel is that it requires more circuitry in the pixel, thereby lowering the fill factor and or quantum efficiency. A snapshot shutter pixel requires an additional sample-and-hold stage in the pixel to memorise the pixel signal before being readout. Another possible drawback is that the stored signal is unintentionally still affected by light (parasitic light sensitivity, shutter efficiency). It is possible to avoid the need for a global shutter for the pixels of the array, which avoids the need to perform in-pixel sampling of the signal. In-pixel sampling of the signal requires sample-and-hold circuitry in the pixel, which reduces the fill factor and thus light sensitivity of the pixel. Also, the global shutter is typically not perfect, i.e. the sampled signal is still slightly light sensitive. This can introduce a further reduction of modulation transfer function (MTF), which is a measure of sharpness, and may result in a degradation of the SNR.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Lepage G. et al, "CMOS long linear array for space application", Sensors, Cameras and Systems for Scientific/Industrial Applications VII, Proceedings of SPIE-IS&amp;T Electronic Imaging, Vol. 6068, 1 January 2006, pages 606807-1</text></nplcit>, XP007912764, describes a CMOS linear array which can operate in a TDI mode, optionally applying a rolling shutter mode.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention seeks to provide an alternative imaging device suitable for performing Time Delay Integration (TDI).</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">A first aspect of the present invention provides an imaging device according to claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The integration period start time of each column of the array can be offset from an integration period start time of any other column of the array, i.e. each column has a different integration period start time and a different integration period stop time from any other column of the array.

The image sensor comprises a two-dimensional array of pixels 30. The pixels 30 of the array 30 are arranged in columns (column 1...column N). The array is intended to image a subject 28. There is relative movement between the subject 28 and the array in a direction 22. The relative movement can result from: a movable subject (e.g. conveyor belt, document) drawn past a fixed array; a mobile array moved across a static subject; or a mobile array moved across a movable subject. Each column has a longitudinal axis 31 which is aligned with the direction 22 of relative movement (called the "along track" direction). In this embodiment, pixels of the array are arranged in rows, each with a longitudinal axis 32 which is orthogonal to the longitudinal axis 31 of the columns of pixels. The longitudinal axis 32 of the rows are also parallel to the "across track" direction of the subject 28. Each row of pixels in the array has a dedicated readout bus 33. In <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>, there are four rows of pixels and four readout buses. Control lines (marked "select" in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>) selectively activate a column of pixels and cause pixels in that column to be connected to the readout bus. Each readout bus 33 is connected to an amplifier 35 and the output of the amplifier is selectively connectable by a switch 36 to an output bus 37. A further output amplifier 38 is also shown. <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 3 and 4</figref> show examples of pixels 30 that can be used in the array. <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> shows a conventional three transistor (3T) Active Pixel Sensor (APS) and <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref> shows a four transistor (4T) floating diffusion or pinned diode pixel in which charge is selectively transferred to a floating diffusion node of the pixel. The operation of both of these types of pixel is well known. Each pixel connects to the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> "select", "reset", "transfer" and readout buses 33 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>. The invention is not limited to these types of pixel. Indeed, the invention is also applicable to passive pixels which do not include a buffer amplifier within each pixel.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The photodiode, or pinned photodiode, in each pixel of the array is exposed to radiation for an integration period, during which charge is generated and is integrated in the pixel. The precise operation differs for each type of pixel. For a 3T APS, generated charge accumulates on the gate of the source-follower/buffer amplifier M1. For a 4T pixel, generated charge accumulates on the source of the transfer transistor and is transferred to the gate of the source-follower after integration. The integration period is controlled by the RESET and TRANSFER control signals, in a known way. A rolling shutter is provided across the array, i.e. in the "across track" direction, of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 5</figref> shows control circuitry for the array of pixels 30. A controller 34 comprises line drivers for outputting signals "SELECT", "RESET" and (in the case of a 4T or similar pixel) "TRANSFER". Controller 34 controls the times at which the "RESET" and "TRANSFER" signals are generated which, in turn, controls the integration period and integration period start and stop times. Controller 34 controls the times at which the "SELECT" signals are generated to read the sample values of each pixel. Output processing circuitry 39 includes the functions previously described in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>. Controller 34 controls operation of output processing circuitry 39 via signal 50. This control includes operation of switches 36, 136 to transfer sample values held in sample-and-hold circuits 35, 135 to output bus 37, 137 in a time-multiplexed manner.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The controller 34 implements a "rolling shutter" which will now be described. Each column of pixels is integrated synchronously. Each column of pixels simultaneously experiences the same integration period (also known as an "exposure period"), with the start time and the end time of the integration period being the same for each pixel in the column of pixels. The duration of the integration period of each column is equal, but the start of the integration periods of different columns are offset from one another.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 6</figref> shows the integration periods for the array of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>. Firstly, the integration (exposure) period of column 1 begins at time t1. After a short delay, the integration period of column 2 begins at time t2. This continues for each of the N columns. The integration period of column 1 ends at time t3. After a short delay to<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> read and reset the pixels of that column, a new integration period for column 1 begins at time t4. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 6</figref> clearly shows that the length of the integration period is equal for each column of the array. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 6</figref> also shows that the integration period for column N begins before the integration period for column 1 has ended (assuming that integration happens with almost 100% duty cycle). All columns are read out in a period smaller than, or equal to, the time the scene has moved over a distance according to the reference TDI sampling distance in the "along track" direction 21 (ground sampling distance (GSD)). In general, it is typically required to synchronise the integration periods with the relative movement so that pixels in the "along track" direction sequentially sample the same scene information, although this is not essential.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The process described here will result in an image with a non-orthogonal coordinate system and the image has thus the form of a parallelogram, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref>. This is not an issue in many applications.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The process of reading the array of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref> is shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 8</figref>. At the end of an integration period for a column of pixels (e.g. at time t3 for column 1 in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 6</figref>) the column of pixels are read. This process is shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 8</figref>. The column of pixels is selected, by raising the "select" control signal to those pixels, and the value of each pixel is applied to the respective readout bus. The column of pixels are read in parallel. Amplifier 35 at the end of each readout bus 33 performs a sample-and-hold operation on the signal on the read-out bus 33. The set of signals held by amplifiers 35 are read in a time-multiplexed manner on to output bus 37. After each integration period, a similar operation is performed for a column of pixels. <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 8</figref> shows the process repeated for columns 2, 3 and column N. <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 8</figref> does not show the subsequent processing of data output from the pixel array, as this is conventional in operation. The process has already been described in outline in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. Similar elements of a subject are accumulated in storage devices, such as integrators or registers of a processor. At the end of the TDI process, which will be after four integration periods using the four line arrays of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">9</figref>, an element of the final image is output. The subsequent processing can be performed on the same chip as the pixel array, or by an off-chip processor. An example of the required processing is described in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US7268814B"><text>US 7,268,814</text></patcit>, which describes the use of a bank of integrators.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">One potential disadvantage of the rolling shutter readout as in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 8</figref> is that the number of pixels in the "across track" direction is usually significantly larger than in the along track direction (TDI level). As a result, the multiplexing readout buses 33<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> in the pixel array are longer and more heavily loaded, which can lead to lower multiplexing speed and increased power consumption. Typically, each readout bus also requires a line overhead time to sample the multiplexed signals into the readout circuits. Since the number of lines to be read out is larger, the frame rate is also reduced.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 9</figref> shows a second embodiment of the invention which can overcome some of the disadvantages of the first embodiment. Corresponding features of the array are the same as previously described and do not need to be described again. A set of readout buses 133 are provided which allow multiple columns to be simultaneously read. In <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 9</figref>, this advantage is achieved by providing a set of readout buses 133 which follow a diagonal path across the array and connect a diagonally positioned group of pixels. The set of readout buses 133 are arranged parallel to each other. <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 9</figref> shows one possible layout for a set of readout buses 133. A first readout bus 133 connects the top pixel of column 1, the second pixel of column 2, the third pixel of column 3 and the fourth pixel of column 4. An output amplifier 135, with a sample-and-hold function, is connected to the output of the readout bus 133. The amplifiers 135 are selectively connectable, via switches 136, to an output bus 137 and an output amplifier 138.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">An advantage of having the diagonally arranged multiplexing buses 133 is that they are quite short, and connect to fewer pixels. This means that they have a lower capacitance and therefore can be operated at a faster speed than the arrangement of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>. This configuration also allows multiple columns to be read out in parallel. This can be achieved by using multiple pointers for selection. The rolling shutter operation for reset (and transfer in case of 4T) and select lines is still very similar but multiple pointers are active in the pixel array.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The process of reading the array of <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 9</figref> is shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 10</figref>. At the end of the integration period for column 1 of the array, that column of pixels are read. The column of pixels is selected, by raising the "select" control signal to those pixels, and the value of each pixel is applied to the respective readout bus 133. The column of pixels are read in parallel. Amplifier 135 at the end of each readout bus 133 performs a sample-and-hold operation on the signal on the read-out bus 133. The set of signals held by amplifiers 135 are read in a time-multiplexed manner on to output bus 137. Column 5, Column 9, Column 13 (and any other columns offset by 4 columns) can also be read at the same time. This is because the paths of the readout buses serving<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> columns 1, 5, 9 and 13 do not have any pixels in common. Looking at the readout buses for column 1, it can be seen that they are only connected to pixels in columns 2, 3 and 4. Therefore, the readout buses connected to the pixels of column 5 can be operated independently. It will be appreciated that this embodiment requires time-multiplexed switches 136 to read a larger number of signals onto bus 137 during each read operation (in this example, four times as many), but this is easily accommodated. At the end of the integration period for columns 2, 6, 10, 14 a similar operation is performed for these columns of pixels. <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 11</figref> shows an image resulting from the array of <figref idrefs="f0006">Figures 9</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">10</figref>. The image has a sawtooth-like profile. It can be seen that the pixels of columns that have been integrated, and read, at the same time are aligned with other. So, the pixels of columns 1, 5, 9 and 13 are all aligned with each other. Pixels of other groups of columns that were integrated at the same time as one another (e.g. columns 2, 6, 10, 14) are similarly aligned with each other, but offset (in the along track direction) with respect to the pixels of other groups of columns. It should be understood that the layout of readout buses 133 shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 9</figref> is only one example of a range of possible layouts. In another example layout, a readout bus 133 extends diagonally across the pixel array from the bottom left-hand pixel 30 of the array (as viewed in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 9</figref>), connecting that pixel with the second pixel (viewed in an upward direction) in column 2, the third pixel of column 3 and the fourth pixel of column 4. Other readout buses lie parallel to that readout bus, and the pattern is repeated across the array.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The process of sampling the scene synchronously in the along track direction and using a rolling shutter in the across track direction has the effects shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref> or <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 11</figref>. While these effects can be tolerated in some applications, it is possible to compensate for these effects by configuring the pixels of the array in a particular physical layout on the semiconductor chip. <figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 12</figref> shows a physical layout of pixels which can be used in place of that shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>. The columns of pixels of the array are offset with respect to each other in the along track direction. The offset between each pair of columns is constant. Each row of pixels now has an axis which is non-orthogonal with respect to the axis 31 of a column of pixels. The longitudinal axis of the entire array is also non-orthogonal with respect to the axis 31 of a column of pixels. The total accumulated shift of the columns over the complete detector (part readout by single readout pointer) should correspond to the shift in integration time between first and last column and the relative velocity of the scene:<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">P</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">N</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">P</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">v</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">.</mn><mfenced separators=""><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">N</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn></msub></mfenced></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="36" he="8" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
where P<sub>N</sub> - P<sub>1</sub> is the distance between the positions on the detector (in the direction of the first axis/direction of relative movement), v the relative velocity of the scene and t<sub>N</sub>-t<sub>1</sub> is the difference in start times of the integration periods of the last column (column N) and first column (column 1). <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 6</figref> shows the start times t1, t<sub>N</sub> and <figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 12</figref> shows the difference in positions P<sub>N</sub>-P<sub>1</sub> between first and last columns of the detector.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 13</figref> shows a physical layout of pixels which can be used in place of that shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 9</figref>. Columns of pixels of the array are offset with respect to each other in the along track direction. Columns of pixels which are integrated at the same time are aligned with one another. Columns of pixels which are integrated at a later time are offset in the along track direction. The physical configuration of the array is directly related to the configuration of the final image shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 11</figref>.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Using an array as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 12 or 13</figref> provides a final image for which the shift in integration times between the columns is compensated by the shift in layout of the columns. Therefore, the resulting image will have an orthogonal coordinate system as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 14</figref>.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Another way of modifying the resulting images shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">11</figref> is to crop the sides of the parallelogram or sawtooth image to produce a rectangular image. This will only have the effect of curing the irregular shape of the final image. Postprocessing can be applied to compensate for the non-orthogonal shape, e.g. Fourier transform/inverse transform, although this is likely to result in some degradation of the SNR.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In the examples described above, a single readout bus 33, 133 connects to each pixel. It is also possible to connect each pixel to multiple (at least two) readout buses. In each of the embodiments, this will allow an increased number of columns of pixels to be read at any time. Looking again at <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>, consider that each row of pixels now has two readout buses 33. Consider the first two columns of the array - column 1, column 2. Both columns can now be read simultaneously. Pixels in column 1 connect to the first readout bus and pixels in column 2 connect to the second readout bus. Multiple readout buses per pixel are practical with pixels having a large area, as the fill factor penalty for routing an additional bus through the pixel is reduced. IN the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 9</figref>, an additional one or more diagonal readout buses can be<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> provided, in parallel with the existing readout bus. Alternatively, the additional readout buses can have a different layout compared to the first set of readout buses.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Although the above examples have referred to "pixels", it will be understood that the array can be used for monochrome or colour imaging.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The invention is not limited to the embodiments described herein, which may be modified or varied without departing from the scope of the invention.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980394" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>CMOS-Bildgebungsvorrichtung für eine Time Delay Integration (TDI, Integration mit Zeitverzögerung) Bildgebung eines Subjekts, wobei eine relative Bewegung zwischen der Bildgebungsvorrichtung und dem Subjekt in einer ersten Richtung (22) vorhanden ist, wobei die Bildgebungsvorrichtung umfasst:
