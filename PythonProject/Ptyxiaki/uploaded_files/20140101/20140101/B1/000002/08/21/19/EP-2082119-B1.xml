A valve seat insert according to the invention comprises a cooling duct, an inlet port for conveying cooling liquid into the cooling duct and an outlet port for discharging cooling liquid out of the cooling duct. According to the invention the inlet port and the outlet port are arranged close to one another. In addition, the cooling duct is arranged between the inlet port and the outlet port so that it extends at least almost around the whole seat insert. The valve seat insert is a one-piece part. The cooling<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> duct is unbranched and the inlet port and the outlet port are arranged at the outer periphery of the seat insert.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Considerable advantages are achieved by the present invention.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The inlet port and the outlet port of the seat insert are arranged close to one another, and cooling liquid flows in the cooling duct between the inlet port and the outlet port at least almost around the whole seat insert. Due to steady cooling liquid circulation no uncooled areas remain in the seat insert, which improves the cooling of the seat insert and prolongs the operating life of the seat insert.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The seat insert is preferably a one-part cast or a one-part piece manufactured by hot isostatic pressing. Compared to a seat insert made of several separate parts e.g. by welding, there are fewer surfaces to be sealed, whereby cooling liquid leakages from the cooling duct are less significant. Moreover, it is easy to place the cooling water duct in a suitable position in the cast and shape it as desired.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The seat insert is connected by a shrinkage fit to the cylinder head and the outer periphery of the seat insert acts as a joint face for the counter surface in the cylinder head. Then the inlet port and the outlet port that open to the outer periphery of the seat insert can be connected tightly to the cooling liquid circulation and the connecting points are protected from the exhaust gases of the engine. Further, the inlet port and the outlet port at the outer periphery may be used as supporting points for the foundry core, while the seat insert is being cast, whereby the ports need not to be closed or sealed after the casting.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the following, the invention is described in more detail with reference to the appended drawings, in which<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> -->
<ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a cross section of one seat insert according to the invention mounted in conjunction with the cylinder head; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref> shows the seat insert of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> sectioned along the line A-A.</li></ul></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The drawings show a valve seat insert 1 of a piston engine attached to a cylinder head 5 of a liquid-cooled piston engine, e.g. a large diesel engine, by a shrinkage fit. The outer periphery 8 of the seat insert 1 is adapted against the edge of the recess in the cylinder head 5. The task of the cylinder head 5 is to close the upper end of the cylinder sleeve and form the upper part of the combustion chamber 7 of the cylinder. In addition, the cylinder head 5 is provided with an inlet passage and an exhaust passage 6 for the gases of the cylinder's combustion process. The gas flow through the inlet passage and exhaust passage is controlled by valves arranged in conjunction with the passages. The cylinder head also acts as a base for the valve gear and in a diesel engine for the fuel injection valve. The cylinder head 5 is provided with flow ducts for cooling liquid, which ducts are part of the engine's cooling system. The drawings show the exhaust valve seat insert 1, which acts as a counter surface for the exhaust valve disc (not shown). The seat insert 1 encircles the exhaust passage 6.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The seat insert 1 encompasses an annular cooling duct 2. The seat insert 1 is cooled by the cooling liquid flowing in the cooling duct. The cooling duct 2 is arranged completely inside the seat insert 1, i.e. the seat insert forms all the walls of the cooling duct 2. The seat insert encircles the cooling duct 2 completely. The cooling duct 2 extends almost around the whole seat insert 1. The seat insert 1 comprises also an inlet port 3 for conveying cooling liquid into the cooling duct 2 and an outlet port 4 for discharging cooling liquid out of the cooling duct 2. The inlet port 3 and the outlet port 4 are connected to the cooling circuit of the cylinder head 5 or to a cooling circuit independent thereof. The inlet port 3 and the outlet port 4 are arranged close to one another. The cooling duct 2 is arranged between the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> inlet port 3 and the outlet port 4 so that it extends at least almost around the whole seat insert 1. In addition to the inlet port 3 and the outlet port 4 the cooling duct 2 has no other openings, through which cooling liquid is allowed to enter or exit the cooling duct 2, i.e. the cooling duct 2 is in flow connection with only one inlet port and one outlet port. Moreover, the shorter route between the inlet port 3 and the outlet port 4 is closed. Thus, the cooling liquid fed into the seat insert 1 circulates in the cooling duct 2 almost around the whole seat insert 1 between the inlet port 3 and the outlet port 4. Since the cooling duct 2 is not branched, all the cooling liquid fed into the seat insert 1 flows in the cooling duct 2 by only one route between the inlet port 3 and the outlet port 4. The flow directions of the cooling liquid in the seat insert 1 are indicated by arrows in the drawings.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In order to provide a sufficiently uniform cooling effect the inlet port 3 and the outlet port 4 are arranged as close to one another as possible. The central angle α between the centre of the inlet port 3 and the centre of the outlet port 4 is 70º at the most, preferably 20° at the most. The central angle α is, however, at least 5°, preferably at least 10º. Thus the reflex central angle ß between the centre of the inlet port 3 and the centre of the outlet port 4 is at least 290º, preferably at least 340º. The central angle ß is, however, 355º at the most, preferably 350º at the most. The central angle is the angle between the straight line connecting the centre P of the seat insert to the centre of the inlet port 3 and the straight line connecting the centre P of the seat insert to the centre of the outlet port 4. The cooling duct 2 curves around the centre P of the seat insert to the extent of the reflex central angle ß.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The inlet port 3 and the outlet port 4 are located at the outer periphery 8 of the seat insert 1, i.e. on the surface, which is adapted by the shrinkage fit of the seat insert 1 against the counter surface on the cylinder head 5. The seat insert 1 is a one-piece part, for instance a one-piece cast part, i.e. it is manufactured by casting. During the casting, the foundry core of the cooling duct is supported at the inlet<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> port and the outlet port and possibly also at some additional points elsewhere. Alternatively, the seat insert 1 may be manufactured by using a powder metallurgical manufacturing method, for instance hot isostatic pressing (HIP). Here, powdered raw material is encapsulated inside a sheet capsule, which conforms to the forms of the finished product in such a way that the deformation caused by hydrostatic pressing (about 1800 bar), which is performed later on, is taken into account. The cooling duct is made of a tube and placed in the capsule before it is filled with powder. The powder-filled capsule is subjected to uniform pressure from every direction, while the capsule is at high temperature, whereby the powdered raw material is compacted to the shape according to the mould.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Cooling liquid is supplied through the inlet port 3 into the cooling duct 2. The cooling liquid circulates in the cooling duct 2 almost around the whole seat insert 1, and subsequently, the cooling liquid is discharged from the cooling duct 2 through the outlet port 4. The cooling liquid circulates in the cooling duct 2 around the centre P of the seat insert to the extent of the reflex central angle ß.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The invention has embodiments that differ from the above-described one. In the embodiment according to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1 and 2</figref> the shorter section of the cooling duct 2 between the inlet port 3 and the outlet port is closed, i.e. cooling liquid is allowed to flow between the ports 3, 4 only along the longer route passing almost around the whole seat insert. The cooling duct 2 may be shaped so that it is completely annular extending around the whole seat insert and having an open shorter section between the inlet port 3 and the outlet port 4 as well. The shorter section is provided with a throttling so that only a small quantity of cooling liquid between the inlet port 3 and the outlet port 4 flows through this route, while most of the cooling liquid flows along the longer route around almost the whole seat insert 1. Similarly to the embodiment according to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1 and 2</figref>, also in this embodiment the seat insert encircles the cooling duct completely.</p></description><claims
