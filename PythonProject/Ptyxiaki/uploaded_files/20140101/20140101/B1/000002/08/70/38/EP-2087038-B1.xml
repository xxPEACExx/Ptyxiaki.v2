The present invention further relates to polymeric films and sheets formed from the novel SBC or the polymer blend compositions.

The SBC must contain a substantially random I/B polymer mid-block that has an I/B ratio within a range of from 30/70 to 70/30 and have a glass transition temperature (Tg) of no more than -60 degrees centigrade (°C), preferably -85 °C to -75 °C. The SBC has S content within a range of from 28 wt percent to 31 wt percent, based upon SBC weight, and an apparent molecular weight within a range of from 110,000 to 160,000. Joly et al. recognizes that SBC preparation via coupling of living diblock segments may leave some living S-I/B diblock segments in an uncoupled state, with "some" preferably being no more than 20 mole percent (mol percent), based upon total moles of SBC. The second thermoplastic resin may be a polyolefin, a polystyrene resin, a coumarone-indene resin, a polyindene resin, a poly(methylindene) resin, an alpha-methylstyrene resin, a polyphenylene resin or a mixture of such resins or copolymers of styrene and a compatible monomer such as alpha-methylstyrene, methylstyrene or vinyl toluene.

Such tetrablock copolymers may be represented molecularly and structurally represented as S-I-B-S or as S-B-I-S if one reverses order of diene monomer addition. Each S is independently a predominantly styrene polymer block with a peak weight average molecular weight of at least (≥) 9,500 g/M, more preferably ≥ 9,800 g/M, most preferably ≥ 10,000 g/M and preferably less than or equal to (≤) 35,000 g/M, more preferably ≤ 20,000 g/M and still more preferably ≤ 15,000 g/M, with a range of from 10,000 g/M to 15,000 g/M being especially preferred. Tetrablock copolymers with substantially equal S block M<sub>w</sub> values typically bear a label of "symmetric" while a label of "asymmetric" refers to those tetrablock copolymers with<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> unequal S block M<sub>w</sub> values. I and B represent, respectively, predominantly isoprene polymer blocks and predominantly butadiene polymer blocks. In other words, an I block contains very little, preferably no, monomer other than isoprene and a B block contains very little, preferably no, monomer other than butadiene. On that basis, the tetrablock copolymer contains very little, preferably no, random I/B copolymer. I and B relate to each other via a weight ratio of I to B that falls within a range of from 75:25 to 15:85, preferably within a range of from 65:35 to 20:80, still more preferably within a range of from 50:50 to 25:75, and most preferably within a range of from 40:60 to 25:75.

--></p><p id="p0078" num="0078">The data presented in Table 3 above support several observations. First, a comparison of Ex 1 and Comp Ex A shows that tetrablock copolymers of the present invention (Ex 1), wherein I and B exist as substantially distinct blocks, provide an improved hysteresis performance (for example, a lower ratio of load at 200 percent elongation to unload at 30 percent elongation) relative to triblock copolymers (Comp Ex A) wherein I and B exist as components of a random block (S-(I/B)-S). Dilution of a tetrablock copolymer representative of the present invention with up to 15 wt percent of a linear triblock (S-I-B) as in Ex 2 provides some decrease in hysteresis performance, as evidenced by an increase in the ratio of load at 200 percent elongation to unload at 30 percent elongation from 4.1 to 4.4, still yields better hysteresis performance than Comp Ex A. Diluting triblock copolymers that have a random IB block with random diblock S(I/B), further reduces hysteresis performance as shown in Comp Ex B versus Comp Ex A, and Comp Ex D (which also includes PS and MO-325 oil) versus Comp Ex B. Table 4 contains additional data that supports improved hysteresis performance of tetrablock copolymers of the present invention relative to triblock copolymers with a random I/B block. <u>See,</u> for example, Ex 3 versus Comp Ex C and Ex 4 versus Comp Ex F.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">The data in Tables 5 and 6 show that one may vary styrene content in tetrablock copolymers of the present invention to achieve a range of melt flow rates, Shore A hardness values, tensile test properties while maintaining, or even improving hysteresis performance relative to Ex 1. Skilled artisans recognize that hysteresis performance improves as the ratio of load at 200 percent elongation to unload at 30 percent elongation decreases. A comparison of Ex 12 with Comp Ex G, which have similar styrene contents (29.3 wt percent for Comp Ex G versus 29.2 wt percent for Ex 12) shows that a single S-I-B-S tetrablock copolymer of the present invention has a better hysteresis performance than a blend of a SIS block copolymer with a SBS block copolymer.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980397" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Eine Polymermischungszusammensetzung, wobei die Zusammensetzung die folgenden Komponenten beinhaltet:
