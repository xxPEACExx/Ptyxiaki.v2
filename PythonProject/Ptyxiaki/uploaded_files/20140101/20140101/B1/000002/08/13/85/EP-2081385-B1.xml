load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0002">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an application execution terminal which receives a content containing a video or an audio and playbacks the content, and which also executes an application which provides related information about the content.</p><heading id="h0003">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">For example, patent reference 1 discloses a system which receives video content data via a network, such as a cable network or a radio network, playbacks the video content, and presents the video content as well as information on an advertisement (a commercial) related to the video content or the like. This system is provided with an information distribution server which distributes a video content and meaning information in which the description of each semantic unit of the video content are described, a related information server which distributes related information about the video content in response to a request, and a client terminal which receives the video content and playbacks this content. The client terminal disclosed by patent reference 1 is provided with a rule which predetermines the type of related information and a timing at which the related information is to be presented while the related information is associated with meaning information, and a user profile in which the user's preference and interest are described.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">When receiving video content data and meaning information about this video content data from the information distribution server, the client terminal refers to the above-mentioned rule and the above-mentioned user profile on the basis of this meaning information, and then makes a request of the related information server for related information corresponding to the above-mentioned meaning information. By doing in this way, the client terminal can present the meaning information and the related information according to the user' s preference, as well as the video content, to the user in agreement with the contents of the video content and at an effective timing.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The system disclosed by patent reference 1 is further provided with a reaction response unit for making the user's preference and interest reflected in the user profile in response to an input operation by the user. The system can therefore evaluate the related information which is presented to the user via the client terminal by using the reaction response unit so as to update the user profile according to the description of the evaluation.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">[Patent reference 1] <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2002101406A"><text>JP,2002-101406,A</text></patcit></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The above-mentioned conventional system can change the type of the related information which is presented to the user when the user watches the video content by updating the user profile using the reaction response unit. For example, assumes a case in which when the video content which the user is watching comes near to an image about a hot weather scene, a commercial about beer is to be presented as a commercial about drinks. In<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> this case, if the user does not like such a commercial about beer, the conventional system can modify the user profile by using the reaction response unit in such a way as to present a commercial about juice.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, the conventional system does not take into consideration offering a suggestion to present plural pieces of related information for one description of a specific video content while associating the plural pieces of related information with the one description for the user, and additional registration of related information which is explicitly suggested to the user into the user profile.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">For example, when playing back a video content showing a hot weather scene, the conventional system cannot simultaneously present, as related information, both a commercial about beer and a commercial about juice to the user. Furthermore, the user cannot update the user profile by himself or herself in such a way that such a video content showing a hot weather scene is associated with both a commercial about beer and a commercial about juice.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Thus, a problem with conventional systems is that when a user watches a content which is received via either a broadcast wave or a communications network and is played back, the user cannot know variations in the related information which is adapted to the description and the watching time period of the content, and therefore no related information which really matches up with the user's preference cannot be presented to the user.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO0172040A2"><text>WO 01/72040 A2</text></patcit> describes a media display system which is able to enhance content by recognizing patterns in the media signal and to modify the media signal responsively to the recognized patterns. The modification is based on user preferences and the correlated enhanced content. The enhanced content is superimposed on video or audio outputs.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Document <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP1530349A1"><text>EP 1 530 349 A1</text></patcit> describes a communication terminal and in particular a cellular phone capable of receiving a TV production. The communication terminal stores an incoming-reporting condition on the basis of which the precedence among the video reproduction and the operation to report an incoming is determined.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present invention is made in order to solve the above-mentioned problem, and it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an application execution terminal which, when a user watches a content, can present related information which really matches up with the user' s preference at a timing which is appropriate for the description of the content or the watching time period.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an application execution terminal including: an event detection unit for, on the basis of event detection rules in which event detection conditions are described for various events, respectively, detecting an event which matches up with one of the event detection conditions in the reception and playback of the content by the content processing unit; a profile storage unit for storing profiles in each of which an application associated with an event is registered; an event processing rule storage unit for storing event processing rules in which a description of a suggestion which is to be made in response to occurrence of an event is described; an application execution unit for starting and executing an application in response to a start request; and an application start control unit for making a suggestion to start either an application or a profile which is associated with the event detected by the event detection unit on the basis of the event processing rules, and for making a request of the application execution unit to start either the application for which the suggestion is accepted or an application registered into the profile for which<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the suggestion is accepted.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The application execution terminal in accordance with the present invention thus makes a suggestion to start either an application or a profile which is associated with an event detected in the reception and playback of the content on the basis of the event processing rules in which the description of a suggestion which is to be made in response to occurrence of an event is described, and, when the suggestion is accepted, makes a request of the application execution unit to start either the application or an application registered into the profile. By doing in this way, the application execution terminal in accordance with the present invention offers an advantage of being able to make a suggestion to start an application which presents the user with related information at a timing at which there occurs an event which matches up with an event detection condition related to the description of the content or the watching time period, and therefore can present related information which really matches up with the user's preference to the user.<br/>

The application execution terminal 100 in accordance with Embodiment 1 has a function of receiving and playing back a content, such as a video or an audio. The application execution terminal 100 also has a function of, according to the description of a content (a video, an audio, or the like) currently being played back or depending on the time period of the current time, suggesting to a user that the application execution terminal should start an application which presents related information about the content to the user.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the application execution terminal 100 is provided with a content receive/playback control unit 101, an event detection unit 102, an event detection rule storage unit 103, an application start control unit 104, an event processing rule storage unit 105, a profile storage unit 106, an application execution unit 107, an application storage unit 108, a user interface unit 109, and a user input receiving unit 110. The above-mentioned function is implemented by these components.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The content receive/playback control unit (a content processing unit) 101 receives coded content data via either a broadcast wave or a communications network, and decodes the coded content data. As a result, the content data are decoded to have a data format which can be displayed by the user interface unit 109. The decoded content data are then outputted from the content receive/playback control unit 101 to the user interface<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> unit 109.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The content receive/playback control unit 101 extracts metadata which are multiplexed into the received content data, and outputs the metadata to the event detection unit 102.

The details of the operation of the application execution<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> terminal 100 will be explained with reference to this figure. First, the event detection unit 102 transmits an event detection rule acquisition request to acquire the event detection rules to the event detection rule storage unit 103 (step ST201). The event detection rule storage unit 103 transmits the event detection rules which the event detection rule storage unit stores therein to the event detection unit 102 in response to the event detection rule acquisition request (step ST202).</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a diagram showing an example of the event detection rules.

In each of the event detection rules shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, settings about event detection are stored while being grouped into a setting in an event detection rule column 301 and a setting in a notified event column 302.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In the event detection rule column 301, an event detection condition for detecting occurrence of an event is set up for each event. As an event detection condition, a keyword related to a corresponding event, the genre of the content, or a time period can be provided.

When an event which matches up with one of the event detection rules 301 is detected, an event occurrence notification indicating occurrence of the event is transmitted from the event detection unit 102 to the application start control unit 104.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> again, the application start control unit 104 transmits an event processing rule acquisition request to acquire event processing rules to the event processing rule storage unit 105, like the event detection unit 102 (step ST203). The event processing rule storage unit 105 transmits the event processing rules which the event processing rule storage unit stores therein to the application start control unit 104 in response to the event processing rule acquisition request (step ST204).</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> is a diagram showing an example of the event processing rules.

In <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>, for example, "baseball" and "time period_morning" which are the descriptions of events are set up in the received event column 401. An event which is to be processed is specified by comparing each event data in this received event column 401 with the event specified by the event occurrence notification received from the event detection unit 102.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In the event processing condition column 402, event processing conditions each for determining a processing operation which is to be performed for a corresponding event detected are set up. As each of the event processing conditions, the presence or absence of a profile corresponding to the event which is specified through the comparison with the event data in the received event column 401 can be provided as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>. In a profile, various settings for an application, data, and so on which are provided for each user and which correspond to an event are set up.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In the event processing operation column 403, pieces of information each indicating the description of a suggestion (an event processing operation) which is to be made when a corresponding event processing condition in the event processing condition column 402 is satisfied are set up. For example, in a case in which an event "baseball" occurs, if there is a profile (a baseball profile) corresponding to this event "baseball", an operation of suggesting to the user that the application execution terminal should start an application registered into the baseball profile is determined as the event<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> processing operation. In contrast, if there is no baseball profile, the application execution terminal suggests to the user that the application execution terminal should start an application for receiving and playing back a baseball live broadcast.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In the user response column 404, user responses are set up for the processing operations set up in the event processing operation column 403, respectively. In the example of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>, when the user accepts a suggestion to start an application, "suggestion accepted" is set to a corresponding cell of the user response column 404. In contrast, when the suggestion is refused, "suggestion refused" is set to the corresponding cell of the user response column 404. In contrast to this, when the event processing condition is not satisfied and therefore the corresponding event processing operation is not carried out (when the start of an application is not suggested), "yet-to-be suggested" is set to the corresponding cell of the user response column.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In the above-mentioned way, as the pre-processing which is carried out prior to the processing of the content receive/playback control unit 101, the event detection unit 102 acquires the event detection rules and the application start control unit 104 acquires the event processing rules.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The content receive/playback control unit 101 receives content data via either a broadcast wave or a communications network and playbacks the content data, and also detects whether or not metadata which are multiplexed into the content data have<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> been updated.

Explaining this process using the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, when an arbitrary part of the metadata associated with the specific content has a keyword "baseball", an event "baseball" is detected. In contrast, when information indicating that the genre of the content is "movie" is described in the metadata, an event "movie" is detected.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The event detection unit 102 also acquires the current time from a not-shown timer, and compares the current time with<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> the event detection rules so as to judge whether an event corresponding to the current time has occurred. In the example of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, when the current time is 7:00, because this current time matches up with an event detection rule "time period == 05:00 to 10:00", an event "time period_morning" is detected.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">When detecting occurrence of an event, the event detection unit 102 transmits an event occurrence notification indicating the detected event to the application start control unit 104 (step ST207).

The operation of checking event processing will be explained in detail with reference to this figure. First, the application start control unit 104 checks to see whether or not the event indicated by the event occurrence notification received from the event detection unit 102 is defined in the received event column 401 of the event processing rules shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> (step ST501). In this case, if the event indicated by the event occurrence notification is not defined in the received event column 401, the application start control unit ends the event processing check.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In contrast, when the event indicated by the event occurrence notification is defined in the received event column<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> 401, the application start control unit 104 inquires of the profile storage unit 106 whether there exists a profile corresponding to this event (step ST502).</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">When the profile corresponding to the event indicated by the event occurrence notification exists in the profile storage unit 106, the application start control unit 104 refers to the user response column 404 of the event processing rules, and then judges whether, as a result of performing the event processing corresponding to this event, "suggestion refused" has been made by the user (step ST503). As a result, the application start control unit can prevent the suggestion which has been refused once by the user from being carried out repeatedly.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">When, in step ST503, judging that "suggestion refused" is not set up in the user response column 404, the application start control unit 104 determines to make a suggestion to start the profile corresponding to this event (step ST504). In contrast, when judging that "suggestion refused" is set up in the user response column 404, the application start control unit 104 shifts to a process of step ST505 after setting up "corresponding profile not existing" in the cell corresponding to this event in the event processing condition column 402.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Thus, even if the start of the application of the profile is refused, the application start control unit 104 shifts to the process of step ST505 of judging the presence or absence of an application corresponding to this event.

When, in step ST506, judging that "suggestion refused"<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> is set up in the corresponding cell of the user response column 404, the application start control unit 104 returns to step ST505 in which the application start control unit carries out a process of judging whether or not information indicating a suggestion to start another application is set up.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In contrast, when, in step ST506, judging that "suggestion refused" is not set up in the corresponding cell of the user response column 404, the application start control unit 104 determines to notify a suggestion to start an application for which "suggestion refused" is not set up to the user interface unit 109 (step ST507).</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">When the application start control unit 104 determines either a profile or an application, which the application start control unit has to make a notification of a suggestion to start, through the event processing check in above-mentioned step ST208, the application start control unit 104 transmits a notification of a suggestion to start either the above-mentioned profile or the above-mentioned application to the user interface unit 109.

Thereby, the user is<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> not bothered by judgment of whether to refuse or accept a suggestion to start an application which he or she does not desire, and therefore can accept a suggestion to start only an application which the user desires according to the detected event.</p><heading id="h0008">Embodiment 2.</heading><p id="p0071" num="0071">An application execution terminal in accordance with this Embodiment 2 manages the number of times that a suggestion to start either an application or a profile has been accepted, and makes a suggestion to register the application into a profile or to automatically start the profile according to the number of times that a suggestion to start either the application or the profile has been accepted.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">While the fundamental structure of the application execution terminal in accordance with Embodiment 2 is the same as the structure of that in accordance with above-mentioned Embodiment 1 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the application start control unit in accordance with Embodiment 2 differ from that in accordance with above-mentioned Embodiment 1 in that the application start control unit in accordance with Embodiment 2 manages the number of times that a suggestion to start either an application or a profile has been accepted, and makes a suggestion to automatically start the profile according to the number of times that a suggestion to start either the application or the profile has been accepted. Hereinafter, the operation of the application execution terminal in accordance with Embodiment 2 will be explained by applying the structure of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> to the application execution terminal in accordance with this<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> Embodiment 2.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">Next, the operation of the application execution terminal will be explained. <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 9</figref> is a sequence diagram showing the operation of the application execution terminal in accordance with Embodiment 2 of the present invention.

First, the event detection unit 102 transmits a request to acquire event detection rules to the event detection rule storage unit 103, like that of above-mentioned Embodiment 1.

The event<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> processing checking operation will be explained in detail with reference to this figure. First, the application start control unit 104 in accordance with Embodiment 2 checks to see whether or not the event indicated by the event occurrence notification received from the event detection unit 102 is defined in the event processing rules (step ST501), like that in accordance with above-mentioned Embodiment 1.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079"><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 11</figref> is a diagram showing an example of the event processing rules in accordance with Embodiment 2.

The setting columns 401 to 404 are the same as those of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> explained in above-mentioned Embodiment 1.
