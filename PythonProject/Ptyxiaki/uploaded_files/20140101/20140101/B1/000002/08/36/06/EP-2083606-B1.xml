load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b><u>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><heading id="h0002"><u>1. Field of the Invention:</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a mobile terminal. More particularly, the present invention relates to a multi-standby mobile terminal that supports multi-party conversations and data sharing between other mobile terminals on distinct networks and to a method of providing a host function for the same.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>2. Description of the Related Art:</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">With advances in communication technologies, modern mobile terminals provide diverse functions. More particularly, recently developed multi-mode mobile terminals can receive services from two or more different mobile communication networks.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Unlike a single-mode mobile terminal which can communicate within the service area of a single mobile communication network, a multi-mode mobile terminal can communicate within the service areas of two or more different mobile communication networks. For example, a dual-mode mobile terminal supporting a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) network and a Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) network can receive services from both the service area of a CDMA network and the service area of a GSM network. Hence, a dual-mode mobile terminal provides greater availability than a single-mode mobile terminal.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In a dual-mode mobile terminal, switching between different networks involves menu manipulation in an idle mode and rebooting, thus requiring a manual operation and a long duration of time.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Therefore, dual-standby mobile terminals have been developed that can simultaneously communicate with multiple networks, for example, a CDMA network and a GSM network.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For a multi-party conversation, when a dual-standby mobile terminal is connected to multiple mobile terminals on a single network, a conference call is registered as a supplementary string in the network and controlled accordingly.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, when a dual-standby mobile terminal is connected to multiple mobile terminals on different networks, one of the mobile terminals may not be<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> registered in the network serving the other mobile terminal. Hence, unlike the above single network case, the dual-standby mobile terminal can communicate one by one with the mobile terminals on the different networks, but cannot provide a conference call service. That is, one user can have a separate conversation with one of multiple counterparts at a time, but the counterparts cannot participate in the multi-party conversations at the same time as in the case of a conference call.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In other words, when a dual-standby mobile terminal communicates separately with mobile terminals on different networks, the mobile terminals on the different networks may be unable to join a conference call together.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Therefore, a need exists for a mobile terminal and method for allowing mobile terminals on different networks to join a conference call.<br/>
