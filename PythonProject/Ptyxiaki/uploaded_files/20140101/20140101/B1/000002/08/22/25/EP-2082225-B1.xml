The extracellular matrix glycophosphoprotein osteopontin (OPN) is normally secreted by osteoblasts and is utilised as an extracellular adhesion molecule. Osteopontin has also been associated with certain aspects of malignant transformation (1) by enhancing malignant cell attachment and migration and contributing to anchorage-independent growth of tumour cells (2, 3). Transfection of benign, non-metastatic rat mammary cells with cDNA for OPN has been determined to endow the transfectants with the ability to overproduce OPN <i>in vitro</i> and to metastatsize <i>in vivo</i> (4). OPN overexpression has been associated with poor prognosis in human primary breast cancer (5, 6) and OPN has been shown to be the single most powerful prognostic factor in a multivariate analysis against outcome, in a large prospective study of breast cancer patients (7). Although it is known that circulating plasma levels of OPN are higher In metastatic breast cancer patients (8), the precise molecular mechanisms of OPN regulated metastasis remains unclear.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">RAN GTPase (RAN) is a small GTP (Guanosine triphosphate) binding protein of the RAS superfamily. RAN has been determined to be essential for the translocation of RNA and proteins through the nuclear pore complex. A direct association between RAN and viral oncoproteins such as human adenovirus E1A, human papilloma virus E7 and SV40 large T antigen has been reported to be closely associated with cellular transformation and genomic instability induced by viral infection (27) and RAN GTPase has been determined to be highly expressed in most of the adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma cell lines tested from various organs, including the stomach, lungs, head and neck, pancreas and colon and also in metastatic tumour cells (29), but not in the normal cells in those tumour tissues (28). RAN has also been determined to regulate spindle cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis (26).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Whilst RAN has been determined to be associated with uncontrolled cell growth, determining cell growth does not give a measure of the process of metastasis, which is a largely independent process.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">By analysing gene expression between the benign rat mammary cell line Rama 37 (R37) and R37 cells stably transfected with an expression vector for OPN, termed R37-OPN cells, wherein the former cells produce low levels of OPN and are non-invasive and nonmetastatic (9), while the latter cells produce high levels of OPN and are invasive, the inventors have determined that RAN has a further role in invasion and metastasis and that RAN and RAN Binding Protein 1 have substantially increased expression in association with OPN.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of determining whether a tumour cell has invasive / metastatic potential comprising the steps:

A double mutant in the GTP binding pocket of RAN was also constructed, Mut.RAN (Materials and Methods) which, when expressed in a reticulocyte cell-free protein-synthesising system produced a lower 6-8 fold rate of GTP hydrolysis over the wild type (Wt.)

Increased expression of this magnitude is sufficient to induce the invasive phenotype in vitro (1), enhance cellular migration through Matrigel (24) and induce metastasis in syngeneic rats in vivo in this R37 system (4). In the present study, OPN cDNA overexpression in R37-OPN cells is associated with enhanced cellular adhesion to laminin-coated surfaces, enhanced anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and enhanced cellular invasion through Matrigel. R37 cells thus provide a robust system for the study of OPN-induced changes in the parental R37 cells that leads to the invasive phenotype in vitro and, by analogy, to the metastatic state in vivo (4). The inventors have identified the G protein RAN as a potential downstream effector of the OPN-induced signalling network that can lead to invasion and ultimately metastasis. Further, the inventors have identified differentially expressed genes whose proteins can interact with and possess some function of RAN, these include p27 and RAG -1, MDM 2, RAN binding protein 5, adenovirus EIA oncoprotein, RAN promoter activated protein Spl, HLA-A, and androgen receptor associated protein 24.<!-- EPO <DP n="59"> --></p><p id="p0138" num="0138">When siRNA-RAN was transfected into the R37-OPN cells, it was determined to inhibit the production of OPN, whilst transfection of the expression vector for as-OPN into RAN expressing R37 cells failed to inhibit the expression of RAN. Moreover, when an expression vector for RAN was transfected into R37 cells independently of OPN, it also had the ability to transform their phenotype in the same manner as that of the expression vector for OPN by inducing increased cell adhesion to laminin-coated surfaces, increased anchorage-independent cell growth and increased cell invasion through Matrigel, properties identified with the malignant state in vitro and associated with increased metastasis in vivo. Permanent transfection of Rama 37 and R37-as-OPN cells with the RAN cDNA in its expression vector causes elevated level of RAN proteins and confers the ability to metastatsize in syngeneic rats. Since the relatively non-invasive MCF-7 and ZR-75 express low levels of both OPN and RAN and both levels are increased in the invasive breast cancer cell lines MDA MB 435S and MDA MB 231, this suggests that their levels are coordinately regulated.</p><p id="p0139" num="0139">The inventors have determined that stable transfection of non-invasive R37 cells with an expression vector for RAN induces the invasive/metastatic phenotype in culture characterized by increased cell adhesion, anchorage independent growth and invasion through Matrigel and in vivo by metastasis in syngeneic rats. Conversely, stable transfection of invasive R37-OPN cells with RAN siRNA downregulates RAN expression and inhibits the invasive/metastatic phenotype. Further, stable transfection of R37 cells with Mut.RAN significantly inhibits invasion.</p><p id="p0140" num="0140">The inventors results show that RAN can trigger the cells to metastatsize <i>in vivo</i> independently of OPN and it is the key OPN intermediate molecule. Thus expression of RAN alone is able to convert R37 cells to a malignant,<!-- EPO <DP n="60"> --> metastatic phenotype <i>in vitro</i> and in vivo. The fact that expression of three siRNA oligonucleotides targeted against RAN inhibits the three properties associated with the malignant, metastatic state in R37-OPN cells, and that overexpression of RAN in OPN-silenced R37-OPN cells recreates the malignant, metastatic state are consistent with RAN being a downstream effector of the same malignant, metastatic state induced by OPN. This conclusion is confirmed by the similar incremental decreases in expression of RAN protein (<figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 4A</figref>) and in cell adhesion (<figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 4B</figref>) and anchorage-independent growth (<figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 4C</figref>) when the R37-OPN cells are transfected singly or in binary combinations with the three siRNA oligonucleotides targeted against RAN. Moreover, the expression of RAN in OPN-silenced R37-OPN cells fully restore their invasive potential <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, respectively (<figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 3E</figref>, table 2) suggests that RAN alone and also play an important role in OPN's induction of invasion in the R37 cell system.</p><p id="p0141" num="0141">In addition, it has been determined that overexpression of RAN in R37 cells increased both MET receptor and Akt phosphorylation and treatment of R37-RAN cells with a phosphoinositol 3 kinase (P13K) inhibiter LY 294002, completely abolished Akt phosphorylation and reduced cell invasion.</p><p id="p0142" num="0142">The inventors have further determined that an inhibiter of RAN mediated invasion by R37 cells is phosphoinositol 3 kinase (P13K) inhibiter LY 294002.
