load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>Field of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to channel multiplexing technologies, in particular, to a method and device for multiplexing a broadcast service channel and a non-broadcast service channel.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Since 1990s, multicarrier technology has become a hot technology of broadband wireless communications. The basic concept of the multicarrier technology lies in that a broadband carrier is divided into a plurality of subcarriers and data is transmitted simultaneously on the divided subcarriers. In most of applications, the width of the subcarrier is less than a coherence bandwidth of a channel. Thus, on a frequency selective channel, the fading on each subcarrier is a flat fading, so that the crosstalk between user data symbols is reduced, and no complex channel equalization is needed. Therefore, it is suitable for the high-rate transmission of data. The existing multicarrier technology has various forms, such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex Access (OFDMA), Multiplex Carrier CDMA (MC-CDMA), Multiplex Carrier-Direct Spread-CDMA (MC-DS-CDMA) and Time Frequency (TF) domain two-dimensional expansion. Additionally, various expanded technologies based on the technologies are also included.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) technology is a representative technology in the multicarrier technologies. In the OFDM technology, a given channel is divided into several orthogonal subchannels in a frequency domain, and it is allowed that spectrums of the subcarriers overlap partially, because different data signals may be separated from the overlapped subcarriers when the different subcarriers are orthogonal to each other.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a schematic diagram showing a modulation and demodulation process of a basic OFDM system in the prior art. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, in the OFDM system, a channel coding and interleaving process is first performed on the user data, and the data after the coding and interleaving process is modulated to form a user data symbol through a modulation mode (such as, Binary Phase Shift Keying, BPSK, Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying, QPSK, and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation, QAM), and the user data symbol is modulated to a radio frequency by an OFDM operation. The demodulation process is opposite to this process, and a repeat description thereof is omitted.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the OFDM operation, firstly, a serial/parallel conversion is performed on the user data symbol to form a plurality of low-rate sub-data streams, and each sub-data stream occupies a subcarrier. The process for mapping each sub-data stream into a corresponding subcarrier may be implemented via an Inverse Discrete Fourier Transformation (IDFT) or Inverse Fast Fourier Transformation (IFFT) process. Through a Cyclic Prefix (CP) adding process, a CP is added to the time domain signal after the IDFT or IFFT process as a guard interval. The intersymbol interference may be reduced greatly or even eliminated, and the orthogonality between channels may be guaranteed, so that inter-channel interference may be reduced greatly.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">At present, the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) based on the OFDM multicarrier technology is one of the important services of Long-Time Evolution (LTE). The MBMS service refers to a service in which the network side broadcasts or multicasts the same multimedia data to a plurality of receivers in the network simultaneously. At present, the multimedia data mainly includes stream services and background services.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As described above, in order to reduce the intersymbol interference caused by a multipath delay, a CP is usually added to a time domain signal after the IDFT or IFFT process. The longer the CP added is, the stronger the ability to resist the intersymbol interference caused by multipath delay will be. However, a too long CP may also result in a low transmission efficiency. Therefore, in different OFDM systems, the length of the CP added may be configured as different values according to different applications.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the LTE, the CP includes a short CP and a long CP. The time length of the short CP is about 4.7µs, i.e., TCP≈4.7µs, and is mainly used in a non-broadcast service (Unicast). The time length of the long CP is about 16.7µs, i.e., TCP≈16.7µs, and is mainly used in MBMS or cell with a larger diameter. For cells with smaller diameters, or when the system sends a Unicast service, the short CP is employed. When the system sends an MBMS service or when the cell diameter is larger, the long CP is employed.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Usually, a system sends the Unicast service and the MBMS service after a Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) process is performed; in other words, some sub-frames are used for delivering the MBMS service and some sub-frames are used for delivering the Unicast service.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is a schematic diagram showing the state of the TDM process for the Unicast service and MBMS service in the prior art. In <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, a short CP is used in Sub-frame 0, Sub-frame 2, Sub-frame 3 and Sub-frame 6 to deliver Unicast service. Base stations between cells schedule and send Unicast service data independently. A long CP is used in Sub-frame 1, Sub-frame 4 and Sub-frame 5 to deliver MBMS service, and each cell sends the same MBMS service data. A User Equipment (UE) demodulates the MBMS service data sent by the system according to corresponding control information. If the UE lies in the cell edge, a plurality of MBMS service signals received from a plurality of cells may be merged through a combining mode, so that the signal-to-noise ratio and the coverage percentage of the cell edge may be improved.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">At present, the mode for performing the TDM for the MBMS service and the Unicast service includes a scheduling mode and a designating mode.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The scheduling mode is performed according to the Quality of Service (QoS) of the Unicast service data and MBMS service data. When the QoS requirement for the MBMS service data is stricter than that for the Unicast service data, the MBMS service data will be scheduled firstly; otherwise, the Unicast service data will be scheduled first. Because the MBMS service needs to be sent between a plurality of adjacent cells simultaneously, the QoS requirement for the MBMS service between the cells may be the same. However, the QoS requirement for the Unicast<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> service in each cell may hardly be the same. Therefore, during the TDM process in the scheduling mode a frequent switching between the MBMS service sub-frame and the Unicast service sub-frame will be caused, and the system signaling overhead will be increased greatly.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The designating mode refers to that, only the QoS requirement for the MBMS service will be considered in the two services; in other words, the system will designate the sub-frames for delivering the MBMS service data according to the delay requirement and rate requirement of the MBMS service. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, the system may designate Sub-frame 1, Sub-frame 4 and Sub-frame 5 to deliver the MBMS service data according to the QoS requirement for the MBMS service. Therefore, it can be seen that the delivery priority of the Unicast service will be neglected in the designating mode. As a result, the delay of the Unicast service is increased and the delay is intolerable for the Unicast service with a strict delay requirement.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to one aspect of the invention, a communication system is provided so that reduce system signaling overhead occupied when transmitting broadcast service and the non-broadcast service, and reduce transmission delay of the non-broadcast service.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The communication system includes at least a service sending device and a user equipment, UE.

Specifically, when a cell schedules an MBMS service sub-frame (the MBMS service sub-frame may be assigned by the network side regularly according to a certain time rule), the system will reserve part of the TF resources for delivering Unicast service data with a stricter delay requirement. In the Sub-frame, the multiplexing of MBMS service data and Unicast service data may be implemented in a frequency hopping mode, TDM mode or FDM mode. The main implementation is as follows.
<ol><li>1. Node B performs a constellation mapping on MBMS service data after channel coding, puts the mapped complex signal on a subcarrier appointed by the system, and reserves a part of the subcarriers for scheduling Unicast service data according to configurations (the system will be preconfigured to inform Node B which subcarriers are allowed to keep TF resources).</li><li>2.

In other words, in the above solution shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>, a QoS threshold of Unicast service is set and only Unicast service data exceeding the threshold are scheduled. Moreover, Unicast service situations in different cells are different, in other words, some cells may have a Unicast service exceeding the threshold, while some cells may not have the Unicast service exceeding the threshold, and additionally, the TF resources reserved in the MBMS service sub-frame may not be fully occupied even if the Unicast service exceeding the threshold exists. Therefore, TF resources which are not occupied may be used for delivering redundant information of MBMS service data (including repeated MBMS service data and check bit information of MBMS service data). A UE pertaining to the cell may receive and demodulate the MBMS service data and the redundant MBMS service data, and merge the MBMS service data and the redundant MBMS service data, so that the SINR of the MBMS service is improved.

Based on the OFDM multicarrier technology, frequency selective diversity gain needs to be obtained between different Nodes B via the cycle shift process. Usually, MBMS service data sent from different Nodes B are the same. Hence, when Node B sends the MBMS service data, the cycle shift process may be performed to improve the frequency selective gain. Additionally, because the Unicast service data is scheduled on the reserved TF resources in the MBMS service sub-frame, the interference between neighboring cells is likely to occur. Therefore, it is necessary to scramble the Unicast service data via an interference randomization process, and the interference randomization process is implemented by adding a scramble in the Unicast service data to generate interference, and the interference randomization process may be implemented in different interleaving modes.
