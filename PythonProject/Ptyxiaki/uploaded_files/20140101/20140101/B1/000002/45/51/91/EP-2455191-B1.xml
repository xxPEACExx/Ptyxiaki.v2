Such an apparatus measures the outer diameter of a columnar portion of a workpiece, thereby monitoring the state of grinding of the columnar portion performed by the grinding machine.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As one such type of measuring apparatus for a grinding machine, the configuration disclosed, for example, in Patent Document 1 has been proposed. This grinding machine will now be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0019">Figs. 24 and 25</figref>. A rotary shaft 103 of a motor (not shown) is supported on the upper surface of a grinding base 101, which can be reciprocated, via a pillow block 102. A grindstone 104 is coupled to the distal end of the rotary shaft 103.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A measuring apparatus 111 is attached to the pillow block 102 to measure the outer diameter of a crankpin 106a of a crankshaft 106. The measuring apparatus 111 is configured as follows. That is, a first tilt arm 114 is supported on the upper surface of the pillow block 102 via a bracket 112, and a support shaft 113, so as to be vertically tiltable. A second tilt arm 116 is coupled to the distal end of the first tilt arm 114 via a coupler shaft 115, so as to be vertically tiltable.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A tubular case 117 is supported at the distal end of the second tilt arm 116, and an operation rod 118 is movably received in the tubular case 117. A pin of a measuring device 119 is attached to the distal end of the operation rod 118. The pin of the measuring device 119 contacts the outer circumferential surface of the crankpin 106a of the crankshaft 106 to measure the outer diameter of the crankpin 106a. A support block 120 is attached to the tubular case 117. A gauge 121 is attached to the support block 120. The gauge 121 is formed to engage with the outer circumferential surface of the crankpin 106a. A guide member 122 is attached to the support block 120. The guide member 122 guides the gauge 121 toward the crankpin 106a. The measuring device 119 is hooked to the crankpin 106a by means of the weight of the first tilt arm 114 and other members.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A cylinder 123 for tilting the first tilt arm 114 is attached to the bracket 112. A weight 125 is coupled to the first tilt arm 114 to maintain the weight balance as shown in <figref idrefs="f0019">Fig. 24</figref>. When a piston rod 124 of the cylinder 123 is moved rightward as viewed in <figref idrefs="f0019">Fig. 24</figref>, so as to push the weight 125, the first tilt arm 114, the second tilt arm 116, the support block 120, and the gauge 121 are moved from a measurement position shown in <figref idrefs="f0019">Fig. 24</figref> to a home position shown in <figref idrefs="f0019">Fig. 25</figref>.<br/>

<ul><li>Patent Document 1: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2007185768A"><text>2007-185768</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0004">PROBLEMS THAT THE INVENTION IS TO SOLVE</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the measuring apparatus 111 of the above described grinding machine, the tilt axis 0114 of the first tilt arm 114 is spaced away from the rotation center 0104 of the grindstone 104. This causes the following problems.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">That is, the movement path of the coupler shaft 115, which couples the first tilt arm 114<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> and the second tilt arm 116 together, is not coaxial with the center 0104 of the grindstone 104. Therefore, when the gauge 121 at the home position shown in <figref idrefs="f0019">Fig. 25</figref> is moved to the measurement position shown in <figref idrefs="f0019">Fig. 24</figref>, where the gauge 121 contacts the crankpin 106a, the first tilt arm 114 needs to be tilted counterclockwise about the tilt axis 0114. At the same time, the second tilt arm 116 needs to be tilted clockwise about a tilt axis 0116.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The gauge 121 and the pin of the measuring device 119 contact the outer circumferential surface of the crankpin 106a, which reciprocates vertically while contacting the outer circumferential surface of the grindstone 104. This operation is referred to as gauge application. If the guide member 122 is not provided, the gauge application can be performed at a limited position, that is, only when the rotating crankpin 106a is stopped at the uppermost position.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Specifically, when proper gauge application is attempted on the rotating crankpin 106a, the tilt angle of the first tilt arm 114 and the tilt angle of the second tilt arm 116 each need to be suitable values corresponding to the rotational position of the crankpin 106a. However, such setting is practically impossible. Therefore, at the gauge application described above, the rotation has to be stopped when the crankpin 106a is at the highest position. This extends the time required for the gauge to be applied and disengaged.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the Patent Document 1, the guide member 122 is attached to the support block 120 to reduce the time required for the gauge to be applied and disengaged. Regardless of the rotational position of the crankpin 106a, the guide member 122 is made to contact the crankpin 106a, so as to perform the gauge application of the gauge 121.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">To shorten the time required for the gauge to be applied and disengaged, the guide member 122 is attached to the support block 120 in the structure shown in <figref idrefs="f0019">Figs. 24 and 25</figref>, so as to cause the guide member 122 to contact the rotating crankpin 106a. The gauge 121 is held to correspond to the crankpin 106a. In this state, the first tilt arm 114 and the second tilt arm 116 are tilted to perform the gauge application.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">However, the diameter and the vertical stroke of the crankpin 106a of the machined crankshaft greatly vary. Therefore, in accordance with the type of crankshaft, the position of the gauge application needs to be adjusted. This makes the operation problematic. Also, when the gauge 121 contacts the crankpin 106a, great impact can occur. In such a case, the life of a part that contacts the crankpin 106a is shortened. Further, since the measuring apparatus 111 has the downward projecting guide member 122, the tilt arm 116 needs to be at an upper retreat position before the gauge application, so as to prevent the guide member 122 from contacting the crankpin 106a. This extends the distance between the rotation range of the crankpin 106a and the gauge 121. Thus, even if the gauge application is performed at appropriate timing, impact can occur when the crankpin 106a and the gauge 121 contact each other, as in the above described case.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Further, since the tilt axis 0114 of the first tilt arm 114 is off the rotation center 0104 of the grindstone 104, the gauge 121 or the guide member 122 can hit the grindstone 104 if the tilt arm 114 is lowered in a state where no crankpin 106a is being machined.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a grinding machine that allows easy and smooth gauge application to the outer circumferential surface of a columnar part of a workpiece and ensures accurate measurement of a measuring device.</p><heading id="h0005">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">To achieve the foregoing objective and in accordance with the present invention, a grinding machine according to claim 1 is provided that includes a grindstone, a tilt arm, and measuring means<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> provided at a distal portion of the tilt arm. The grinding machine causes the grindstone to contact a shaft-like workpiece that is rotated about an axis to grind the workpiece, The tilt arm is tilted about another axis, and the measuring means measures an outer diameter of the workpiece. The rotation center of the grindstone and the tilt center of the tilt arm are arranged on a common axis.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According this invention, the rotation path of the measuring device at the distal portion of the tilt arm is an arcuate path the center of which coincides with the rotation center of the grindstone. Therefore, the rotation path of the measuring apparatus corresponds to the movement path of the workpiece, which is ground by the grindstone, so that the gauge application and disengagement can be performed smoothly and quickly.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the above configuration, the workpiece is preferably a crankshaft, and a crankpin of the rotating crankshaft is preferably ground by reciprocating the grindstone. This allows the crankpin to be efficiently ground.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The measuring means is supported at the distal portion of the tilt arm to be rotatable about an axis parallel to the axis of the tilt arm, and the grinding machine includes adjusting means for adjusting the rotation angle of the measuring means. In this case, the measuring means can be located at a position suitable for measuring the pin diameter. Also, at the dressing of the grindstone, the measuring means can be located at a position where it does not hinder the dressing.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Angle adjusting means for adjusting the tilt angle of the tilt arm is preferably provided, and the angle adjusting means is preferably capable of adjusting the position of the measuring means about the tilt center of the tilt arm. This allows the position of the measuring means to be freely adjusted relative to the workpiece. For example, regardless of the type of workpiece, a standby position for the measuring piece, at which the measuring means contacts the workpiece, can be made sufficiently close to the workpiece. Accordingly, the gauge application and gauge disengagement can be performed over a short distance, and the time required for the gauge application and the gauge disengagement are reduced. Also, an impact at the gauge application can be reduced.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The angle adjusting means preferably includes urging means for urging the tilt arm in one tilting direction and a first motor, and the first motor preferably actuates an actuating element, which is selectively contacts and separates from the tilt arm, thereby rotating the tilt arm against the urging force of the urging means. In this case, the operation of the first motor accurately moves the measuring means to a predetermined position.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The adjusting means preferably includes a driven lever integrally rotated with the measuring means, another driven lever rotated by drive means, and a link coupling the driven levers together.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The drive means includes a second motor and an actuating element driven by the second motor. The actuating element has an arcuate surface the shape of which conforms to an are the center of which coincides with the tilt center of the tilt arm, and wherein the arcuate surface is engaged with said another driven lever so that said another driven lever is rotated. The arcuate surface is preferably engaged with said another driven lever so that said another driven lever is rotated. This allows the actuating element, on which the arcuate surface is formed, to properly rotate the driven lever.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Holding means is provided that maintains the measuring means at a neutral position and allows the measuring means to be rotated by an external force. In this case, when the grindstone is slightly worn, it is not necessary to set the rotation range of the tilt arm and the measuring device through computation again. However, since the measuring<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> device is allowed to rotate from the neutral position, it is possible to cope with a change in the grinding range due to abrasion of the grindstone.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The measuring means is preferably held at the neutral position via force of a spring.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A reducing means is preferably provided that reduces the load due to the weight of the tilt arm and the measuring means when the measuring means is located at a position for measuring the outer diameter of the workpiece. This reduces the measurement load acting on the workpiece, allowing accurate machining and measurement of the workpiece.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The reducing means is preferably formed by a spring. When the spring has passed a dead point, the reducing means reduces the load.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Load adjusting means is preferably provided that adjusts the degree by which the reducing means reduces the load. In this case, a proper load can be obtained at measurement.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The tilt arm preferably has an arcuate portion the center of which coincides with the center of the tilt arm, and the arcuate portion is preferably received in a hole in an apparatus cover. This prevents the tilt arm from moving toward the opening face in the hole formed in the cover. Accordingly, the size of the hole in the cover can be reduced to prevent entry of coolant.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The tilt arm and the link each preferably have an arcuate portion the center of which coincides with the center of the tilt arm and the center of the link, and the arcuate portions are preferably each received in a hole in an apparatus cover. As in the previous case, this prevents the tilt arm and the link from moving toward the opening face in the holes formed in the cover.

Thus, even if the tilt arm 28 is tilted, the distance between the gauge 46 of the measuring device 41 and the outer circumferential surface of the grindstones 15A, 15B is maintained constant. Therefore, the position of the gauge 46 relative to the crankpin 23a can be easily adjusted without performing complicated computations. Thus, even if the crankpin 23a is orbiting when the rough-grinding is shifted to the finish-grinding, the measuring device 41 can be smoothly set on the crankpin 23a.

Therefore, by activating the servomotor 34, the standby position Pw of the gauge 46 of the measuring device 41 can be set to a position above and in the vicinity of the crankpin 23a of the crankshaft 23. Thus, the measuring device 41 can be moved from the home position Po to the standby position Pw during the rough-grinding. Also, switching of the measuring device 41 from the standby position Pw to the measurement position Ps and the reverse switching, that is, the gauge application and gauge disengagement can be quickly performed in a short distance even if the type of the crankshaft 23 varies. Accordingly, the outer diameter of the crankpin 23a can be quickly measured, and the impact due to the gauge application is reduced. Further, the standby position Pw is adjusted according to the type of the crankshaft 23 so as to reduce the distance between the standby position Pw and the measurement position Ps.
