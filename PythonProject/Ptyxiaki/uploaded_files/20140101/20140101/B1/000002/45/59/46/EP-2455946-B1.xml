Indeed, as known, the peristaltic pump is nothing more than a rotating projection caused by the action of an electric motor which periodically pushes on the duct so that the fluid in the duct is encouraged to cross the duct. It is apparent that the only means which allow the flow rate of the fluid in the duct to be regulated consist in regulating the speed of rotation of the projection which pushes on the duct, and as known, such regulation is coarse. Furthermore, the above-described plant has further problems if further fluids,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> such as e.g. a buffer fluid, are to be added to the radioactive fluid before being conveyed towards the bottle. Lastly, it is worth noting that making the aforesaid plant even more problematic to use is that the different ducts and the above-mentioned shielded container are to be subjected to a thorough washing by means of e.g. water and/or ethanol. The use of peristaltic pumps which, as is known, are apparatuses which allow conveying fluids under low pressure, is capable of achieving perfect and thorough washing.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The relevant prior art is illustrated by each of the documents <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2008083313A2"><text>WO-A2- 2008/083313</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2006349649A"><text>JP-A- 2006 349649</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2005343798A"><text>JP-A-2005 343798</text></patcit>.

Moreover, all the filling steps are controlled and extremely accurate filling is obtained because it is possible to control the quantity of fluids conveyed by means of the solenoid valves, the valves and the pressure regulator, and furthermore the quantity of mixture emitted into the bottle is measured moment by moment. It is worth noting that not only is accurate filling controlled, but the effectiveness is also controlled of certain organs in the kit such as e.g. filter 36. It is also worth noting that the action of the inert gas under pressure not only conveys the mixture but also obtains an effective homogenization of the components in the mixture. Lastly, it is worth noting that washing the aforesaid kit is periodically and always automatically obtained with the same plant.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56978675" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Verfahren zum Befüllen einer Flasche (2) mit einem auf einer radioaktiven Flüssigkeit basierenden Gemisch, wobei das Verfahren Folgendes umfasst:
