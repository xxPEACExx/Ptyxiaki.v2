While complete elimination of the noise generated by a tread pattern may not be currently feasible, the reduction or optimization of the noise level generated by a tread pattern is desirable. Such treatment of the noise level can improve passenger comfort and, therefore, customer satisfaction.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Unfortunately, the precise mechanism by which sound is created by a tread during tire operation is both complex and perhaps not yet completely explored. The investigation of the physics behind tread noise is further complicated by the subjective nature of the inquiry i.e., differences of opinion may arise regarding the acceptability of both the type and level of noise created. Additionally, a substantial expense can arise in the manufacture and noise testing of tires having different proposed tread patterns due to e.g., new mold costs and the modification of molds between different patterns being tested.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Approaches for confronting the difficulties of designing tread patterns with acceptable noise levels have been proposed. For example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4727501A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,727,501</text></patcit>, entitled "Method of Simulating Tire Tread Noise and Apparatus," describes transforming a proposed tread pattern from a digitized format to an analog signal that is subsequently<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> converted into sound for a subjective, aural evaluation. The procedure is intended to allow for a more economical evaluation of the noise created with different tread patterns by providing an approach that avoids the expense of constructing a mold and curing a tire for each tread pattern being tested. A sound representative of a proposed tread pattern is generated for subjective consideration without necessarily constructing an actual tire bearing the tread pattern. However, the particular design modifications that should be undertaken to improve the noise associated with a given tread pattern are not described.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US4788651A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,788,651</text></patcit>, entitled "Method for Improving Tread Noise by Relative Rotation of a Rib and Simulating the Effect Thereof," describes the application of <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US4727501A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,727,501</text></patcit> in order to improve the noise level associated with a tread having ribs. After a sound representative of a particular tread pattern has been generated, a rib of the tire tread is rotated relative to the other ribs to determine if an improvement results in the noise level associated with the tread pattern. Modifications to the tread pattern of any particular rib are not described. The analysis is also based on an assumption that the ribs do not significantly interact with each other. Additionally, application to tire treads that do not have ribs is also not indicated or described.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Accordingly, a method for improving tire tread noise would be useful. A method that also avoids the construction of multiple molds and tires bearing the tread patterns being tested would also be useful. A method that indicates the location and nature of modifications that can be made to improve the noise created by the operation of a particular tread pattern - including a pattern that does not include ribs - would be particularly useful.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">Objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention. In one exemplary aspect of the invention, a method for improving the tread noise created by a tire is provided. For purposes of reference, it will be understood that the tread pattern defines a circumferential direction. Accordingly, the method includes the steps of selecting a portion of the tread pattern for evaluation, determining the variation in contact length ratio along the circumferential direction for the selected portion of the tread pattern, and reducing the variation in contact length ratio by modifying the tread pattern. These steps<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> of selecting, determining, and reducing may also be repeated until an acceptable variation in contact length ratio is achieved for the selected portion of the tread pattern.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The method may also include additional steps and modifications. For example, the determining step may include calculating the contact length ratio at each point along the circumferential direction of the selected portion of the tread pattern and/or mapping the selected portion of the tread pattern. The determining step of this exemplary method of the present invention may also include mapping the selected portion of the tread pattern, calculating the contact length ratio at each point along the circumferential direction of the mapped tread portion of the tread pattern, and plotting the results of the calculating step for each point along the circumferential direction of the mapped tread portion of the tread pattern.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The reducing step may further include adding contact surfaces to the tread pattern at one or more points along the circumferential direction of the selected portion based on the variations in contact length ratio provided by the determining step. In addition or in alternative thereto, the reducing step may include removing contact surfaces from the tread pattern at one or more points along the circumferential direction of the selected portion based on the variations in contact length ratio provided by the determining step.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">This exemplary method of the present invention may also include the step of determining the point along the circumferential direction of the selected portion of the tread pattern at which maximum variation in the contact length ratio occurs. Similarly, the method may include a step of determining the point along the circumferential direction of the selected portion of the tread pattern at which minimum variation in the contact length ratio occurs.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Various portions of the tread pattern may be selected for treatment by this exemplary method of the present invention. For example, one pitch of the tread pattern may be selected. However, other portions of the tread pattern may be selected as well.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">While the contact length ratio may be defined variously as discussed herein, in one exemplary aspect of the present invention the contact length ratio at given point along the circumferential direction of the tread pattern is defined as <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><msub><mi mathvariant="italic">CLR</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mmultiscripts><msub><mo>/</mo><mi>n</mi></msub><mprescripts/><none/><msub><mi>C</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mmultiscripts></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="39" he="18" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>

The method includes the steps of determining contact length ratios along a selected portion of the tread, comparing the contact length ratios to determine locations of maximum and minimum variations in the contact length ratios along a circumferential direction of the tread, and optimizing the noise to be produced in operation of the tire tread by modifying the maximum and minimum variations in the contact length ratios. The optimizing step may include modifying the tread pattern so as to change the contact length ratios at the locations of the maximum and minimum variations. For example, the optimizing step may include adding contact surfaces to the tread pattern at one or more locations along the circumferential direction, reducing contact surfaces of the tread pattern at one or more locations along the circumferential direction, or both. The steps of determining, comparing, and optimizing may be repeated until acceptable variations in contact length ratios are achieved for the selected portion of the tread pattern.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention also includes a tire bearing a tread pattern constructed using any of the methods of the present invention.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims.

num="0026">The present invention provides a method of improving tire tread noise including an identification of one or more specific locations where particular modifications can be made in order to optimize the tread noise associated with a subject tread pattern. For purposes of describing the invention, reference now will be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment, can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As used herein, "pitch" means a section of the tread pattern in the circumferential direction that is repeated around the outer circumference of the tire.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">While the precise mechanism by which a tread pattern generates noise during tire operation can still be further explored, the inventors believe there are at least two reasons noise is generated. First, the air that is within the grooves of the tread pattern as well as the air surrounding those grooves is compressed and pushed out of the grooves as the tire rolls along a road surface. Second, contact between the tire tread and the road surface excites the tire - including the tread features - which in turn creates sound by inducing vibration or waves in the air. Part of the inventors' discovery is that by minimizing variation in the contact between the tread and the surface (i.e. road surface), the noise generated by a tire tread can be substantially improved.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> illustrates a tire tread 100 arbitrarily chosen for an improvement in tire tread noise. Tread 100 may be an image of a pattern taken from an actual tire for which noise improvement is sought. Alternatively, tread 100 may be an image of a proposed pattern for which tread noise optimization is desirable. In such case, the image of the proposed pattern can be optimized as described herein before construction of molds or actual tires bearing the proposed pattern. Accordingly, substantial savings in the development of a tread pattern can be accomplished using the present invention.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Line OL represents the outline of the area of the tire tread that is in contact with the road surface (i.e., footprint) when operating under a load with the tire supported on a flat road surface. The top line LE represents the leading edge of the footprint while the bottom line represents the trailing edge TE of the footprint. As the tire rolls forward during operation, the tire tread can be considered to continuously enter the outline OL of the footprint along leading edge LE while exiting the outline OL along the trailing edge TE. Along leading edge LE, each point on the surface of a block (such as block 105) will impact the road surface while all points along the grooves (such as groove 110) will not impact the road surface.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The image of tread 100 can be digitized into pixels (or e.g., points) with each pixel along leading edge LE represented by a single pixel. This model allows the determination of how much physical contact is occurring between the tread and the road surface along the leading edge LE as the tire rolls along the road surface. For example, the amount of impact of tread 100 at each location <i>i</i> along the circumferential direction C can be defined herein as the contact length ratio or CLR and can be determined by the following equation: <maths id="math0002" num=""><math display="block"><msub><mi mathvariant="italic">CLR</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mmultiscripts><msub><mo>/</mo><mi>n</mi></msub><mprescripts/><none/><msub><mi>C</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mmultiscripts></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="64" he="14" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In equation 1, CLR<i><sub>i</sub></i> represents the contact length ratio at a given location <i>i</i> along the circumferential direction C of the tire, C<i><sub>i</sub></i> represents the total number of pixels (or points) on the block surface along the leading edge LE at a given location <i>i</i> along the circumferential direction, and n represents the total number of pixels (or points) on the leading edge LE. Accordingly, a higher CLR value for a given cross section at a location <i>i</i> along the circumferential direction represents a lower amount of contact between the tread pattern and<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the road surface while a lower CLR values represents a higher amount of contact between the tread pattern and the road surface. A slick tire, such as a racing tire, will have no variation in CLR and, therefore, no noise generated by a tread pattern.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Other equations can be created for calculating CLR. For example, the CLR at a given location <i>i</i> (CLR<i><sub>i</sub></i>) - could be equated directly with the fraction in equation 1. While various calculations could be used, the objective is to determine a CLR<i><sub>i</sub></i> such that it provides a measurement of how much physical contact is occurring between the tread and the road surface for the leading edge LE at a given point along the circumferential direction as the tire rolls along the road surface.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The inventors have determined that the variation in CLR<i><sub>i</sub></i> along the circumferential direction is the main source of tire tread noise. In other words, the variation in the amount of physical contact between the tread and the road surface along the leading edge LE as the tire moves by rotation along the surface is a primary contributor to tread noise. The calculation of CLR at each point along the circumferential direction can be expressed mathematically as follows: <maths id="math0003" num=""><math display="block"><msub><mi mathvariant="italic">CLR</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mspace width="1em"/><mi>where</mi><mspace width="1em"/><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>,</mo><mo>…</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">N</mi></math><img id="ib0003" file="imgb0003.tif" wi="83" he="10" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
where N represents the number of locations along the circumferential direction of the tread pattern that are selected for determination of CLR. The value ofN can be chosen arbitrarily such that any length of the subject tread pattern can be evaluated for tread noise optimization. For example, N can be selected so that a single pitch of the tread pattern is evaluated. However, other portions of the tread pattern may also be selected. Regardless, minimizing the variation in CLR<i><sub>i</sub></i> along the circumferential direction of the tread pattern can reduce the level of tread noise associated with such tread pattern. Exemplary methods of using CLR to minimize such variation are now described.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref> represents a single pitch of tread pattern 100 with line LE again representing the leading edge of the footprint when the tire is operating under load. To aid the analysis developed by the inventors, <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2B</figref> represents the same pitch of tread pattern 100 but the pattern has been shifted - referring to herein as "mapped" or "mapping" - in order to represent leading edge LE as a straight line. Accordingly, a cross-section at each location <i>i</i> along the circumferential direction eventually represents the leading edge LE of<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> tread 100 as the tire rolls along the road surface. For each such cross-section at each location <i>i</i>, a CLR<i><sub>i</sub></i> can be calculated as described above.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">For purposes of evaluation, the variation in CLR<i><sub>i</sub></i> for a given pitch of tread 100 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2A and 2B</figref> can be calculated in several different ways. For example, the variation can be obtained by calculating CLR<i><sub>i</sub></i> at each location <i>i</i> along a given pitch of tread pattern 100, subtracting the average CLR for the entire pitch, and then multiplying the result by 100. Alternatively, and by way of further example, the variation for each point i could be determined by calculating CLR<i><sub>i</sub></i> at each location i along a given pitch of tread pattern 100, subtracting the lowest CLR<i><sub>i</sub></i> for the entire pitch, and then multiplying the result by 100.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><maths id="math0004" num=""><math display="block"><msub><mi>CLR</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">variation at i</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfenced separators=""><msub><mi>CLR</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>CLR</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">minimum</mi></msub></mfenced><mo>*</mo><mn>100</mn></math><img id="ib0004" file="imgb0004.tif" wi="92" he="10" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
where CLR<i><sub>variation at i</sub></i> represents the CLR variation at each point <i>i</i> along the selected portion of the tread, CLR<i><sub>i</sub></i> represents the contact length ratio at a given location <i>i</i> along the circumferential direction C of the tire, and CLR<i><sub>minimum</sub></i> represents the smallest value of CLR<i><sub>i</sub></i> calculated along the selected tread portion. The approach in equation 3 was used to calculate the CLR variation for illustration here, which is shown in the plot of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2C</figref>. Regardless of approach, the objective is to provide a means by which the variation in CLR<i><sub>i</sub></i> values across a given portion of the tread pattern - such as a single pitch - can be analyzed. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2D</figref> provides the harmonic contents to the CLR variation shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2C. Figs. 2B and 2C</figref> are placed side by side so that the reader can compare the mapped tread pattern 100 directly with the CLR variation for such pattern.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2C</figref>, tread pattern 100 has significant variations in CLR values across the pitch shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2A and 2B</figref>. For example, the maximum CLR variation is about 35 and multiple peaks and valleys are present along the curve. These peaks and valleys correspond to locations in the tread pattern where the tread pattern has relatively more voids (i.e. grooves) or relatively more contact surfaces (i.e. blocks or other contacts).</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The peak at about 3 5, for example, represents a point in tread pattern 100 along circumferential direction C where the highest voids are present. In order to reduce CLR variation, and therefore tread noise, tread pattern 100 should be modified at this location in a manner that reduces the voids and provides more contact surfaces. Conversely, the valley at<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> about 0 represents the point where the highest amount of contact surface is present in tread pattern 100. Thus, in order to reduce CLR variation, and therefore tread noise, tread pattern 100 should be modified at this location in a manner that increases the voids and reduces the amount of contact surfaces. Upon making modifications to the tread pattern 100 in this manner, the CLR variation can then be recalculated and the process repeated until the CLR variation is reduced to an acceptable level.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is provided to further illustrate the process of modifying a tread pattern in order to reduce tread noise by reducing the CLR variation. Specifically, tread 100 again represents a reference design for which modification to reduce tread noise is proposed. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the pattern of tread 100 has been mapped so that each leading edge LE that is created as the tire rolls across the ground surface can be represented as a straight line.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Tread 115 represents a modification of tread 100 in order to reduce the CLR variation. More specifically, in the modified design, lateral grooves in region 1 have been further disconnected and are oriented more towards a circumferential (i.e. vertical as viewed on the page) direction. In region 2, the right side of the lateral grooves has been shifted downward and the left side of the grooves are more circumferentially (i.e. vertically) oriented. The lateral groove width on the right side of region 2 has also been reduced. Region 3 has been modified according to the changes made to region 2.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Still referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, plot 120 represents the new calculation of CLR variation for the modified tread pattern 115. As shown, for example, the new maximum CLR variation for modified tread pattern 115 is now 26, which is significantly less than the value of about 35 that was calculated for tread pattern 100. <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> represents the process of reverse mapping the modified tread pattern 115 in order to illustrate and thereby visualize the actual tread pattern 125 that results from adjusting the CLR variation as described herein.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Accordingly, using the methodology described herein to reduce the CLR variation, the inventors proposed four new tread patterns based on modification of tread pattern 100 in order to optimize the CLR variation and, therefore, tread noise.

A visual determination of the changes to create the new tread patterns can be determined by comparison with the reference tread pattern 100 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. Each new pattern was mapped in order to represent leading edge LE as a straight line as previously described. The mapped patterns are shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 5B</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0005">6B</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0006">7B</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0007">8B</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Using the methods described herein, the CLR variation of each proposed pattern 500, 600, 700 and 800 was calculated and plotted as set forth in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 5C</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0005">6C</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0006">7C</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0007">8C</figref> respectively.

Thus, the CLR variation of the original tread 100 has been reduced and, in the case of tread pattern 800, the reduction is very substantial. Therefore, the changes to the tread patterns successfully reduced the CLR variation. It should be understood that the process could be repeated iteratively for each pattern in an effort to achieve additional CLR variation reductions if desired.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">As stated, the harmonic content of the CLR variation of each proposed new pattern 500, 600, 700, and 800 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 5D</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0005">6D</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0006">7D</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0007">8D</figref>. In selecting among the patterns, a designer may wish to consider the harmonics of the CLR variation as well as the CLR variation itself. For example, <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 8C</figref> indicates a low CLR variation for pattern 800 but <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 8D</figref> reveals a relatively large contribution from the fourth harmonic. Accordingly, for certain applications, pattern 800 may not be the most appropriate despite the lower CLR variation and pattern 500 or 700 might be chosen instead. Alternatively, the designer might try another iteration of different modifications to tread pattern 100 to create yet additional new patterns also having a lower CLR variation but with different harmonics.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Tires having substantially the tread patterns of treads 100, 500, 600, 700, and 800 were constructed and a vehicle coast-by noise test was conducted as defined by the <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Directive 2001/43/EC of the European Parliament of the Council of June 27, 2001</text></nplcit>. <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 9</figref> provides a plot of the CLR variation for the referenced and proposed designs versus the measured coast-by noise.
