Refineries in the petroleum industry, and methanol, cyclohexane, and ammonia plants in the chemical industry consume considerable quantities of hydrogen during processes for the production of gasoline, fertilizers and other chemical products. As environmental regulations demand cleaner, renewable and non-polluting processes and products, most of the hydrogen balances at petroleum refineries are becoming negative. As laws mandate lower aromatics in gasoline and diesel fuels, H<sub>2</sub> is now consumed in aromatic saturation and thus, less H<sub>2</sub> is available as a by-product. At the same time, H<sub>2</sub> consumption is increasing in hydro-treating units in the refineries because many of these same laws require lower sulfur levels in fuels.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Hydrogen can be obtained as a byproduct in the catalytic reforming of naphtha. In particular, significant amounts of hydrogen can be obtained during dehydrocyclization of naphtha in selective processes such as the Aromax™ process. Hydrogen is also obtained by steam reforming methane or mixtures of hydrocarbons, a reaction which produces synthesis gas which comprises hydrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (CO). Synthesis gas represents one of the most important feedstocks of the chemical and petroleum industries. It is used to synthesize basic chemicals, such as methanol or oxyaldehydes, as well as for the production of ammonia and pure hydrogen. However, synthesis gas produced by the steam reforming of hydrocarbons does not meet the requirements for further use in some processes because the CO/H<sub>2</sub> ratio is too high. Therefore it is industrial practice to reduce or adjust the CO content in the syngas by conversion with steam in what is often referred to as the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction. In some instances it is desired to increase the CO content. This reaction is called the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">To improve H<sub>2</sub> yield and also the operating efficiency of carbon monoxide conversion, the water-gas shift reaction is extensively used in commercial hydrogen or ammonia plants. The reaction can be described as:<br/>
<br/>
         CO + H<sub>2</sub>O ⇆ CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub><br/>
<br/>
</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The water-gas shift reaction is usually divided into a high temperature process and a low temperature process. The high temperature process is generally carried out at temperatures within the range of between about 350 and about 400 degrees C. The low temperature water-gas shift reaction typically takes place between about 180 and about 240 degrees C.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">While lower temperatures favor more complete carbon monoxide conversion, higher temperatures allow recovery of the heat of reaction at a sufficient temperature level to generate high pressure steam. For maximum efficiency and economy of operation, many plants contain a high temperature reaction unit for bulk carbon monoxide conversion and heat recovery and a low temperature reaction unit for final carbon monoxide conversion.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Chromium-promoted iron catalysts have been used in the high temperature process at temperatures above about 350 degrees C to reduce the CO content to about 3-4% (see, for example, <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>D. S. Newsom, Catal. Rev., 21, p. 275 (1980</text></nplcit>)). As is known from the literature (see for example, <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>H. Topsoe and M. Boudart, J. Catal., 31, p. 346 (1973</text></nplcit>)), the chromium oxide promoter combines two functions. It serves to enhance catalytic activity and acts as a heat stabilizer, i.e., it increases the heat stability of magnetite, the active form of the catalyst, and prevents unduly rapid deactivation.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Unfortunately, when chromium is used, especially in hexavalent form, expenditures must be incurred to guarantee worker safety both during production and handling of the catalyst. Despite special efforts health hazards cannot be fully ruled out. In addition, the spent catalyst ultimately poses a hazard to man and the environment and must be disposed of with allowance for the government regulations relating to highly toxic waste. An example of an iron containing catalyst for this purpose that avoids the use of chromium is <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="USP5830425A"><text>USP 5,830,425</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Catalysts used for the water-gas shift reaction at low temperature (or so-called low temperature shift reaction) in industry generally contain copper oxide,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> zinc oxide and aluminum oxide. Because these catalysts operate at relatively low temperature, they generate equilibrium carbon monoxide concentrations of less than 0.3% in the exit gas stream over an active low temperature shift catalyst. However, carbon monoxide conversion and hydrogen yield gradually decreases during normal operations as a result of deactivation of the catalyst. Deactivation can be caused by sintering and poisoning such as by traces of chloride and sulfur compounds in the feed and the hydrothermal environment of the reaction. The rate of the hydrothermal deactivation, in particular, is dependent on reaction conditions such as the temperature, the steam to gas ratio and composition of the feed gas mixture, and the formulation and manufacturing process of the catalyst.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Although copper is physically and physicochemically stabilized by both zinc oxide and aluminum oxide attempts of further stabilization of the catalyst have been made as is taught in the art. Sintering of copper crystallites is still thought to be a significant cause for deactivation/aging of the catalyst, especially when there are very low concentrations of poisons in the feed. For example, the copper crystallite size of a fresh catalyst can range from 30-100 angstroms in contrast with 100-1,000 angstroms for a discharged spent catalyst. Low temperature shift catalysts thus need to be improved with regard to both activity and stability.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Another use for hydrogen that is becoming increasingly important is as a feedstock to a fuel cell to generate electricity. The Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell is one of the most promising fuel cell designs and PEM fuel cells are already commercially available in limited applications. PEM fuel cells as well as several other fuel cell designs currently in development require hydrogen as a feedstock along with oxygen. Processes being considered to supply the needed hydrogen include Steam Reforming, Partial Oxidation (POX), Autothermal Reforming, and variations thereof. Most such processes for hydrogen generation also produce Carbon Monoxide (CO). Yet many Fuel Cells, in particular PEM fuel cells, cannot tolerate CO and in fact can be poisoned by small amounts of CO. The water-gas shift reaction can be used to generate additional hydrogen and convert the CO into the more inert CO<sub>2</sub>. Many fuel cells types including PEM fuel cells can tolerate CO<sub>2</sub> although it can act as a diluent. Alternatively some or all of the CO<sub>2</sub> can be removed from the H<sub>2</sub> feed to the fuel cell.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Another method of removing unwanted traces of CO from a hydrogen stream is by the use of CO oxidation to form CO<sub>2</sub>. Examples of patents that use CO<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> oxidation for reducing the amount of CO in a reformate gas are <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="USP6332901B"><text>USP 6,332,901</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="USP6287529B"><text>USP 6,287,529</text></patcit>,<patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="USP6299995B"><text>USP 6,299,995</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="USP6350423A"><text>USP 6,350,423</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As mentioned above one of the most common methods for the hydrogen production using hydrocarbons is the steam reforming process or variations thereof. The main process step involves the reaction of steam with a hydrocarbon over a catalyst at about 800°C to produce hydrogen and carbon oxides. It is typically followed by several additional steps to remove impurities and carbon oxide byproducts (particularly CO) as well as to maximize hydrogen production. In the water-gas shift reaction carbon monoxide reacts with steam to produce carbon dioxide and additional hydrogen. This is often done in two steps. The high temperature shift (HTS) reaction usually runs at about 350°C and reduces CO levels to about 1%-2%. The low temperature shift (LTS) reaction runs at about 200°C and reduces the amount of CO down to about 0.1%-0.2%. In both cases, ideally the reaction is run in an excess of steam and at the lowest temperature possible to achieve the target conversion. Conventional iron/chromium-containing HTS catalysts are inactive below about 300°C and copper/zinc-containing LTS catalysts lose the activity above about 250°C. Both the HTS and LTS catalysts require in-situ reduction treatments and are extremely air sensitive. All currently available LTS catalysts are either pyrophoric or have a relatively low activity. Some of them are based on expensive precious metals such as Platinum (Pt), Palladium (Pd), and Rhodium (Rh). The pyrophoric nature of LTS catalysts contributes to an unacceptably rapid deactivation rate.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the preparation of hydrogen for fuel cells, the WGS reaction zone can be the largest component of the fuel processor affecting its size, weight and performance factors such as its start-up time. Therefore, a WGS catalyst is needed which is air stable, low cost, and has high long term activity. In addition a WGS method that can operate over a wider temperature window without deactivation is needed. Furthermore a catalyst that can have high activity for WGS and/or CO oxidation is highly desired.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0002"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention provides a method for oxidizing CO according to claim 1. Also disclosed is a method for making hydrogen, a catalyst useful in said methods and a method of making the catalyst. Accordingly, disclosed is a method for making hydrogen comprising contacting in a water-gas shift reaction zone a feed comprising carbon monoxide and water under water-gas shift conditions with an effective catalytic amount of a catalyst comprising highly dispersed Group 1B metal such as gold on a sulfated zirconia, and collecting from the water-gas shift reaction zone an effluent comprising hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The method for making hydrogen utilizes an effective amount of a catalyst comprising gold highly dispersed on sulfated zirconia and optionally promoters. A broad disclosure of the method of making hydrogen provides a method of converting CO, comprising:
<ul><li>passing a feed comprising CO, over a catalyst comprising highly dispersed gold on sulfated zirconia, at conversion conditions, to produce an effluent comprising a reduced level of CO.</li></ul></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The method of the invention uses a catalyst composition useful in water-gas shift reactions and/or CO oxidation reactions which comprises highly dispersed gold on sulfated zirconia. The catalyst used in the present invention is particularly useful because it is non-pyrophoric and can be exposed to air without rapidly deactivating. Surprisingly, the catalyst used in the present invention is also not significantly affected by moisture. The catalyst and methods disclosed surprisingly are highly effective for both low temperature and high temperature water-gas shift reactions as well as CO oxidation. Furthermore the catalyst is highly stable and is much less prone to deactivation than prior catalysts. The low deactivation rate of the method of the present invention is thought to be due at least in part to the sulfating. Prior WGS processes and catalysts are typically effective for either high temperature water-gas shift or low temperature water-gas shift but not both. The method of making hydrogen provides excellent CO conversion in the water-gas shift reaction over a wide range of process conditions. The excellent performance is seen at conditions comprising a surprising range of temperatures and space velocities. Also disclosed is a catalyst suitable for use in a water-gas shift reaction to produce hydrogen from CO and H<sub>2</sub>O, comprising:<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> -->
<ol><li>(1) sulfated zirconia having a sulfur content of between 0.02 and 1.0 wt % based on the weight of zirconia;</li><li>(2) gold highly dispersed in the zirconia; and</li></ol>
wherein the gold content is between 0.001 and 4.0 wt % based on the weight of zirconia.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Also disclosed are a WGS method, a CO oxidation method, a WGS catalyst, and a method of making the catalyst that has enhanced performance over prior methods and catalysts. In particular these methods and catalyst are usable under both high temperature and low temperature shift conditions. In addition the catalyst and methods have a particularly low deactivation rate. The fact that the catalyst and methods are usable under both HT and LT shift conditions makes them uniquely well suited for use in a fuel processor used for making hydrogen for use in a fuel cell. In such a fuel processor high conversion to hydrogen in the WGS reaction is required and very low levels of CO in the product hydrogen is essential. The methods and catalyst help achieve both of those requirements - high conversion to H<sub>2</sub> and low levels of effluent CO.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Still further disclosed is that the catalyst can be used in both high temperature shift and low temperature shift conditions in order to maximize the conversion of CO in the overall process. To this end, a feed comprising CO and water is passed over a catalyst comprising gold on sulfated zirconia (zirconium oxide) at high temperature water-gas shift conditions to produce an effluent having a reduced CO content. At least a portion of said effluent is passed over a catalyst comprising gold on sulfated zirconia at low temperature water-gas shift conditions to produce a second effluent comprising hydrogen and carbon dioxide.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Also disclosed is the use of the method and catalyst disclosed above in producing hydrogen by the water-gas shift reaction for use in a PEM fuel cell.

This can be done in discrete zones where one zone is at HT shift conditions and another zone is at LT shift conditions. Alternatively the water-gas shift reaction can be carried out in a zone or zones having a continuum of conditions including both HT and LT shift conditions.

The catalyst, which is also used in the invention, shows substantially higher activity and stability when compared to other catalysts. The catalyst used in the present invention comprises highly dispersed Gold on a crystalline sulfated zirconia support optionally in association with modifiers and additives such as, for example Group I, Group II and rare earth oxides.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Surprisingly we have discovered that unusually active and stable WGS catalysts can be prepared when sulfated zirconia is used for the catalyst preparation. The presence of sulfate is critical for making the catalyst used in the present invention with its<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> outstanding performance. In a preferred embodiment of the catalyst used in the present invention it has been found that the sulfur level should be at least 0.02 wt% based on the weight of zirconia (also referred to as zirconium oxide or ZrO<sub>2</sub>). Preferably the sulfur level of the catalyst should be between 0.02 and 4.0 wt % based on the weight of zirconium oxide more preferably between 0.02 and 3.5 wt %, still more preferably between 0.02 and 2.5 wt % and most preferably between 0.02 and 1 wt % based on the wt of the zirconium oxide.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">We have further discovered that the catalyst used in the present invention can operate in what is considered to be high temperature shift range down into the low and even ultra low temperature range. Thus the method of the present invention when using the novel catalyst is able to operate over a temperature range from about 100 degrees C to about 500 degrees C.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In a typical preparation, the catalysts used in this invention are prepared by an aqueous gold deposition onto a calcined sulfated zirconia support. This is usually followed by drying in air at around ambient temperature or slightly higher, e.g., about 35°C. Prior to use the catalyst is generally activated in the reactor under nitrogen at 250°C for about 2 hours.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Not wishing to be bound by any particular theory we believe that it is extremely important to keep Group 1 B metal from reducing to a zero valence metal state during the Group 1 B metal deposition process. Also it is believed that the sulfated zirconia support plays a critical role in keeping gold well dispersed. Additionally it is believed that it is advantageous for at least some of the zirconia to be in the tetragonal phase.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">As discussed above highly dispersed Gold is an essential feature of the catalyst used in the present invention.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention a majority of the zirconia in the catalyst should be in the tetragonal phase, more preferably the zirconia should be predominately in the tetragonal phase. The phase of the zirconia can be determined by the PXRD (Powder X-Ray Diffraction) pattern of the catalyst sample.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> The X-ray diffraction pattern can be used to determine the phase of the zirconia due to the different phases exhibit characteristic lines in the pattern.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">It was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) that the catalysts of this invention most preferably have no detectable gold particles after gold deposition and drying steps. In the catalyst and method of the present invention the gold loading of the catalyst should be at least 0.001 wt % based on the weight of zirconium oxide in the catalyst. Preferably the gold loading of the catalyst should be between 0.001 and 5.0 wt % , more preferably between 0.001 and 4.0 wt%, still more preferably between 0.01 and 3.0 wt % , even more preferably between 0.1 and 3.0 wt %, and most preferably between 0.1 and 2.0 wt % based on the weight of zirconium oxide in the catalyst.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Another important feature of the catalyst used in the present invention is that the gold be very highly dispersed on the catalyst. The methods for gold loading described in the Detailed Description of the Present Invention and in the Examples can lead to a very highly dispersed catalyst. Activation conditions must also be carefully selected to avoid agglomeration of the gold (or other Group 1B metal) and loss of the very high dispersion. It is preferred that at least 80 wt % of the gold be dispersed in particles of less than 1.0 x 10<sup>-9</sup> metres (10 angstroms) when measured by TEM. More preferably at least 90 wt % of the gold should be dispersed in particles of less than 1.0 x 10<sup>-9</sup> metres (10 angstroms) when measured by TEM. Most preferably there should be no detectable gold particles on the catalyst after gold deposition and drying steps when examined by TEM and SEM. In the present application the phrase no detectable gold particles means essentially no particles having an approximate diameter above about 7 x 10<sup>-10</sup> m to 9 x 10<sup>-10</sup> m (7 to 9 angstroms).</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">There is a trade off between the amount of surface area and stabiliy of the sulfated zirconia support. So it is important that the zirconia surface area of the sulfated zirconia support be carefully controlled. The BET (Brunauer, Emmett, Teller) surface area of the sulfated zirconia support should be at least 5 m<sup>2</sup>/g, preferably at least 10 m<sup>2</sup>/g, more preferably between 10 and 500 m<sup>2</sup>/g, still more preferably between 30 and 250 m<sup>2</sup>/g and most preferably between 50 and 100 m<sup>2</sup>/g.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> The BET surface area can be determined using ASTM D 4567 (volume 5.03) or ASTM D 3663.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">As mentioned above it is also critical to the present invention that the catalyst comprise sulfated zirconia. It has been found that by employing the sulfated catalyst described above that the method of the present invention displayed surprisingly low deactivation rates.

The structural support can be in any form including for example monolith, spheres, or hollow cylinders. More specifically the structural support material can additionally include "supports" such as alumina, silica, silica-alumina, silicate, alumino-silicate, magnesia, zeolite, active carbon, titanium oxide, thorium oxide, clay and any combination of these supports. In one embodiment of the present invention preferably, the invention's catalyst can contain between 50% and 95% by weight of structural support, on which 5% to 50% of sulfated zirconia by weight is deposited.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The catalyst has been found to be effective at a surprisingly broad range of temperatures. The water-gas shift reaction can be carried out between 100 and 500 °C preferably between 135 and 420 °C. It is understood by one of skill in the art that as catalysts become less active the reaction temperature may be increased to achieve a target conversion. However, increasing temperatures leads to an increased concentration of CO due to a shift in equilibrium.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Space velocities useable in the method of the present invention as measured by gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) are between 1000h<sup>-1</sup> to 200,000h<sup>-1</sup>, preferably between 10,000h<sup>-1</sup> to 100,000h<sup>-1</sup>, more preferably between 25,000h<sup>-1</sup> to 100,000h<sup>-1</sup>. It is understood by one of skill that the space velocity can be decreased to compensate for lower activity.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">As mentioned above the disclosed method of making hydrogen can include a CO oxidation zone in order to reduce the level of<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> CO in the H<sub>2</sub> such that it is suitable for use in a fuel cell such as a PEM fuel cell. A potential advantage is that the WGS method can be used to convert most of the CO while also making hydrogen and leaving only a small amount or trace amount of CO to be oxidized in the CO oxidation zone. This means that the CO oxidation zone can be smaller in size and can further reduce the size and complexity of a fuel processor system. An example of a fuel processor that includes a combination partial oxidation/steam reforming zone, WGS zone, and CO oxidation zone is shown in <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="USP6521204B"><text>USP 6,521,204</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The present invention provides a method for CO oxidation.
