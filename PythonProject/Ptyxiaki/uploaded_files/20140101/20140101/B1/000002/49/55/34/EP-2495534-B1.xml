In some examples, the techniques may use arithmetic operations to generate one or more signals that vary with respect to the parameter value in a substantially linear fashion over one or more intervals of the parameter value. The one or more linearly varying signals may be used to produce an output signal where each value of the output signals maps to a unique parameter value.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In a first example, two different sets of arithmetic operations may be used to generate two different signals that vary in a substantially linear fashion with respect to the parameter value in different parameter value intervals. These signals may be referred to as candidate intermediate signals. The different parameter value intervals where the candidate intermediate signals are linear may overlap for one or more intervals of parameter values that define one or more overlap regions.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In some implementations of the first example, each candidate intermediate signal may be associated with a respective offset value. For a given overlap region, the sum of a first candidate intermediate signal and the offset value associated with the first candidate intermediate signal may be substantially equal to the sum of a second candidate intermediate signal and the offset value associated with the second candidate intermediate signal. A signal indicative of the half-phase occupied by the parameter value may used to select which of the two different candidate intermediate signals and associated offset values to use to generate the decoded output signal. Each transition between the two-half phases may be defined to occur within an interval of parameter values that defines a transition region. The set of parameter values that define a particular overlap region may encompass the set of parameter values that define a corresponding transition region. In other words, each parameter value within a transition region may be included within the set of parameter values that define a corresponding overlap<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> region. The transitions between half-phases, in some examples, may vary within a transition region due to an error tolerance within the sensor generating the signal indicative of the half-phase. By producing candidate intermediate signals and associated offset values that have substantially equal sums, a decoder device may be insensitive to such variances in the signal indicative of the half-phase.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In additional implementations of the first example, each candidate intermediate signal may be associated with two different offset values. For a given overlap region, the sum of a first candidate intermediate signal and one of the offset values associated with the first candidate intermediate signal may be substantially equal to the sum of a second candidate intermediate signal and one of the offset values associated with the second candidate intermediate signal. Two signals indicative of the half-phase occupied by the parameter value within different half-phase partitions may used to select which of the two different candidate intermediate signals and associated offset values to use to generate the decoded output signal. The signals taken together may provide quadrant information indicative of a quadrant occupied by the parameter value. Each transition between the four quadrants may be defined to occur within an interval of parameter values that defines a transition region. The set of parameter values that define a particular overlap region may encompass the set of parameter values that define a corresponding transition region. In other words, each parameter value within a transition region may be included within the set of parameter values that define a corresponding overlap region. The transitions between quadrants, in some examples, may vary within a transition region due to an error tolerance within the sensors generating the signals indicative of the half-phases.

Decoder device 10 is configured to generate a output signal 54 based on sinusoidal signal 48, sinusoidal signal 50 and half-phase signal 52. In some examples, sinusoidal signals 48 and 50 may vary sinusoidally with respect to a parameter value, and decoder device 10 may be configured to generate output<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> signal 54 such that output signal 54 varies in a substantially linear fashion with respect to the parameter value. Decoder device 10 includes an intermediate signal generator 12, an offset value selector 14 and a summation node 16.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Intermediate signal generator 12 is configured to generate an intermediate signal 56 based on sinusoidal signal 48, sinusoidal signal 50 and half-phase signal 52. Intermediate signal generator 12 includes a first input terminal electrically coupled to sinusoidal signal 48, a second input terminal electrically coupled to sinusoidal signal 50, and a third input terminal electrically coupled to half-phase signal 52. In some examples, intermediate signal generator 12 may include a fourth input terminal electrically coupled to offset value 58. In other examples, offset value 58 may be produced internally within intermediate signal generator 12. In any case, intermediate signal generator 12 may generate intermediate signal 56 based on offset value 58 in addition to sinusoidal signal 48 and sinusoidal signal 50.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Sinusoidal signals 48 and 50 may each vary sinusoidally with respect to a sensed parameter value. Together, sinusoidal signals 48 and 50 may be indicative of the parameter value. In some examples, the parameter value may be an angle within an angular spectrum, e.g., a 360 degree angular spectrum. For example, the angle may be indicative of the angular position of a magnetic field, a rotary, an electrical resolver, or any other type of information represented by an angle.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In some examples, sinusoidal signal 48 may vary with respect to the parameter value according to a first sinusoidal function and sinusoidal signal 50 may vary with respect to the parameter value according to a second sinusoidal function. As used herein, a sinusoidal function may refer to a function that oscillates like a sine function or a cosine function with respect to the parameter value. The sine function or cosine function may be shifted, stretched and/or compressed. Each of the sinusoidal functions associated with sinusoidal signal 48 and sinusoidal signal 50 may have a period and a phase. A period, as used herein, may refer to the length of an interval of parameter values that contains one full cycle or repetition of the sinusoidal function. The phase, as used herein, may refer to where in the oscillation cycle a particular sinusoidal function begins.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In further examples, the period of the first sinusoidal function may be substantially equal to the period of the second sinusoidal function. In additional examples, the phase of the first sinusoidal function may be different from the phase of the second sinusoidal function. The type of sinusoidal function for the first sinusoidal function may, in some examples, be different from the type of sinusoidal function for the second sinusoidal function. For example, the first sinusoidal function may be a sine wave and the second sinusoidal function may be a cosine wave. It is recognized, however, that each of these different types of sinusoidal functions may be rewritten as the same type of sinusoidal function with an appropriate phase shift.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As shown in the specific example of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, sinusoidal signal 48 varies with respect to a parameter value, θ, according to a sin θ sinusoidal function, and sinusoidal signal 50 varies with respect to the parameter value, θ, according to the cos θ sinusoidal function. Thus, in the specific example of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, sinusoidal signal 48 and sinusoidal signal 50 vary with respect to θ according to sinusoidal functions that have substantially equal periods of 360 degrees. Because the COS θ function is equivalent to a phase-shifted version of the sin θ function, sinusoidal signal 48 and sinusoidal signal 50 may be said to vary with respect to θ according to sinusoidal functions that have different phases.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the example configuration shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, intermediate signal generator 12 includes transfer function circuits 18, 20, and a candidate intermediate signal selector 22. Transfer function circuit 18 is configured to generate candidate intermediate signal 60 based on sinusoidal signal 48, sinusoidal signal 50 and offset value 58. In some examples, candidate intermediate signal 60 may vary with respect to the parameter value in a substantially linear fashion for a particular range or interval of parameter values. In other words, for a particular interval of parameter values, as the parameter value varies, candidate intermediate signal 60 may vary according to a function that has a substantially constant slope over the particular interval. In some implementations, the length of the interval of parameter values for which candidate intermediate signal 60 varies in a substantially linear fashion may be greater than the length of the interval of parameter values for which either of sinusoidal signals 48 and 50 approximates a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> linear function. For example, the length of the interval may be greater than or equal to 180 degrees.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Transfer function circuit 20 is configured to generate candidate intermediate signal 62 based on sinusoidal signal 48, sinusoidal signal 50 and offset value 58. Similar to candidate intermediate signal 60, candidate intermediate signal 62 may vary with respect to the parameter value in a substantially linear fashion for a particular range of parameter values. In some implementations, the length of the interval of parameter values for which candidate intermediate signal 60 varies in a substantially linear fashion may be greater than the length of the interval of parameter values for which either of sinusoidal signals 48 and 50 approximates a linear function. For example, the length of the interval may be greater than or equal to 180 degrees. In some examples, the interval of parameter values for which candidate intermediate signal 60 varies in a substantially linear fashion may be different from the interval of parameter values for which candidate intermediate signal 62 varies in a substantially linear fashion.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, for the specific example decoder device 10 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, candidate intermediate signals 60 (S1) and 62 (S2) each vary linearly with respect to the parameter value for at least one-half of the period of sinusoidal signals 48 and 50. More specifically, candidate intermediate signal 60 (S1) is substantially linear over an interval of parameter values that includes parameter values within the range of 0 degrees to 180 degrees. Meanwhile, candidate intermediate signal 62 (S2) is substantially linear over an interval of parameter values that includes parameter values within the range of 180 degrees to 360 degrees. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the interval of parameter values over which candidate intermediate signal 60 (S1) and candidate intermediate signal 62 (S2) are substantially linear also includes parameter values that extend outside of the ranges identified above in either direction.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Referring back to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, transfer function circuit 18 performs one or more arithmetic operations to generate candidate intermediate signal 60.

Offset value 58 may be selected such that S1 and S2 both include linear regions that are greater than or equal to 180 degrees. For example, offset value 58 may be within the range of approximately 1 to approximately 10 times the amplitude of one or both of sinusoidal signals 48 and 50. In some examples, offset value 58 may be substantially equal to 1.6 times the amplitude of one or both of sinusoidal signals 48 and 50 in order to provide candidate intermediate signals 60 and 62 that have a high degree of linearity. Other values for offset value 58, however, may be selected to adjust the slope and/or linearity of candidate intermediate signals 60 and 62. In additional examples, offset value 58 and offset voltage 66 may be<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> selected such that the product of offset value 58 and offset voltage 66 is approximately equal to 2 times the amplitude of sinusoidal signals 48 and 50 in order to provide an output signal 54 with a high degree of linearity.
