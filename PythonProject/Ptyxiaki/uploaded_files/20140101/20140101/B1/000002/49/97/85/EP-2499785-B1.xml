The invention relates more specifically to a method for determining the topology of the subscriber loop (number of sections integrating it and open circuit branches that may exist, referred to as bridged taps), the detection of faults and the calculation of the access speed that the loop can provide using different types of asymmetric digital subscriber lines (ADSL or Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line, ADSL2+ or Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line - Extended bandwidth and VDSL2 or Very high bit rate Digital Subscriber Line 2), referred to hereinafter as xDSLs.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Background of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Both in the telecommunication operators and providers industry, it is necessary to calculate, beforehand and with reduced operational costs, the performance that a metal pair should provide when said pair is to be used to provide broadband access based on xDSL multicarrier technologies (ADSL or UIT-T G.992.1, ADSL2 or UIT-T G.992.3, ADSL2+ or UIT-T G.992.5 y VDSL2 or UIT-T G.993.2). Said metal pair is indistinctly given the terms "loop" and "access loop" throughout this document.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">To calculate said performance it is necessary to specify the topology of said metal pair: segments (metal pair sections characterised by a gauge of the wires and the insulation of said wires) integrating it, the length thereof and the possible presence of bridged taps or branches (metal pair sections connected parallel to the loop, finished in open circuit) and the length thereof. It is likewise necessary to identify beforehand the faults preventing the use of the metal pair for a broadband access based on xDSL.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Several prior art documents relate to solutions based on reflectometry which implement xDSL chipsets, for example documents <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1842292A"><text>EP1842292</text></patcit> (granted to Centillium Communications), <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US2008089485A"><text>US2008089485</text></patcit> (granted to Conexant Systems Inc), <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US2007013384A"><text>US2007013384</text></patcit> (granted to Alcatel-Lucent) and <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US20020089337A"><text>US20020089337</text></patcit> (granted to Harris Corporation).<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Said documents relate to methods for measuring, in asymmetric digital subscriber line modems, the reflection coefficient by means of the excitation of the loop and the measurement of the echo corresponding to said excitation generated by the loop.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The calculation of the performance which can be expected from a metal pair when it is used for broadband accesses on xDSL is necessary to determine the offer of broadband services which can be marketed to each potential client.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In principle, this calculation is simple for an incumbent telecommunications operator since it has plant records (records in which the topology of each loop is specified in a detailed manner) of the metal pair access network which it has previously deployed. In principle, with this information, the performance which can be expected can be calculated beforehand. However, these processes are proving to be very unreliable for two reasons:
<ul><li>The effect derived from a good or bad condition of preservation of the pairs, which translates into a degradation of its electric features, such as for example the increase of the resistance of the wires of the pair and the loss of insulation between the wires of the pair, is not contemplated.</li><li>These plant records also do not take into account the negative effect on the access speed derived from the crosstalk (interference) introduced by the progressive increase of the number of metal pairs supporting xDSL accesses of the incumbent or third party operator through Local Loop Unbundling or LLU.</li></ul></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the case of an incoming operator, which offers broadband services based on xDSL by renting out loops to the incumbent operator, the difficulties are much greater since it does not have any information. The only information which it receives is provided by the incumbent operator, in accordance with the standards established by the regulator. Said information is in turn subject to the limitations previously indicated and which may involve margins of error of up to 50% in some cases.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A proposed solution is to take measures in the two ends of the loop, however said solution cannot be carried out due to the time limits and the operational costs that it entails. Therefore, there is still a need in the art for a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> quick, simple and inexpensive method for predicting the performance of a metal pair which is to be used to provide broadband access.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Another existing alternative solution for predicting the performance of a loop for broadband access is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="EP1248383A"><text>EP 1248383</text></patcit>, which uses an excitation signal inputted at one point (or port) of the access network in order to compute a reflectogram. A 1-port parametric model of the network is generated and optimized by reducing the difference between the results from the reflectometry measurements and results obtained from the 1-port parametric model and the excitation signal. Thus, a 2-port parametric model of the network is generated using the optimized parameter values.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention relates to a method for predicting the performance of the metal pair (or loop) for broadband accesses from reflectometry measurements taken from a single point of the access network, specifically from the telephone exchange. The prediction of performance is understood as the estimation of the raw data rate which said loop can support. Said method can be carried out from the raw data provided by the DSLAM, as well as from the data already prepared by management and configuration tools. This capability allows the integration under a single platform of equipment and solutions of a different origin, allowing a multivendor access network for the operator.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The method comprises:

The method of the present invention further allows working from different types of data, whether such data are provided by the digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) or by the management and configuration tools developed by the DSLAM providers themselves; and, from the data provided by the DSLAM, the loop topology, the faults (open circuit loops) and the maximum net data rate which can be provided by the loop with a determined type of xDSL access are calculated.
