Conventional hearing aids include a microphone to convert acoustic waves into an electrical signal; electronics to adapt modify the electrical signal, and a speaker to convert the electrical signal into an acoustic signal in close proximity to an ear.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the case, for example, of binaural hearing aids, that is to say, a hearing device which has an earpiece typically including a speaker, for each ear of a user, it is known to provide communication between the two earpieces. This communication may typically be by means of near-field communication (NFC). In NFC devices, also commonly referred to as magnetic induction devices, the magnetic near-field, which attenuates with the third power of distance, is used. In the transmitter, a coil is used to generate a varying magnetic field, and this magnetic field induces a current in the coil of the receiver.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is also known to provide external communication, from for instance a remote control device to an earpiece, by means of NFC, as described for example in United States patent publication <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4918736A"><text>US4,918,736</text></patcit>.

However, there is a constraint on the distance between the remote controller and of the earpiece is due to the rapid attenuation of the near-field strength.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">European Patent Application <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP1879426A"><text>EP1,879,426</text></patcit> discloses a method and apparatus for binaural hearing assistance systems using monaural audio signals.

The same reference signs are generally used to refer to corresponding or similar feature in modified and different embodiments</p><heading id="h0005"><u>Detailed description of embodiments</u></heading><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a schematic system diagram of an arrangement of a hearing device according to an embodiment of the invention. The hearing device comprises two sub-units 10 and 20, which as shown may be individual earpieces, one for each of the left and right ear of the user. It will be immediately appreciated that although the sub-units 10 and 20 are shown as earpieces, they may take a variety of different forms, such as without limitation, ear buds, in-ear hearing aids, headphones, or even may be implanted devices such as Cochlear implants which are widely employed by people with hearing impairments.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Each sub-unit 10, 20 includes a receiver, respectively first receiver 12 and second receiver 22, for receiving a respective signal from an electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field is generated by an antenna 30<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> which forms part of a further communication device 40. Further communication device 40 may be, for instance, a television as shown in the figure, or may be part of a two-way communication devices such as a mobile phone.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Further communication device 40 transmits, by means of antenna 30, an electromagnetic signal. Typically, the electromagnetic signal will be transmitted at a frequency of about 2.5 GHz, although the invention is not limited to this frequency range. Non-limiting but preferred frequency ranges for the electromagnetic signal include 400MHz ― 6 GHz, and 2.4 ― 2.48 GHz.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">However it is known that for example at a frequency of 2.5 GHz electromagnetic radio signals between devices may face severe propagation fading behaviour. This effect results in reduced signal strength at the receiver input which can decrease below the detectable level and thus interrupt the demodulated output information. For example at 2.5 GHz in a typical indoor situation, regular signal reductions of 10 to 20 db are very realistic.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The effects of propagation fading can be reduced by using antenna diversity. As used herein, the term antenna diversity refers to the use of multiple antennas (also referred to here-in as antennae) so as to enhance the reception of a signal, which in this case is typically an electromagnetic signal.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">By using two or more antennas that receive signals which are uncorrelated or are only partly correlated, an improvement can be achieved. However, due to the space constraints usually present within the individual earpieces, it is generally impractical to include more than one antenna in the earpiece.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> this problem may be resolved by including an antenna in each of the earpieces. Provided that at least to some extent, the earpieces can operate as part of a single hearing device, that is to say that there is some communication and interaction between the two earpieces, the antenna in the two earpieces may provide suitable antenna diversity so as to mitigate the effects of localised signal reductions. The amount of the improvement depends on the correlation factor between the antennas and the method used for antenna diversity. Examples of the methods used for<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> antenna diversity include selection diversity and maximum ratio combining, each of which will be considered in more detail below. In case of selection diversity the better received signal between those from the two antennae is selected; this allows simple implementations which can be done at the RF stages or in the baseband stages. In case of maximum ratio combining, the two signals are weighted and added together in the correct phase. This method is more complex but delivers more improvement then selection combining.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">To provide sufficient benefit from antenna diversity the antenna signals should be sufficiently uncorrelated. Although there is no fixed a lower bound below which no improvement may be demonstrable, a typical good figure of merit is a correlation coefficient of 0.5. To be able to have such uncorrelated antenna signals two or more antennas should be at a certain distance from each other, for example a quarter wavelength.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">It will be appreciated by the skilled person from the physical dimensions of a hearing aid earpiece that it is not generally possible, within a single earpiece, to implement two antennas that provide sufficient uncorrelated signals, when operating in radio frequencies which are typically used currently. But, by providing for an antenna in each of the earpieces, one to be worn on either side of the head, the antennae may have a sufficiently large separation to allow them to receive relatively uncorrelated signals from the same source electromagnetic field. The signals received at either antenna are uncorrelated since the antennas have a large separation, the dimension of the head and above all the head itself gives a lot of isolation between the two antennae: the propagation loss between the antennae has been found more than 40dB.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Thus, any local attenuation of interference in the electromagnetic field may produce a deterioration in the received signal at only one of the antennae. Such a situation is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, in which an attenuator 43, which may be for instance a piece of furniture, or a mobbing arm or hand, lies in the first signal path 41 to first sub-unit 10 but does not interrupt the signal path 42 to the other sub-unit 20. A similar situation may apply where there is a strong interference, for instance from an interferer such as a Bluetooth device or a<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> cellular transmitter, which may affect one signal path to a significantly greater level than the other signal path. This will particularly be the case where the interferer is carried by the user, for instance, in a pocket on one side of the user's body.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In order to implement antenna diversity using an antenna on each of the earpieces, communication is necessary between the earpieces. This is shown schematically in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> by communication 50. Although in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> the communication is shown as a one-way communication, the communication will usually be a two-way communication.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref> shows an outline schematic of a conventional hearing aid 200. The hearing aid includes RF antenna shown at 210. In order to conserve the robustness of the device, the antenna will typically be mounted inside the casing 220. In addition to the RF antenna, the hearing aid includes a loop or coil 230 for NFC.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">A variety of ways of implementing antenna diversity according to embodiments of the invention are possible, some of which will now be described.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">A first method, is depicted in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>, which shows, at the left hand side steps associated with a first sub-unit, and at the right hand side, steps associated with the other sub-unit. At step 310, 315 the first and second receivers 12 and 22 respectively receive an electromagnetic signal, that is to say an RF signal. Each receiver converts the respective RF signal to derive a respective first and second baseband stream, at step 320, 325. Each baseband stream normally contains both the left and right audio channels. It may be encoded in any one of a variety of known coding arrangements, which will be well-known to the skilled person. In addition and also at step 320, 325 each receiver determines the quality of the received RF signal, in the form of a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In this method, at step 330, 335, each sub-unit transmits to the other sub-unit, by means of the NFC link, the RSSI, 332, 334 corresponding to the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> signal received at its respective receiver. Each sub-unit then determines whether its own RSSI is higher than the other sub-unit's RSSI. The sub-unit that has received the better strength RF signal, that is to say the sub-unit which has the higher RSSI, then transmits, at step 340, its baseband stream 342 to the other sub-units, again by means of the NFC link.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Both sub-units (that is to say both the left ear and right ear sub-units) now have access to the baseband stream derived from the higher RSSI RF signal. Each sub-unit decodes this audio-stream in a conventional manner shown at 350,355, sending the left or right channel to the respective left or right output. That is, each sub-unit directs a single channel to its associated output. Typically the output will be an in-ear or on-ear speaker, although in the case of implants, the skilled person that will appreciate that the output may take the form of electrical stimuli.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Although this method has been described with respect to RSSI, the skilled person will appreciate that in variants of this method, other parameters, such as baseband stream distortion, may be transferred between the sub-units instead of RSSI.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In further variants, such as that shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>, the signal quality information such as RSSI is transmitted only from one, sending, sub-unit by the NFC link to the other, receiving, unit. In this figure, the steps corresponding to those in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> are depicted by the same reference numerals. However, in step 330, RSSI is transmitted (shown at332) only by one sub-unit. The receiving sub-unit compares, at 440, the received information such as RSSI or baseband stream distortion discussed above, with that from its own receiver. If it determines that the signal quality from its own receiver is higher than that of the sending sub-unit, it transmits its own baseband stream to the sending sub-unit by means of the NFC link (shown at 442); otherwise it requests the sending sub-unit to transmit, at 445, its baseband stream, that is to say, the sending sub-unit's baseband stream, to the receiving unit (shown at 444).</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Other variants, such as use of a timeout rather than a request for information in order to initiate transfer of the baseband stream, will be immediately apparent to the skilled person.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In other embodiments, instead of signal quality information being transferred between the devices, the baseband stream converted by the first sub-unit is transmitted by the NFC link from the first sub-unit to the second sub-unit. This is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 5</figref>, at step 530, at which baseband stream 532 is transmitted from the first to the second sub-unit. In this case, the second sub-unit carries out the determination, at 545, of which baseband stream to use, based on information either associated with the baseband stream itself, or with the RF signal. In the latter case information relating to the RF signal may be also be transmitted from the first sub-unit to the second sub-unit. As a result of the determination made by the second sub-unit, it may require to transmit its own baseband stream (534) to the first sub-unit, in the case that it determines that its own baseband stream is the better quality signal, or, in the case that it determines that to the baseband stream from the first sub-unit is the better quality signal, it may simply transmit confirmation of this to be first sub-unit.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In yet other variants (not shown), each sub-unit transmits its baseband stream to the other sub-unit. Each sub-unit then determines which baseband stream to use, as described above, and outputs the respective channel of that baseband stream to its output.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The embodiments described so far have related to a simple selection of the better quality baseband stream.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In other embodiments, instead of simply selecting the better quality, or stronger, baseband stream, information from the both of the baseband streams is combined in order to provide a resultant preferred baseband stream. It will be apparent that in this case, the term preferred is used to indicate that the resultant baseband stream is preferred over either of the input signals, whilst in embodiments described above, the preferred baseband stream may be an exact copy of one or other of the baseband stream, and thus is the preferred one between the two input signals.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0046" num="0046">A hearing device, configured for operation according to embodiments of the invention, is shown schematically in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref>.

The link diversity management and MI-RF bridge within each subunit can communicate by dotted link 604.

At least one of link diversity management MI-RF bridge units 640, 645, determines that the baseband signal associated with its subunits should be transferred to the other sub-unit, as shown by routing 606, This transfer is effected by means of the respective MI radio interface 610, MI radio 600, MI radio 605, and MI radio interfaces 615. In the example shown, MI radio 600 acts as transmitter, and MI radio 610 605 acts as receiver for the baseband<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> stream 603.

The antennae communicate with a further communication device by conventional wireless RF transmission. The two sub-units communicate by means of near field communication, NFC. The two sub-units act in co-operation so as to ensure that a relatively higher quality baseband stream is extracted from either one or a combination of the receivers associated with the antennae. Deleterious effects from e.g. local disturbances to the electromagnetic field of the transmission may thereby be mitigated or overcome. Methods of operating such hearing devices are also disclosed.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0052" num="0052">For the sake of completeness it is also stated that the term "comprising" does not exclude other elements or steps, the term "a" or "an" does not exclude a plurality, a single processor or other unit may fulfil the functions of several means recited in the claims and reference signs in the claims shall not be construed as limiting the scope of the claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977886" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Ein Hörgerät, welches eine erste Untereinheit und eine zweite Untereinheit aufweist, wobei<br/>
