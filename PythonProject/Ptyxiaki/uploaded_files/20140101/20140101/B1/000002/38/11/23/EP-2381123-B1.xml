When the ferrous disc rotor is worn by the abrasive material, wear dust from the disc rotor is transferred onto the friction material surface and thus creates a ferrous transfer film on the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> friction material surface. Here, when the frictional temperature of braking creates a high friction surface temperature between the disc rotor and the friction material, a thermosetting resin, included as the binder of the friction material, causes thermal decomposition and the generation of an unwanted gas. This gas is generated when the friction material surface temperature reaches a combustion temperature.This combustion heats the ferrous transfer film formed on the friction material surface and significantly reduces the amount of oxygen around the friction surface. After the combustion, massive amounts of oxygen is introduced onto the friction surface to contact the heated ferrous transfer film on the friction material surface. As a result, the oxygen and the ferrous transfer film rapidly cause an oxidase reaction and generate ferrous oxide molten slag. Then, if the tight contact between the friction material and the disc rotor is maintained, as the friction material temperature falls, the dissolved ferrous oxide slag becomes solidified and causes the sticking problem.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Inventors of this invention studied the above-explained mechanism and found an effective solution of reducing the sticking problem of the ferrous disc rotor by (1) using a binder of a thermosetting resin with high heat resistance that generates less gas at high temperatures and (2) adjusting Moh's hardness of the abrasive material, average particle size of the abrasive material, and the amount of additional abrasive material.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">This invention relates to the disc brake pad for the disc brake equipped with the ferrous disc rotor, having the friction material including the fiber base material, binder, abrasive material, and frictional wear modifier and is based on the following technology.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">(1) A disc brake pad for a disc brake, equipped with a ferrous disc rotor, having a friction material comprised of: a fiber base material, a binder of 4.5-7.0 weight % relative to the gross friction material amount including aralkyl modified phenolic resin of at least 50 weight % relative to the binder amount, an abrasive material including inorganic particles of 1-3 weight % weight having Moh's hardness between 6 and 8 and average particle diameter of 10-200µm, and a frictional wear modifier.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">(2) The disc brake pad of the above (1), wherein the friction material further comprises alkali metal titanate and/or alkali earth metal titanate of 20-30 weight %.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">(3) The disc brake pad of the above (1) or (2), wherein the friction material further comprises cashew dusts of 3-30 weight %.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">This invention can provide the disc brake pad for the disc brake, equipped with the ferrous disc rotor, having the friction material that includes the fiber base material, binder, abrasive material, and frictional wear modifier, that minimizes the sticking problem of the friction material and the disc rotor effectively and at the same time provides effective fading resistance, wear resistance, and formability.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of the disc brake pad of this invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><heading id="h0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">The friction material for the disc brake pad of this invention has the binder of 4.5-7.0 weight % relative to the gross amount of the friction material and aralkyl modified phenolic resin of at least 50 weight % relative to the gross amount of the binder. The gross amount of the binder is preferably 4.5-7.0 weight % relative to the gross amount of the friction material. If the gross amount of the binder is 4.5 weight % of the gross amount of the friction material, the wear resistance reduces while if the weight % exceeds 7.0, the fading resistance reduces. Aralkyl modified phenolic resin, which has high heat resistance, has an aralkyl base without a phenolic hydroxyl group between phenolic nuclei and phenolic nuclei. Including at least 50 weight % of the amount of aralkyl modified phenolic resin relative to the gross amount of the binder reduces the amount of generation gas under the high temperature and minimizes the sticking problem.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Other than aralkyl modified phenolic resin, the binder can be various thermosetting resins, such as phenolic resin, various elastomer modified phenolic resins as a result of modifying phenolic resin by such as cashew oil, silicon oil, and various elastomer, various elastomer dispersion phenolic resins as a result of dispersing various such as elastomer and fluorine polymer in phenolic resin, epoxy resin, and benzoxazine resin.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In order to realize good formability, the maximum amount of aralkyl modified phenolic resin relative to the gross amount of the binder should be 80 weight %, and the remaining part of the binder is preferably phenolic resin of 2,000-5,000 weight average molecular weight.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Also, the friction material for the disc brake pad of this invention has an abrasive material that is 1-3 weight % of inorganic particles with Moh's hardness of 6-8 and an average particle diameter of 10-200µm.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The inorganic particles with Moh's hardness of less than 6 do not provide sufficient brake effectiveness and reduces the fading resistance while inorganic particles with Moh's hardness of more than 8 shows excessive aggressiveness against the mating surface, generating more disc rotor wear dust, which tends to create the sticking problem and increases the amount of disc rotor wear. Inorganic particles with Moh's hardness of 6-8 can be inorganic particles generally used for the friction material such as zirconium oxide, zirconium silicate or aluminum oxide.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Here, in the present invention, Moh's hardness is represented by 1.

Also, this invention uses a few 50% particle diameter as the average particle diameter measured by laser diffraction particle sizing method.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The inorganic particles with contents of less than 1 weight % does not provide sufficient brake effectiveness and reduces the fading resistance while the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> inorganic particles with contents of more than 3 weight % shows excessive aggressiveness against the mating surface, generating more disc rotor wear dust, which tends to create the sticking problem and increases the amount of disc rotor wear.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Preferably, the friction material of the brake pad of this invention further includes alkali metal titanate and/or alkali earth metal titanate salt of 20-30 weight %. Sufficient amount of alkali metal titanate and/or alkali earth metal titanate salt, which tends to form a transfer film on the disc rotor surface, is added to minimize the transfer of the wear dust from the disc rotor to the friction material surface to form the ferrous transfer film thereon, thereby providing the apparent effect of minimizing the sticking problem. Excessive amount of additional amount of alkali metal titanate and/or alkali earth metal titanate salt reduces the wear resistance.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">This alkali metal titanate and/or alkali earth metal titanate are preferably flat or squamous shape, which tends to form a film on the disc rotor surface. Alkali metal titanate and/or alkali earth metal titanate can be potassium titanate, lithium potassium titanate, or potassium magnesium titanate, and are commonly used for the friction material.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Preferably, the friction material of the brake pad of this invention further includes cashew dusts of 3-5 weight %. Adding sufficient amounts of cashew dust that tend to be oxidized under high temperature prevents the oxidation of the ferrous ingredient transferred to the friction material surface, thereby providing significant reduction of the sticking phenomena.
