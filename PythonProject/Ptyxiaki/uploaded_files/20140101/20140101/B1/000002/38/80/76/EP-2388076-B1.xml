load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a droplet dispensing device, and more specifically to a watertight liquid droplet dispensing device for personal fragrances. Such droplet dispensing devices are also sometimes called aerosol generators, nebulizers and the like. They normally contain a spray head having a nozzle body on a support part, in particular, a nozzle body of a liquid droplet dispensing device which dispenses a liquid substance as a liquid droplet spray from the device through the nozzles of the nozzle body. They may further consist of an actuator based on a vibrating element which generally causes the liquid to vibrate, to be accelerated and expelled as droplets. They may further consist of elements such as liquid space, liquid feed and fluid interface to a reservoir, a reservoir as well as electrical connections between the vibrating element and a corresponding electronic circuitry. Such liquid may be for example a perfume.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Such nozzle bodies are sometimes called aperture plates, nozzle arrays, dosing aperture, orifice plate, vibratable membrane member, dosing aperture arrangement, aerosol generator and the like. Said terms are hence to be understood as being interchangeable throughout the present document.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In fact, such nozzle bodies and droplet dispensing devices are well known, for example from document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20030218077A"><text>US 2003/0218077</text></patcit> and document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP1129741A"><text>EP 1 129 741</text></patcit> in the name of the present Applicant. This document describes a liquid droplet spray device having a top substrate formed of a main body and of a nozzle body. The nozzle body contains a nozzle array of liquid droplet outlet means allowing a liquid substance contained in the liquid droplet spray device to exit the device, in this case as a spray of droplets. The nozzle body is conventionally formed of a nozzle array.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In order to allow for an effortless transportation of liquid out of the reservoir into the nozzle body, a venting hole may be used to ensure correct pressure difference between the inside of the reservoir and the surrounding atmosphere. An example is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. A reservoir 3 contains liquid and is covered by a cap in which a venting hole 35 may be provided. A gasket (not shown) may be provided to ensure liquid tightness.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, if the spray device is, for example, held in an upside down position, liquid may seep through the venting hole 35 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> causing leakage and inconvenience such as unwelcome smell, etc.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Similar leakage can be caused by a change of temperature of the liquid, for example because a hand holding the device, resulting in a change of volatility of the liquid. Another cause of leakage is increased pressure on the reservoir induced by a hand of a user or by change of atmosphere pressure, the resulting deformation forcing liquid to exit the reservoir, and the spray device, by way of the venting hole.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As can be understood from the above, it is thus important to provide a venting hole to ensure correct spraying, but a venting hole causes unwanted leakage of liquids to be sprayed. In room fragrance devices, this is generally not a major problem, because the device is generally positioned on a stable surface and in a stationary position.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, in a personal fragrance device, for example a perfume dispenser, such leakage is much more prominent, because the device can put in a pocket or a handbag, and thus may be in any position. Indeed, any perfume leaking out into a ladies handbag, for example, is of course to be avoided.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is therefore desirable to provide a liquid droplet dispensing device for emitting perfume and the like that is watertight.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">However, the design of such a watertight device is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> limited due to physical laws, in particular Jurin's rule. Indeed, Jurin's rule defines the height that a liquid can reach when rising in a capillary tube. This rule states that the height of liquid in a capillary tube is inversely proportional to the diameter of the tube at the surface of the liquid only. This rule is as follows: <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mi>h</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>γ</mi><mspace width="1em"/><mi>cos</mi><mfenced><mi>θ</mi></mfenced></mrow><mrow><mi>r</mi><mn>.</mn><mi>ρ</mi><mn>.</mn><mi>g</mi></mrow></mfrac></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="38" he="16" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
where:
<ul><li><i>h</i> is the height of the liquid;</li><li>γ is the surface tension of the liquid;</li><li>θ is the contact angle between the liquid and the wall of the tube;</li><li>ρ is the fluid density of the liquid;</li><li><i>r</i> is the radius of the tube; and</li><li><i>g</i> is the gravitational acceleration.</li></ul></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The valid conditions are as follows: the diameter of the tube must be smaller than the capillary length, which typically is 2 mm for water at ambient temperature and pressure.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">This means that such a liquid droplet dispensing device has design constraints resulting in a limited height and shape, because liquid can only rise over a limited distance by capillary action. Clearly, in the world of perfume, such constraints are very limiting.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present invention addresses this contradictory aspect and provides a liquid droplet dispensing device that is watertight and that allows to overcome the design constraints imposed by Jurin's rule.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The innovative dispensing device is defined in the appended claims.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Thanks to the construction of the innovative dispensing device according to the present invention an efficient device fulfilling this objective may be obtained in a relatively simple<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> and inexpensive manner.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Other features and advantages of the dispensing device according to the present invention will become clear from reading the following description, which is given solely by way of a non-limitative example thereby referring to the attached drawings in which:

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4A</figref>, the dispensing device comprises a spray head 1 for ejecting fragrance from the device, a liquid reservoir 3 arranged to provide fragrance to the spray head 1, and a bottom housing 2 for containing electronic control means for controlling the dispensing of fragrance from the device.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The liquid reservoir 3 comprises a primary reservoir 31, a secondary reservoir 34, and a capillary liquid feed 33 connecting liquid reservoir 3 to spray head 1.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The secondary reservoir 34 is disposed in the primary reservoir 31 and is in direct contact with capillary liquid feed 33. Further, secondary reservoir 34 is smaller than primary reservoir 31 and contains a unit dose of fragrance to be ejected from the device.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A preferred embodiment will now be described. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1, 1A</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0005">5 and 5A</figref>, the liquid droplet dispensing device comprises a spray head 1, a bottom housing 2 and a reservoir 3. Reservoir 3 is presented as replaceable refill. In fact, once the reservoir is empty, a new one may be inserted.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2</figref> show in more detail an example of spray head 1. As shown, spray head 1 comprises a cap housing 11, a spray head body 12, a lever 13, a nozzle mask 14, a covering element 15, a nozzle body 16, a space body 17, a valve axis 18, a valve body 19, an actuator membrane 111 and a vibrating element 112. Spray head body 12 may be located in the way as disclosed, for example in the afore-mentioned document <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP1129741A"><text>EP 1 129 741</text></patcit> in the name of the present Applicant. Thus, nozzle body 16 contains a perforated membrane plate. The perforations are in fact nozzle outlet means through which droplets of fragrance are to be expelled. Vibrating element 112, for example a piezoelectric element, acts on actuator plate 111, which itself acts on liquid contained in a space, or compression chamber 17a provided in space body 17 proximate to nozzle body 16. Liquid is supplied from reservoir 3 to the space. In a manner known in the art, when vibrating element 112 is actuated, the ultrasound energy generated by the vibrating element is transmitted to the liquid causing it to undergo vibrations, which results in the liquid being pushed towards and through the outlet means of nozzle body 16 as a spray of droplets.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Vibrating element 112 may act directly on spray body 12 to transmit ultrasound energy to the liquid contained in space 17a, or it may act indirectly thereon. In such case, and as shown in the present embodiment, an actuating member 111 may be provided between vibrating element 112 and the bottom surface of spray body 17. As such, when vibrating element 112 is activated, the ultrasound energy generated by vibrating element 112 is transmitted to actuating member 111 and then to liquid present in the space (compression chamber) of space body 17, thus causing the liquid to undergo vibrations and to be expelled as a spray of droplets. Such specific arrangement is described in detail in co-pending application <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP08157455A"><text>EP 08 157 455.0</text></patcit> in the name of the present Applicant.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In order to protect the nozzle outlet means of nozzle body<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> 16, a nozzle mask 14 may be provided. This may be a simple plate that can be moved from a first position uncovering the nozzle body, to a second position covering and protecting the nozzle body, for example from dust or sharp objects. Lever 13 is connected to nozzle mask 14 in a suitable manner to allow for this movement. In an alternative, nozzle mask 14 may be provided with a gasket or the like to ensure water tightness of the nozzle outlet means.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">A capillary liquid feed 33, for example a mesh or a capillary channel may be provided connecting reservoir 3 to spray head body 12. Liquid access to the compression chamber 17a may be controlled by a valve means, comprising valve axis 18 and valve body 19, located in the capillary channel. The valve means is dimensioned to allow for a sufficient and continuous capillary feed fluid flow and its opening and closing can be controlled in a mechanical or electronic manner. As an example, the valve means may allow for a liquid flow of between 20 and 40 µl/s. When the valve means is closed, there is no fluid communication between reservoir 3 and spray body 12 thus rendering the system watertight, even in changing atmospheric conditions such as in an airplane. <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref> shows an example of the valve means in the open and closed position, allowing/preventing liquid to flow from reservoir 3 to spray head 1.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Further, in order to ensure that any liquid already present in the spray body will not leak out, a liquid retention zone may be provided in spray head body 12. In fact, due to temperate changes, for example caused by a hand holding the spray device, any liquid present in space 17a of spray body 17 might leak out through the outlet means, because the temperate change may change the pressure of the liquid.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In this respect, a covering element 15 is provided on top of nozzle body 16 and has a centrally arranged through-hole for alignment with the outlet means of nozzle body 16 to allow<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> liquid to be ejected from the device. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2c</figref>, covering element 15 contains an internal buffer zone 15a which constitutes a liquid high-retention zone. This buffer zone 15a is arranged to receive any liquid that may leak out of space body 17 through the outlet means of nozzle body 16.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Buffer zone 15 is dimensioned and configured such that it retains liquid by way of capillary action, i.e. any liquid that enters into buffer zone 15 flows in through capillary action, and will be retained therein by the capillary force.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> shows an example of bottom housing 2. Bottom housing 2 comprises a bottom casing 21, a bottom casing cover 22, electronic control means 23 and a battery 24 for supplying power to electronic means 23.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Bottom casing 21 is designed and shaped such that the spray device is placed horizontally when not in use, and not upright, for example on a bottom edge. Indeed, by having a thin edge, the spray device cannot be placed upright, because it will fall. This arrangement is advantageous in that by placing the spray device horizontally, the secondary reservoir 34 can be easily filled with liquid from main reservoir 31, as will be explained in more detail later.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Battery 24 is dimensioned depending on the size of reservoir 3 and of the general design of the spray device. The larger the battery, the more liquid can be sprayed, but the heavier the device.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Electronic control means 23 are programmed to allow for sequenced spraying of fragrances from the spray device. It is possible to program the electronic control means such that the ejected spray can be controlled as a function of the used fragrance, i.e. of the liquid characteristics and features. In this example, the electronic control means are programmed to eject the spray as a fine spray of droplets leaving a more or less "dry" film on a sprayed surface, such as the skin of a user of the device. Indeed, when spraying too much, the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> sprayed surface remains wet for a certain period of time. This is considered unpleasant for many users, in particular for certain surfaces, such as the neck. If the neck remains wet for a while after spraying, a user may have the sentiment that the spray may drip down lower, and that she or he smells too strong. Conventional mechanical spray devices do not allow for such electronic control, and thus have a tendency to spray too much liquid in a single spray release.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Electronic control means are configured such that the amount of released liquid may be regulated, without, however, changing the sizes of ejected droplets or the flow of droplets. In this way, a user can avoid the wetting problem mentioned above. Several examples of different kinds of ejected sprays are shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref>. As shown from left to right in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref>, an amount of 75 µl was sprayed for a period of 1 s, then 70 µl for 2.8 s, 35 µl for 2.3 s and 46 µl for 2.5 s. Clearly, in this example the impact on the sprayed surface can thus be controlled by varying the duration and the amount of liquid released in a spray sequence. Preferably, a pulsed operation of the electronic control means may be used to save energy, important when using a battery-powered device.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As can be seen from <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7A</figref>, these different actuations do not have an impact on the droplet size, seeing the droplet distributions for all four examples shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref> overlap. As can be understood from this, the different activation parameters do not influence droplet size or the flow, which allows to respect the Volatile Organic Components (VOC) norm.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 4 and 4a</figref> show an example of reservoir 3. Preferably, reservoir 3 is a disposable refill and can be easily fitted in and removed from the spray device. It may contain, for example, between 2 and 150 ml of liquid. As can be seen, reservoir 3 has a main, or primary reservoir 31, a reservoir cap 32 for covering and sealing the reservoir, a priming wick 33, a secondary reservoir 34 and an air valve 35.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Air valve 35 is provided to equalize the pressure in reservoir 3 with the outer pressure. However, air valve 35 may ensure liquid tightness up till a pressure of 600 mbar.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Reservoir 3 is designed, similar to bottom housing 2, to ensure a horizontal positioning of the spray device, and of the reservoir, so that primary reservoir 31 will instantly fill secondary reservoir 34. Secondary reservoir 34 is a unit dose reservoir, containing sufficient liquid, for example between 0.1 and 0.6 ml, for an ejection upon an activation of the device.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Thanks to this secondary reservoir, the maximum height restraint imposed by Jurin's rule explained above can be overcome. Indeed, as explained, in order to prime the liquid, i.e. allowing the liquid to move from primary reservoir 31 to spray head 12, a maximum height of a capillary channel has to be respected to ensure flowing of liquid.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">According to the present invention, by providing secondary reservoir 34, which always fills up with liquid from primary reservoir 31 once the reservoir and/or spray device is positioned horizontally, primary reservoir 31 can be designed to have a height much larger than permitted by Jurin's rule.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Having described now the preferred embodiments of this invention, it will be apparent to one of skill in the art that other embodiments incorporating its concept may be used. It is felt, therefore, that this invention should not be limited to the disclosed embodiments, but rather should be limited only by the scope of the appended claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56978291" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Wasserdichte Duftabgabevorrichtung zum Ausstoßen eines Dufts als ein Sprühnebel aus Tröpfchen, wobei die Vorrichtung Folgendes umfasst:
