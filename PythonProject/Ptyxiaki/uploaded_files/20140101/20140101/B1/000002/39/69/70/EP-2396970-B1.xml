Unfortunately, antennas have not been reduced in size at a comparative level and often are one of the larger components used in a smaller communications device.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Although antenna size may be reduced by miniaturizing wavelength by increased frequency, lower frequencies can be advantaged for wave propagation, increased receive aperture, beamwidth, or simply for reason of allocation. In the present art and at room temperature, antenna gain is limited at small size by the loss resistance of metal conductors. Even slot type antennas, whose radiation resistance may approach infinity at vanishing small size, are limited by conductor loss through proximity effect. Thus, it can be desirable to reduce antenna size without reducing frequency, but difficult to design and manufacture a reduced size antenna having the greatest gain for the smallest area.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In current, everyday communications devices, many different types of structures are used as antennas, including loaded whips, copper springs (coils and pancakes) and they are used in a variety of different ways. "Patch" antennas may utilize printed circuit board (PCB) construction for ease of manufacture, and "chip" antennas may be components mounted on PWBs.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Antennas may be divided into two families, loops and dipoles, corresponding to the curl and divergence of electric current. The canonical antennas are the circle and line embodiments of the loop and dipole, respectively. Antenna hybrids between the loop and dipole may include the spiral and helix. Euclidian geometries, commonly known, have advantages such as the shortest distance between two points (line), greatest area for perimeter (circle), and they may be preferential<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> antenna shapes for lower conductor loss, greater radiation resistance, increased directivity, etc.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Loop antennas may have special utility for electrically small antenna requirements as they can be loaded to resonance with capacitors rather than inductors. Presently, the antenna designer is afforded better insulators than conductors at room temperature, so capacitors can have lower loss than inductors. Thus, the loop antenna includes the necessary inductor in antenna structure at the most efficient size. Loop antennas may also be advantaged for body worn applications, with magnetic radial near fields that do not cause dielectric heating, or for reduced electromagnetic interference (EMI) pickup at low frequencies.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">For portable communications such cellular telephones, the antenna may be located near a metallic chassis or battery, in which case "ground plane" operation may be beneficial. An example of a ground plane antenna is the monopole or "whip" for portable radios, where the whip and radio chassis may together form an antenna system. Although the whip antenna may be better known, the image plane form of the loop antenna can comprise a conductive arch or "half loop". Half loop antennas share the advantages of loop antennas while permitting ground plane operation.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Examples of prior art antennas include <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6252561B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,252,561 to Wu, et al</text></patcit>. which is directed to a wireless LAN antenna with a dielectric substrate having a first surface and a second surface. The first surface of the dielectric substrate has a rectangular loop. A rectangular grounding copper foil is adhered within the rectangular loop. A signal feeding copper foil is further included. One end of the signal feeding copper foil is connected to the rectangular loop and the grounding copper foil, while another end of the signal feeding copper foil running across another end of the rectangular loop. Moreover, a layer of back surface copper foil is plated to the back side of the printed circuit board. This back surface copper foil covers one half of the loop on the front surface. Adjustment of the transversal dimensions of the grounding copper foil will impedance-match the antenna to the feeding structure of the antenna.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Also, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6590541B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,590,541 to Schultze</text></patcit> is directed to a half-loop antenna having an antenna half-loop positioned on top of a ground plane, the antenna half-loop forming an area whose outer edge forms a convex closed curve. The conductor half-loop has the form of an ellipse tapering to a point at its ends, and at the feed-in point of the conductor half- loop an inductance can be inserted, formed as a spring.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">However, none of these approaches is focused on providing a chip antenna component, e.g., for circuit boards or ground planes, while reducing the antenna size and providing the desired gain for a small area.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Patent Document <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6597318B1"><text>US 6,597,318 B1</text></patcit> discloses a printed circuit antenna with broadband input coupling.

An input coupler is provided for matching an input impedance of the antenna to the antenna feed circuitry. The input coupler can comprise a conductive line disposed on the substrate adjacent to the antenna element. The conductive line is separated from the antenna element by a coupling space for coupling to the antenna element an input signal applied to the input coupler. The conductive line extends parallel to a portion of the antenna element including the first end portion.

The invention is small, provides good gain for size, is scalable, is operable with and without a ground plane, and is suitable for portable communications requirements such as cell phones or pagers.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56978279" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Antenne (10) mit:
