By manure is also meant other material, such as feed residues, which has to be removed from a floor.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE10309106"><text>DE 103 09 106</text></patcit> shows a trolley with a manure slide to be driven and steered by a person who has taken his position on the device, which manure slide is provided with two sliding walls which are located behind each other and which are fastened to a horizontal plate which defines a chamber with the sliding walls. The plate is fastened to the frame of the trolley by means of a parallelogram connection comprising upwardly and forwardly extending link rods, in order to be able to swivel upwards, with the sliding walls, in a vertical longitudinal plane of the trolley, in order to avoid a threshold or other obstacle. The known trolley is also provided with a mechanism for pre-setting the vertical position of the plate and thereby of the sliding walls.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US2966256A"><text>US2966256</text></patcit> shows a barn-gutter cleaner, and more particularly a scoop means which enters a barn-gutter and automatically and repeatedly loads itself and disposes of the load to the end that the gutter is substantially entirely cleaned in a most efficient manner. As best seen in Figure 6 of <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US2966256A"><text>US2966256</text></patcit>, the scoop means 50 is provided with a rearwardly extending flange 100 located centrally of the lateral edges of the scoop means and carrying a pivot pin 102 to which the the tractor means may be connected.</p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is an object of the invention to provide a device of the type mentioned in the preamble, the manure slide of which is able to have, in many circumstances, an effective contact with the floor.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In order to achieve at least one of these objects, the invention, as claimed, provides a device for removing manure present on a floor, comprising a frame, a drive for moving the device over the floor and at least one manure slide which has an upper edge, wherein the manure slide is held by the frame by means of a connection structure, wherein the connection structure comprises a first rotational connection with a first substantially horizontal rotational centre line which is located below at least a portion of the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> upper edge of a manure-pushing wall portion of the manure slide.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Hereby, while maintaining the rotatability, a low point of rotation is obtained, as a result of which the vertical moment arm of horizontal forces exerted on the manure slide, such as by the contact between floor and slide, is kept limited, and therewith a possibly occurring moment tending to lifting of the slide. Substantially horizontal for the first rotational centre line also relates to rotational centre lines which are at a small angle to the horizontal, such as for example an angle of approximately 20 degrees.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In such an arrangement, the connection structure can comprise a second rotational connection with a second, substantially horizontal rotational centre line which is at an angle, of preferably approximately 90 degrees, to the first rotational centre line, so that adjustment to local changes in a direction transverse thereto is improved. The second rotational centre line is preferably also located below at least a portion of the upper edge of a manure-pushing wall portion of the manure slide.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is observed that from <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP1690450A"><text>EP 1.690.450</text></patcit> a self-propelled trolley with a single manure slide is known, in which the manure slide is suspended at a location in front of the manure slide from a frame in such a manner that the slide is rotatable about a horizontal rotational centre line which is parallel to the direction of travel, for adjustment to local changes in the floor profile. The slide can also be suspended in such a manner that it can pivot about a rotational centre line perpendicular to the aforementioned rotational centre line, for example by means of a drawbar, a parallelogram construction or in general by means of two hinges. Both rotational movements take place about centre lines located above the upper edge of a manure-pushing wall portion of the manure slide.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The first rotational centre line can be transverse to a vertical central longitudinal plane of the device. The second rotational centre line can then be located in that plane.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In one embodiment, the location of the manure slide with respect to the first rotational centre line, in particular the horizontal distance, can be set. Hereby, the moment arm between manure slide and rotational centre line can be determined.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the device according to the invention, the manure slide is substantially U-shaped or V-shaped in order to define a manure-accommodating-space which opens in forward direction. The first rotational centre line is then preferably located in front of a rear wall of the manure-accommodating-space, and preferably coincides in horizontal direction with the manure-accommodating-space, when viewed in projection on a vertical central longitudinal plane of the device. The moment generated by the frictional force in one or more planes parallel to the vertical central longitudinal plane, by which moment the pressure of the rear wall of the manure slide could otherwise be reduced, can then be kept limited.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In one embodiment thereof, the manure slide has two legs which have a length in the order of magnitude of the width of the rear wall of the manure slide.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The above-mentioned device can be configured in a manner known per se for unmanned self-propelling and preferably also for unmanned steering. By unmanned self-propelled and self-steering device are meant both at least substantially autonomously travelling and steering devices, whether or not programmed for this purpose, such as the Discovery (registered trademark) manure slide of the registered trademark Lely, and devices in which the travelling and/or steering are/is remotely controlled. In both cases, a motor for the travelling of the device is provided in the device.</p><heading id="h0003">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The invention will be explained with reference to a number of exemplary embodiments shown in the accompanying figures, in which:
<ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1A and 1B</figref> show a top and a side view, respectively, of a first exemplary embodiment of a device according to the invention;</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><heading id="h0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION,OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">The device 1 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1A and 1B</figref> for removing manure from a floor 30 of a passageway of a stable comprises a relatively heavy, block-shaped concrete housing 2. The device 1 is supported on two wheels 3 and on a manure slide 4. The housing 2 is provided on both sides with current collectors 6, by means of which an accumulator 16, included in the housing 2, can be charged at an external charging station, as used in the manure slide device which is offered by Lely (registered trademark) under the name Discovery (registered trademark). The manure slide 4 is wholly located in front of the housing 2 and thus in front of the drive, as is visible in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1A and 1 B</figref>, and viewed in projection on a central longitudinal plane M of the device 1.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The housing 2 accommodates a control unit 15 which is fed by the accumulator 16 and which controls, via the control line 18, a double electric motor 17, by means of which the wheels 3 can be driven individually. The control unit 15 is capable of being programmed remotely, so that the device 1 can follow autonomously a defined working route, in a repeating manner.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The manure slide 4 is made of stainless steel and U-shaped with two legs 7a,b and manure-pushing rear wall 8, which define a manure-accommodating-space 25, with a length L1 and a width B, which are substantially equal in this example. The legs 7a,b and the rear wall 8 are plate-shaped, the height of the legs 7a,b being greater at the rear than at the front. At their lower edge 9a they are provided with a polyurethane strip 26, for a sweeping contact<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> with the floor 30. The legs 7a,b can undergo some mutual upward/downward movement (direction C), so that their lower edges can properly follow the floor 30.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">A longitudinal bar 10, which is bearing-supported in a freely rotatable manner, direction B, about its centre line in the housing 2, extends forwardly from the housing 2, At its front end there is mounted a bracket 23 in which a cross-bar 22 is bearing-supported in a freely rotatable manner, direction C. The ends 22a,b of the cross-bar 22 are rigidly attached to legs 7a,b of the manure slide 4, thus behind the front end of the (legs) of the manure slide. As a result of this cardan-like connection with the housing 2, it is possible for the manure slide 4 to follow in a proper manner slopes in longitudinal and transverse direction of the floor 30, so that the contact of the manure slide 4 with the wall 30 remains sufficient. The rotational centre lines for the longitudinal bar 10 and for the cross-bar 22 are located below the highest point of the upper edge 9b of the rear wall 8, the rotational centre line for the cross-bar 22 even below the upper edges of all walls 7,8.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">During operation on a so-called closed floor 30 of the passageway of a stable, it is possible by means of the device 1 moving in forward direction A to move in an autonomous manner manure (or other material) present on the floor 30 to a manure pit opening located at the end of the passageway. The device 1 subsequently moves back to the other end of the passageway, to start a next stroke, for sweeping a strip of the floor 30 next to the strip that was swept in the previous stroke.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">By way of example, L1 is greater than L2, the length of the housing 2 upto the wall 8. L1 can amount to more than 2/3 of the sum of L1 + L2, the overall length L of the device 1. L1 and B can, for example, amount to 1 m, whereby an amount of manure of 100 l can be accommodated without problems, which amount of manure is expected to land, in one hour, on a strip of 1 m of a passageway with a length of 100 m. In that case, the device 1 has to clean the same surface only 1 x per hour. Then, L2 can amount to 0.5 m.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The above-mentioned description serves to illustrate the operation of preferred embodiments of the invention, and not to limit the scope of the invention.
