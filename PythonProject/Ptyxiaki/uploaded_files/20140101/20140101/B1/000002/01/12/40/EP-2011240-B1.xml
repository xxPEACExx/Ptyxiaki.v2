used in radio receivers. In particular, the invention relates, but is not limited to hardware and software correlators that aid in acquiring and tracking satellite signals in global positioning type systems.</p><heading id="h0002">Background of the Invention</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The basic functionality of a receiver used in global positioning type systems is to calculate the latitude, longitude and altitude of the receiver's location (i.e., the co-ordinates of the receiver) upon receiving a number of signals from a network of satellites that orbit the earth. The calculation of the co-ordinates of the receiver relies on having acquired signals transmitted by orbiting satellites. After acquiring respective satellite signals, the receiver may track the transmission frequency and code phase of the satellite signals so as to maintain synchrony with signals received from the respective satellites.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">During acquisition and tracking of a satellite signal a respective identification portion of the signal is correlated with known satellite signal identification information maintained by the receiver. This correlation process allows positive identification of the source of the received signal.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Current technologies use either hardware correlators or software correlators to acquire and track code division multiple access (CDMA) signals in global positioning systems.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An approach using only hardware correlators suffers from a lack of flexibility in strategy and in which type of satellite system signals are received. In addition, unless a very large number of hardware correlators are used, there may be a long signal acquisition time which can delay obtaining position information.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">An approach using only software correlators suffers from an increase in power consumption and processor load.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Without sufficient power and processing resources available in the receiver, large amounts of data must be stored in memory for post processing. A disadvantage of this approach is that large amounts of memory are assigned and real-time position calculation and data demodulation may be compromised.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US7002515B2"><text>US7002515 B2</text></patcit> shows a global positioning system receiver, in which a CPU acts as a software correlating unit for synchronous acquisition while a hardware correlating section includes hardware units that execute correlating process for tracking the GPS satellites.</p><heading id="h0003">Summary of the Invention</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to a broad aspect of the invention, there is provided a correlator architecture for use in a radio receiver comprising: at least one software correlator operable for at least one of acquiring and tracking a received signal;

For example, in a generic radio receiver, e.g. a CDMA receiver, the correlation function is the process of aligning (correlating) the frequency peaks to a known combination or set of peaks (e.g. a known standard), and thereby deriving an understanding of the signal source (e.g. with whom the receiver is communicating). The acquisition function results in the receiver locking onto the channel. In CDMA telephony, this allows a connection to be established between a transmitter and receiver for communication between the two, and in GNSS, it allows the satellite transmitting the signal to be identified, which subsequently enables the position of the receiver to be determined.

In <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, the receiver 100 has a receiver front-end including an antenna 102, a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) 104, an image-rejection filter 106, a mixer 108, a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) 110 and an Intermediate Frequency (IF) filter 112. In addition to the superhet architecture, the receiver is also shown to include an analog-to-digital convertor (ADC) 114, a correlator 116 and a processor 118.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In operation, a radio signal 20 at a radio frequency (RF) is first received by the antenna 102 and amplified by the LNA 104. For example, the radio signal may be a spread spectrum<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> signal from a satellite that is part of a global positioning navigation system. Filter 106 then filters the radio signal 20. Requirement for this filter can be removed by integrating its function into the LNA 104 or the mixer 108. The mixer 108 down-converts the radio signal 20 from the RF to an intermediate frequency (IF) by using a local oscillator (LO) signal generated by the VCO 110. The output of the mixer 108 is provided to the IF filter 112. The IF filter 112 then filters the signal. The output of the IF filter 112 is coupled to the correlator 116 via the analog-to-digital convertor 114. An output of the correlator 116 is coupled to the processsor 118. The processor 118 performs the signal processing that ultimately determines the position of the receiver.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Satellite signals transmitted by the satellites are modulated in a manner whereby pseudo-random codes are employed to identify each of the orbiting satellites so as to aid in resolving the timing of the received signals. As such the signals are processed digitally by logic which performs a correlation function in the correlator 116. In the correlator 116 the processing gain applied to the spread spectrum signal raises the signal level above the noise floor when a local copy of the pseudo-random code specific to an individual satellite is placed in-phase with the received signal modulated with the same code. This correlation and synchronization process is carried out for all the received satellite signals in order to identify the strongest set of signals to be used to calculate the receiver's co-ordinates. The results are then passed from the correlator 116 to the processor 118 to determine the signal path delays to each of the satellites and hence enable calculation of the location of the receiver.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In another embodiment, the receiver of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> may be adapted for other communication applications such as voice and/or data. The processor may be configured as a Media Access<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> Controller (MAC), and may interface with one or more other devices, such as a microphone, speaker, keyboard, mouse, or visual display. Acquisition or locking of the received signal may be performed by the correlator 116, which may include at least one hardware correlator and at least one software correlator. Tracking or maintaining lock on the received signal may also be performed by the correlator 116. In another embodiment, a software correlator may be implemented by the processor 118, either instead of or in addition to the correlator 116. The software correlator may be implemented as a program running on the processor. The software correlator may be configured to perform either one or both of locking onto the signal and maintaining lock on the signal.

After filtering by the IF filter 210, the IF signal is coupled to an input of the ADC 212. An output of the ADC 212 is coupled to the switch 220. A first output of the switch 220 is coupled to the hardware correlators 230. A second output of the switch 220 is coupled to both the hardware correlators 230 and the software correlators 240.

The input from one of or both of the hardware correlators 230 and the software correlators 240 may for example be an initial portion of the received signal. Further examples of other factors that may influence how the acquisition and tracking logic 250 controls operation of the switch 220 include: received signal strength; desirability for conservation of power or processing resources; desirability to provide continuous or momentary position calculation; and/or desirability to analyse received signal deeply for multipath or other types of distortion.

In some embodiments, the acquisition and tracking logic 250 determines if use of one type of correlator is more advantageous for processing the signal than the other type.

In some embodiments, link 235 in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2A</figref>,<figref idrefs="f0003">2B</figref>,<figref idrefs="f0004">2C</figref> is used to facilitate such a transfer of information.

The information may include timing<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> and/or frequency information and may take any of a number of different forms. Examples of such information may include: Doppler shift of a satellite signal from a reference frequency; systematic Doppler shift from a reference frequency for all signals; a code phase (or time) offset applicable to an individual satellite signal; and/or a systematic time offset pertaining to a receiver oscillator.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">The flexibility allowed by a shared software and hardware correlator architecture enables the receiver to process signals from two or more different types of satellite global positioning navigation systems. In some embodiments, the two or more different types of satellite global positioning navigation systems use different types of CDMA signals. In some embodiments, once the received RF signals are converted to IF signals, the IF signals can be processed simultaneously in hardware and software.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">Strategically, using software correlators in addition to hardware correlators may be useful for a number of reasons. For example, the shared software/hardware correlator architecture may provide a) post-hoc improvement of accuracy of measurements; b) additional processing of IF signals when a position is requested by the user of a satellite navigation device; c) tracking recovery for a temporarily weak signal; d) flexibility of using an arbitrarily large number of software correlators to acquire very weak signals; e) detecting and mitigating the effects of multi-path signals; and/or f) using signals from more than one satellite navigation system.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">In some embodiments, it is useful to use the software correlators when low signal levels are detected. Some of the reasons for this include: it is more economically cost effective to implement multiple software correlators for performing such a task than to implement multiple hardware<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> correlators for performing the task, software correlators are potentially more flexible to reconfigure than hardware correlators, and processing can be performed as a post processing operation by software as opposed to real time processing by hardware.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">Post-processing using software correlators allows the receiver to trade memory resources for processing load. For example, in some embodiments there are fewer constraints on how many software correlators are used at one time. This extra flexibility may improve power efficiency over a system using only hardware correlators.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">In some embodiments, software correlators can be programmed to support navigation systems (or other systems, e.g. DVB-H) not supported by hardware correlators and perhaps systems not implemented at the time the hardware was created.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">It may be useful to use the software correlators when a fast position fix is requested as it is possible to have a huge number of software correlators working at once, which as discussed above is less economically expensive than a similar number of hardware correlators being used as once.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">The availability of software correlators for acquisition of weak signals allows a reduction in the number of hardware correlators in the receiver. As fewer hardware correlators are typically required to track previously acquired signals, an overall reduction in the number of hardware correlators reduces the cost of the receiver as the hardware correlators are typically more economically expensive to implement than software correlators.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">In low power signal environments acquisition may be achieved by post-processing in software, or by simultaneously processing by a plurality of software and hardware correlators.<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --></p><p id="p0096" num="0096">In some embodiments, if additional received signals are present and these received signals are of a different type from those for which the hardware correlators are designed, the system may then allow the software correlators to attempt to acquire one or more of these signals. In some embodiments, decisions of this type are made by the acquisition and tracking logic 250. In other embodiments a separate and distinct logic function from that of the acquisition and tracking logic 250 is used to determine how different signal types are handled by the software and hardware correlators.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">In some embodiments of the invention, in an IF signal stream containing signals from more than one satellite system, the hardware correlators may acquire and track a first set of signals from a first satellite system and the software correlators may acquire and track a second set of signals from a second satellite system. For example, where one or more hardware correlators are tailored to correlate for a particular type of signal, for example GPS, the software correlators may be configured to correlate for additional types of signals, e.g., Galileo or GLONASS. For instance, in an environment where the hardware correlator is used for tracking a small number of GPS based satellites, it may be beneficial for the receiver to have additional measurements from Galileo based satellites to improve the position calculation.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">It is to be understood that other combinations of sharing the acquisition and tracking.tasks for a single type of satellite signal or a collection of different types of satellite signals are within the scope of the invention. For example, with respect to the collection of different types of signals, embodiments may include using hardware correlators to acquire a first set of signals from a first satellite system, using software correlators to acquire a second set of signals<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> from a second satellite system and using the hardware correlators to track both the first and second sets of signals.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">In some situations signal tracking is less computer processing power-intensive than signal acquisition. Therefore, a short acquisition time may aid in decreasing power consumption depending on the received signal power level. In some embodiments, using extra data channels capable of operating on a single correlation data set, commonly known as correlator fingers, may be utilized to reduce the acquisition time. Extra correlator fingers are used when the IF signals are routed through multiple software correlators. By way of example, a receiver with 32 correlator fingers may be able to search simultaneously 32 different code offsets or frequency offsets or a mixture of the two.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">In some embodiments, the use of hardware correlators during tracking reduces the processing load and allows more efficient continuous reporting of position fixes.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">In some embodiments of the invention, it is easy to switch between various possible user modes. An example of a user mode is "low cost/low power" GPS in which there may be no tracking and either set of correlators may be employed to acquire signals for a position fix. Another example of a different user mode is "high-availability/high quality" GPS in which both sets of correlators may be used to perform acquisition and constant tracking of signals. Some user modes, such as those used for continuous navigation while tracking in a car, favour hardware correlators as this application uses a relatively modest number of correlators and typically does not lend itself to post-processing. Other user modes, for example in which initial acquisition of very weak signals is performed when assistance data is available (and no demodulation is required), favour software correlators since an arbitrarily<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> large number of correlators may be applied or an arbitrarily large number of samples may be stored for post-processing. While there may be some embodiments in which particular user modes commonly use either or both of software or hardware correlators, it is to be understood that there is no fixed relationship between user modes and use of software or hardware correlators.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">In some embodiments, the software correlators may be configured to correlate with one or more of a plurality of signals, having different frequencies and structures.</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">In some embodiments of the invention, IF signal samples may be assigned a label or timestamp before correlation. These identification labels may be used to identify the respective IF samples. Further to this, these labels may be used to identify or align corresponding samples from two or more different streams.
