FIG. 1</figref> is an external side view schematically showing a side of the straddle-type vehicle 100.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The straddle-type vehicle 100 (hereinafter also referred to as the "vehicle") is what is called an underbone-type motorcycle. In general, a straddle-type vehicle typically comprises a body frame and a seat on which a rider can be seated straddling the body frame when being seated. However, also scooter-type vehicles, on which riders sit with legs closed, are included in the meaning of straddle-type vehicles. The straddle-type vehicle 100 is formed of a headlight unit 10, a cowling 20, and a front fender 30.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The headlight unit 10 is an illuminating lamp for night driving. A headlamp unit formed of a pair of a left and a right headlamps is employed as the headlight unit 10 in this embodiment. The headlight unit 10 includes front illuminating sections (lenses) 12 protruding frontward of the vehicle, reflectors 14 functioning as reflecting mirrors, and light sources (bulbs) 16 for emitting light. Light (hereinafter also referred to as "illumination light") emitted from each of the light sources (bulbs) 16 is reflected from the reflectors and passes through a corresponding one of the front illuminating sections<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> (lenses) 12 to illuminate an area ahead of the vehicle. The cowling 20 is placed to surround the headlight unit 10.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The cowling 20 (referred to as a "front cover" in some cases) is a cover member attached to the vehicle to cover a front portion of the vehicle. The cowling 20 of this embodiment is attached to the vehicle at a position below and to the front of a handlebar 80, above a front tire 32. The lenses 12 each forming a portion of the headlight unit 10 are provided on a front surface of the cowling 20. The front fender 30 is provided below the cowling 20.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The front fender 30 of this embodiment is positioned above the front tire 32 and serves as a guard against mud splashed up by the front tire 32. The front fender 30 has a shape capable of functioning as a mudguard. In the example shown in the drawings, the front fender 30 has a curved shape to cover the front tire 32 from above.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2(A)</figref> shows the headlight unit 10, the cowling 20, and their surroundings as viewed up from a position at which the front fender 30 is provided (from an obliquely lower position, in a direction indicated by arrow 60).</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">A light guide window 40 is provided below the headlight unit 10. The light guide window 40 has a function of allowing a portion of light emitted from the light source 16 of the headlight unit 10 to go out. In other words, the light guide window 40 is configured to allow illumination light emitted from the headlight to leak through the light guide window 40. In this embodiment, a clearance (that is, a through opening) is created in a boundary between a bottom edge 18 of the headlight unit 10 and the cowling 20 as the light guide window 40. The light guide window 40 is shaped to allow illumination light emitted from the headlight to leak. Hence, the light guide window 40 can take various shapes (a V shape in the example shown in the drawings). When the light guide window 40 having such a structure is provided, illumination light emitted from the headlight can be projected not only onto the area ahead of the vehicle but also onto an area downward of the vehicle.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The thus-downwardly directed light (light 42 going out through the light guide window 40) is projected onto the front fender 30 to form a predetermined pattern corresponding to a predetermined shape of the light guide window 40. In other words, the light 42 having leaked through the light guide window 40 is selectively projected onto an upper surface 31 of the front fender 30 and forms a light image pattern 44 thereon substantially corresponding to the shape of the light guide window 40 on the upper surface 31. <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 2(B)</figref> shows an example of the light image pattern 44 formed on the upper surface 31 of the front fender 30. <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 2(B)</figref> shows the light image pattern 44 (a part of which is not shown) assuming a V shape corresponding to the V shape of the light guide window 40.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">According to the straddle-type vehicle 100, the light guide window 40, through which a portion of light emitted from the light source 16 goes out, is provided below the headlight unit 10. The light going out through the light guide window 40 is projected onto the front fender 30 to form a predetermined pattern (for example, a V-shaped pattern) corresponding to a predetermined shape (for example, a V shape) of the light guide window 40. Hence, the portion of the light emitted from the light source 16 of the headlight unit 10 forms the predetermined pattern (for example, the V-shaped pattern) on the front fender 30.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Preferably, in order to further improve the visibility of the vehicle from the side-front direction of said vehicle, two headlight units 10, 10 can be arranged on the left and right side of the vehicle, preferably in a substantial V-shape.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">According to this configuration, because the front fender 30 can be used as a what is called a decorative light component, a design (appearance) of the vehicle for night driving is improved. Consequently, a commercial value of the straddle-type vehicle is increased. Furthermore, because the illumination light emitted from the headlight unit 10 can be used as light for the decorative light component, it is less expensive than attaching an additional decorative component is created.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Meanwhile, in the example described above, the light guide window 40 is implemented as the clearance (that is, the through opening) between the headlight unit 10 and the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> cowling 20, however, the shape of the light guide window 40 is not limited to such an opening. For example, a light-permeable member (typically a trans parent member) may be embedded in the opening. Consequently, the clearance between the headlight unit 10 and the cowling 20 can be sealed, thereby forming the headlight unit 10 as a sealed structure. Preferred examples of such a light-permeable member include an acrylic, glass, resin, and the like.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The light-permeable member is not limited to a colorless, transparent member, and can be a colored light-permeable member. When a colored light-permeable member is used, the light image pattern projected onto the front fender 30 is colorful (brightly colored), thereby further improving the design (appearance) of the vehicle. Examples of the colored light-permeable member include acrylic resins, glasses, and polycarbonates. Alternatively, pigmented coating (e.g. clear blue coating) may be applied onto a colorless, transparent member. These configurations allow a vehicle to have various appearances (e.g., causing the vehicle to look as if the vehicle is decorated with a black light).</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The light guide window 40 may include a condensing lens (e.g. a convex lens) capable of concentrating light. When light is concentrated through the condensing lens, a further fine pattern (e.g., characters) can be projected onto the front fender 30. Alternatively, the light guide window 40 may be a combination of a condensing lens and a colored light-permeable member. For example, a condensing lens, onto a surface of which a colored film serving as the colored light-permeable member is affixed, can be favorably used as the light guide window 40.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The shape and size of the light guide window 40 may be arbitrarily selected according to rider's preference. More specifically, the members (e.g., the colored light-permeable member and the condensing lens) forming the light guide window 40 can be detachably attached so as to be changed to suit the shape and size of the rider's preference. Examples of the various selectable shapes include, in addition to the V shape shown in the drawings, a star shape, an X shape, and a heart shape.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The configurations of the headlight unit 10 and the cowling 20 according to this embodiment will be described in more detail with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">FIGs. 3 to 6</figref>.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The configuration of the cowling 20 of this embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 3</figref> first. <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 3</figref> is an external perspective view of the cowling 20.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The cowling 20 for accommodating the headlight unit 10 therein is made of an opaque resin material.

Moreover, the lens 12 comprises the upper lens 12a which is located to emit another portion of light 46 / main portion of light emitted from the bulb 16 to illuminate the area ahead of the vehicle, i.e. the road, for the driver, respectively the rider of the straddle-type vehicle, when driving said vehicle.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 5</figref>, the lower lens 12b is preferably inclined with regard to the upper lens 12a.

An outer edge demarcating the opening is formed with the bottom edge 18 of the headlight unit 10 and a bottom edge 28 of the cowling 20. In other words, the light guide window 40 is the clearance between the headlight unit 10 and the cowling 20 in this embodiment. The illumination light having passed through the lower lens 12b passes through the light guide window 40.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">According to the above configuration, as indicated by arrows 46 in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 5</figref>, a portion of the illumination light emitted from the bulb 16 is reflected from the reflector 14 to pass through the upper lens 12a and illuminate an area ahead of the vehicle. Furthermore, as indicated by an arrow 42 in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 6</figref>, a portion of the illumination light emitted from the bulb 16 sequentially passes through the uncoated lower lens 12b and the light guide window<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> 40, thereby selectively illuminating an area below the cowling 20 (and accordingly the front fender 30 below the cowling 20). According to this configuration, by changing the shape (that is, the shape of the lower edge 18 of the headlight unit 10 and that of the lower edge 28 of the cowling 20) of the outer edge demarcating the light guide window 40, the light image pattern projected onto the front fender 30 can be specifically changed.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The lens 12 has a lower area located to emit the portion of light indicated by the arrow 42 from the headlight unit 10 before said position of light 42 reaches the light guide window 40.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Meanwhile, the light guide window 40 is positioned so that light leaked through the light guide window 40 is selectively projected onto the front fender 30. More specifically, the position, at which the light guide window 40 is provided, can be adjusted as required in accordance with a positional relationship between the light source 16 and the front fender 30 so that light emitted from the light source 16 (the light may include not only light directly emitted from the light source 16 but also light reflected from the reflector 14) appropriately impinges the front fender 30 through the light window 40. This way, at least a part of the portion of light 42 is reflected by said reflector 14 towards the light guide window 40.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In this embodiment, the light guide window 40 is the clearance between the headlight unit 10 and the cowling 20. However, the location of the light guide window 40 is not limited thereto, and may be provided at another portion. For example, the light guide window 40 can be a through hole of a predetermined shape defined in the bottom surface of the cowling 20 (or the headlight unit 10). It should be noted that the configuration of using the clearance between the headlight unit 10 and the cowling 20 as the light guide window 40 is advantageous because the need of providing an additional through hole is omitted, which can simplify the manufacturing process.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The "straddle-type vehicle" referred to in the specification is not limited to an astride-riding type vehicle, and includes a vehicle type (typically a scooter-type vehicle) on which a rider seats with his/her legs closed.
