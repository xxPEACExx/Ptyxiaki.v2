INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Metallurgical properties of a weld are affected by numerous variables like base material composition, filler material and shielding composition and welding process variables. Compositions of the materials are controlled by various methods, quality<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> control procedures, and general manufacturing techniques. The welding process variables are normally documented and checked with additional quality control procedures. However, the large number of welding process variables can be difficult to control. These variables include some items which are easy to control and others which are more difficult to control or measure accurately. The welding process itself could be a constant voltage (CV) or constant current (CC) mode or involve a more complex waveform like surface tension transfer (STT), Pulse, or AC Pulse. As the waveform becomes more complex, or as a welding process becomes more precise with more stringent quality control requirements, the methods used to accurately verify proper operation also become more complex.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">An additional variable that can affect the performance of a welding system but is difficult to control, or measure, is the inductance of the welding circuit. Inductance increases with long cables that are typically connected to the output of a welding power source. As this inductance increases, the power source welding performance can degrade because it may not have the ability to reach a desired output within a desired period of time. The power source can only produce a finite amount of voltage which limits this rate of change. <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">L</mi><mo>*</mo><mfenced separators=""><mi>dI</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>dt</mi></mfenced></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="32" he="10" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A combination of all these variables (desired output level, rate of change, and amount of voltage available from the power source) are needed to determine if a specific welding circuit inductance is acceptable or not. Knowing these requirements, measuring the inductance (also measuring the inductance at a high current level), and determining what <u>is</u> acceptable are not functions that an operator can be expected to perform.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional, traditional, and proposed approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art, through comparison of such<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> systems and methods with certain embodiments the present invention as set forth in the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings.</p><heading id="h0003">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention deals with methods and apparatuses to characterize a welding output circuit path according to claims 1, 5, 9, 15.

In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the welding system 100 does not include a spool of wire 160, a wire feeder 170, or a wire 180 but, instead, includes a welding tool comprising a consumable electrode such as used in, for example, stick welding.

where N is the number of voltage and current sample pairs over the suitable time period.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Fast sampling of the instantaneous voltage and instantaneous current is done within the power source 110 of the welding system such that complex waveforms are sampled at a high enough rate to allow accurate calculation of Joule energy or true power. The samples of instantaneous voltage and current are multiplied together to generate multiple instantaneous energy samples and are integrated over a predefined time interval to generate true input heat or energy, not just some average energy. All of this processing is done in real time within the power source 110 of the welding system. The result may be displayed to an operator of the welding system 100 on a display 115 of the power source 110, for example.

In step 310, a welding output circuit path is established running from a welding power source through a welding cable to a welding tool, through a workpiece and/or to a workpiece connector, and back through the welding cable to the welding power source. In step 320, a welding output waveform is generated within the welding power source which is transmitted through the welding output circuit path, and wherein the welding output waveform comprises a welding output current component and a welding output voltage component. In step 330, the instantaneous output current levels and the instantaneous output voltage levels of the welding output waveform are continuously sampled within the welding power source at a predefined sample rate. In step 340, a product of each of the sampled output current levels and the corresponding sampled output voltage levels are continuously generated, within the welding power source, as part of determining a true energy output level and/or a true power output level from the welding power source into the welding output circuit path in real time.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a running integrated value of true energy can be provided over a sliding time interval of, for example, one minute. Such a true energy value may be continuously updated and displayed to an operator on, for example, a display or meter 115 of the power source 110, thus giving the true energy input (i.e., true heat input) over the past one minute interval. Other time intervals may be used instead, in accordance with various other embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The true energy output level, for a predefined time interval, may be divided by a distance traveled by the welding tool 130 during the predefined time interval to calculate<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> a true energy per unit length. With welding travel speed information that can be measured by the welding power source 110, communicated digitally, or manually entered by the operator, the Joule energy may be presented as Joules per unit length. A typical measurement magnitude is kJ/inch. The welding travel speed may be controlled by the power source 110 which provides the welding speed to, for example, an automated robot welder or some other hard automatic or semi-automatic mechanism (not shown).

The control circuit looks at the output current versus the set point and determines if a duty cycle within the welding power supply should be increased in order to achieve the desired current ramp rate for that portion of the waveform. The welding power source, using the control circuit, simply tries to increase output current to achieve a desired current output level (e.g., the set point). The inductance of the welding output circuit path is not necessarily known, and the welding power source is not concerned with achieving any particular output voltage level. Instead, the welding power source is concerned with increasing the output voltage level as much as needed to reach the desired current set point within the desired time interval, thus avoiding saturation.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the steps 1130-1160 of the method 1100 may be periodically repeated for different portions of a welding output waveform.

For example, for a given welding output<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> waveform and a particular welding output circuit path, the system 100 may spend 100 milliseconds out of every 500 milliseconds in saturation (i.e., the percentage of time that saturation occurs is 20%, or the frequency of occurrence of saturation is 1 out of 5).</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, an indication may be displayed on the display 115 showing that the welding output circuit path 105 is acceptable with respect to the present welding output waveform being used, for example, if the calculated percentage of time that saturation occurs is within a predefined range of acceptability (e.g., is below a predefined threshold value).
