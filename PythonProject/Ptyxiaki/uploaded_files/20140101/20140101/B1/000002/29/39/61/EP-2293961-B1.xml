mxw-id="PDES63957344" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a demountable vehicle body system, in which a variety of different body types can be mounted and demounted from a vehicle chassis or trailer to enable a single vehicle chassis or trailer to be utilised for a variety of different purposes.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">At the present time commercial vehicles are usually manufactured having a standard front cab and a variety of standard rear cab types, including, for example, a box cab, a Luton cab, a flat deck or a tipper. In addition, a plurality of specialised rear cabs can be supplied to order and these might include refrigerated rear cabs, minibuses, horse boxes, cement mixers, breakdown lorries, street light lifts, bowsers and the like for liquid or bulk material or live stock carrying cabs. Generally, as a consequence, as the individual body type is normally provided as an integral part of the rear portion of the vehicle, each vehicle is generally suitable only for the purpose for which it was designed, therefore, the user of a variety of different types of vehicle would require to have a number of each vehicle types for this purpose, even though it is unlikely that all of the vehicles will need to be used at all the times and such an arrangement can involve a considerable capital outlay for a fleet user.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Also, over the past few decades many parts of the world have experienced a gradual reduction in working hours and a consequent increase in leisure time. Many of these resulting leisure and cultural activities take place outdoors and at selected venues where spectator seating, toilet and catering facilities are not organised on a permanent basis. Increasingly, there is the need for facilities such as catering stands, mobile grandstands, mobile toilets etc. and there are systems available in the marketplace in which rear cabs are detachable from the vehicle by means of legs which are extendable and which raise the rear cab from the vehicle, which is then subsequently<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> driven away. However, these tend to be time consuming to unload and do not allow the rear cab to be dropped to ground level.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A further example of a prior art arrangement is known in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="GB2240751A"><text>GB 2 240 751</text></patcit>, which was made by the inventor of the present application. Basically, this system comprises a support frame attachable to the vehicle and a demountable body frame on which various vehicle bodies can be secured. The vehicle body frame can be removed from the vehicle by means of a cable winch mechanism driving an endless cable mechanism, the endless cable mechanism being connectable to the demountable body via a coupling member. Whilst this invention was commercially successful, the disadvantage of this approach was that the inertia of "heavier" body types tended to cause the vehicle body to jerk and move irregularly during mounting or demounting operations.<br/>
A further example of prior art is <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO9602403A"><text>WO 96/02403</text></patcit> showing a vehicle body exchange system for vehicles or trailers, comprising: a support frame attachable or integrally mounted with a vehicle chassis or trailer unit, said support frame capable of receiving a vehicle body; a first winch means connected to a coupling member for connection to a vehicle body to enable said vehicle body to be lifted from the ground or lowered to the ground during a mounting or demounting operation, said first winch means comprises a motor which turns, via a gear mechanism, a cable drum;<br/>
a second winch means connected to a coupling member for connection to a vehicle body to enable said vehicle body to be lifted from the ground or lowered to the ground during said mounting or demounting operation, said second winch means is driven by the motor and that said second winch means turns, via a gear mechanism, a twin cable drum (58); and means for independently controlling the rotational speed of said first and second winch means during said mounting or demounting operation to enable a smooth displacement of said vehicle body.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a demountable vehicle body system for motor vehicles and trailers which overcomes the disadvantages of prior art arrangements and provides for a convenient and cost effective use of a variety of vehicle body types. In use, it is a further object of the present invention to provide a demountable vehicle body system that is capable of safely mounting or demounting a wide variety of vehicle body types, including fully-loaded heavy bodies, in a much smoother and efficient manner. The vehicle body system described herein can be mounted or demounted in a matter of minutes by a single operator.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to the present invention there is provided a vehicle body exchange system for vehicles or trailers, comprising:

The chassis frame may also include a tilt frame which pivots in the direction of motion of the body frame relative to the chassis frame. In use, the coupling member for connection to a vehicle body may be provided as a connector plate.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Towards the rear of the chassis frame, a rear cable guide roller and an auxiliary guide roller can be provided which, in use, guide the cables when performing said mounting or demounting operation. Guide rails and corresponding guide rollers may, preferably, enable the body frame to connect with the chassis frame during mounting or demounting operations. A further set of guide rails may be provided along the chassis frame to ensure that the body frame is pulled on squarely and securely.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further preferably, a lock release handle is mounted on the chassis frame which is engaged when the body frame is mounted securely on the chassis frame.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Preferably, the vehicle body is secured on a body frame. The body frame may consist of two L-shaped guide rails, which, in a mounted condition, sit on the guide rails of the chassis frame.

The second motor may be a winch motor which cannot be pulled out when no power is applied.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In use, the means for independently controlling the rotational speed of said first and second winch can be provided using a microcontroller or microprocessor. A plurality of sensors detect the relative position of the vehicle body relative to the chassis frame and these are inputted to the microcontroller or microprocessor. In use, these comprise a first sensor, which can be a microswitch, and its function is to detect when the body frame is locked in position on the chassis frame; a second sensor, which can be a microswitch, which senses when the body frame is in an unlocked position; a third sensor, which can be a capacitive sensor, that is used to notify when the body frame is located on the chassis frame; and a fourth sensor, which can be a capacitive sensor, which senses when the body frame is at the rear of the cable guide roller.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Further preferably, any number of vehicle body types can be utilised, for example, a box cab, a Luton cab, a flat deck, tipper, refrigerated rear cab, minibus, horse box, cement mixer, breakdown lorry, street light lift, bowsers and the like for liquid or bulk material, live stock carrying cabs, catering stands, mobile grandstands or mobile toilets.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is believed that a demountable vehicle body system for motor vehicles and trailers in accordance with the present invention at least addresses the problems outlined above.

Referring firstly to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, which shows detail of the chassis frame 10 which, in use, is intended to be attachable or integrally formed with a vehicle chassis (not shown) or mounted on a trailer (not shown). The chassis frame 10 comprises at least two guide rails 12 or channel sections for receiving and guiding corresponding channels or guide rails 42 on the demountable body frame 40, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. The guide rails 12 are strengthened by a number of cross-pieces 14. The chassis frame 10 is secured to the vehicle chassis (not shown) or mounted on a trailer (not shown) via a plurality of mounting means 16. At the front end of the chassis frame 10 (the cab end), a cable winch mechanism or winch box 18 is provided for mounting and demounting the body frame 40, and further detail is provided in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>. For clarity purposes, the cables are not shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Towards the rear of the chassis frame 10, a rear cable guide roller 20 is provided which is used to guide the cables when performing a mounting or demounting operation. Guide rails 22 and corresponding guide rollers 24 enable the body frame 40 to connect with the chassis frame 10 during mounting or demounting operations. A further set of guide rails 26 is provided along the chassis frame 10 to ensure that the body frame 40 is pulled on squarely and securely. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> also shows detail of the pivotable tilt frame 28 which assists with the smooth operation of the mounting and demounting of vehicle bodies.

In this way, the body frame 40 can be rapidly secured for transport.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> shows detail of the vehicle body frame 40, on which, in use, various types of vehicle bodies (not shown) can be mounted. The body frame 40 consists of two L-shaped guide rails 42 which, in a loaded condition, sit on the guide rails 12 of the chassis frame 10. Again, cross-members 44 provide structural support. Towards the rear of the body frame are either fixed rolled wheels 46, or if heavier bodies are envisaged, then additional torsion wheels 48 can be inserted into the body frame 40. The body frame 40 also has means for receiving a connector plate 50 which is connected to the cable winch mechanism 18 on the chassis frame 10 via cables (not shown). In use, the connector plate 50 is secured via locking bar 52. The connector plate can be quickly ejected via a spring-loaded release mechanism which is activated by using the connector plate ejector 54. Further detail of the connector plate and its method of operation will be discussed later in relation to <figref idrefs="f0009 f0010">Figs. 8A to 8G</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0011 f0012">9A to 9I</figref>. Also mounted on the body frame 40 are locking pins 56 which mount with the apertures 32 on the chassis frame 10, as described above.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> shows detail of the winch box 18 that is used to pull the vehicle body 40 on and off the vehicle. Motor 1 turns, via a gear mechanism, a single cable drum 60 that is mainly used to pull the vehicle body 40 off the vehicle. It is an induction motor capable of being pulled out when no power is applied. Motor 2 turns, via a gear mechanism, a twin cable drum 58 that is mainly used to pull the vehicle body on to the vehicle. This is a winch motor which cannot be pulled out when no power is applied. Obviously this is from a safety point of view should power be lost during a winching mechanism.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The key to smooth operating of the present invention is the difference in performance and configuration of the motors 1 and 2. As mentioned, motor 1 has a single cable drum 60 that the cable 70 is fed down the full length of the vehicle to the rear, round the pulley 20 and back to fix to the connector plate 50. It is capable of being pulled out when no power is applied. Some force is required to pull out the cable, in use, maintaining tension on the cable.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Motor 2 is the main lifting motor and has two cables 68 on its drum 58. It is attached directly to the connector plate 50. This is a winch motor which can feed out or in under power. When no power is applied the drum 58 is locked, this feature is critical to the safe operation of the system. When feeding out cable 68, the drum 58 cannot be accelerated by applying tension to the cable 68.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4A to 4C</figref> show the principle of operation of the invention without any detail of the chassis frame 10 or body frame 40 shown in these drawings, as this aids the explanation of the invention. Mounted on the chassis frame 10 (not shown), inside the winch box 18 (not shown), are the ON and OFF drums 58 and 60, respectively, which connect with the connector plate 50 via ON and OFF cables 68 and 70, respectively. As noted above, in use, the connector plate 50 would be secured in the body frame 40 (not shown).

The OFF drum 60 takes up OFF cable 70 drawing the connector plate 50 (which is connected to the body frame 40) to the rear. The ON drum 58 pays out cable 68 subject to dynamic braking or under torque.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As the body frame 40 is drawn to the rear of the chassis frame 10, the tilt frame 28 (not shown) begins to tilt, the torque and downward force of the OFF cable 70 pulls (as the centre of gravity of the body is being transferred), the rear of the tilt frame 28 in a downward motion, thereby sensing and controlling the angle and speed of tilt of the moving body prior to the front of the body frame and body, reaching the top dead centre of the tilt frame rear rollers 74 (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 6</figref>).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">At this point, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4B</figref>, the body frame 40 reaches the extreme rear of the cable guide roller 20 of the tilt frame 28 (beyond top dead centre).

In particular, Sensor A is a microswitch and its function is to detect when the body frame 40 is locked in position on the chassis frame 10. Sensor B is a also microswitch which senses when the body frame 40 is in an unlocked position. Sensor C is a capacitive sensor that is used to notify when the body frame 40 is located on the chassis frame 10. Sensor D is again a capacitive sensor which senses when the body frame 40 is at the rear of the cable guide roller 20. The key to the smooth operation of the present invention is the accurate measurement of the body frame 40 relative to the chassis frame 10, particularly via sensors C and D. As described above in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4A to 4C</figref>, the switching points of motors 1 and 2 is set by Sensors C and D. Due to the wrap of the cables 68 and 70 at the rear of the chassis frame these switching points are critical. For example, during a mounting operation, sensor D detects the body as the body approaches the underside of the cable guide roller 20. At this point, the OFF cable 70 attached to motor 1 is at its minimum length. From this point, the OFF cable 70 attached to motor 1 must be pulled out by motor 2.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0009 f0010">Figs. 8A to 8G</figref> show schematically the unloading (or demounting) sequence performed by the present invention.

The movement of the body 100 is controlled by the tension in the cables 68 and 70.
