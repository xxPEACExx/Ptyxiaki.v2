mxw-id="PDES63957342" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><u>BACKGROUND</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">Wireless local area networks ("LANs") use RF (radio frequency) signals to link two or more personal computers ("PCs") or other devices without using wires. Particularly for home users, wireless networking has become very popular due to straightforward infrastructure installation, low cost, and the ease with which new devices may be added to the network. Most wireless networks will utilize one or more access points to match the footprint of wireless coverage to a desired area in the home. Sometimes an access point may be combined with a switch or gateway to enable PCs and devices on the wireless home network to connect to an external network such as the Internet.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Wireless RF signals are typically relatively high powered to accommodate variations in antenna designs in the transceivers that are incorporated into networked devices. While such high power generally supports good network performance, it can allow wireless data packets to be unintendedly intercepted by devices outside the network footprint. To deal with this situation, wireless network users will typically utilize one of a variety of encryption technologies that are commonly available such as WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) or WEP (Wired Equivalency Privacy).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Utilization of these technologies can make it difficult for the intercepted data to be decrypted and read. However, for such technologies to work each of the wireless devices on the network must have access to commonly-utilized network information. The information may include, for example, a network identification ("ID") and a network "key" (i.e., secret information). A device will use the network information to discover and then be admitted to the network that it is looking to join.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">While wireless networks generally perform satisfactorily, it is often inconvenient for users to populate the commonly-utilized network information across all of the devices that the user wishes to have on a given network. In particular, the network key, such as a WEP key, can comprise a long string of alphanumeric characters that must be identically and accurately entered into each device. While some wireless networkable devices provide a graphical user interface ("GUI") or similar means to support manual entry of the required network information, such user interfaces will typically add cost and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> complexity to the device. In addition, data entry errors can still easily be made which is often a source of frustration to users who are simply looking to add a device to the wireless network without having to put in a lot of effort. Accordingly, it would be desirable to improve the manner in which network information may be populated in wireless networkable devices.<br/>
<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20050135628A1"><text>US 2005/0135628 A1</text></patcit> discloses a system and method for authenticating components in a wireless home entertainment system. A removable medium is used to exchange configuration information. The medium is engaged with a drive of the server, and configuration information of the server is downloaded on the medium. Then, the medium is removed from the server and is engaged with the drive of a component. The configuration information of the server is downloaded from the medium to the component, and the configuration information of the component is copied onto the medium. The medium is removed from the component and reengaged with the drive of the server, which downloads the configuration of the component to complete the configuration information exchange out-of-band with a primary communication system.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>SUMMARY</u></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The invention is defined according to the independent method and apparatus claims.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A personal media player is arranged to capture information, such as wireless network information (including network ID and key) and other kinds of information such as credentials (e.g., user name and password), and then share the information with a wireless networkable device when the player is physically coupled to the device in a docking process. When the personal media player is docked, the information is automatically transferred from the player to the device to enable the device to perform some action without any additional effort by the user. This could include, for example, discovering and be securely admitted to the wireless network, or accessing a remote service using the transferred credentials.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In various illustrative examples, the wireless networkable device is configured as a speaker that includes an integrated docking cradle that is configured to be removably interfaced with the personal media player. The player is docked in the cradle and the user is prompted through the graphical user interface ("GUI") to confirm that the user intends for the speaker to join the network. If so, the network information is automatically transferred so that the speaker can discover and securely join the wireless network without further interaction from the user. The user is then free to undock the player and then wirelessly play audio content from the player (or other wireless network device) from anywhere within the footprint of the wireless network over the speaker.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><u>DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG 1</figref> shows an illustrative usage environment in which a user may listen to audio content and watch video content rendered by an illustrative personal media player;</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG 2</figref> shows a front view of an illustrative portable media player supporting a GUI on a display screen as well as user controls;</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG 3</figref> shows an illustrative usage environment for a personal media player in which a wireless network includes a network access point that is used to support wireless communication among a number of devices;</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG 4</figref> shows several illustrative components that are used to implement the present automatic network information transfer;</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIGs 5 and 6</figref> show a personal media player being docked with an accessory device to automatically transfer network information to the device;</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG 7</figref> shows details of functional components used to transfer network information to the accessory device;</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG 8</figref> shows details of the transfer of an accessory ID (identification) to the personal media player;</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG 9</figref> shows the user playing audio content on an accessory device from a personal media player over a wireless network;</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG 10</figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative method for automatically transferring network information between docked devices;</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG 11</figref> is a simplified block diagram that shows various functional components of an illustrative example of a personal media player; and</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG 12</figref> is a simplified block diagram that shows various physical components of an illustrative example of a personal media player.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Like reference numerals indicate like elements in the drawings.

In this example, the personal media player 110 is configured with capabilities to play audio content such as MP3 files or content from over-the-air radio stations, display video and photographs, and render other content. The user 105 will typically use earphones 120 to enable audio content, such as music or the audio portion of video content, to be consumed<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> privately (i.e., without the audio content being heard by others) and at volume levels that are satisfactory for the user while maintaining good battery life in the personal media player. Earphones 120 are representative of a class of devices used to render audio which may also be known as headphones, earbuds, headsets, and by other terms. Earphones 120 generally will be configured with a pair of audio speakers (one for each ear), or less commonly a single speaker, along with a means to place the speakers close to the user's ears. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG 2</figref>, the speakers are wired via cables to a plug 201. The plug 201 interfaces with an audio jack 202 in the personal media player 110.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG 2</figref> also shows a conventional GUI 205 that is rendered on a display screen 218, and user controls 223 that are built in to the personal media player 110. The GUI 205 uses menus, icons, and the like to enable the user 105 to find, select, and control playback of media content that is available to the player 110. In addition to supporting the GUI 205, the display screen 218 is also used to render video content, typically by turning the player 110 to a landscape orientation so that the long axis of the display screen 218 is parallel to the ground.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The user controls 223, in this example, include a gesture pad 225, called a G-Pad, which combines the functionality of a conventional directional pad (i.e., a "D-pad") with a touch sensitive surface as described in U.S. Patent Application <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20090125824A"><text>US 2009 0125824, filed November 12, 2007</text></patcit>, entitled "User Interface with Physics Engine for Natural Gestural Control," owned by the assignee of the present application. A "back" button 230 and a "play/pause" button 236 are also provided. However, other types of user controls may also be used depending on the requirements of a particular implementation.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG 3</figref> shows an illustrative usage environment 300 for the personal media player 110 in which a wireless network 306 includes a network access point that is used to support wireless communication among a number of devices 310<sub>1,2 ... N</sub> that are each configured for implementing communications over the wireless network. Various protocols may be utilized with the wireless network 306 including those complying with Wi-Fi (i.e., the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, IEEE 802.11 standards family).</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Each device 310 will typically include a wireless transceiver plus the appropriate instructions (such as software code) needed to operate the transceiver. In this example, the devices include a PC 310<sub>1</sub>, a laptop computer 310<sub>2</sub>, a speaker dock 310<sub>3</sub>, and a game console 310<sub>N</sub>. However, it is emphasized that the devices 310 are intended to be<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> illustrative and that other devices may be used within the environment 300 as needed to meet the needs of a particular implementation.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">An access point 312 is utilized to provide the devices 310 with access to the wireless network 306. The access point 312 is also configured, in this example, with an integrated gateway functionality that enables connectivity to an external network such as the Internet 316. Such connectivity allows the devices 310 to access various resources which illustratively include Web resources 321 and a media content delivery service 325.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG 3</figref> also shows the personal media player 110 as typically inserted into a dock 328 for synchronization with the PC 310<sub>1</sub>. Dock 328 is coupled to an input port 331 on the PC 310<sub>1</sub> such as USB port (Universal Serial Bus) with a synchronization ("sync") cable 335, in this example. A pair of mating connectors (including a dock connector in the player 110 and a device connector in the dock 328) are utilized to implement the connection between the personal media player 110 and the dock 328, where one of the connectors in the pair is disposed in the player and the other is disposed in the recess of the dock 328 in which the player sits. The dock 328 also typically provides a charging functionality to charge an onboard battery in the personal media player 110 when it is docked.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In alternative arrangements, the portable media player 110 may be coupled directly to the sync cable 335 without using the dock 328. The personal media player 110 is itself equipped with a Wi-Fi transceiver and may synchronize with the PC 310<sub>1</sub> wirelessly as well as communicate with other devices 310 on the network 306.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The synchronization process implemented between the player 110 and the PC 310<sub>1</sub> typically enables media content such as music, video, images, games, information, and other data to be downloaded from the media content delivery service 325 or other on-line source over the Internet 316 to the PC 310<sub>1</sub>. From the PC 310<sub>1</sub>, the downloaded media content may be transferred to the player 110. In this way, the PC 310<sub>1</sub> operates as an intermediary or proxy device between the service 325 and the personal media player 110.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In this example, a network setup utility 410 is instantiated on the PC 310<sub>1</sub> as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG 4</figref>. When run, the network setup utility 410 provides for configuration and setup of the access point 312, as indicated by reference numeral 416. The network setup utility 410 may be supported using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) code that runs on a Web browser, for example. Alternatively, the network setup utility 410 may be configured as a standalone application. The network setup utility 410 will typically be arranged to specify a network ID and network key that will be utilized by the access point<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> 312. In addition, various types of settings, preferences, and other configuration information may also be set using the utility 410.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The network setup utility 410 is further arranged to interact with the personal media player 110 to transfer the network information to the player for storage. The player 110 can then automatically transfer the stored network information to other devices that the user 105 intends to add on to the network. In alternative implementations, the utility 410 may be used to configure other types of information that can be transferred from the player 110 to the devices 310. For example, such information may include credentials such as user name and password used to access an on-line media content service. When later transferred to a device 310, for example, the on-line media content service can be contacted using the credentials to receive a stream of media content such as music or video which can then be rendered by the device.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIGs 5 and 6</figref> show one illustrative example of such automatic transfer of stored network information from the personal media player 110 to a device 310. In this example, the device is the speaker 310<sub>3</sub> that includes an integrated docking cradle 503 that is specifically adapted to receive and interact with the player 110 to enable the speaker to later receive a stream of content from the media player that can be rendered. It is noted that the speaker 310<sub>3</sub> is intended as an illustrative example only and that other types of devices may also be adapted to interface with the personal media player 110 in a similar manner. For example, the device 310 could also be an image rendering device and the stream of content from the player 110 could include video content, photographs, images, etc.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG 6</figref>, the personal media player 110 interfaces with the integrated docking cradle 503 in a way that is similar to the conventional synchronization dock 328 shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG 3</figref>. Accordingly, the docking cradle 503 will include a device connector that is arranged to engage with a mating connector in the player 110. When the personal media player 110 is docked and the mating connectors are engaged, the network information stored on the player will automatically be transferred to the speaker 310<sub>3</sub>.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG 7</figref> shows details of functional components used to transfer the stored network information 707 from the personal media player 110 to the speaker 310<sub>3</sub>. The stored network information 707 will typically be stored in a persistent form in nonvolatile memory of the player 110. When the docking connector 711 of the player 110 is operatively coupled to the device connector 713 in docking cradle 503, a signal through path is created to enable the stored network information 707, comprising a network ID 717 and network key 721 to be received by a device interface 726 in the speaker 310<sub>3</sub>.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG 8</figref>, the personal media player 110 is configured with a GUI component 802 that may be utilized to display a prompt 806 on the display screen of the player 110. The prompt 806, in this example, is used to confirm that the user intends to add the speaker 310<sub>3</sub> to the wireless network 306 (<figref idrefs="f0002">FIG 3</figref>).</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Returning back to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG 7</figref>, the device interface 726 is operatively coupled to a wireless transceiver module 730 so that the received network ID 717 and network key 721 may be used by the speaker 310<sub>3</sub> to identify the wireless network 306 (<figref idrefs="f0002">FIG 3</figref>) and join on. The wireless transceiver module 730 is further operatively coupled to native accessory device functionality 734. In this example, the functionality 734 is associated with loudspeaker functionality and may typically include digital signal processing, amplification, and the like. For example, the wireless transceiver module 730 can receive a digital audio signal over the wireless network 306 that is then converted to an analog signal, amplified, and then rendered by one or more audio transducers in the speaker 310<sub>3</sub>. It is noted at this point that while a single speaker 310<sub>3</sub> is shown, it may be used in a pair-wise arrangement, or include multiple sets of audio transducers in order to reproduce a multi-channel or stereo signal in some implementations.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In this example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG 8</figref>, the speaker 310<sub>3</sub> is further arranged to transfer an accessory ID 807 that uniquely identifies the speaker to the personal media player 110 through an accessory interface 811. This transferred accessory ID 807 is arranged to enable the player 110 to discover the speaker 310<sub>3</sub> on the wireless network 306 after the player is undocked from the speaker as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG 9</figref>.

Here, the player 110 and speaker make a connection to the wireless network 306 through the access point 312. Music (or other audio content), video, images, etc., may then be streamed from the player 110 over the wireless network 306 and rendered by the speaker 310<sub>3</sub> or other appropriately configured rendering device. In the case of music, such arrangement advantageously enables the user 105 to control playback of content through the speaker 310<sub>3</sub> from a location that falls anywhere within the footprint of the wireless network 306.

The functional components include a digital media processing system 1102, a user interface system 1108, a display unit system 1113, a data port system 1124, and a power source system 1128. The digital media processing system 1102 further comprises an image rendering subsystem 1130, a video rendering subsystem 1135, and an audio rendering subsystem 1138.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The digital media processing system 1102 is the central processing system for the personal media player 110 and provides functionality that is similar to that provided by the processing systems found in a variety of electronic devices such as PCs, mobile phones, PDAs, handheld game devices, digital recording and playback systems, and the like.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Some of the primary functions of the digital media processing system 1102 may include receiving media content files downloaded to the player 110, coordinating storage of such media content files, recalling specific media content files on demand, and rendering the media content files into audio/visual output on the display for the user 105. Additional features of the digital media processing system 1102 may also include searching external resources for media content files, coordinating DRM (digital rights management) protocols for protected media content, and interfacing directly with other recording and playback systems.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">As noted above the digital media processing system 1102 further comprises three subsystems: the video rendering subsystem 1135 which handles all functionality<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> related to video-based media content files, which may include files in MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group) and other formats; the audio rendering subsystem 1138 which handles all functionality related to audio-based media content including, for example music in the commonly-utilized MP3 format and other formats; and the image rendering subsystem 1130 which handles all functionality related to picture-based media content, including for example JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), GIF (Graphic Interchange Format), and other formats. While each subsystem is shown as being logically separated, each may in fact share hardware and software components with each other and with the rest of the personal media player 110, as may be necessary to meet the requirements of a particular implementation.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Functionally coupled to the digital media processing system 1102 is the user interface system 1108 through which the user 105 may exercise control over the operation of the personal media player 110. A display unit system 1113 is also functionally coupled to the digital media processing system 1102 and may comprise the display screen 218 (<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG 2</figref>). Audio output through the audio jack 202 (<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG 2</figref>) for playback of rendered media content may also be supported by display unit system 1113.

The data port system 1124 may comprise, for example, a data synchronization connector port, a network connection (which may be wired or wireless), or other means of connectivity.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The personal media player 110 has a power source system 1128 that provides power to the entire device: The power source system 1128 in this example is coupled directly to the digital media processing system 1102 and indirectly to the other systems and subsystems throughout the player. The power source system 1128 may also be directly coupled to any other system or subsystem of the personal media player 110.
