The laser light is typically sent out in multiple directions by rotation of either a laser unit or by rotations of a reflecting device at which a laser unit is pointed. For 360° operation of a LADAR, it is usually the laser unit which is rotated to avoid directions in which the laser light cannot be sent.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">These systems operate in the polar coordinate space (or spherical coordinate space for three dimensional systems) as, natively, the angle of the laser light is known and the distance to any object which reflects the light is calculated. That is, the angular coordinate θ of a polar coordinate space is known and the radial coordinate r is calculated. As mentioned previously, a drawback of LADARs operating in a rotational mode is that as the distance increases from the LADAR, the resolution decreases due to the diverging pulses of laser light as the angle changes.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In some applications, such as in autonomous vehicles, it is desirable to have a higher resolution at larger distance from the LADAR. For example, to enable higher speed operation of autonomous vehicles, higher resolution of features at a greater distance from the vehicle is necessary to enable the appropriate corrective action. Also, especially in autonomous vehicle applications, it is less important to detect features which are behind the LADAR.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Features are usually objects which are present in the range of the LADAR and which reflect light but can also be, for example, differing surfaces of ground. For ease of explanation, the remaining description will refer to objects which are detected.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a LADAR 10 is shown having a laser transmission and reception means 12, a parabolic mirror 14 and an analysis and control means<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 16. In this example, the laser transmission and reception means 12 rotates a single laser unit and emits laser beam pulses every 15°. The parabolic mirror 14 is positioned between angles 120° and 240°, taking laser beam path P<sub>8</sub> as 0°. Accordingly, laser beam paths P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>15</sub> are positioned such that the laser pulses following those paths do not interact with the mirror 14. Laser beam paths C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>8</sub> interact with the mirror 14 and are reflected, due to the parabolic nature of the mirror 14, parallel with laser beam path P<sub>8</sub>.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">When a laser beam emitted by the laser unit strikes an object in its path, the object reflects a proportion of the laser beam back towards the LADAR 10. For example, laser beams emitted along paths P<sub>13</sub> and P<sub>14</sub> will strike object A and laser light will be reflected back to the LADAR 10. The laser transmission and reception means 12 comprises a light reception means, such as an electronic image sensor, capable of detecting the reflected laser light.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The analysis and control means 16 comprises a pulse controller 18, a time-delay analysis means 20 and a position analysis means 22. The pulse controller 18 controls the laser unit to emit pulses of laser beams at pre-defined angular rotations or at regular time intervals with the angle of the beam emission being recorded. The time-delay analysis means 20 calculates the time-delay between the emission of the laser beams and the receipt of reflected light at the light reception means. As the speed of light is known, the position analysis means 22 can calculate a position of an object reflecting light from the angle at which the laser beam was emitted.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The position analysis means 22 is pre-configured with the position of the parabolic mirror 14. Where the laser unit is at an angle such that the laser beam will not be reflected by the parabolic mirror, such as beam paths P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>15</sub>, the position analysis means can calculate a polar coordinate position for any object which reflects light from the laser beam. The angle at which the beam is emitted gives the angular coordinate θ and the distance to the object gives the radial coordinate <i>r</i>.

Moreover, <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref> shows the difference between the heights given in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> for the same angles. As the graph is significantly curved, it is clear that the difference in heights is not uniform as the angle of the LADAR beam changes.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">As a result of the above calculations, the intercept height <i>y</i> can be determined for a LADAR beam if <i>p</i>, the distance from the vertex to the focus of the parabola, is known, the angle of the LADAR beam is known and centre of reference (<i>x<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>y<sub>0</sub></i>) is at the focal point of the parabolic mirror.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">As the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinate of the intercept point on the parabolic mirror can be calculated, it is possible to correct any distance calculation to take into account the mirror 14. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>, the laser transmission and reception means 12 and the parabolic mirror 14 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> are shown with reference to an x-y coordinate system having its reference point (<i>x<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>y<sub>0</sub></i>) at the focal point of the parabolic mirror 14. A beam 24 is emitted from a laser unit in the laser transmission and reception means 12 and is reflected from the parabolic mirror at an intercept point (<i>x̂,ŷ</i>) before being reflected back along the same path from an object (not shown). The time-delay analysis means 20 calculates the time-delay between the emission of the laser beam 24 and the receipt of reflected light at the light reception means. The position analysis means 22 can then calculate a distance <i>d<sub>t</sub></i> between the laser unit and the object along the laser beam path 24. Once the distance <i>d<sub>t</sub></i> has been calculated to the object based on the time delay of the reflected light, the additional distance travelled by the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> LADAR beam due to reflection from the parabolic mirror can be deducted. As we have the location of the intercept (<i>x̂</i>,<i>ŷ</i>), the distance from the reference point <i>d<sub>ref</sub></i> can be calculated as follows <maths id="math0053" num="(49)"><math display="block"><msub><mi>d</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">ref</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>d</mi><mi>t</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><mover><mi>x</mi><mo>^</mo></mover><mo>-</mo><msqrt><msup><mover><mi>x</mi><mo>^</mo></mover><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mover><mi>y</mi><mo>^</mo></mover><mn>2</mn></msup></msqrt></math><img id="ib0053" file="imgb0053.tif" wi="132" he="13" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0073" num="0073">As such, the system can provide a Cartesian coordinate position for an object reflecting light from a LADAR beam emission using a parabolic mirror.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">Referring once again to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, objects B and C are not detected by any of LADAR beam paths P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>15</sub> due to the diverging nature of the beam paths. If the direction of beam path P<sub>8</sub> is, for example, the direction of travel of an autonomous vehicle, detecting objects B and C is important. Prior art systems increase the resolution by increasing the sub-divisions of angles at which laser beams are emitted. This is often enabled by increasing the number of lasers used in the system.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">If a particular direction is of most interest, such as is the case with autonomous vehicles, then using a mirror can increase the resolution in that direction. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the mirror 14 enables the laser beam paths in a direction which is of less interest, such as behind a vehicle, to be used to increase the resolution in another direction, which in this case is in the direction of beam path P<sub>8</sub>. Object B is detected by beam paths C<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>7</sub> and Object C is detected by beam paths C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>. Furthermore, in the special case of a parabolic mirror, the resolution does not decrease with distance from the LADAR unit 10.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Although the system above is described in relation to a parabolic mirror, other concave mirrors can also improve the resolution of the system, although without the added benefit of direct calculation into the Cartesian coordinate system. In addition, it can be envisaged that the reflected light rays may even converge from a mirror to give increased resolution at a particular point.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Furthermore, although the mirror described herein is referred to as a single mirror, multiple or arrays of mirrors may be used to provide the same effect. In addition, it is possible within the scope of the invention to add other optic elements, such as refractive lenses, to alter the path of light rays. Light rays could be refracted before they are reflected from the reflection means or, if they are not intended to be reflected from the reflection means, to converge the light rays more than they would have been.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">The main application envisaged for a LIDAR of this type is in autonomous vehicles in systems such as collision avoidance systems or terrain selection systems. For either application, the LIDAR could be mounted at wheel height, around the position that headlights would normally be placed, in order to detect such objects as ruts in the road. In this manner an autonomous vehicle can select not only objects to avoid but the most promising terrain to progress over. Given that the information that the LIDAR can provide can be used in these systems for autonomous vehicles, it can also be envisaged that it can be used in driver assistance systems in vehicles for training or warning drivers about objects or terrain choices.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56978849" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Gerät zur Detektion mittels Licht- und Abstandmessung (LIDAR) (10), umfassend:
