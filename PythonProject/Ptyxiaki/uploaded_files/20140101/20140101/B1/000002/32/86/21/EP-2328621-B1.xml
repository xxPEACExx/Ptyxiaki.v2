mxw-id="PDES63957096" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a novel formulation of indocyanine green which can be used as a diagnostic agent, in particular for fluorescence imaging, and to a process for the preparation thereof and uses thereof.</p><heading id="h0001"><b>[Prior art]</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Fluorescence imaging is an imaging technique which is based on the injection of a fluorescent label into an animal or human and detection of the localisation of the fluorescent label. The instrumentation accordingly comprises an excitation source for the fluorescent label and a detector for the fluorescence emitted by the label.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Nowadays, fluorescence imaging appears as a complementary imaging technique to other modalities such as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), PET (positron emission tomography), SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography), ultrasonic echography, radiography or X-ray tomography.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Fluorescence imaging has a number of advantages over the other imaging techniques:
<ul><li>it does not use ionising rays and therefore does not require radiological protection or the complex management of radioactive waste;</li><li>the instrumentation is inexpensive, compact and simple to use;</li><li>the acquisition times are very short;</li><li>it is a technique that is very sensitive in terms of the concentration of label to be injected, the concentration of label is much lower than for MRI and similar to that used in PET and SPECT;</li><li>it is a technique whose resolution is similar to that of nuclear imaging (PET, SPECT) when imaging is carried out non-invasively on the scale of a small animal or an organ, and which can have cellular resolution when microscopy techniques are used.</li></ul></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">At present, fluorescein and indocyanine green are approved fluorophores in the United States for injection in humans.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Indocyanine green, which is referred to hereinbelow as ICG, is sold under the name Cardiogreen (Akorn Inc.), Infracyanine (Serb), ICG-Pulsion (Pulsion Medical System). The compound has the following formula:
<chemistry id="chem0001" num="0001"><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="76" he="36" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is a fluorophore which emits in the near-infrared. That range is of particular interest for fluorescence imaging because, compared with the visible range, the tissues absorb the light less, the tissues diffuse the light less, and the autofluorescence of the tissues is reduced.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">For that reason, indocyanine green is nowadays the fluorophore of choice for clinical applications of fluorescence imaging.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">However, ICG has some properties which render its use as a fluorescent label problematic.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">First of all, ICG is an amphiphilic compound with a solubility of from 5 to 10 mg/ml and is therefore poorly soluble in water. At higher concentrations, dimers or aggregates having different spectral properties are formed.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Moreover, ICG has poor stability and a low fluorescence quantum yield in aqueous solution, especially because of the formation of those poorly emissive dimers. Therefore, the FDA requires the solutions to be prepared less than 10 hours before injection into the patient.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In addition, ICG is adsorbed on plasma proteins to a considerable degree when injected by the intravenous route, which alters the absorption and emission<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> spectrum.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Furthermore, the fluorescence lifetime of ICG (0.5 ns) is very close to that of the autofluorescence of biological tissues (typically 0.3-0.4 ns). It is therefore difficult to distinguish the ICG fluorescence from the tissue autofluorescence using a fluorescence device based on pulsed luminous excitation.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Finally, ICG does not have a grafting group allowing it to be coupled to targeting biomolecules or molecules such as antibodies, peptides, saccharides, proteins, oligonucleotides or aptamers. The grafting of targeting molecules is valuable because, after systemic injection, it allows the fluorophore to be directed <i>in vivo</i> to the zone of interest, which would result in the preferential accumulation of ICG in the zone to be imaged and consequently in an increase in the detection sensitivity.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A number of ICG formulations have been proposed for overcoming some of those problems.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Accordingly, for the treatment of lesions by photocoagulation, patent application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2001017561A"><text>WO 2001/017561</text></patcit> proposes formulations of ICG which allow its solubility and chemical stability to be increased, which formulations comprise alcohol, buffers, surfactants, glycerol, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), oils, red blood cells, fatty acids and antimicrobial agents. Patent application <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20040156782A"><text>US 2004/0156782</text></patcit> describes formulations of ICG in lyophilised form for angiography, measuring hepatic or cardiac clearance, or measuring blood flow.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Patent application <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2003057259A"><text>WO 2003/057259</text></patcit> describes a formulation of ICG which is based on liposomes and allows the solubility of the fluorophore to be increased. The location of the fluorophore is not specified. However, given that the fluorophore is added after formation of the liposomes, it is to be assumed that it is adsorbed at their surface. Moreover, the stability of this formulation is less than one month. Finally, liposomes are vesicles with a double-layer shell and generally have particle sizes greater than 100 nm in diameter; solutions of particles of that size diffuse light and do not permit satisfactory extravasation of the blood<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> circulation to tumour tissues and internalisation in the cells.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">It has also been proposed to adsorb ICG on cargo molecules, especially in order to increase its blood half-life. For example, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO2005082423A"><text>WO 2005/082423</text></patcit> describes conjugation by non-specific adsorption of serum albumin with ICG. However, formulations based on non-covalent adsorption bonds have low chemical stability and limit the choice of biological targeting ligands which can be used. Accordingly, small targeting peptides such as cRGD, an angiogenesis marker which has been greatly studied (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Haubner et al. JACS 1996, 118, 7461-7472</text></nplcit>), cannot be associated with ICG in order to produce a fluorescent label by those methods.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Patent application <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US20050019265A"><text>US 2005/0019265</text></patcit> proposes a fluorophore formulation in polymersomes. However, such synthetic liposomes are complicated to synthesise, require the use of synthetic polymers and do not directly yield nanoparticles suitable for permitting successful extravasation of the blood circulation to tumour tissues and internalisation in the cells, namely less than 100 nm and even less than 50 nm.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO2008102065A"><text>WO 2008/102065</text></patcit> describes a fluorescent nanoemulsion for in vivo fluorescence imaging.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In addition, documents <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US7014839B"><text>US 7,014,839</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="WO9848846A"><text>WO 98/48846</text></patcit> describe a formulation of ICG in the form of an emulsion of the oil-in-water type, but without indicating the method of production or the characteristics of the emulsion. However, that type of formulation leads in most cases to emulsions in which the droplet size is too large to limit the diffusion of light and ensure satisfactory colloidal stability and furtivity after injection <i>in vivo.</i></p><heading id="h0002"><b>[Technical problem]</b></heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">The proposed formulations do not allow the performance of ICG as a fluorophore for fluorescence imaging to be optimised. It was therefore desired to have available an ICG formulation which can be used for fluorescence imaging and which is stable and allows its optical properties to be optimised, especially by preserving them from the external environment, and which permits access to transparent formulations which, after injection, exhibit satisfactory extravasation of the blood circulation to tumour tissues and internalisation in the cells.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><b>[Summary of the invention]</b></heading><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to the invention, it is proposed to formulate ICG in an emulsion comprising a solubilising lipid in the oily phase according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to a first aspect, therefore, the invention relates to a formulation of indocyanine green in the form of a nanoemulsion, comprising a continuous aqueous phase and at least one dispersed oily phase, in which the oily phase comprises indocyanine green, at least one amphiphilic lipid and at least one solubilising lipid according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The amphiphilic lipid is preferably a phospholipid.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The oily phase can further comprise at least one oil, especially an oil having a hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) of from 3 to 6, in particular soybean oil or linseed oil.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The aqueous phase preferably further comprises a cosurfactant, especially a cosurfactant having at least one chain composed of ethylene oxide units or of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide units. The cosurfactant can be chosen especially from polyethylene glycol/phosphatidylethanolamine conjugates (PEG-PE), ethers of fatty acid and polyethylene glycol, esters of fatty acid and polyethylene glycol and block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The continuous phase of the emulsion can comprise especially a physiologically acceptable buffer.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">According to a second aspect, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of a formulation of indocyanine green comprising at least one<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> continuous aqueous phase and at least one dispersed oily phase, which process comprises steps in which:
<ol><li>(i) the oily phase comprising at least one solubilising lipid, an amphiphilic lipid and ICG is prepared;</li><li>(ii) the oily phase is dispersed in an aqueous phase under a shearing action sufficient to form a nanoemulsion; and</li><li>(iii) the nanoemulsion so formed is recovered.</li></ol></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The shearing action can be exerted in particular by sonication.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The oily phase can be prepared especially by dissolving all or some of the constituents in a suitable solvent and then evaporating off the solvent.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">According to a third aspect, the invention relates to said formulation of indocyanine green for use as a diagnostic agent.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">When so formulated, ICG exhibits considerably improved optical characteristics (about 10 times more performance), which allows the performance in imaging to be improved or the injected dose to be reduced. For example, 2 to 10 ml of ICG formulated as a nanoemulsion at 0.27 mg/ml emit a fluorescent signal at least as intense as 2 to 8 ml of a solution at 2.5 mg/ml ICG (dose injected intravenously in a human weighing 70 kg in order to measure the circulating blood volume and the cardiac output).</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Furthermore, the formulation according to the invention is very stable, both in chemical terms and on a colloidal level and as regards the optical performance over time.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Another of the advantages of the present formulation is that it can be prepared in an isotonic medium, such as 154 mM sodium chloride, unlike ICG in suspension, which flocculates in such a medium and is therefore injected in a hypotonic medium (5% glucose water).<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">It is entirely suitable for use in fluorescence imaging in so far as it is preferably constituted by compounds which are today all approved for injection in humans.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The formulation of ICG according to the invention is additionally readily accessible given that it is very easy to prepare and is inexpensive.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In addition, the formulation can be adapted to different pharmaco-kinetics by modifying the molar composition of the ingredients.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Finally, the formulation according to the invention can be functionalised and therefore enables the ICG to be rendered transportable to the zone of interest that is to be imaged by means of grafting with a targeting biomolecule or molecule, which opens up new clinical applications for fluorescence imaging.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>[Definitions]</b></heading><p id="p0040" num="0040">Within the scope of the present description, the term "nanoemulsion" is understood as being a composition having at least two phases, generally an oily phase and an aqueous phase, in which the average size of the dispersed phase is less than 1 micron, preferably from 10 to 500 nm and in particular from 20 to 100 nm (see article <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>C. Solans, P. Izquierdo, J. Nolla, N. Azemar and M.J. Garcia-Celma, Curr Opin Colloid In, 2005, 10, 102-110</text></nplcit>).</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The term "droplet" includes both droplets of liquid oil as such and the solid particles obtained from emulsions of the oil-in-water type in which the oily phase is solid. In the latter case, the expression solid emulsion is also often used.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Within the scope of this description, the term "lipid" denotes the totality of the fatty materials or of the substances containing fatty acids that are present in fats of animal origin and in plant oils. They are hydrophobic or amphiphilic molecules constituted principally of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and having a density less than that of water. Lipids can be in the solid state at ambient temperature (25°C), as in waxes, or liquid, as in oils.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The term "phospholipid" refers to lipids having a phosphate group, especially phosphoglycerides. In most cases, phospholipids comprise a hydrophilic end formed by the optionally substituted phosphate group and two hydrophobic ends formed by fatty acid chains. Among the phospholipids, particular mention may be made of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine and sphingomyelin.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The term "lecithin" denotes phosphatidylcholine, that is to say a lipid formed from a choline, a phosphate, a glycerol and two fatty acids. More generally, it covers phospholipids extracted from living organisms, of plant or animal origin, in so far as they are for the most part constituted by phosphatidylcholine. Such lecithins generally constitute mixtures of lecithins carrying different fatty acids.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The expression "fatty acid" is used to denote aliphatic carboxylic acids having a carbon-containing chain of at least 4 carbon atoms.
