This disadvantage can be also noticed when belts with stiffening cables, which are buried therein, are employed; these cables, are in fact cut when cutting the looped toothed belt, thus being cut themselves at the coupling region.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Therefore, during the closed looped belt for the transport of articles and/or for power transmissions functioning, the coupling region is the belt section which is likely subjected to breaking.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5092823A"><text>US 5 092 823</text></patcit>, which discloses the features mentioned in the preamble of claim 1, concerns an interlocking belt having an elongated female member and an elongated male member extending from its ends. The male and female members extend generally parallel to the lateral edges of the belt and include interlocking complementary dovetail-like projections and notches. A pair of pins extend through the ends of the male and female members for ensuring that the male and female members do not separate as they travel around a pulley. The geometry of the male and female members is such that longitudinal forces extending between the female and male members are borne by the dovetail-like projections and notches and not the pins.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US4063463A"><text>US 4 063 463</text></patcit> is concerned with a method of fitting a belt to a filter assembly of the endless belt type having belt-tensioning means in which a belt blank, the end portions of which are at least only partially vulcanized and which have disposed therein recesses arranged to receive in friction locking manner connecting members having an end portion whose configuration corresponds to the configuration of its receiving recess, is placed in position in the assembly around said belt-tensioning means such that the ends of said belt lie adjacent each other, whereafter the connecting members are inserted in respective recesses to form an endless belt having a friction-locked joint, the ends of said belt are fully vulcanized, and the belt is tensioned.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide a method for obtaining a closed looped belt starting from using a belt piece which can be employed for the transport of articles and/or for power transmissions, of the type which can be closed as a loop by means of restraining the relative ends.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method for obtaining a closed looped belt, whose realization costs are relatively low with<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> respect to the objects intended to be pursued.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Said objects are obtained by means of a method for obtaining a closed looped belt starting from said belt piece, as protected in the independent claim 1.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The features of the invention, not emerging from the previous description, will be better highlighted in the following, according to what is claimed and with reference to the appended drawings, in which:

As it will be better précised in the following, the thus restrained ends are stable in longitudinal and transverse direction to the extension direction of the looped toothed belt 10, thus obtained.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As a way of example, the restrained ends 2, 3 of the closed looped toothed belt 10 can be mutually fixed by means of local melting of respective thermoplastic material, according to techniques known to the experts in the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> art; therefore <figref idrefs="f0003">fig. 5</figref> shows a portion of the section of the closed looped toothed belt 10 of <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 4</figref> after fixing by melting the ends 2, 3 (shown by the dotted line in <figref idrefs="f0003">fig. 5</figref>).</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Yet referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 4</figref>, still prior to the local melting of the thermoplastic material, it is clear how the restrained ends 2, 3 result stable in particular in the direction of the longitudinal extension of the closed looped toothed belt 10 (in the following briefly indicated as "looped belt 10"); in other words, the ends 2, 3 are so shaped that their restraining advantageously opposes a significant resistance to longitudinal traction efforts, which the looped belt 10 can be subjected to during its normal functioning, for the transport of articles and/or for power transmissions.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In greater detail, at the inner longitudinal sides 81, 82 of the ends 2, 3, the complementary profiles 4, 5 comprise a plurality of first 6 and second portions 7, which are respectively arranged in mutual contact when the ends 2, 3 are restrained with respect to each other; and which press the one against the other in case a longitudinal traction effort is applied to the closed looped belt piece 1 (i.e. the looped belt 10). The interaction stabilizing between each couple formed by a first 6 and a second portion 7 contributes singularly to create a total resistant force opposing and compensating the traction effort, thus preventing the ends 2, 3 from sliding in longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Each couple thus defined can oppose a maximum value of resistant force which depends on the configuration (shape and dimensions) of the contacting surfaces of the corresponding first 6 and second portion 7; these contacting surfaces extend transversely to the longitudinal axis of the looped belt 10. As a consequence, the maximum value of total resistant force the restrained ends 2, 3 can oppose to a traction effort in longitudinal direction depends on the total interaction of the plurality of first 6 and second portions 7.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Depending on the usages the looped belt 10 is intended to, i.e. the traction efforts it is subjected to during its functioning, it is possible to specifically design the configuration and the extension of the coupling ends 2, 3 of the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> belt piece 1, from which the same looped belt 10 is obtained; by varying the configuration and the longitudinal dimensions of the inner sides 81, 82 of the ends 2, 3 (and so the number of the first 6 and second portions 7, as well as shape and dimensions of the respective contacting surfaces) it is in fact possible to obtain belt pieces 1, which when closed as a loop, have determined features of resistance to the longitudinal traction efforts.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The appended drawings show clearly in this case that the longitudinal extension of the first 2 and second end 3 is a predetermined number of times greater than the transverse dimension of the belt piece 1.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A not shown embodiment of the belt piece 1 can be provided with coupling ends extending on a length greater than the dimensions of a section of the corresponding looped belt 10.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The next fixing of the ends 2, 3 of the looped belt 10 is needed to wrap the belt around pulleys, thus guaranteeing the same ends 2, 3 being stably coupled; moreover, such fixing gives the looped belt 10 more resistance to traction efforts in longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Referring for example to <figref idrefs="f0003">fig. 5</figref>, it can be noticed that the complementary profiles 4, 5 comprise patterns, always equal along the extension of the longitudinal sides 81, 82 of the ends 2, 3; once the shape of the complementary profiles 4, 5 is determined, it is thus clear that the maximum resistance to a traction effort increases with the increase of the extension of the ends 2, 3, as the number of couples of first 6 and second portions 7 of complementary profiles 4, 5 increases and so the total contacting surface on which the traction effort can be "unloaded".</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">At the transverse sides 83, 84, 85, 86 of the ends 2, 3 instead, the complementary profiles 4, 5 comprise two couples, each formed by a third 12 and a fourth portion 13; said third 12 and fourth portion 13 being arranged in mutual contact respectively, when the ends 2, 3 are restrained with respect to each other and press the one against the other in case a transverse stress is applied on the closed looped belt piece 1 (i.e. looped belt 10).

This is needed to maintain the ends 2, 3 of the closed looped toothed belt piece 1 in a coupling configuration, when the piece is wrapped around the pulleys.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The resistance to the traction efforts of the looped belt 10 is instead mainly exerted by the ends 2, 3 being restrained, as above-précised, by means of the interaction of the contacting surfaces of the first 6 and second portions of complementary profiles 4, 5.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The assembly of small block 23-false tooth 18 units can be advantageously used also for the transport of articles; as a way of example, fig. 19 shows a looped belt 10 which comprises small blocks 23 of different type. A first type of greater dimensioned small block is indicated with the reference number 23A; it is intended to allow the transport of an article (not indicated) and contributes to the removable fixing of the ends 2, 3 of the looped belt 10. A second type of small block 23B contributes instead only to the removable fixing of the ends 2, 3 of the looped belt 10.
