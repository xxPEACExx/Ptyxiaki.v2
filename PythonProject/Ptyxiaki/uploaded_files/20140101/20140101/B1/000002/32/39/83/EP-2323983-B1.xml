There are two major classes of chemokines, CXC and CC, depending on whether the first two cysteines in the amino acid sequence are separated by a single amino acid (CXC) or are adjacent (CC). The CXC chemokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8), neutrophil-activating protein-2 (NAP-2) and melanoma growth stimulatory activity protein (MGSA) are chemotactic primarily for neutrophils and T lymphocytes, whereas the CC chemokines, such as RANTES, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, the monocyte chemotactic proteins (MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, and MCP-5) and the eotaxins (-1 and -2) are chemotactic for, among other cell types, macrophages, T lymphocytes, eosinophils, dendritic cells, and basophils.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The chemokines bind to specific cell-surface receptors belonging to the family of G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane-domain proteins which are termed "chemokine receptors." On binding their cognate ligands, chemokine receptors transduce an intracellular signal though the associated trimeric G proteins, resulting in, among other responses, a rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentration, changes in cell shape, increased expression of cellular adhesion molecules, degranulation, and promotion of cell migration. There are at least ten human chemokine receptors that bind or respond to CC chemokines with the following characteristic patterns: CCR-1 (or "CKR-1" or "CC-CKR-1") [MIP-1α, MCP-3,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> MCP-4, RANTES] CCR-2A and CCR-2B (or "CKR-2A"/"CKR-2B" or "CC-CKR-2A"/"CC-CKR-2B") (MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-5];CCR-3 (or "CKR-3" or "CC-CKR-3") [eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, RANTES, MCP-3, MCP-4]; CCR-4 (or "CKR-4" or "CC-CKR-4") [TARC, MDC]; CCR-5 (or "CKR-5" OR "CC-CKR-5") [MIP-1α, RANTES, MIP-1β]; CCR-6 (or "CKR-6" or "CC-CKR-6") [LARC]; CCR-7 (or "CKR-7" or "CC-CKR-7") [ELC]; CCR-8 (or "CKR-8" or "CC-CKR-8") [I-309]; CCR-10 (or "CKR-10" or "CC-CKR-10") [MCP-1, MCP-3]; and CCR-11 [MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-4].</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In addition to the mammalian chemokine receptors, mammalian cytomegaloviruses, herpesviruses and poxviruses have been shown to express, in infected cells, proteins with the binding properties of chemokine receptors. Human CC chemokines, such as RANTES and MCP-3, can cause rapid mobilization of calcium via these virally encoded receptors. Receptor expression may be permissive for infection by allowing for the subversion of normal immune system surveillance and response to infection. Additionally, human chemokine receptors, such as CXCR4, CCR2, CCR3, CCR5 and CCR8, can act as co-receptors for the infection of mammalian cells by microbes as with, for example, the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The chemokines and their cognate receptors have been implicated as being important mediators of inflammatory, infectious, and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, including asthma and allergic diseases, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and arthrosclerosis (reviewed in: <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Carter, P.H., Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 2002, 6, 510</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Trivedi et al., Ann. Reports Med. Chem. 2000, 35, 191</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Saunders et al., Drug Disc. Today 1999, 4, 80</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>Premack et al., Nature Medicine 1996,2,1174</text></nplcit>). For example, the chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1α) and its receptor CC Chemokine Receptor 1 (CCR-1) play a pivotal role in attracting leukocytes to sites of inflammation and in subsequently activating these cells. When the chemokine MIP-1α binds to CCR-1, it induces a rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentration, increased expression of cellular adhesion molecules, cellular degranulation, and the promotion of leukocyte migration.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In addition, demonstration of the chemotactic properties of MIP-1α in humans has been provided experimentally. Human subjects, when injected intradermally with MIP-1α, experienced a rapid and significant influx of leukocytes to the site of injection (<nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>Brummet, M.E., J. Immun. 2000, 164, 3392-3401</text></nplcit>).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Demonstration of the importance of the MIP-1α/CCR-1 interaction has been provided by experiments with genetically modified mice. MIP-1α -/- mice had normal numbers of leukocytes, but were unable to recruit monocytes into sites of viral inflammation after immune challenge. Recently, MIP-1α -/- mice were shown to be resistant to collagen antibody induced arthritis. Likewise, CCR-1 -/- mice were unable to recruit neutrophils when challenged with MIP-1α <i>in vivo;</i> moreover, the peripheral blood neutrophils of CCR-1 null mice did not migrate in response to MIP-1α, thereby demonstrating the specificity of the MIP-1α/CCR-1 interaction. The viability and generally normal health of the MIP-1α-/- and CCR-1 -/- animals is noteworthy, in that disruption of the MIP-1α/CCR-1 interaction does not induce physiological crisis. Taken together, these data lead one to the conclusion that molecules that block the actions of MIP-1α would be useful in treating a number of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. This hypothesis has now been validated in a number of different animal disease models, as described below.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is known that MIP-1α is elevated in the synovial fluid and blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, several studies have demonstrated the potential therapeutic value of antagonism of the MIP-1α/CCR1 interaction in treating rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It should also be noted that CCR-1 is also the receptor for the chemokines RANTES, MCP-3, HCC-1, Lkn-1/HCC-2, HCC-4, and MPIF-1 (<nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>Carter, P.H., Curr. Opin Chem. Bio. 2002, 6, 510-525</text></nplcit>). Since it is presumed that the new compound of formula (I) described herein antagonizes MIP-1α by binding to the CCR-1 receptor, it may be that this compound is also an effective antagonist of the actions of the aforementioned ligand that are mediated by CCR-1. Accordingly, when reference is made herein to "antagonism of MIP-1α," it is to be assumed that this is equivalent to "antagonism of chemokine stimulation of CCR-1."<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Recently, a number of groups have described the development of small molecule antagonists of MIP-1α (reviewed in: <nplcit id="ncit0007" npl-type="s"><text>Carson, K.G. et al., Ann.

For a tablet dosage form, the compound of this invention generally may be present in an amount of about 5 to 10 milligrams per dosage unit, and the second anti-coagulant in an amount of about 1 to 5 milligrams per dosage unit.</p><p id="p0142" num="0142">Where two or more of the foregoing second therapeutic agents are administered with the compound of Formula I, generally the amount of each component in a typical daily dosage and typical dosage form may be reduced relative to the usual dosage of the agent when administered alone, in view of the additive or synergistic effect of the therapeutic agents when administered in combination. Particularly when provided as a single dosage unit, the potential exists for a chemical interaction between the combined active ingredients. For this reason, when the compound of Formula I and a second therapeutic agent are combined in a single dosage unit they are formulated such that although the active ingredients are combined in a single dosage unit, the physical contact between the active ingredients is minimized (that is, reduced). For example, one active ingredient may be enteric coated. By enteric coating one of the active ingredients, it is possible not only to minimize the contact between the combined active ingredients, but also, it is possible to control the release of one of these components in the gastrointestinal tract such that<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> one of these components is not released in the stomach but rather is released in the intestines. One of the active ingredients may also be coated with a material which effects a sustained-release throughout the gastrointestinal tract and also serves to minimize physical contact between the combined active ingredients. Furthermore, the sustained-released component can be additionally enteric coated such that the release of this component occurs only in the intestine. Still another approach would involve the formulation of a combination product in which the one component is coated with a sustained and/or enteric release polymer, and the other component is also coated with a polymer such as a low-viscosity grade of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) or other appropriate materials as known in the art, in order to further separate the active components. The polymer coating serves to form an additional barrier to interaction with the other component.</p><p id="p0143" num="0143">These as well as other ways of minimizing contact between the components of combination products of the present invention, whether administered in a single dosage form or administered in separate forms but at the same time by the same manner, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, once armed with the present disclosure.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56978801" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Verbindung der Formel (I):
