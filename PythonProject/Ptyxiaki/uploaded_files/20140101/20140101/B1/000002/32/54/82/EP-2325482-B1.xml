load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to an arrangement with a nacelle of a wind turbine and with a radiator, which is arranged on top of the nacelle.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">The radiator is connected with the outer surface of the nacelle and is used to radiate heat, which is generated inside the nacelle to the ambient air.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The transport of wind turbine components is a challenge due to the physical dimensions of the components. Especially nacelles for an offshore site may show a length up to 12 meters or more and a diameter up to 5 meters.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For a transportation on roads it is necessary, to plan the road-connection carefully, as a transport-vehicle has to circumvent or has to cope with all barriers like curves, tunnels, bridges, traffic lights, etc.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">One example is the Elbe-tunnel, which is close to Hamburg, Germany. The tunnel shows a minimum height of 4.20 m, thus a transported component and the used vehicle has to comply with this height.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In Europe a standard height of new bridges is 4.50 m, but there are many older bridges, which show a lower height of clearance.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Thus the transport vehicle and the transported component have to be constructed in a way that they comply with all of those traffic barriers or traffic restrictions along the way to a planned site for the wind turbine.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Thus the construction of wind turbine components with a high diameter is limited in a certain way.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is well-known that a radiator is arranged on top of a wind turbine. Due to the transport limitations the radiator and the nacelle are transported separately to the planned site. At the site the radiator is placed on top of the nacelle and is connected with the nacelle.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004285984A"><text>JP 2004 285984 A</text></patcit> discloses a wind mill which is designed to reduce costs by reduced capacity and weight of the nacelle. Even maintenance operations are reduced. The document especially refers to a pipe structure, to be used against fire in the nacelle.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide an improved arrangement with the nacelle and the radiator, which allows reduction of the complexity of the transport.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">This object is achieved by the features of claim 1. Preferred configurations are object of the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to the invention the arrangement contains a nacelle and a radiator.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The nacelle is connected with a rotational axis. The radiator is connected with the rotational axis, too. Thus the radiator can be turned around the rotational axis between a first position and a second position.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">If the radiator is turned in the first position the radiator projects above the nacelle. Thus the radiator can be used in this position to transmit heat, which is generated inside the nacelle, to the environment.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">If the radiator is turned in the second position the radiator does not project above the nacelle or does only project by a minimum height above the nacelle. Thus the nacelle and the radiator show as common component a certain predefined minimum height.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">This allows the transport of the nacelle and the radiator as single component. The second position of the radiator allows a minimum height of the nacelle and of the radiator. Thus<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> barriers like tunnels or bridges along the way of transport can be overcome.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Preferably the rotational axis is close to the top side of the nacelle and near to its rear side. Thus the first position of the radiator is on top of the nacelle, while the second position is close to the rear side, while the rear side is not topped by the radiator.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Thus the second position of the radiator is kept while the nacelle is transported to the side of the wind turbine, while the first position is the working-position of the radiator at the site of the wind turbine.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to the invention the radiator can be installed and connected in a controlled production facility. It is no longer necessary to transport the nacelle and the needed radiator as separate components to the site.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Preferably the radiator and the nacelle are connected by flexible tubes, which are used to transport a cooling medium between the nacelle and the radiator. The connection between the radiator and the nacelle is closed at the production facility and maintained later.<br/>
Thus the cooling medium can be filled into the closed cooling system at the production facility and therefore in a controlled environment.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to the invention there is no longer the need to use a crane for the installation of the radiator to the nacelle at the site. Thus personal do not longer have to climb on top of the nacelle to install and fixate the radiator in the first position.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to the invention there is no longer the need for a separated shipment of the radiator and the nacelle to the site.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The invention is described now in more detail by help of figures.
