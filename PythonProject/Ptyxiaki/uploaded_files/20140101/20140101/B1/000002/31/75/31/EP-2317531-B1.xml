The need to lock the control lever in one of its operative positions may be due to various circumstances. For instance, in the case in which the electrical apparatus is a circuit breaker for protecting an electrical installation, it may be convenient, for security reasons, during maintenance operations on the electrical installation, to lock the lever in an OFF position, i.e. in the open position of circuit breaker contacts, in order to avoid an (automatic or manual) resetting of circuit breaker, which is potentially dangerous for personnel maintaining the installation.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">An exemplary modular electrical apparatus of the known art of above said type, having a lockable control lever, is<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> disclosed in patent <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1288978A"><text>EP 1 288 978</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Another example of modular electrical apparatus with a lockable control lever is disclosed in patent application <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP1241692A"><text>EP 1 241 692</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Both above said patent publications of the known art disclose modular electrical apparatuses comprising a control lever which may be locked due to the fact that such lever comprises an element, which may slide with respect to a further portion of same control lever.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Although in said the above indicated electrical apparatuses, the provision of a sliding portion of control lever allows the locking of lever, it is to be noted that for achieving this goal, in such electrical apparatus, a certain complexity of structure of control lever is required. It is also to be noted that above said solutions of the known art don't seem to be practical in the case in which a plurality of adjacent side-by-side modular electrical apparatuses are to be operatively connected by means of a single distribution rail coupled to each of respective control lever, as for example described in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="DE1973477U"><text>DE 1973477 U</text></patcit>. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5322980A"><text>US 5 322 980</text></patcit> discloses another example of a modular electrical apparatus which control lever can be locked with a tie wrap and an additional locking element.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In view of the above indicated drawbacks of modular electrical apparatuses of the known art, there is felt the need to provide a modular electrical apparatus with a lockable control lever which does not require a particularly complex structure and which entails particular ease of use</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> when multiple modular electrical apparatuses are coupled or mounted together in a side-by-side formation.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The above need is complied with by means of embodiments of a modular electrical apparatus with a lockable control lever, which are to be provided in the following description, and whose general definition is provided in appended claim 1.

For example, circuit breaker 10 is a magneto-thermal circuit breaker. From now on, without introducing any limitation, reference will be made to the modular electrical apparatus 10, by using the term circuit breaker 10.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Circuit breaker 10 comprises a box-like main body 11 defining an internal space for housing electromechanical components of circuit breaker 10. The main box-like body has two opposite side faces 12, 13, which are planar or approximately planar and essentially parallel to each other, their mutual distance defining the modular size of circuit breaker 1, which in this example is equivalent to one module.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The box-like main body 11 also has an upper face 14 and an opposing lower face 15, a front face 16 and a rear face 17. In the embodiment shown in appended figures, circuit breaker 10 comprises an electrical connection terminal 22 on the side of upper face 14 and an electrical connection terminal 23, which is barely visible in figures, on the side of lower face 15.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">On the side of rear face 17, the main box-like body 10 has a recess 18 adapted for coupling the circuit breaker 10 to a support system for mounting circuit breaker 10 into an electrical board or box. For example, circuit breaker 10<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> comprises, on the side of rear face 17, latching elements 19, 20 which may be operated by means of a gripping element 21, the elements being provided on both opposite sides of recess 18, for holding circuit breaker 10 connected to the mounting rail, for example a DIN mounting rail. According to a possible embodiment, latching elements 19, 20 are provided according to the teachings of patent application <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="EP2003754A"><text>EP 2 003 754</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Circuit breaker 10 also comprises a control lever 25', which projects from front face 16 of circuit breaker 10 and which is operable either manually and/or by a modular automatic control device, which may be provided at circuit breaker 10 for switching the circuit breaker 10 from a closing state of contacts to an open state of contacts. Each of said states correspond to a respective stable operating position of control lever 25'.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to the exemplary embodiment, the control lever 25' may be rotated between two operating positions. In appended figures, the control lever 25' is always shown in the operating position corresponding to the OFF state, i.e. the opening condition of contacts of circuit breaker 10. The control lever 25' comprises a gripping element 25", comprised of a "C"-profiled bar, which is preferably removably locked to a remaining portion of control lever 25'.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to an alternate embodiment, which is not<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> shown, the control lever 23` instead of being a rotatable lever, is a cursor-like translatable lever between two operating positions.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">As shown in figures, according to an embodiment, the front face 16 of circuit breaker 10 comprises a projecting front portion 26, from which the control lever 25' protrudes. Such front projecting portion 26 is preferably a substantially centrally located portion, with respect to front face 16. In a so called DIN modular apparatus, such frontally projecting central portion is commonly called "DIN front".</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to an embodiment, circuit breaker 10 comprises a label carrying badge 28 which may be removably coupled to front projecting portion 26.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">circuit breaker 10 also comprises a covering mask 29, which may be removably coupled to front projecting portion 26 and has a generally "L" shaped profile. Such covering mask 29 may be removably locked to front projecting portion 26, at one of its corners. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 2</figref>, where the circuit breaker 10 is shown without the covering mask 29, on front face 16 of circuit breaker 10, two latching recesses 38, 39 are provided, which may cooperate with two corresponding latching flaps 30, 31, which are provided in covering mask 29 (<figref idrefs="f0003">fig. 5</figref>).</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Since the circuit breaker 10 is a modular electrical<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> apparatus, it is to be mounted in a side-by-side manner adjacent to one or more modular electrical apparatuses 10, in order to provide combinations of apparatuses. To this end, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">figs. 6</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">10</figref>, the further one or more electrical apparatuses 10 are put in a side-by-side arrangement along side faces 12 and 13. Such apparatuses 10 are kept adjacent to each other, when mounted on a rail, in a per se known way, by providing latching elements between apparatuses, at corresponding side faces 12, 13. This type of coupling is generally of the removable type.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Another possible side-by-side arrangement consists in a plurality of single modular elements 10 to be fixed to each other, as a packet, in a stable and irreversible way, for example by providing transversal rivets on side faces 12, 13 in order to form multi-modular electrical apparatuses. For example, starting with a unipolar circuit breaker 10, as the one shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1</figref>, it is possible to provide a bipolar circuit breaker 60 (<figref idrefs="f0003">fig. 6</figref>), a tripolar circuit breaker (not shown), a quadripolar circuit breaker 100 (<figref idrefs="f0005">fig. 10</figref>), etc.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As shown, in case of a plurality of side-by-side positioned modular electrical apparatuses 10, it is possible to stably associate a single gripping element 25" to these apparatuses (<figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006">fig. 6 to 12</figref>), providing a grip and coupling bar, for keeping the single control levers 25' fixed to each other even when performing a movement. The gripping element<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> 25" preferably has a substantially "C" or "U" shaped profile, so that a channel for receiving free end portions of control levers 25' is provided inside the same profile.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As one can appreciate by observing <figref idrefs="f0001">figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">6</figref> conjointly, a groove 35 is defined on at least one of side faces 12, 13 of circuit breaker 10, which groove extends between two opposite access openings 36, 37 exiting on front face 16, the groove 35 being such as to allow a locking element 70 to pass through it, which locking element is to be closed by a noose or loop for locking the control lever 25'. For example, the locking element 70 is a cable tie. In an alternate embodiment the locking element 70 is comprised of a metal wire, for example having a diameter of approx. 1,5/2 mm. It is to be noted that, in general, it is possible to use any foldable locking device 70, which is able to pass through the groove 35, when the former is in a linear arrangement and is folded and closed afterwards in order to form the noose or serrated loop on control lever 25' (more precisely, on its grip bar 25").</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">According to an embodiment, for example, the groove 35 is comprised of a notch defined in the thickness of a side wall of main body 11, which continuously extends between both access openings 36 and 37.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">According to an embodiment, on each side face 12, 13 of circuit breaker 10 a respective groove 35 of above said<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> kind is defined. From now on, reference will be made to the case in which the circuit breaker comprises two grooves 35, without introducing any limitation.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">It is to be noted that in the particular embodiment described, the recess 35 and access openings 36, 37 are defined in the projecting portion 26. With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 2</figref>, according to an embodiment, the access openings 36, 37 lie on a first plane p1 and a second plane p2, respectively, which are perpendicular to side faces 12, 13 of circuit breaker 10. Preferably, first p1 and second p2 planes are inclined to each other forming an angle between 70° and 90° (in the figure, the angle is formed between p1 and p2, by rotating p2 in a clockwise direction).</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Still with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 2</figref>, according to an embodiment, the control lever 25', when positioned in one of two stable operative positions, is interposed between the two openings 36 and 37 of recess 35. For example, it may be noted in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 2</figref>, where the control lever 25' is shown in an opening position (i.e. the opening position of contacts of circuit breaker 10), that the lever is interposed between the access opening 36 and access opening 37. One can therefore deduce that by letting a locking element 70, such as a cable tie, pass through the inside of groove 35, and by closing said element 70 in a noose or loop, and closing the same on the control lever, it is possible to retain the control lever 25'<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> locked in an open position.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Although it is possible to provide the groove 35 with a size such as by putting the circuit breaker 10 adjacent to a further circuit breaker 10, having a side wall without a groove 35, it is possible to insert a locking element into the groove, in a particularly convenient embodiment, shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 2</figref>, it is possible to foresee that each circuit breaker 10 comprises a respective groove 35, so that the grooves are juxtaposed to one another, when the circuit breakers 10 are adjacent to each other along one of side walls 12, 13. The juxtaposed grooves 35 therefore define a through channel, of prevailing longitudinal extension, which is substantially closed transversally and is able to be passed through by a locking element 70 provided for simultaneously locking the control levers 25' of both circuit breakers 10 in the same operating position. This solution allows each wall of circuit breakers to have a thickness which is locally reduced to a lesser extent with respect to the solution, where the groove 35 is entirely provided in a wall of only one circuit breaker. In this case, it is to be noted that by providing circuit breakers 10 having a respective groove 35 for each of side walls 12, 13, the manufacturers of electrical apparatuses do not need to offer redundant circuit breaker models, differing from one another only by the fact that the groove 35 is provided on one or the other of side walls.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005">Figs. 6 to 9</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005 f0007">10 to 13</figref> refer to a first and second group of parts, which embody a bipolar circuit breaker group 60 and tetrapolar circuit breaker group 100, respectively, which are formed by putting in a side-by-side formation two and four circuit breakers 10, respectively, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1</figref>. As one may observe, it is possible to provide in such groups 6 and 10 one common gripping element 25", which is coupled to all control levers 25' of separate unipolar circuit breakers 10. In this way, by letting a locking element 70, such as a cable tie, pass between the side walls of two adjacent circuit breakers, through a pair of juxtaposed grooves 35, it is possible to lock all control levers 25'.
