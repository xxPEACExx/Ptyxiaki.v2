assembly for a filter assembly for processing a liquid-state industrial process stream.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Filter assemblies are used in industrial facilities to selectively remove material from process streams. Filter assemblies are used to both remove undesirable contaminates from process streams and to extract desirable filtrates out of the process streams. Two such filter assemblies are disclosed in the Applicants' Assignees' <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5198111A"><text>U.S. Patents No. 5,198,111</text></patcit>, FILTER WITH RECIPROCATING CLEANING UNIT, issued March 30, 1993 and No. 5,527,462, FILTER WITH AXIALLY MOVABLE WIPER, issued June 18, 1996.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Generally, each of the above-referenced filter assemblies includes an elongated, cylindrically shaped housing. Internal to the housing there is a sleeve shaped filter element. The process stream to be filtered is introduced into the center of the filter element, usually through the top of the housing. The process stream is filtered as it passes from the inside to the outside of the filter member. The filtered process stream exits the filter assembly through an opening in the housing.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As the process stream passes through a filter assembly, the removed filtrate builds up on the inner wall of the filter element. If allowed to remain in place, the filtrate will, over time, first impede and then possibly block fluid flow through the filter assembly. Therefore, it is a common practice to further provide the filter assembly with a cleaning head. This cleaning head moves longitudinally up and down through the filter element to scrape off the filtrate that adheres to the element. Typically, the removed filtrate is allowed to flow through the bottom of the filter element and out through an opening in the bottom of the housing.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5198111A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,198,111</text></patcit> discloses a filter assembly wherein the cleaning head is mounted to a threaded shaft that extends longitudinally axially through the housing and filter element. A motor mounted to the housing rotates the shaft so as to cause the longitudinal displacement of the cleaning head. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5527462A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,527,462</text></patcit> discloses a filter assembly wherein the cleaning head is mounted to the end of a piston rod that extends down from the top of the housing into the filter element. The opposed end of the piston rod is disposed in a cylinder attached to the top of the housing. A fluid, such as compressed air, is applied to the cylinder in order to cause the extension/retraction of the piston rod and cleaning head through the filter element.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">One disadvantage associated with providing a filter assembly with a screw type cleaning head actuator is that the actuator has components that come into contact with the process stream. Steps must be taken to<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> ensure that the upline components that drive the moving components are not exposed to the process stream. For example, it is necessary to ensure that there is a liquid-tight seal around the opening through which the screw shaft enters the housing. A similar seal must be provided around the opening where the piston of the above-described linear actuator enters the housing. It should be understood that fluid typically enters the housing under a significant amount of pressure, for example 150 psi. In order to successfully perform the filter process, it may be necessary to repetitively actuate the cleaning head. Therefore, given that the seal around the actuator is subjected to significant pressure and the actuator itself is repeatedly actuated, this seal is subjected to significant wear. This wear requires that an appreciable amount of effort be spent verifying that the seal is maintaining its integrity, and when that integrity shows signs of failing, replacing the seal. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5198111A"><text>US 5 198 111 A</text></patcit> discloses a filter and movable cleaning member having top and bottom plates which are circular in shape. The plates have an outside diameter slightly less than the inside diameter of the filter. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US5527462A"><text>US 5 527 462 A</text></patcit> discloses a filter with axially movable cleaning member formed as a split ring having circumferential ends opposed across a circumferential gap.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">This invention is related to a generally disk shaped cleaning head assembly for a filter assembly for filtering industrial liquid-state process streams. The filter assembly includes said cleaning head with a sealed actuator.<br/>
Specifically, the actuator includes an actuator tube disposed in the assembly housing. A piston formed of magnets, is disposed is the actuator tube. The cleaning head is disposed over the actuator tube. Magnets associated with the cleaning head couple the head to the piston even though the actuator tube separates the two components.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The cleaning head of this invention is displaced up and down in the filter housing by selectively supplying a pressurized gas or liquid to the opposed ends of the actuator tube. In some versions of the invention, pressurized air is employed. The air causes the piston to move longitudinally through the actuator tube. Since the cleaning head is magnetically coupled to the piston, the longitudinal movement of the piston causes the like displacement of the cleaning head.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The filter assembly is constructed so that only the cleaning head and the complementary magnet carrier to which it is attached are the moving components exposed to the process stream. The actuator tube seals the components that force the movement of the cleaning head, the piston. Thus, it does not require one to provide some sort of liquid tight seal between a moving member that extends into the filter housing and a housing opening through which the member extends. The elimination of this seal, and the need to maintain it, minimize the overall costs associated with operating the filter assembly of this invention.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The invention is pointed out with particularity in the claims.

The filter assembly 20 includes a generally cylindrical housing 22. A pair of opposed legs 24 hold the housing 22 above ground level. Tabs 25 that extend from opposed sides of housing 22 connect the housing to the legs 24. A pair of feet 26, one foot 26 being attached to the end of each leg 24, stabilizes the housing 22 and the other components of the filter assembly 20 integral with the housing.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The top end of the housing 22 is open. A lid 28 that is hingedly attached to housing 22 selectively covers the top opening. A set of locking clamps 30 releasably hold the lid 28 over the open end of the housing 22. Each clamp 30 has a U-bolt 32 that engages over a separate tab 34 integral with a lip 36 that extends around the opening end of the housing 22. The engagement of the U-bolts 32 over the tabs 34 is what<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> holds the lid 28 over the housing 22. One source of clamps 30 is the Model 374 manufactured by De-Sta-Co Industries of Birmingham, Michigan.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">An O-ring 37 disposed in a groove in the upper exposed face of lip 36 provides a liquid-tight seal between the interface of housing 22 and lid 28 (groove not identified). A small bore 38 extends through the center axis of lid 28. Bore 38 functions as a vent.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The bottom end of housing 22 is also open. A bottom cone 40 is welded or otherwise permanently secured to the bottom end of housing 22. As seen by reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, it is noted that bottom cone 40 is formed with a lip 41 that is disposed within the bottom end of housing 22. Bottom cone 40 is further formed to have a tubularly shaped outlet fitting 39 that extends laterally away from the base or bottom end of the cone.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Bottom cone 40 is further shaped so that the section of the cone immediately below lip 41 and opposite the side of the cone from which fitting 39 extends downwardly from the inner perimeter of lip 41, cone section 42, has a constant diameter. The section of the cone 40 immediately below lip 41 and above fitting 39, cone section 43, curves inwardly and downwardly from lip 41. The end section of the bottom cone 40, cone end section 44, is semispherical in shape. The cone end section 44 is the portion of the bottom cone 40 from which the outlet fitting 39 extends.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">A tear-drop shaped boss 45 extends upwardly from the inner wall of the cone end section 44. Boss 45 is positioned so that the wide diameter section of the boss is centered on the longitudinal axis of the housing 22 and bottom cone 40. The narrow diameter<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> pointed end of boss 45 is directed towards, and is in line with, the longitudinal axis of the outlet fitting 39.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">A filter element 46 is disposed in the enclosed space defined by housing 22, lid 28 and bottom cone 40. The filter element includes a base ring 48 with an L-shaped cross-sectional profile from which a filter member 50 extends. While not specifically illustrated, one particular filter member 50 includes a number of longitudinally extending metal ribs that are spaced a small distance apart from each other. The ribs extend circumferentially around the base member. Spaced apart metal annular ribs extend around the outer surface of the longitudinally extending ribs. The interstitial gaps between the ribs of the filter member 50 are the pores through which the process liquid flows.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">A top ring 51, similar in shape to bottom ring 48, extends around the top of the filter member 50. U-shaped handles 52, one partially shown, extend upwardly from top ring 51. Handles 52 facilitate the installation and removal of the filter element 46 from housing 22.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">When the filter element 46 is seated in housing 22, the bottom surface of the base ring 48 seats against the adjacent lip 41 of bottom cone 40. A compressor assembly is seated over the filter element top ring 51. The compressor assembly consists of a retainer ring 53 to which a number of upwardly extending legs 54 are attached, (one leg 54 shown). When lid 28 is closed, the inner surface of the lid bears against the adjacent ends of the legs 54. The lid 28 thus forces the legs 54 and, therefore, retainer ring 53, against filter element<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> top ring 51. The engagement of these components is what holds the filter element 46 in position in housing 22.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Filter element base ring 48 is formed with an outwardly beveled surface 55 around the outer perimeter of the bottom of the ring. Retainer ring 53 is formed with a similar beveled surface 56. First and second O-rings 57 seat in the spaces adjacent the beveled ring surfaces 55 and 56. Thus, one of the 0-rings 57 provides a liquid-tight seal between the filter element base ring 48 and the adjacent inner wall of the housing 22. The second O-ring 57 provides a liquid-tight seal between the retainer ring 53 and the housing 22 at the top of the filter element 46.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">An inlet fitting 58 is connected to housing 22 and opens into the housing above retainer ring 53. An outlet fitting 60 is connected to the housing 22 and extends from an opening located above where the filter element base ring 48 is located. When filter assembly 20 is in operation, the process stream is introduced into the housing 22 and the center of the filter element 46 through inlet fitting 58, as represented by arrow 59. The filtrate is trapped by the filter member 50. The filtered process stream exits the filter assembly 20 through the outlet fitting 60, as represented by arrow 61.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Internal to the filter element 46 is a cleaning head assembly 62 for removing trapped filtrate off the filter member 50. The cleaning head assembly 62 includes a generally disk shaped cleaning head 64 that moves up and down through the filter element 46. A number of cleaning blades 66 are attached to the cleaning head around the outer perimeter of the head. The cleaning<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> blades 66 abut the adjacent inner surface of the filter member 50 to scrape the trapped filtrate off the filter member. The cleaning head 64 is slidably mounted over an actuator tube 68 that extends longitudinally axially through the housing 22 and the filter element 46. A pneumatically actuated piston 70 is disposed inside the actuator tube 68. Cleaning head 64 is magnetically coupled to piston 70. Thus, the longitudinal displacement of the piston 70 in the actuator tube 68 results in the like longitudinal movement of the cleaning head 64 through the housing and against the filter member 50.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">With this basic understanding, the cleaning head assembly of this invention is now described by initial reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0004">4 and 5</figref>. Actuator tube 68 is formed of a metal that will not react with the contents of the process stream and that is non-magnetic, has a high magnetic permeability and low, preferably zero, magnetic susceptibility. One such material from which actuator tube 68 may be formed is 316 stainless steel.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The actuator tube 68 extends upwardly from a solid, generally cylindrical, bottom cap 71 that is fixedly secured to the bottom cone 40. Bottom cap 71, now described by reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">6</figref>, is formed of the same material from which the actuator tube 68 is formed. The bottom cap 71 is shaped to have a relatively narrow diameter stem section 72. A wide diameter head 74 extends coaxially with the stem section 72 and is a single piece with the stem section. Two bores 76 and 77 extend longitudinally through the bottom cap 71. A first bore, bore 76 in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref>, extends to an opening centered<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> around the longitudinal axis of the bottom cap 71 on the top of the head 74 (bore opening not identified). The second bore, bore 77 extends to an opening in the top of the head that is offset from the center axis (bore opening not identified).</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The bottom cap stem section 72 is welded or otherwise secured in a bore 75 formed in bottom cone boss 45. More particularly, the bottom cap 71 is fitted to the boss 45 so that the bottom cap and, therefore, the actuator tube 68, extend longitudinally axially through the bottom cone 40 and the housing 22.<br/>
An O-ring 79 seated in a groove 80 in the bottom cap stem section 72 provides a liquid-tight seal between the bottom cap and the adjacent inner wall of the boss 45. The end of bottom cap stem section 72 extends a short distance beyond the outer surface of the bottom cone 40.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045"><b>,</b> Actuator tube 68 is welded or otherwise secured to the bottom cap head 74. In order to facilitate the mating of the actuator tube 68 to the bottom cap, the bottom cap 71 is formed with a small, reduced diameter recess 86 around the outer perimeter of the head 74. The end of the actuator tube 68 seats in the recess 86.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Returning to <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref>, it can be seen that an air tube 90 extends longitudinally axially through actuator tube 68. One end of air tube 90 is mounted in the bottom cap head opening to which bore 76 extends. Air tube 90 is formed from the same material from which the actuator tube 68 is formed.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">An end cap 92 covers the open ends of the actuator tube 68 and air tube 90. End cap 92, which is generally frusto-conical in shape, is formed from the same material from which the actuator tube 68 is formed.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> The outer perimeter of the end cap 92 is formed with a recess (not identified) in which the adjacent end of the actuator tube 68 nests. The end cap 92 is also formed with a closed-end inlet bore 96 that extends upwardly from the base of the cap and that extends along the longitudinal axis of the cap. When the filter assembly 20 of this invention is assembled, air tube 90 opens into the end cap inlet bore 96.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">End cap 92 is further formed to have at least one outlet bore 98 (two shown) that extends from the base of the inlet bore 96. The outlet bore 98 extends diagonally away from the inlet bore 96. Outlet bore 98 thus opens into a portion of the base of the end cap 92 that subtends the annular space defined by the inner wall of actuator tube 68 and the outer wall of air tube 90. Thus, bores 96 and 98 provide a fluid flow path from the air tube 90 into the top of the actuator tube 68.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Piston 70, as seen in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">8</figref>, is formed to have two opposed cylindrically shaped end caps 102 made of plastic. One specific plastic from which end caps 102 can be manufactured is polythyleneterphtalate plastic with solid lubricant sold under the trademark ERTALYTE TX by Quadrant Engineering Plastic Products of Tielt, Belgium and Reading, Pennsylvania. Sandwiched between end caps 102 are four ring-shaped magnets 104 and five ring-shaped 106 spacers formed of a non-magnetic material such as a ceramic. More specifically, there is a spacer 106 located between each pair of magnets 104. There is also a spacer 106 located between each end cap 102 and the magnet 104 adjacent the end cap.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0050" num="0050">As seen in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 9</figref>, magnets 104 are arranged so that faces of adjacent magnets are of the same polarity.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">A tube-shaped tie rod 108 formed of brass holds the end caps 102, magnets 104 and spacers 106 together.

One end of the tie rod 108 engages threading formed in the bore that extends through one of the end caps 102. The second end of the tie rod 108 engages threading formed in the bore that extends through the second end cap 102. The interior diameter of the tie rod 108 is approximately 0.010 inches greater than that of the enclosed air tube 90.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The end caps 102 are dimensioned to closely fit in the annular space between the actuator tube 68 and air tube 90. The end caps 102 thus function as the bearing elements of the piston 70. Lip seals 110 are seated in grooves 112 formed along the outer perimeter of the end caps 102. One seal 110 is fitted to each end cap 102. The lip seals 110 thus function as the seal members between the piston 70 and the adjacent inner wall of the actuator tube 68. An O-ring 114 seats in a counterbore 116 around the open end of each bore that extends through each end cap 102. The O-rings 114 function as the seals between the piston 70 and the air tube 90.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Magnets 104 and spacers 106 are dimensioned to have diameters that are slightly less than the interior diameter of the surrounding actuator tube 68. In one version of the invention, these components are dimensioned so that the width of the annular gap between the actuator tube 68 and the magnets 104 and spacers 106<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> is approximately 0.015 inches. This separation prevents the magnets and spacers from galling the interior of the actuator tube 68.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">A generally sleeve-shaped carrier assembly 120, now described by reference to <figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 10</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0008">11</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">12</figref>, magnetically couples the cleaning head 64 to piston 70. The carrier assembly 120 is slidably disposed over the actuator tube 68 and has an elongated outer tube 122 formed from the same material from which actuator tube 68 is formed.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Disposed inside the opposed ends of the outer tube 122 are sleeve shaped bearings 124 formed of low friction plastic such as the Ertalyte TX plastic.

The inner end of each bearing 124 is formed to have a number of inwardly directed, arcuately spaced apart teeth 128 that are arranged in a circumferential pattern. The inner surfaces of teeth 128 are the surfaces of carrier assembly 120 that actually physically abut the outer surface of actuator tube 68.

Ring shaped carrier retainers 136 formed of Ertalyte TX plastic are seated in the annular space around the opposed outside ends of the inner tube 134. Each carrier retainer 136 extends from the outer surface<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> of the adjacent inner tube end to the inner surface of the surrounding outer tube 122. O-rings 138 and 139 are mounted in grooves formed, respectively, in the outer and inner surfaces of each carrier retainer 136. O-ring 138 forms a seal between the associated carrier retainer 136 and the adjacent outer surface of inner tube 134.<br/>

Magnets 104 and 132 are collectively arranged so that when the carrier assembly 120 is fitted over the actuator tube 68 and piston 70, the faces of each magnet 132 are of opposite polarity than the coplanar faces of the corresponding coplanar magnet 104.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The components of this filter assembly 20 of this invention are assembled so that inner tube 134 of carrier assembly 120 has a diameter that is approximately 0.125 inches greater than the diameter of the enclosed actuator tube 68. Thus, the only components of the carrier assembly 120 that abut the actuator tube 68 are the teeth 128 of the bearings 124. Thus, when the filter assembly 20 is in operation, the process stream is able to flow through the interstitial gaps between the bearing<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> teeth 128 at one end of the carrier assembly 120, through the annular gap between the actuator tube 68 and inner tube 134 and out through the interstitial gaps between the bearing teeth 128 at the opposed end of the carrier assembly 120. This arrangement prevents components of the process stream, such as solids that would otherwise be caught by filter member 50, from being trapped between the actuator tube 68 and the carrier assembly 120. If material was allowed to be trapped between the actuator tube 68 and the carrier assembly 120, one or both of the components could be damaged.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The cleaning head 64, as best seen in <figref idrefs="f0010">Figures 13, 14</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0011">15</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0012">16</figref>, is in the form of a flat disk. The cleaning head 64 is shaped to have an inner ring 142 and an outer ring 143. Four equangularly spaced apart webs 144 connect the inner and outer rings 142 and 143, respectively, together. The openings in the head 64 between rings 142 and 143 and webs 144 allow the process fluid to flow through the head.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">The cleaning head 64 is seated between a lip 146 and a set of equangularly spaced apart keys 148 that extend circumferentially around the carrier assembly outer tube 122, as seen best in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 10</figref>.

Collectively, cleaning head 64 and outer tube 122 are dimensioned so that the cleaning head tabs 154 can slide over the tube 122 in the spaces adjacent the tube keys 148. Tabs 154 are further dimensioned so as to have inner edges 156 that are dimensioned to facilitate the close slip fitting of the cleaning head 64 of the carrier assembly outer tube 122.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The cleaning head 64 is releasably mounted to the carrier assembly 120 by slip-fitting the head over outer tube 122. Movement of the cleaning head 64 is stopped by the abutment of tabs 154 against outer tube lip 146. The cleaning head 64 is then rotated so that tabs 154 seat in the annular gaps between the lip 146 and keys 148 of the outer tube 122. More particularly, the cleaning head is rotated until an opening 158 formed in the inner ring 142 goes into registration with the key and lip grooves 150 and 152, respectively, of the carrier assembly 120. A lock pin 160 is seated in opening 158. The lock pin 160 has a stem 162 that extends through opening 158 and seats in the key and lip grooves 150 and 152, respectively.

A small<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> wire cable (not illustrated) extends from one of the trunions 166 to the cleaning head 164 to hold the lock pin 160 to the cleaning head.

One suitable plastic is an acetyl resin plastic sold by du Pont under the trademark DELRIN. The cleaning blade 66 is formed to have an arcuately shaped base 172. Base 172 defines the curved outer face 174 of the blade 66 that is disposed against the filter member 50. The side of base 172 opposite that of outer face 174 is formed to have a groove 176 that extends the length of the base.

The edges defined by the interfaces of outer face 174 to the top face 178 and the bottom face 180 are the edge surfaces that scrape trapped filtrate off the filter member 50.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Cleaning blade base 172 is further formed to have opposed end faces 181 and 182.

The angles of faces 181 and 182 relative to the base edge surfaces are identical.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Each cleaning blade 66 is further formed to have two overlapping legs 183. The legs 183 extend inwardly from the inner face of the base 172, on opposed sides of groove 176 towards the center of the cleaning head 64. Each leg 183 generally has the profile of one of the head webs 144. When each cleaning blade 66 is mounted to the head, the opposed blade legs 183 extend over and under an associated one of the webs 144.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Pins 184, one seen best in <figref idrefs="f0012">Figure 16</figref>, that extend laterally through the opposed sides of each web 144, hold the cleaning blades 66 to the cleaning head 64. Each leg 183 is formed with an elongated slot 186. When a cleaning blade 66 is fitted to the head, the legs 183 are sufficiently flexible to outwardly bend as the legs move over the associated pin 184. When the pin 184 goes into registration with the associated leg slot 186, the legs 183 snap back down over the enclosed web 144 so as to result in the seating of the pin in the slot.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></p><p id="p0071" num="0071">A coil spring 190 outwardly biases each cleaning blade 66 relative to the cleaning head 64.

In order to facilitate the seating of the spring between the legs, the opposed inner faces of the legs 183 are formed with inwardly directed curved grooves 193. The outer end of each spring 190 abuts a spring pad 194 integral with the base 172 of the associated cleaning blade 66.

The tapers facilitate the snap-fitting of the legs over the associated cleaning head pin 184. The tapers 196 also define spaces between the cleaning head 64 and cleaning blade legs 183 in which the beveled and slotted head 164 of lock pin 160 can be wedged between the legs and the cleaning head. This allows lock pin 160 to be used as a tool for flexing the legs 183 to facilitate the removal of the cleaning blade 66 from the cleaning head 64.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">Returning to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, it is seen that two air lines 202 and 204 are connected to the exposed end of bottom cap 71. Air line 202 is connected to cap bore 76 through a counter bore 203. Air line 204 is connected to<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> cap bore 77 through a counter bore 205. The opposed ends of air lines 202 and 204 are connected to a common manifold 206. Also connected to the manifold 206 is a source of compressed air 208 and a vent to atmosphere 210. A manifold piston (not illustrated) establishes the connection between the air lines 202 and 204 and the air source 208 and vent 210. Specifically, when the manifold piston is in a first setting, air line 202 is connected to air source 208 and air line 204 is connected to the vent 210. When the manifold piston is in a second position, air line 202 is connected to the vent 210 and air line 204 is connected to the air source 208.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">The position of the manifold piston is controlled by a solenoid 212. The actuation of solenoid 212 is controlled by a filter controller 214.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">The filter assembly 20 of this invention is used to filter liquid state process streams. The process stream enters the filter assembly 20, and the center of the filter element 46, through inlet fitting 58. The process stream, it should be understood, flows through the openings formed in the cleaning head 64. Material in the process stream, larger in size than pores of the filter member 50, are trapped by the filter member. The filtered process stream is discharged from the filter assembly 20 through the outlet fitting 60.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Over time, a cake of filtered material accumulates on the inner surface of the filter member 50. Periodically, the cleaning head assembly 62 is actuated to scrap this material off the filter member 50. The cleaning head assembly 62 is actuated by energizing the solenoid 212 to change the position of the piston internal to manifold 206.<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --></p><p id="p0078" num="0078">For example, if the cleaning head 64 is located adjacent the bottom of the actuator tube 68, the manifold piston is set so that air line 202 is connected to the air source 208. Air line 204 and, by extension, bore 77, is vented to atmosphere. When the cleaning head 64 is in this state, the position of the manifold piston is reset to connect air line 202 and, by extension, bore 76, to the vent 210. The resetting of the manifold piston also connects air line 204, and therefore bore 77, to the air supply.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">The above-described resetting of the manifold piston thus results in pressurized air from the air supply 208 flowing through air line 204 and bore 77 into the bottom end of the actuator tube 68, below piston 70. At this time, the space above piston 70 in the actuator tube 68 is vented to atmosphere. Consequently, the force of the pressurized air urges the piston 70 upwardly through the actuator tube 68. In some versions of this invention, it is believed necessary to supply air at a pressure of 60 psi into the actuator tube 68 in order to cause the desired displacement of the piston 70. Since the carrier assembly 120 and, by extension, the cleaning head 64, are magnetically coupled to piston 70, these components engage in a like upward motion. The upward movement of the cleaning head 64 causes the cleaning blades 66 to scrape against the filter member 50 so as to remove the filtrate trapped on the member.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">The removed filtrate is periodically removed from the filter assembly 20 by directing a purge flow through the assembly. During the purge flow, the filtrate is flushed into the bottom cone 40 and out through the cone outlet fitting 39. The shape of the<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> bottom cone 40 ensures that the purging liquid flows throughout the whole of the interior space of the bottom cone. The flowing of the purge fluid in this pattern substantially eliminates the possibility that filtrate will become trapped and adhere to the interior surfaces of the bottom cone 40.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Once the piston 70, and therefore the cleaning head 64, reach the top of the actuator tube 68, the continued application of the compressed air to the space in the actuator tube 68 below the piston 70 holds the piston in position. The cleaning head 64 is lowered by reversing the position of the manifold piston. This action connects the space in the actuator tube 68 below piston 70 to atmosphere through cap bore 77, air line 204 and vent 210. Simultaneously, pressurized air is flowed from supply 208, air line 202, cap bore 76, air tube 90 and end cap bores 96 and 98 into the top of actuator tube 68 above piston 70. This pressurized air forces piston 70 and, therefore, the cleaning head 64 and cleaning blades 66, downwardly.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">The downward movement of the cleaning head 64 also causes the cleaning blades 66 to move against filter member 50 so as to scrape the trapped filtrate off the member.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">One of the primary actuated moving components of the filter assembly 20 of this invention, piston 70, is contained within the sealed actuator tube 68. The second actuated component, the cleaning head 64, is magnetically coupled to the piston 70. Therefore, the filter assembly of this invention does not require a seal between the cleaning head 64 and the components that actuate the cleaning head so as to prevent these latter<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> components from coming into contact with the process stream. Since the filter assembly does require this type of seal, the maintenance tasks associated with maintaining it are likewise eliminated.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">The cleaning blades 66 are constructed so that the blade end faces 181 and 182 are at obtuse, non-perpendicular, angles to the longitudinal axes of the blades.

Thus, as the blades 66 wear, there will still be a blade edge surface pressing against each circumferential section of the filter member 50 so as to scrape filtrate off the whole of the member.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">Spring 190 ensures that, as the base 172 of the cleaning blade 66 with which the spring is associated wears, the edge surfaces of the blade continue to press against the filter member 50.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">The spring pad 194 of a cleaning blade 66 performs two functions. The spring pad 194 serves as a surface against which the associated spring 190 bears. The spring pad 194 also serves as a pad that holds the portions of the base inward of the section that defines outer face 174 and the base of groove 176 together. This function is desirable because, over time, the pressing of the blade base 172 against the filter member 50 causes this outer perimeter section of the base to wear away. Eventually the material forming this section of the cleaning blade 66 can wear through to groove 176. When this occurs, spring pad 194 holds the remaining portions<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> of the base, the portions that define the inward sections of the base bottom and top edges 178 and 180, respectively, together. Thus, spring pad 194 prevents the portions of the cleaning blade from separating while in the filter assembly 20.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">It should be understood that the foregoing description is limited to one specific version of this invention.

These signals can be used to monitor whether or not the filter assembly of this invention is functioning properly. The signals generated by sensors 218 and 220 can also be applied to filter controller 214. Filter controller 214, based on<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> the cleaning head position information provided by the sensor signals, can then selectively control the energization of the solenoid 212 so as to regulate the setting of the manifold piston.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">It should further be recognized that alternative means may be used to drive the piston 70 up and down in the actuator tube 68. For example, it may be desirable to connect a set of electrically actuated valves to air lines 202 and 204. By selective setting of the valves, each air line can be connected to the source of compressed air, a vent to atmosphere or sealed closed. Thus, after the pressurized air is used to place the piston 70, and by extension, in an elevated position, air line 204 could be closed. This would leave a charge of pressurized air in air line 204, cap bore 77 and the actuator tube 68 that would hold the piston 70 in the elevated state. This would eliminate the need to continually supply pressurized air to perform this function.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">It is also further apparent that in not all versions of the invention that are fluid driven, is the flow tube to the top of the actuator tube located within the actuator tube. In some versions of this invention this tube, air tube 90 in the described version of the invention, may be located external to the actuator tube 68. This tube may not even be attached to the outside of the actuator tube 68; the tube could be a stand alone tube in the filter housing 22.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">Also, in not all versions is it necessary to use pneumatic fluid to drive piston 70. In some versions of the invention, hydraulic fluid may be employed to perform this function. It should further be<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> recognized that it may not be necessary in all versions to employ fluids to drive piston 70 up and down through the actuator tube 68. In alternative versions the piston, or at least magnets 104, may be driven up and down in the actuator tube 68 by a lead screw that, while static in position, rotates within the actuator tube 68. The mechanism used to drive this lead screw could be similar to that described in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US5198111A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,198,111</text></patcit>. In still other versions of the invention, the magnets 104 may be at the head of a piston rod that is disposed within the actuator tube 68. A head associated with the piston rod is contained in a piston cylinder external to housing 22 and is pneumatically or hydraulically driven. The particular hydraulic drive assembly could be similar to that described in <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US5527462A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,527,462</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">It should further be understood that the materials from which the described version are constructed are understood to be illustrative and not limiting.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">Still another feature is that, in some versions, multiple filter assembly housings 22 may be connected together by tabs 25. In these versions, the housings 22 support each other. Thus, an array of filter assemblies 20 can be assembled together without having to provide each assembly with its own support legs.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">It also should be recognized that the features may, when desirable, be practiced indpendently of each other. It is not necessary that all magnetically coupled cleaning head assemblies<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> employ the illustrated and described cleaning head and cleaning blade sub-assembly. Similarly, the described cleaning head and cleaning blade sub-assembly, can be employed with alternative actuators.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56978831" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Allgemein scheibenförmige Reinigungskopfanordnung (62) für eine Filteranordnung (20) zum Entfernen von Material aus einem Prozessstrom und umfassend:
