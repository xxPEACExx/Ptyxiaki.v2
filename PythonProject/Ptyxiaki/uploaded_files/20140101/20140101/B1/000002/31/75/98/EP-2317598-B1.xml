Description of the Related Art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Recently, compact and light portable electronic/electric apparatuses such as a cellular phone, a laptop computer, and a camcorder have been actively developed and produced. Battery packs are built in the portable electronic/electric apparatuses so that the portable electronic/electric apparatuses may operate in places where power sources are not provided. Battery packs using economical rechargeable secondary batteries such as a nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) battery, a nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) battery, and a lithium (Li) battery are commonly used.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A battery pack using the lithium secondary battery has an operating voltage three times higher than that of the battery pack using the Ni-Cd battery or the Ni-MH battery and has a high energy density per unit weight, so a battery pack using a lithium secondary battery is widely used in the portable electronic/electric apparatuses. A lithium secondary battery is typically a lithium ion battery that uses liquid electrolyte and a lithium-polymer battery that uses polymer electrolyte in accordance with the kind of electrolyte used. Lithium secondary batteries include cylindrical type batteries, prismatic type batteries, pouch type batteries in accordance with a manufactured shape.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Generally, a battery pack using a lithium secondary battery includes a bare cell, and a protective circuit board electrically connected to the bare cell to prevent overcharge and over-discharge of the bare cell. In order to fix the bare cell to the protective circuit board, in general, a molding process of filling a space between the bare cell and the protective circuit board with a molding material such as resin or hot melt is performed. The bare cell is formed by accommodating an electrode assembly<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> in a can having a top opening and by sealing the top opening of the can by a cap assembly. The electrode assembly includes a positive electrode plate and a negative electrode plate, each having an electrode tab connected to a collector coated with electrode active materials and a separator positioned between the positive electrode plate and the negative electrode plate.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The battery pack is charged with a preset capacity and shipped. When an end user uses the battery pack for the first time after a shipping period, the user may use the battery pack without charging the battery pack. The shipping period is defined by a time period from the time when the manufacturing of the battery pack is completed and shipped to the time when the end user mounts the battery pack in an apparatus. That is, the shipping period of the battery pack is from the time when the battery pack is shipped to the time when the end user purchases the battery pack in order to mount the same in the apparatus. However, the shipping periods of the battery packs may be variable. When the shipping period of the battery pack is extended, since the charged battery pack may be completely discharged due to internal current consumption of the battery pack, the end user must recharge the battery pack before the first use.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention relates to a battery pack configured to be shut down by a switch

The controller 147 receives information on the voltage, temperature, and current of the battery cells 110 sensed by the sensor 141 and stores the information on the received<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> voltage, temperature, and current in the memory 149. The controller 147 provides information on the remaining capacity of the battery cells 110, supplied from the remaining capacity estimator 142, to the LED driver 144 to display the remaining capacity of the battery cells 110 through the LED unit 130. When the switching sensor 143 senses that the mode switch 120 is turned on, the controller 147 drives the LED unit 130 through the LED driver 144 to emit light. The controller 147 converts the ON and OFF signals of the mode switch 120 sensed by the switching sensor 143 into signals in accordance with the timing of the ON and OFF signals and applies the converted signals to the code analyzer 145. The code analyzer 145 codes and analyzes the converted signals supplied from the controller 147 to generate ON and OFF codes of the mode switch 120, and the controller 147 receives the ON and OFF codes of the mode switch 120 from the code analyzer 145.

The controller 147 applies a mode setting signal to the mode setting unit 146 to set a mode in accordance with the codes. The controller 147 turns on or off the charge and discharge switches 150 through the switch driver 148 so that the battery pack 100 operates in the mode set by the mode setting unit 146. That is, the controller 147 controls the LED driver 144, the code analyzer 145, the mode setting unit 146, and the switch driver 148 in accordance with the signals supplied by the sensor 141, the remaining capacity estimator 142, the switching sensor 143, the code analyzer 145, and the mode setting unit 146.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The switch driver 148 is electrically connected to the controller 147 and the charge and discharge switches 150. The switch driver 148 receives the signal in accordance with the mode set by the mode setting unit 146 through the controller 147 to drive the charge and discharge switches 150. When the mode set by the mode setting unit 146 is the normal mode or the sleep mode, the switch driver 148 turns on the charge switch CFET and the discharge switch DFET. When the charge switch<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> CFET and the discharge switch DFET are turned on, the battery pack 100 is in the sleep mode. In the sleep mode, an electric power may be supplied to the microcomputer 140 from the battery cells 110 via the discharge switch DFET and the charge switch CFET. The modes of the battery pack 100 change from the sleep mode to the normal mode at preset time intervals. That is, the mode of the battery pack 100 changes from the sleep mode, which is the standby state, to the normal mode where the microcomputer 140 operates in a preset time period. Therefore, the current consumption of the battery pack 100 in the normal mode may be equal to or larger than the current consumption of the battery pack 100 in the sleep mode. When the mode set by the mode setting unit 146 is the shipping mode, the switch driver 148 turns off the charge switch CFET and the discharge switch DFET.

The memory 149 may store information on the remaining capacity of the battery cells 110 in accordance with the voltage, current, and temperature of the battery cells 110. The memory 149 store a suitable code for setting the mode of the battery pack 100. When the battery pack 100 is mounted (or installed) in an apparatus, the memory 149 transmits the information on the stored remaining capacity of the battery cells 110 to the apparatus so that the remaining capacity of the battery cells 110 may be displayed by the apparatus.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The respective control electrodes of the charge and discharge switches 150 are electrically connected to the switch driver 148.

The charge switch CFET has a first electrode (e.g., source) electrically connected to<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> charge and discharge terminals and a second electrode (e.g., drain) electrically connected to the discharge switch DFET. The discharge switch DFET has a first electrode electrically connected to the battery cells 110 and a second electrode electrically connected to the second electrode of the charge switch CFET. In one embodiment, the charge switch CFET and the discharge switch DFET are field effect transistors, and internal parasitic diodes may be formed from the second electrodes to the first electrodes of the switches CFET and DFET. The charge switch CFET and the discharge switch DFET may be turned on or off to prevent overcharge and over discharge. The charge switch CFET and the discharge switch DFET set the mode of the battery pack 100 in accordance with the code analyzed through the operation of the mode switch 120 mounted on the outside of the battery pack 100.

However, in the shipping mode, the charge switch CFET and the discharge switch DFET are turned off, and only self-discharge current may flow between the microcomputer 140 and the battery cells 110.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Therefore, the battery pack 100 is kept from being discharged while the microcomputer 140 is turned off so that malfunctions of the battery pack 100 are prevented during the shipping period and stability of the battery pack 100 may be improved. In general, the current consumption of the battery pack 100 is 200 to 300 uA/hr in the normal mode or in the sleep mode and is 2 to 3 uA/hr in the shipping mode, which is the shut-down state. That is, the current consumption of the battery pack 100 in the shipping mode is smaller than that of the current consumption of the battery pack 100 in the normal mode or in the sleep mode.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The operating mode of the battery pack 100 may be changed to the shipping mode through the mode switch 120 mounted on the outside of the battery pack 100 when the battery pack 100 is shipped. Therefore, undesired current consumption may be prevented when the battery pack 100 is in the normal mode or in the sleep mode so that the charge keeping time of the battery pack 100 may be extended during the shipping period. The shipping period is from the point of time when the manufacturing of the battery pack 100 is completed to the point of time when an end user mounts the battery pack 100 in an apparatus. When the battery pack 100 is mounted in the apparatus, the charge switch CFET and the discharge switch DFET are turned on so that the operating mode may change. For example, when the battery pack 100 is coupled to a charger, the microcomputer 140 built in the battery pack 100 receives an electric power from the charger to operate and the microcomputer 140 turns on the charge switch CFET and the discharge switch DFET so that the battery pack 100 is in the normal mode.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, an example of an operation timing diagram of the mode switch of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrated.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the operation timing diagram of the mode switch 120 includes a first period T1, a second period T2, a third period T3, and a fourth period T4.
