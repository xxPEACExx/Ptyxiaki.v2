mxw-id="PDES63957679" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><u>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to pneumatic nailers, and more particularly to an actuator housing having a releasable actuator cartridge for use on a pneumatic nailer.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Hardwood flooring generally consists of a number of juxtaposed elongated tongue-and-groove planks interlocked with each other, and then fastened in position to a subjacent subfloor. To fasten these hardwood planks to the subfloor of a room (composed for example of plywood plates and/or floor joists), it is known to use a dedicated pneumatic nailer. A pneumatic nailer for hardwood flooring generally comprises a main body carrying a floor-engageable shoe mounted to its bottom surface, upon which the nailer rests against a hardwood plank prior to discharging a fastener in the latter.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The pneumatic nailer also comprises an actuator housing on the nailer's main body and connected to a pressurized air source (e.g. an air compressor). The actuator housing has a casing defining a pressurized air chamber therein, the casing carrying a fastener discharge mechanism comprising an actuator head and a piston assembly. The piston assembly comprises a cylinder defining a cylinder chamber, and a plunger mounted inside the cylinder chamber and movable therein between upper and lower limit positions. The plunger in turn comprises a head portion engaging the inner peripheral wall of the cylinder in airtight fashion, and a striking rod carried by the plunger head.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Moreover, a magazine is mounted to the nailer and serially feeds fasteners, in the form of metallic L- or T-shaped barbed cleats or staples, into a fastener ejection channel defined by the actuator housing.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">At rest, a valve of the actuator head is positioned in a closed position, in which it cuts off fluid communication between the upper portion of the piston's cylinder chamber (the portion located above the plunger head) and the pressurized air chamber. To set off a fastener discharge cycle of the nailer, a workman activates a trigger thereof, which causes the valve to shift to its open position and to enable air to be admitted in the piston's cylinder above of the plunger head, which causes the plunger to move with great force and celerity from its upper limit<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> position to its bottom limit position. As the plunger travels from its upper to its bottom limit position, the striking rod thereof sweeps the fastener ejection channel containing a fastener. The fastener is consequently forced out of the nailer and driven into the subjacent workpiece.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">On certain nailers, the fastener discharge cycle is set off by striking an impact-receiving actuator head with a mallet; on other types of nailers, the fastener discharge cycle is set off when the user pushes a switch on the pneumatic nailer.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Such nailers are designed to have an extended longevity, and the internal components of the actuator housing of such nailers need to be maintained at regular intervals during their extended lifetime in order to remain in functioning condition. More particularly, the fastener discharge mechanism - composed of an intricate arrangement of movable parts - needs to be regularly accessed in order to be cleaned, lubricated, repaired or generally maintained.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In prior art devices, performing maintenance tasks on the fastener discharge mechanism can be tedious, and even problematic if the appropriate tools are not handy, as some of the parts of the fastener discharge mechanism cannot be accessed without disassembling and opening up the casing.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6061901A"><text>U.S. patent No. 6,061,901</text></patcit> in the name of Hiroshi TANAKA discloses a pneumatic screw punching machine including a poppet portion at the top of a piston of an air cylinder and a piston catch disposed inside a head cap.

The illustrated nailer 10 is of the type used to secure hardwood flooring planks to a subfloor. It is however understood that the present invention could extend to any kind of pneumatic fastener driving tool.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Nailer 10 comprises a C-shaped frame 12, made of moulded metal for example, carrying a shoe 14 at its bottom end portion. Shoe 14 will rest on a subjacent workpiece, such as a tongue-and-groove hardwood plank P, prior to driving a fastener therein.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">C-shaped frame 12 defines a handle portion 16 integrally carried at one end of an arm portion 18 and extending transversally relative thereto. Arm portion 18 also integrally carries an actuator housing 20 according to the present invention, at its end opposite handle portion 16.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Actuator housing 20 is best shown in <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007 f0008 f0009">figures 2-9</figref>, although its internal components are only thoroughly numbered in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>. Actuator housing 20 comprises a hollow casing 22, in turn defining a main chamber 23 therein. Main chamber 23, even though it is shown confined within casing 22, could further extend into other portions of frame 12 (arm portion 18 and handle portion 16).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the illustrated embodiment, casing 22 is a moulded section of frame 12. In another embodiment, casing 22 could be distinct from frame 12 and bolted thereto instead of being a moulded section thereof, as shown for example in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6834789B"><text>US Patent No. 6,834,789 (from inventors Dion et al.</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A compressed air source (not shown) feeds compressed air into main chamber 23 through the instrumentality of a hose (not shown) connected to a conventional compressed air inlet (not shown) made through casing 22 and opening into main chamber 23. Casing 22 further comprises a cartridge insertion opening 24 made in the casing's upper wall. As best seen in <figref idrefs="f0009">figure 9</figref>, opening 24 can be decomposed in three tiers: (1) an outermost annular depression 26 recessed in the outer surface of casing 22; (2) a cylindrical intermediate portion 28 juxtaposed to and diametrically smaller than annular depression 26; and (3) a cylindrical innermost threaded portion 30, opening into the hollow of casing 22.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Main chamber 23 within casing 22 is separated from an auxiliary chamber 32 by a moulded partition 34. Partition 34 defines an upright wall 34a extending upwardly from the internal bottom wall of casing 22, and a top wall 34b transversal to upright wall 34a and having a circular cylinder insertion opening 36 made therethrough, coaxial to the circular cartridge insertion opening 24.

A barrel member 74 is slidably received in head chamber 64. Barrel member 74 comprises an upper stub portion 76 extending and projecting outwardly of top opening 61 made in shell 60. Upper stub portion 76 carries a discoid impact plate 75 at its outer free end, which in turn abuts on the inner surface of protective plastic cap 55. At its end opposite impact plate 75, stub portion 76 merges with a cylindrical and tubular elongated sliding portion 78. Sliding portion 78 is sized to freely and slidably engage the upper, correspondingly cylindrical portion of head chamber 64. An annular depression 79 is made peripherally on the outer peripheral wall of sliding portion 78. Beneath this depression, sliding portion 78 carries annular sealing means in the form of a rubber U-cup 80. Furthermore, opposite stub portion 76, sliding portion 78 carries a widened, discoid head portion 82. In one embodiment, head portion 82 is releasable from sliding portion 74.

Compressed air is thus never allowed to flow from main chamber 23 into head chamber 64 by seeping through the interstice formed between the outer wall of valve 88 and the peripheral wall of head chamber 64.

The downward motion of barrel member 74 also causes head portion 82 to move within valve inner chamber 90, and U-cup 83 to come in sealing engagement against the peripheral wall of valve chamber lower portion 90b. This interrupts fluid communication between the atmosphere and the volume of valve chamber 90 beneath barrel member head portion 82 and above plunger head 122.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The pressure within head chamber 64 having dropped to atmospheric pressure, the relatively high pressure in main chamber acting upwardly on the horizontal surfaces of valve 88, as suggested by arrows B on <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 4</figref>, slidably urge valve 88 upwardly. This upward movement of valve 88 causes air channels 89 be become almost completely sealed by the inner peripheral wall of shell skirt 70.

Pressurized air therefore applies a very important downward pressure on the upper surface of plunger head 122 as suggested by arrows C' in <figref idrefs="f0005">figure 5</figref>, which causes plunger 120 to be urged downwardly.

Therefore, air flows from pressurized cylinder chamber 101 radially outwardly into the relatively low pressure auxiliary chamber 32 through exhaust holes 108 as suggested by arrows F in <figref idrefs="f0006">figure 6</figref>, and auxiliary chamber 32 becomes substantially pressurized.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Concomitantly, pressurized air seeps gradually back from main chamber 23 into the sealed head chamber 64 through the not-entirely sealed air channels 89 on valve 88. Indeed, although the end of air channels 89 is almost entirely obstructed and sealed by the inner peripheral wall of shell skirt 70, a very narrow clearance remains therebetween allowing compressed air to flow at a very low rate from main chamber 23 through air channels 89 and into head chamber 64, as suggested by arrows G in <figref idrefs="f0006">figure 6</figref>. As head chamber 64 slowly but surely pressurizes, valve 88 moves gradually downwardly until air channels 89 are again completely unobstructed by the inner peripheral wall of skirt 71. Once valve 88 has moved sufficiently downwardly so that air channels 89 are cleared by the inner peripheral wall of shell skirt 70, the air flow from main chamber 23 into head chamber 64 is greatly accelerated, head chamber 64 becomes instantly pressurized, and valve 88 is briskly urged downwardly so as to come in pressing and sealing engagement against the upper free edge of piston cylinder 100, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">figure 7</figref>. At this point, fluid communication between cylinder chamber 101 and main chamber 23 is interrupted. Also, in this position of valve 88, the U-cup 83 around barrel member head portion 82 clears the peripheral wall of valve inner chamber 90, and fluid communication between valve chamber 90 and the atmosphere is re-established through exhaust channel 84. Therefore, the pressurized air that remains in cylinder chamber 101 above plunger head 122 thus escapes through the exhaust channel 84 into the atmosphere, as indicated by arrows H in <figref idrefs="f0007">figure 7</figref>.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">At this point, since atmospheric pressure is now applied on the upper surface of plunger head 122, the pressurized air into auxiliary chamber can decompress by flowing back into cylinder chamber 101 beneath plunger head 122 through transfer holes 112 as indicated by arrows I in <figref idrefs="f0007">figure 7</figref>, thereby urging plunger 120 back towards its upper limit position.

This is greatly facilitated with the present invention. Indeed, an important advantage of the present invention is that the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> actuator cartridge 50 can be very easily extracted from casing 22, as suggested in <figref idrefs="f0008 f0009">figure 8-9</figref>. Indeed, to perform maintenance tasks on the actuator mechanism, the user can simply grasp actuator head 54 and twist it in the "unscrewing" direction. This causes threads 69 of intermediate portion 68 of actuator head shell 60 to slide against the threads of threaded section 30 of cartridge insertion opening 24, and the connection between actuator head 54 and casing 22 to loosen.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">To prevent disconnection of actuator head 54 from piston assembly 58 when the actuator head 54 is unscrewed from casing opening 24, the thread pitch of both threaded interconnections is different. More particularly, the thread pitch of the cooperating threaded sections 69, 30 of actuator head 54 and casing opening 24 respectively, is greater than the thread pitch of the cooperating threaded sections 71, 104 of actuator head 54 and cylinder 100. In practise, this translates in a different number of turns needed for undoing the two threaded interconnections: for example, unscrewing of actuator head 54 from casing opening 24 may necessitate 5 turns, and unscrewing of actuator head 54 from piston assembly 58 may necessitate 10 turns. By providing different thread pitches, actuator head 54 hence cannot be entirely disconnected from piston assembly 58 as actuator head 54 is rotated and unscrewed from casing opening 24.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">It is understood that any other suitable technique could be used to prevent disconnection of actuator head 54 from cylinder 100 as actuator head 54 is disconnected from casing 22. For example, a small compressible plastic fitting could be received in a corresponding cavity made in either one of the cooperating threaded sections 104, 71 of cylinder 100 or actuator head 54 respectively. Such a plastic fitting would oppose a certain resistance to the sliding of the threads of actuator head threaded section 71 about those of cylinder threaded section 104, and thus prevent disconnection of cylinder 100 from actuator head 54 as actuator head 54 is unscrewed from casing opening 24.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">The threading interconnection of actuator head 54 with casing opening 24 is the only connection fastening actuator cartridge 50 to casing 22. Thus, when actuator head 54 is completely unscrewed and thus disconnected from casing opening 24, the only connection of actuator cartridge 50 to casing 22 is undone, and actuator cartridge 50 can be entirely extracted from casing 22, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">figure 8</figref>. Thus, actuator head 54, piston assembly 58, and their respective constituents can be extracted from casing 22, simply by disconnecting actuator head 54 from casing 22. As actuator cartridge 50 is extracted out of casing 22, plunger 120 clings to the inner peripheral wall of cylinder 100 due to the friction at the contact between sealing band<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> 123 around plunger head 122 and cylinder 100. If ever plunger 120 were to accidentally slide out of cylinder 100 and remain in casing 22 as actuator cartridge 50 is extracted therefrom, the workman could simply insert his hand in the casing or flip the nailer upside down in order to separately extract the plunger from the casing.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Once actuator cartridge has been extracted out of casing 22, the workman can disconnect actuator head 54 from piston assembly 58, by grasping actuator head 54 in one hand, and piston assembly 58 in the other hand and twisting in the "unscrewing" direction. This causes the threads on the inner wall of skirt rim 71 of actuator head 54 to slide against the threads of cylinder annular portion 104 until actuator head 54 and piston assembly 58 detach from each other. Thereafter, actuator head 54 can be further disassembled by sequentially removing its internal constituents (valve, barrel member, etc.), and plunger 120 can be slid out of cylinder 100.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">By providing an assembled actuator cartridge 50 which can be connected and disconnected "as one" from casing 22, it becomes significantly easier to clean, repair, lubricate, or generally maintain each individual component of the actuator mechanism.

The workman then takes note of the orientation of cross-sectionally rectangular guiding piece slit 43, and inserts the actuator cartridge 50 in casing 22 through cartridge insertion opening 24 such that the cross-sectionally rectangular striking rod 124 be properly angularly lined up with guiding piece slit 43. As cartridge 50 is progressively inserted in cartridge insertion opening 24, the lower portion of cylinder 100 enters auxiliary chamber 32 through circular opening 36 made in partition top wall 34b, and the striking rod 124 becomes engaged in guiding piece slit 43. The workman then starts to screw actuator head 54 in cartridge insertion opening 24. As actuator head 54 is rotated, all components of the cartridge are rotated therealong with the exception of plunger 120, since its cross-sectionally rectangular striking rod 124 is non-rotatably engaged in guiding piece slit 43.

Switch lever 3200 acts upon a selector valve 3202 which controls inlet of pressurized air inside head chamber 364, above valve 388, via an elongated air channel 3206 made in the thickness of the top wall of casing 322. When switch lever 3200 is not pressed, selector valve 3202 is set to route compressed air from pressurized main chamber 323 into head chamber 364, therefore urging valve 388 towards its closed position. To trigger a discharge cycle of the nailer, the workman applies pressure on the switch lever 3200, which shifts the selector valve 3202 and sets it to cut off communication between head chamber 364 and pressurized main chamber 323, and to establish fluid communication between the atmosphere and head chamber 364. Thus, when a workman depresses the switch lever 3200, head chamber 364 is depressurized as compressed air is exhausted through channel 3206, valve 388 is urged to its open position, and compressed air is thus admitted into cylinder chamber 3101 to urge plunger 3120 towards its bottom limit position. When the workman releases switch lever 3200, head chamber 364 is re-pressurized, valve 388 is urged towards its closed position, and the pressurized air above the plunger head is exhausted through exhaust channel 384 made across barrel member 374 and out into the atmosphere through exhaust holes 363 made across shell 360.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">Similarly to actuator cartridge 50 in nailer 10, actuator cartridge 350 in nailer 300 is a unitary structure which can be connected and disconnected as one from casing 322, in order to easily carry out maintenance thereof.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">It is understood that the above-described nailer embodiments are exemplary, and various modifications could be made thereto without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">For example, the fastening means allowing the releasable connection of the actuator head to the piston assembly is formed of matching threaded sections on both the actuator head and the piston assembly.

The cylinder could for example comprise, on its outer wall, an annular threaded radial projection threadingly engaging mating threads made in the circular opening on the top wall of the partition separating the main chamber from the auxiliary chamber.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Furthermore, in both illustrated embodiments, the shock absorber (no. 44 in the first embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>), is snugly friction-fitted in the annular shoulder 40 made on the bottom wall 33 of the auxiliary chamber 32. In alternate embodiments, the shock absorber could instead be friction-fitted within the lower rim of the piston assembly cylinder and could freely rest against the auxiliary chamber shoulder. In such an embodiment, the shock absorber would cling to the inner surface of the cylinder chamber as the piston assembly is extracted out of the casing, and would consequently be extracted out of the casing along with the actuator cartridge.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Also, the plunger should not be limited to carrying a striking rod for directly striking and ejecting fasteners. For example, instead of carrying a striking member for directly striking a fastener, the plunger could carry connecting aims transmitting the axial movement of the plunger head to pivotable arms situated outwardly of said casing, as for example disclosed in co-pending international application No. <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="CA2005000804W"><text>PCT/CA2005/000804 (inventors Dion et al</text></patcit>.). These pivotable arms are in turn operatively connected to an arcuate striking member situated outboard of the casing for striking arcuate fasteners. However, in such an embodiment, the plunger would likely not be extracted along with the cylinder as the actuator cartridge is extracted from the nailer's casing.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">The "backstroke" of the plunger, i.e. its return to its upper limit position, was accomplished in the above-described embodiments by providing an auxiliary chamber (chamber 32) separated from main chamber 23, and communicating with cylinder chamber 101 through unidirectional air exhaust holes 108 and through transfer holes 112. When the plunger reaches its lower limit position, the auxiliary chamber becomes pressurized as compressed air flows from the main chamber into the cylinder chamber, and in turn from the cylinder chamber into the auxiliary chamber through unidirectional air exhaust holes 108. When the pressure above the plunger drops to atmospheric pressure, the compressed air in auxiliary chamber 32 flows back into cylinder chamber 101 beneath plunger head 122 through transfer holes 112 and urges the plunger back to its upper limit position.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></p><p id="p0079" num="0079">The nailer casing and the actuator cartridge could be configured differently, such that the "backstroke" of the piston be accomplished as described in the above-mentioned international application No. <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="CA2005000804W"><text>PCT/CA2005/000804</text></patcit>. In this international application, the auxiliary chamber communicates permanently with the main chamber, and the inner chamber of the cylinder has a variable diameter. More particularly, the cylinder chamber comprises a lower tier having a smaller inner diameter than an upper tier of the cylinder. The plunger head, on the other hand, is I-shaped, and an annular chamber is formed between the variable-diameter cylinder inner peripheral wall and the plunger head's outer peripheral wall; this annular chamber communicates permanently with the auxiliary chamber via holes made through the cylinder. Due to the shape of the plunger head and of the variable-diameter cylinder inner chamber, the piston is constantly biased upwardly towards its upper limit position when the main chamber is pressurized. When compressed air is admitted in the cylinder above the plunger head as the valve opens (at the beginning of a nail discharge cycle), this compressed air acts on the wide upper surface of the plunger head and overwhelms the bias exerted on the plunger by the compressed air from within the annular chamber formed between the plunger head and the cylinder, and urges the plunger towards its lower limit position. However, when the valve closes (towards the end of the nail discharge cycle) and the pressure above the plunger head drops back to atmospheric pressure, the plunger can be urged back automatically to its upper limit position under the action of this upward "backstroke" bias. It is generally understood that the scope of the present invention could extend to any actuator composition and configuration coming within the scope of the appended claims, and should not be limited to the specific actuator configurations described above. For example, the actuator cartridge could comprise an actuator head and a cylinder fastened thereto, and could further comprise a concentric double-piston configuration as shown in <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US3542273A"><text>US patent No. 3,542,273 (inventor G.R. Hedrick</text></patcit>). In this embodiment, the plunger is composed of a striking rod mounted to a plunger head, the plunger head comprising in turn a discoid member defining a toroidal groove on its upper surface, and a hollow mounting rod mounted to the discoid member and further concentrically and telescopically mounted within a tubular member affixed and depending downwardly from the actuator head.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980526" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Ein Betätigungsgehäuse (20) für den Einsatz auf einem pneumatischen Nagler (10), wobei das genannte Betätigungsgehäuse (20) umfasst:
