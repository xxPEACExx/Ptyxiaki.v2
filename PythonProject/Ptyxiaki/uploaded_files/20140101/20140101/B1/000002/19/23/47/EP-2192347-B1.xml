load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><u>Field of the invention</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a swirler arrangement for injecting a fluid into a tubular swirling chamber. Moreover, the present invention relates to a method of injecting a fluid into a tubular swirling chamber.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Art background</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In order to provide a homogeneous air/fuel mixture for a combustion chamber of gas turbines, an air/fuel mixture may be injected into a tubular swirling chamber of the turbine. When injecting a fluid, such as air, fuel or an air/fuel mixture, radially, a defined swirling of the air/fuel mixture in the tubular swirling chamber is generated. By such a defined swirling of the fluid, a proper mixing ratio of the air/fuel mixture and a stable flame on a pilot body surface in the tubular swirling chamber may be provided.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For injecting fluid radially, radial swirlers are attached to a pre-chamber of the tubular swirling chamber in order to generate a strong turbulence flow of the fluid in the pre-chamber. In conventional radial swirlers, the fluid is in general injected tangentially to an inner surface of the pre-chamber, so that a high tangential moment inside the pre-chamber and a vortex of the fluid inside the pre-chamber and a combustion chamber of the tubular swirling chamber may be generated. The vortex provides a turbulent swirling region in the vicinity of the inner lateral area and a slow, inturbulent flow in the core of the vortex.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The fluid flow inside the pre-chamber and the combustion chamber will be described in the following in more detail.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Usually, the pre-chamber and the combustion chamber are formed tubular, wherein the diameter of the pre-chamber is smaller than the diameter of the combustion chamber. When the injected fluid flows from the pre-chamber to the combustion chamber of the tubular swirling chamber, the diameter and thus the available volume increases abruptly. Thus, an axial pressure drop occurs. Under the influence of the axial pressure drop, that is generated by the change in a diameter difference of the pre-chamber and the combustion chamber, the fluid flows in a longitudinal direction from the pre-chamber to the combustion chamber. In the region where the axial pressure drop occurs, the fluid expands abruptly which causes the fluid to turn from the lateral area inwards towards the centre axis of the pre-chamber and/or the combustion chamber. Then, the fluid flows in the vicinity of the centre axis in an axial counter-direction towards the swirler and towards a base area (pilot body surface) of the pre-chamber again. The region of the counter-direction flow may be called internal re-circulation zone. The internal re-circulation zone is located along the centre axis of the combustion chamber inside of the vortex. At the base area (pilot body surface) the air/fuel mixture may be ignited and forms a flame. Next, the ignited air/fuel mixture turns outwards in the direction to the lateral surface of the pre-chamber and meets the incoming fluid injected by the swirler. At the location, where the internal re-circulating flow meets the incoming flow from the swirler passages, a region of turbulence is generated. Between this region and the centre region a shear layer is formed, wherein an ignited air/fuel mixture on the one side of the shear layer and the injected fluid from the swirler on the other side of the shear layer flows again in the axial direction of the pre-chamber and the main chamber. In this manner a so-called "internal recirculation vortex core flow" inside the pre-chamber and the combustion chamber is generated. Hence, the benefit may be that in the vicinity of the pilot body surface (ignition area of the air/fuel mixture) a proper mixing ration of the air/fuel mixture, a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> slower velocity of the air/fuel mixture and thus a larger exposure time in the area of ignition may be provided, so that a more effective combustion may be achieved.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP0957311A2"><text>EP 0 957 311 A2</text></patcit> discloses a gas-turbine engine combustion.

The pre-chamber and the combustion chamber may be formed tubular, wherein the pre-chamber and the combustion chamber may provide a common centre axis. The combustion chamber may provide a larger diameter than the pre-chamber. In the tubular swirling chamber, the internal circulation zone of the fluid may be provided, i.e. inside of the tubular swirling chamber, a predetermined circulation of the fluid may be provided wherein the fluid moves downstream in the tubular swirling chamber. The pre-chamber may comprise a closed end wherein at the closed end a pilot body surface is provided. At the pilot body surface the fluid may be ignited, so that a flame that burns in the tubular swirling chamber may be anchored to the pilot body surface. The region of the pilot body surface to which the flame is anchored may be called flame anchor surface. At the opposite open end of the pre-chamber, the combustion chamber is attached that may comprise a larger diameter than the pre-chamber. By the change of the diameter the above described pressure drop may be provided for generating the axial movement of the injected fluid.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The swirler arrangement may be attached to the tubular swirling chamber for injecting radially the fluid. In particular, the swirler arrangement may be attached to the pre-chamber for injecting the fluid radially, so that a vortex around the centre axis of the swirling chamber may be generated. This vortex around the centre axis may move downstream in the direction to the open end of the pre-chamber due to the pressure drop caused by the change in diameter.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The first radial swirler devices and the second radial swirler devices may comprise first vanes and second vanes, wherein the first vanes and second vanes are circumferentially attached to the first radial swirler device and the second radial swirler device. Between each of the first vanes first ducts may be provided. Between each of the second vanes second ducts may be provided. The first ducts and second ducts guide the fluid from the outside of the tubular swirling chamber to the inside of the tubular swirling chamber. The first ducts are adapted for defining a first injection direction of the fluid into the tubular swirling chamber. The second ducts are adapted for defining a second injection direction of the fluid into the tubular swirling chamber. The first radial swirler device and the second radial swirler device are designed for injecting the fluid in such a way, that a vortex of the fluid when injecting into the tubular swirling chamber may be generated. The first radial swirler device and the second radial swirler device respectively the first vanes and the second vanes may be attached to a circular plate with an inner through-hole by which the plate may be attached to the tubular swirling chamber, i.e. the through-hole may comprise the diameter of the tubular swirling chamber.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The direction of the injection of the fluid when entering the tubular swirling chamber is defined by the first injection angle and the second injection angle. The first injection angle and the second injection angle are defined by an angle between the direction of the fluid at the location when entering the inside of the tubular swirling chamber and the tangential direction of the inner surface of the tubular swirling chamber at the location where the fluid exits the radial swirler arrangement inside of the tubular swirling chamber. With other words, if the fluid exits the ducts formed by the vanes into the inside of the tubular swirling chamber, the injection angle may define the angle between the exhaust direction of the fluid and the tangential direction<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> along the inner surface. I.e. if the fluid would be injected in a tangential direction by the first radial swirler device, the first injecting angle between the flow direction of the fluid and the inner surface of the tubular swirling chamber would be 0° (degree) and if the fluid would be injected radially, so that the fluid flow direction would point to the centre axis of the tubular swirling chamber, the first injecting angle would provide a first injection angle of 90° (degree). The same definition is valid for the second radial swirler device and the second injection angle.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The term "fluid" may describe air, fuel or an air/fuel mixture of both. The fuel may be in a gaseous state or in a liquid state. The fuel may comprise kerosene or other combustible hydrocarbon materials in a liquid or gaseous state.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In conventional combustion chambers swirler devices are used for generating a strong turbulent flow, such as a vortex, of the injected fluid in order to improve the mixing ratio of the air/fluid mixture and to improve the flame stability in the tubular swirling chamber. In conventional radial swirlers the fluid is injected tangentially with respect to the inner surface of the tubular swirling chamber in order to generate a very high tangential moment inside of the combustion chamber in order to generate a vortex inside the combustion chamber. The tangential flow of the injected fluid generates a vortex with a large inner diameter, because due to the high tangential moment the fluid is flowing in the area of the inner surface of the tubular swirling chamber. In the centre area of the vortex of the fluid a flame anchor surface on the pilot body surface may be generated. Due to the high tangential moment generated by the tangential inflow of the fluid the flame anchor surface is very large. If the fluid would be injected by one swirling device more in the direction to the centre axis of the tubular swirling chamber, the vortex would provide a smaller diameter and thus a smaller flame anchor surface, but the flame would be instable.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">By generating a vortex of the fluid inside the combustion chamber, the fluid vortex extends first of all along an axial direction away from the pilot body surface. By increasing the diameter of the combustion chamber, an axial pressure drop may be provided, so that a recirculation zone of the fluid may be generated. The internal recirculation zone is located along the centre axis of the combustion chamber, so that along the centre axis the fluid flows back to the direction of the pilot body surface. Thus, when the re-circulating fluid flows back in the vicinity of the pilot body surface, the ignition of the fluid occurs. I.e., by changing the injecting angle with one swirler device either the flame anchor surface may be reduced or the flame stability may be improved. A change of the injecting angel may cause other negative effects such as lower swirl numbers, poor air/fuel mixing relations, negative fluid dynamics, high emissions etc.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">By using the swirling arrangement, i.e. a first radial swirler device and a second radial swirler device according to the claimed solution of the present invention, the fluid may be injected by a first radial swirler device and a second radial swirler device, each providing a different injecting angle, namely the first injecting angle and the second injecting angle. Thus, by providing different first injecting angles and second injecting angles of the fluid, the inflow of the fluid may be controlled in such a way, that the positive effects of a more tangential inflow (e.g. good vortex characteristics, improved flame stability, improved air/fuel mixing ratio) and similarly the positive effects of a more radial inflow (reduced flame anchor surface) may be achieved. I.e., good fluid dynamics and good compression characteristics of the injected fluid may be provided by similarly reducing the flame anchor surface on the pilot body surface. Any fluid guiding elements inside of the tubular swirling chamber that guide the injected fluid in a predetermined flow<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> direction, e.g. along the axial direction, may be not necessary.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">With other words, by providing a first radial swirler device and a second radial swirler device with different injecting angles, the diameter of the internal recirculation zone, in particular the diameter of the flame anchor surface, may be reduced e.g. by 50 % without reducing the flame stability. Moreover, a flame anchor surface may be reduced without losing a homogeneous fuel/air mixing or without losing flame stability. A smaller flame anchor surface may extend the life cycle of the overall pilot body surface. Furthermore, when the flame anchor surface is smaller, more mixing volume or a larger mixing area for the injected fluid injected by the swirler devices may be provided. Thus, a more homogenous mixture of the injected fluid may be provided, i.e. the air/fuel mixing ratio may be improved.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The first radial swirler device is located closer to the pilot body surface (e.g. closed end of the pre-chamber) of a tubular swirling chamber than the second radial swirler device. Furthermore, the second injecting angle is smaller than the first injecting angle. When the fluid is injected into the combustion chamber, the fluid flow generates the vortex that flows along a flow direction around the centre axis of the tubular combustion chamber and moves e.g. in a helix like shape along the centre axis. The first radial swirler device is located upstream, i.e. close to the pilot body surface and the second radial swirler device is located more downstream, in particular farer away from the pilot body surface. The streaming direction may be defined as a movement of the fluid along the centre axis starting from the pilot body surface of the pre-chamber in the direction to the combustion chamber. The pilot body surface closes the tubular combustion chamber on one closed end. At the pilot body surface the ignition of the fluid may be provided in a flame anchor surface of the pilot<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> body surface. Furthermore, the pilot body surface may comprise fuel injection devices, such as fuel injection nozzles.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">When the first injection angle of the first radial swirler device is larger (injection direction more radial to the centre axis) than the second injection angle (more tangential to the inner surface of the tubular swirling chamber), the fluid flow injected by the first radial swirler device is directed more to the centre of the combustion chamber. Thus, the vortex of the fluid in the internal circulation zone is generated by the more tangential second injection angle, wherein the vortex core is kept smaller by an injection of fluid with the first injecting angle. Thus, a vortex with high swirl numbers is generated by simultaneously keeping the vortex core and thus the flame anchor surface small.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As mentioned above, inside of the vortex core the flame anchor surface on the pilot body surface may be provided. Typically, when the fluid injection is not orientated tangentially, the swirl numbers of the vortex are reduced. By the present invention the second injecting angle is provided smaller than the first injecting angle, which means that the second fluid injected by the second radial swirler device is injected in a more tangential direction with respect to first injected fluid, injected by the first radial swirler device. Thus, the fluid injected by the second radial swirler device with the second injecting angle provides a more tangentially injected direction that forms a strong vortex inside the tubular swirling chamber with a high swirl number and a movement parallel to the centre axis of the combustion chamber (such as a helix shape). Thus, also a proper re-circulating flow in the re-circulating zone in the direction to the pilot body surface may be provided. At the same time, the more radial directed fluid, injected with the first injection angle, provides a smaller flame anchor surface reducing the flame stability.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to a further aspect of the invention, the swirler arrangement further comprises an adapter plate. The first radial swirler device and the second radial swirler device are attached to the adapter plate. The adapter plate may be formed by a circumferential plate with a through-hole, wherein the through-hole is adapted to the diameter of the tubular combustion chamber. On the side directed to the pilot body surface, the first vanes may be attached circumferentially in order to form the first radial swirler device. On the other adapter plate side, the second vanes may be attached in order to form the second radial swirler device. Thus, the first radial swirler device and the second radial swirler device may provide the same base plate, so that the overall weight may be reduced.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to a further exemplary embodiment, the adapter plate comprises a defined thickness for spacing the first radial swirler device and the second radial swirler device apart. Thus, when increasing the thickness of the adapter plate, the location of injection of the fluid of the first radial swirler and/or the second radial swirler may be adjusted along the centre axis of the tubular swirling chamber. Thus, a desired predetermined and pre-calculated flow pattern of the fluid flow inside the tubular swirling chamber may be adjusted.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">According to a further exemplary embodiment, at least one of the first radial swirler device and the second swirler device comprise injection holes. The first ducts formed by the first vanes and the second ducts formed by the second vanes may comprise injection holes for injecting fluid inside the ducts. The pressured air guided through the first ducts and the second ducts may be pre-mixed with the injected fuel. When the air/fuel mixture exits into the tubular swirling chamber, the air/fuel mixture may not be completely homogeneous but will be further improved in the tubular swirling chamber.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">According to a further exemplary embodiment, at least one of the first vanes and the second vanes are movable, so that at least a desired first injection angle and/or second injection angle are adjustable. Thus, each of the first vanes and/or the second vanes may be movably supported, e.g. pivotable, so that the first injection angle and/or the second injection angle may be adjustable to a desired value. Thus, desired flow patterns of the fluid inside the tubular swirling chamber, e.g. adjusted to a variety of different operating states, may be generated. Thus, the degree of efficiency may be improved. Such adjustments may be performed during operation or during a configuration phase or test of the turbine.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">According to a further exemplary embodiment, the swirler arrangement further comprises a control unit. The control unit is adapted for controlling the first injection angle and/or the second injection angle by moving the first vanes and/or the second vanes. The control unit may receive manual control signals for adjusting the first vanes and second vanes manually. Moreover, the control unit may be connected to a variety of sensors located into the tubular swirling chamber, so that the control unit may control the first vanes and the second vanes due to certain sensor values sensed by the sensors. Thus, the first vanes and the second vanes may be moved automatically in order to provide a certain desired flow pattern inside the combustion chamber.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">According to a further exemplary embodiment, a first width of the first vanes and a second width of the second vanes are different.

The swirler arrangement 100 comprises a first radial swirler device 101 and a second radial swirler device 102, the second radial swirler device 102 being axially downstream of the first radial swirler device 101. The swirler arrangement 100 is adapted for being fixed around an internal circulation zone 105 of the tubular swirling chamber 120. The first radial swirler device 101 comprises first vanes 201 (as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>), wherein the first vanes are formed to radially inject the fluid into the internal circulation zone 105 with a first injecting angle α (as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>).

A fluid or gas, such as air or an air/fuel mixture, may stream under pressure inside the tubular swirling chamber 120. The tubular swirling chamber 120 may comprise a pre-chamber 113 and a combustion chamber 114. The pre-chamber 113 comprises a first diameter 111 and the combustion chamber 114 comprises a second diameter 112. The fluid may be injected with a second injecting angle β (illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>) in a more tangential direction into the pre-chamber 113, so that a vortex of the fluid flow 106 is generated. Thus, the fluid flows in a second flow direction 108 in the direction to the combustion chamber 114 with a first fluid pressure P1. The first radial swirler device 101 directs the fluid in a more radial direction to the region of the centre axis 106 of the pre-chamber 113 in a first flow direction 107. The fluid injected by the first injecting angle α (illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>) defines the inner surface of the vortex, in particular the vortex diameter V. The fluid injected by the first radial swirler device 101 and the second radial swirler device 102 flows with a first fluid pressure P1 in the direction to the combustion chamber 114. The second diameter 112 of the combustion chamber 114 increases abruptly with respect to the first diameter 111 of the pre-chamber 113. Thus, a pressure gradient between the first fluid pressure P1 and the second fluid pressure P2 with less pressure than P1 is generated, so that the fluid expands and is directed to the direction to the centre axis 106 of the tubular swirling chamber 120 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. In the region of the centre axis 106 a re-circulation zone 110 is provided wherein the fluid is directed in a counter-direction to the first flow direction 107 and the second flow direction 108. With other words, the fluid flows back to the<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> first radial swirler device 101 and the second radial swirler device 102 inside the re-circulation zone 110.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The re-circulation zone 110 is defined by a shear layer 109 that is formed by the inner surface of the vortex. The inner vortex diameter V is defined by the first flow direction 107 of the fluid streaming through the first radial swirler device 101 with a first injecting angle α. The fluid flowing through the re-circulation zone 110 flows in a counter-direction to the first flow direction 107 and the second flow direction 108 until the closed end (pilot body surface 103) of the pre-chamber 113 is reached. The area where the re-circulation zone 110 touches the pilot body surface 103 may be called flame anchor surface 104. In the region of the flame anchor surface 104, the fluid may be ignited and provide a permanently burning flame. The flame will extend from the flame anchor surface 104 in the direction to the combustion chamber 114.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">When providing the fluid flow pattern as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the vortex diameter V and thus the flame anchor surface 104 may be reduced compared to non dual swirler configurations. This is provided by a fluid injected by the first radial swirler device 101 with the first injection angle α (see first flow direction 107 of the fluid). Due to a reduced swirl numbers of the vortex when injecting the fluid more radially in a first flow direction 107 respectively with a first injecting angle α, a further fluid will be injected by the second radial swirler device 102 with the second injecting angle β that is more tangential. Thus, a vortex with a high swirl number is provided and at the same time a reduced diameter of the flame anchor surface 104 is generated. By the smaller flame anchor surface 104 less fluctuation of the centre re-circulation zone 110 with constant flow characteristics may be provided.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p id="p0044" num="0044"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B</figref> illustrate a perspective view of the swirler arrangement 100 including a first radial swirler device 101 and a second radial swirler device 102.
