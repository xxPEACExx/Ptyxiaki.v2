load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a portable telephone.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In recent years, not only a telephone call function but also additional functions, such as an electronic mail function for sending and receiving an electronic mail by using an Internet protocol or another unique network protocol and an Internee function so as to read even WEB have been added to a portable telephone. Also, the inclusion of a memory card serving as a small memory medium in a portable telephone can attain a portable telephone in which an audio signal and a picture signal can be recorded and reproduced as the additional functions. In this way, not only the original telephone function but also the various additional functions are added to the portable telephone. It is tried to develop the portable telephone having multiple functions.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A relatively large display is typically mounted in the portable telephone having the thus attained multiple functions. Also, a direction key and a page scroll key<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> are also mounted for retrieving or selecting information displayed on this display.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">By the way, even if it is tried to make the display larger, there is also the limit of the size of the portable telephone itself. For example, of an electronic mail is displayed, if WEB is displayed, or if information stored on a memory card is displayed, the display becomes relatively narrow with respect to the information to be displayed.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In such a case, it is necessary to find out a target information or select the information by operating a direction key for shifting a focus position placed as an operation key of the portable telephone in an upper, lower, leftward or rightward direction, or a page scroll key for scrolling upwardly or downwardly displayed information correspondingly to one page.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, only from the information displayed on -the display, a user cannot find out whether or not the information is located outside a display range or whether or not the focus can be shifted from a current position. Thus, as a first step, the user operates the direction key or operates the page scroll key, and thereby checks the existence of the information existing outside the display range. However, such an operation is very troublesome and difficult.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly, there has been a need to provide a portable telephone in which the operational performances of the direction keys and the like and the convenience for the user are improved.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO9909711A"><text>WO99/09711</text></patcit> describes a computer that has a wireless communication capability and a switch enabling a user to turn this capability on or off as desired, for example during flying.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Various respective aspects and features of the invention are defined in the appended claims. Features from the dependent claims may be combined with features of the independent claims as appropriate and not merely as explicitly set out in the claims.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, throughout which like parts are referred to by like references, and in which:<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> -->

At this communicable state, after any telephone number is pushed by using the dial keys 24, the start key 21 is pushed to start a call and then call out a partner.

The electric field strength is detected by, for example, the transmission/reception unit 51. The detected electric field strength information is periodically read by the system controlling unit 57. The system controlling unit 57 carries out the display control of the display 15 on the basis of the read electric field strength information, and provides the electric field strength information to the user. In this embodiment, this electric field strength indication 61 is represented at approximately four stage levels, such as an excellent level, a usual level, a bad level and an incommunicable level, for example.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Also, this portable telephone 1 has an electronic mail function of communicating with the base station and<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> sending and receiving an electronic mail by using an Internet protocol.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">For example, mail data is sent by displaying a predetermined mail input screen, and entering a sentence to be transmitted, and then selecting a mail transmission button when it is at the communicable state. Actually, the system controlling unit 57 encodes the inputted electronic mail, and the transmission/reception unit 51 once sends the encoded mail data to the base station, and the mail data is transferred from the base station to a mail server of a partner. Also, when an electronic mail is transferred from the partner to an address of the user, the base station sends the mail data to the portable telephone 1. The portable telephone 1, when receiving the mail data at the time of the communicable state, automatically carries out an incoming mail process, and stores the mail data in an inner memory.

Accordingly, new audio data can be written on the memory card 4.

Then, new audio data can be written on the memory card 4. The transfer of the signal to the line input terminal 34 may be performed in a form of an analog signal or digital data. In a case of the analog signal being inputted, the audio encoder/decoder 53 carries out an A/D conversion, and converts the audio signal into the digital data.

Moreover, the direction of the rotating operation is the upper and lower directions (the longitudinal direction) of the operation surface 11. Thus, when the focus is shifted upwardly or downwardly, the shift of the focus on the display screen is parallel to the operation of an operating finger.
