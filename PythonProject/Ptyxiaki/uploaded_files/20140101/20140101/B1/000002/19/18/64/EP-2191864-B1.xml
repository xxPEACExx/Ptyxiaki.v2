load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention is related to a process for colouring and straightening keratin fibres especially human hair in a single process.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Hair colouring is a common practice for ages. Oxidative colouration has widely been used for achieving durable, brilliant hair colour. Direct dyes, mainly of cationic character, have also found their applications for colouring hair. Recently, anionic direct dyes have as well been found to be very powerful for changing hair colour permanently and to achieve long lasting, brilliant colours in strong acidic medium. The colouring agents with anionic dyes are so formulated that the optimum conditions are realised for achieving the highest dyestuff penetration into hair. European patent application with laid open number <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1022014A"><text>EP 1 022 014</text></patcit> describes such compositions comprising anionic dyestuffs, solvents, as aid to enhance penetration of said dyestuffs, and a buffer solution to adjust the pH of the dyeing agent in the range from 2 to 6. For enhancing penetration of dyestuffs, solvents are used such as ethanol, benzyl alcohol, propylene carbonate, dipropylene glycol. Products are found on the professional hair dressing market applying this technology.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5601620A"><text>US 5,601,620</text></patcit>, as well, discloses hair colouring agents with acid dyes, an organic solvent and at least one polysiloxane as a conditioner. The dyeing compositions disclosed here are having a pH in the range of 1.5 - 4.5.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Furthermore it has long been known to colour hair using direct cationic dyes and neutral nitro dyes. The direct cationic dyes developed recently and disclosed in international patent applications <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO9501772A1"><text>WO 95/01772 A1</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO9515144A1"><text>WO 95/15144 A1</text></patcit> have proven to deliver long lasting intensive colours.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Currently, these two chemical alteration processes of keratin fibres especially human hair are carried out separately in two independent processes in order to secure optimal and long lasting colouration and straightening. In practice, a person willing to have both chemical services is, therefore, asked to visit the hair dressing salon twice within a short period of time. In the first visit, hair is straightened and after a week of<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> two or three hair is oxdatively coloured. This brings about first of all economical problems and secondly it is very much time intensive.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">There are a few attempts made to carry out two chemical services in a single process, in the same hair dresser visit. For example <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="EP1655056A1"><text>EP 1655056 A1</text></patcit> discloses a process for colouring and curling hair wherein oxidative colouration is carried out first and the hair is treated with an acidic treatment and after rinsing off the acidic treatment and rolling up the hair onto curlers, a keratin reducing agent is applied onto hair and processed and finally hair is fixed with an oxidizing agent and treated with an acidic treatment again, if necessary. It has been observed that with the suggested method hair is not curled very effectively and also colours so obtained lack intensity, shine and especially durability. In the publication, nothing is disclosed on straightening keratin fibres, especially hair.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Other than the above suggested process, it has been a long hair dressing practice to use the fixing stage of a straightening process at the same time for colouring hair. It should be noted that a straightening hair involves two steps. In the first step the disulfide bonds are broken by using a reducing agent in an alkaline medium and in the second stage the broken disulfide bonds are recovered using an oxidizing agent. Oxidizing agent used in a straightening process usually comprises low level of oxidizing agent and more importantly does not have a strong alkaline pH, rather has acidic to slight alkaline pH where enough oxygen is provided to recover disulfide bonds. This is, however, quite different condition from oxidative colouring hair since there is a need for neutral to strong alkaline conditions and high concentration of oxidizing agent for securing intensive, homogeneous and long lasting colours.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Up until now it has not been known to colour and permanently shape keratin fiberes in a single process using hair direct dyes for colouring hair.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention starts from the objective in achieving excellently intensive, shiny colours and at the same time excellent straightening of keratin fibres without damaging keratin fibres excessively.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It has surprisingly been found out when keratin fibres especially human hair is coloured and straightened according to a process described below, colour intensity, brilliance and durability is excellent and hair is excellently straightened. It has further been observed that hair is less damaged at the end of inventive process of the present invention, feels natural and soft and has further its natural properties such as elasticity so that hair can move freely with the movement of person's head.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A novel process for colouring and straightening hair in a single process according to the present invention includes the following steps:<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> -->
