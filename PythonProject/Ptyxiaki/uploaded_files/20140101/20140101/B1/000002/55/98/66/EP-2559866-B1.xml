warming and that further increase in greenhouse gas production will accelerate global warming. Since carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is identified as a main greenhouse gas, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is considered as one of the potential major means to reduce release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and to control global warming. In this context CCS is defined as the process of CO<sub>2</sub> capture, compression, transport and storage. Capture is defined as a process in which CO<sub>2</sub> is removed either from the flue gases after combustion of a carbon based fuel or the removal of and processing of carbon before combustion. However, CCS, and in particular the compression of carbon-dioxide containing flue gases is a procedure which consumes a considerable amount of power, which in turn reduces the energy efficiency of a power plant. Suggestions have therefore been presented wherein heat generated in compression of flue gases is used in other parts of the power plant.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2011006862A"><text>WO 2011/006862</text></patcit> discloses a power plant wherein heat resulting from cooling compressed flue gases is recovered.

The condensate from the steam turbine 7 leaves the steam turbine 7 via a pipe 8. Carbon dioxide rich flue gas produced in the boiler 3 is fed via a duct 9 to a flue gas condenser 11 for purifying and cooling the carbon dioxide rich flue gas prior to compression and forwarding to a CCS system.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">By "carbon dioxide rich flue gas" is meant that the flue gas leaving the boiler 3 via the duct 9 will contain at least 40 % by volume of carbon dioxide, CO<sub>2</sub>. Often more than 50% by volume of the flue gas leaving the boiler 3 will be carbon dioxide. The balance of the "carbon dioxide rich flue gas" will be about 20-50% by volume of water vapour (H<sub>2</sub>O), 2-7 % by volume of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), since a slight oxygen excess is often preferred in the boiler 3, and totally about 0-10 % by volume of other gases, including mainly nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) and argon (Ar), since some leakage of air can seldom be completely avoided.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the flue gas condenser 11 the carbon dioxide rich flue gas is brought into direct or indirect contact with a cooling liquid, e.g. water. The carbon dioxide rich flue gas may be supplied at the bottom of the flue gas condenser 11 and move vertically upwards while being brought into contact, in a countercurrent flow manner, with cooling liquid flowing down, thus condensing water vapor from the carbon dioxide rich flue gas and lowering its temperature. The cooled and purified carbon dioxide rich flue gas then leaves the condenser 11 via the duct 13 and is forwarded to a compression stage 15 where the carbon dioxide rich flue gas is compressed and in that process experiences a rise in temperature. The compressed and heated carbon dioxide rich flue gas leaves the compression stage 15 via duct 16.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The vapor condensed from the carbon dioxide rich flue gas, the flue gas condensate, leaves the flue gas condenser 11 via a pipe 17, together with the cooling liquid. The cooling liquid and the condensed water vapors may as an alternative leave the flue gas condenser 11 in two separate pipes,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> which is normally the case when the cooling liquid and the carbon dioxide rich flue gas are brought into indirect contact only in the flue gas condenser 11. The cooling liquid may, after cooling, be returned to the flue gas condenser 11 for reuse via a not shown pipe.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Two heat exchangers or condensate reheaters 19 and 21 are arranged for transferring heat to the condensate leaving the steam turbine 7, before the steam turbine condensate is fed back to the boiler 3 as boiler feedwater. The first condensate reheater 19 is arranged in the pipe 17 and thus transfers heat from the flue gas condenser 11 to the steam turbine condensate.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A portion of the steam turbine condensate is fed via a pipe 8a to the first condensate reheater 19 and is heated to a first temperature of e.g. 50-90 °C. It may be noted that even though the first condensate reheater 19 for clarity reasons is shown as a separate device in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig 1</figref>, it may also be integrated in the flue gas condenser 11. There are a number of different possibilities for transferring heat from the flue gas condenser 11 to the steam turbine condensate. One option is to pass the cooling liquid heated by the carbon dioxide rich flue gas in the flue gas condenser 11 through the condensate reheater 19. The cooling liquid may or may not be mixed with the condensed vapors from the flue gas, depending on whether the cooling liquid was brought into direct or indirect contact with the flue gas. Another option is to let the steam turbine condensate function as the cooling liquid, thus allowing the flue gas condenser 11 in itself to serve as the first condensate reheater 19 by bringing the carbon dioxide rich flue gas into indirect contact with the steam turbine condensate in the flue gas condenser 11.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A first portion of the heated steam turbine condensate in the pipe 8b is then diverted via a pipe 8d to the second condensate reheater 21 where the flue gas compressed in the compression stage 15 transfers heat to this portion of the steam turbine condensate, thus heating it to a second temperature of 100-260 °C.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The compression stage 15 may comprise an adiabatic or essentially adiabatic compressor implying that as much heat as possible is available for transfer in the second condensate reheater 21, in turn reducing the energy<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> losses for the system. An adiabatic compressor provides a temperature raise in the flue gas to 170°C - 280°C after compression of the carbon dioxide rich flue gas, which in turn gives an efficient transfer of heat to the steam turbine condensate in the second condensate preheater 21. Downstream the second condensate reheater 21 the temperature of the carbone dioxide flue gas may be lowered to 53°C after the transfer of heat to the steam turbine condensate.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The compression stage 15 may comprise an axial compressor, which may or may not be adiabatic. This enables a more efficient energy recovery, as the temperature increase of the flue gas is higher and the compression power requirements are lower than when using other alternatives such as an intergrally geared design with a centrifugal compressor.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A second portion of the heated condensate at the first temperature in the pipe 8b is returned to the pipe 8 upstream of a steam condensate preheater 23 via a pipe 8c, bypassing the second preheater 21. In the steam condensate preheater 23, or a series of steam condensate preheaters as may be the case, the condensate is heated further to a temperature of e.g. 100-180°C. The condensate preheater 23 heats steam turbine condensate by using extraction steam from the steam turbine 7. For sake of simplicity pipes for transferring steam from the steam turbine 7 to the steam condensate preheater 23 are not shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">At least a portion of the steam condensate heated to the second temperature returns to the pipe 8 via a pipe 8e, downstream the condensate preheater 23 and is fed back to the boiler 3. That a portion of the steam turbine condensate has been reheated in the first and second reheater 19 and 21 means that less heating capacity (fewer or smaller preheaters) is required by the condensate preheater 23.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The heated condensate is finally returned via the pipe 8 to the boiler 3 as boiler feedwater. The heated condensate could potentially be used in another boiler instead, but the principles of the heat recovery system would still be the same.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The two condensate reheaters 19 and 21 enables an efficient heat recovery to the boiler feedwater, by using both heat from the flue gas when it<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> passes the flue gas condenser 11 and from the flue gas when it is compressed in the compression stage 15. The compressed and heated carbon dioxide rich flue gas leaving the compression stage 15 must be cooled to be able to be further compressed and processed in a number of stages (not shown) in preparation for capturing the carbon dioxide in a CCS system, and by using the second condensate reheater 21 for this cooling less energy is lost.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The flue gas condenser or the cooling liquid in the flue gas condenser 11 also need cooling for the flue gas condenser to be able to condense vapors from the flue gas. By using the first condensate reheater 19 this cooling is achieved by transferring heat from the flue gas condenser to the steam turbine condensate. This makes use of the heat dissipated from the flue gas as it is cooled and purified in preparation for compression, and in turn creates further energy savings.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In other words, in a system and a method for recovering heat in a power plant, heat from the flue gas condenser 11 is used in the first condensate reheater 19 for heating the condensate from the steam turbine 7. Heat from the compressed and heated stream of carbon dioxide rich flue gas is transferred in the second condensate reheater 21 to the steam turbine condensate for further heating portions thereof.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">While the invention has been described with reference to a number of preferred embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the present invention.
