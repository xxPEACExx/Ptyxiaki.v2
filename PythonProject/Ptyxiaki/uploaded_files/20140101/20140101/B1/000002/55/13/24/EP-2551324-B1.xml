These materials have therefore found application as thermal insulators (see e.g. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US3953566A"><text>US 3,953,566</text></patcit>, column 5, line 64 to column 6, line 2).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For applications as e.g. for the heat transfer from integrated circuits ("IC") it is desired to make use of the advantageous properties of fluoropolymers, but, at the same time, thermal conductivity is required.

This is caused by an orientation of the polymer chains in the fluoropolymer which makes the fluoropolymer anisotropic, with the direction of high thermal conductivity being parallel to the direction of the chain orientation.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The described use solves the objects of the present invention, in particular allows for the use of fluoropolymers as heat conducting material in thermally conductive articles without the need of adding thermally conductive fillers. The increased ability to conduct heat is intrinsic to the pure fluoropolymer and, hence, the advantageous properties of fluoropolymers such as mentioned above are maintained.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Furthermore, as no additives are necessary to make the fluoropolymer thermally conductive, undesired water adsorbance due to the presence of such additives is avoided.
