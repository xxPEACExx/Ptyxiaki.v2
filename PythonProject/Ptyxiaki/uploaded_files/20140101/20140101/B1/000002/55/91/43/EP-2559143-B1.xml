converter with multi-level voltage output in the form of a device for converting a DC voltage into an AC voltage and vice versa comprising at least one phase leg with a first voltage source and a first passive energy storage element connected in series between a first DC terminal and a first AC terminal and with a second passive energy storage element and a second voltage source connected in series between the first AC terminal and a second DC terminal, where each of the voltage sources comprises at least a first and a second submodule in series-connection, each submodule comprising at least one power electronic switch connected in parallel with at least one capacitor.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In the art, multi-level converters are known to be used in order to reduce harmonic distortion in the output of voltage source converters. A multilevel converter is a converter where the output voltage - or, in case of a multiphase converter, the voltages - can assume several discrete levels, as can be seen for example in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE10103031"><text>DE10103031</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2008067785A"><text>WO 2008/067785</text></patcit>, a multi-level converter according to <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="DE10103031"><text>DE10103031</text></patcit> is disclosed which in addition comprises at least one inductor in each phase leg as well as regulating means to regulate a circulating current flowing through the phase legs, i.e., the current that closes between the phase legs but does not enter the AC grid through the AC terminal.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">If the circulating-current is controlled, as described in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO2008067785A"><text>WO 2008/067785</text></patcit>, the voltage rating of the power electronic switches of the converter must allow for the extra voltage needed to regulate the circulating currents in the desired manner.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It is also known to add a zero sequence third harmonic to an AC voltage. This means that harmonics at three times the fundamental frequency are added to the converter AC voltage reference. Such an addition lowers the peak voltages of the converter and thereby the efficiency of the converter power is raised. However, these harmonics are normally not allowed in an AC grid and therefore they have to be removed. This removal is typically performed through using a transformer connected between the AC grid and the converter.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, it is in some cases of interest to remove this transformer. This means that the zero sequence third harmonic has to be removed in some other way.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO2004017505A"><text>WO 2004/017505</text></patcit> describes one such alternative solution for removing these harmonics without the use of a transformer. This document describes the use of a phase conductor wound around an iron core and placed between a converter and the AC grid instead of a transformer. This phase conductor then takes care of the third harmonics removal.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is however of interest to combine regulating of circulating currents with zero sequence third harmonic removal. This will limit the number of elements used for performing these two functions separately.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a power converter which allows for regulation of the circulating currents in a desired manner, where the required voltage rating of the power semiconductor switches is affected as little as possible at the same time as zero sequence third harmonic removal is performed using a limited number of converter elements.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">This object is achieved by a device according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The device for converting a DC voltage into an AC voltage and vice versa as described above, comprises according to the invention a passive electronic filter<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> which is arranged between the voltage source and the AC terminal. The passive electronic filter is adjusted to reduce harmonics in a circulating current as well as to remove zero-sequence third harmonics.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The invention is based on the recognition of the fact that the desired manner in which the circulating currents should best be regulated is to reduce the harmonics which occur at specific frequencies in the circulating current, rather than to reduce the circulating currents in general. This is according to the invention furthermore combined with zero-sequence third harmonics removal. What the inventors realized is that at each switching event in the power electronic switches of the converter, harmonics appear in the circulating current causing increased losses. As a worst case, some of the harmonics with distinctively high amplitude in the circulating currents could even lead to system instability. The introduction of additional inductors, as described in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO2008067785A"><text>WO 2008/067785</text></patcit>, helps to obtain a general current limitation in the converter circuit but does nothing to avoid the distinctive harmonics as such.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">By introducing a passive electronic filter that reduces or in the best case completely blocks the harmonics with the highest amplitude, it is avoided that the control unit which controls the power semiconductor switches sees and takes into account the most disturbing components of the circulating currents. The requirements on the voltage rating of the power semiconductor switches can thereby be reduced.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A closer look at the harmonics in the circulating currents revealed the following: The sum of the voltage ripple over the submodules of both phase module branches in one phase leg shows in its frequency spectrum a main component at twice the fundamental frequency of the AC voltage. This main frequency component creates a parasitic harmonic component in the circulating current that is also of twice the fundamental frequency. Unless this component is somehow limited, increased losses will result; possibly even loss of system stability.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Therefore, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the parameters of the electronic filter are chosen so that harmonics at twice the fundamental frequency of the AC voltage are reduced, thereby specifically reducing the main disturbing<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> component of the circulating current. This is furthermore combined with reducing harmonics at three times the fundamental frequency in order to remove zero sequence third harmonics without requiring a transformer.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">Other features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent to a person skilled in the art from the following detailed description in conjunction with the appended drawings in which:

The three phase legs 1, 2 and 3 of the device of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> each comprise two so-called arms in series-connection: a positive, upper arm which is connected to a first DC terminal 4 at a positive voltage level, and a negative, lower arm, which is connected to a second DC terminal 5 at zero or a negative voltage level. Each positive arm comprises a series-connection of an upper voltage source Uvpi and a first passive energy storage element, here in the form of an inductor 9, 11 or 13, respectively, and each negative arm comprises a second passive energy storage element, here also in the form of an inductor 10, 12 or 14, respectively, and a lower voltage source Uvni, where i stands for the number of the corresponding phase leg. The midpoint or connection point between the first and second energy storage elements of each phase leg is each connected to an AC terminal 6, 7 or 8, respectively. All the phase legs are connected in parallel to each other and to the two DC terminals 4 and 5. By appropriately controlling the voltage sources of the phase legs over time, the AC to DC conversion is made.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, each voltage source is made up of a series connected string of submodules 15, where at least two submodules 15 are comprised in one such string.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 3</figref>, two different embodiments 15a and 15b of the submodules 15, which are known in the art, can be seen. Any combination of the submodules is possible within each voltage source. The submodules have the form of commutation cells, each cell comprising two valves and a large DC capacitor holding a direct voltage. The main valves are equipped with a power electronic switch 16 with turn-off capability and a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> free-wheeling diode in anti-parallel connection to the switch. Depending on which of the two power electronic switches 16 is conducting, the corresponding submodule can assume one of two switching states, where in state one zero voltage or in state two the capacitor voltage is applied to the output.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to the invention, the converter according to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">Figs. 1 to 3</figref> is additionally equipped with a passive electronic filter in each phase leg, as is depicted in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref> for phase leg 1. In <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 4</figref>, the filter 18 is shown as a dashed box. The filter includes three terminals a first terminal for being coupled to the first voltage source and first DC terminal 4, a second terminal for being coupled to the second voltage source and the second DC terminal 5 and finally a third terminal connected to the AC terminal 6 of the converter. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 4</figref> the first and second passive energy storage elements are being included in the passive filter.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A first design of the filter 18 is shown <figref idrefs="f0003">fig. 5</figref>. This first filter design does, however, not fall within the scope of the present invention. In between the first and second passive energy storage elements, 9 and 10, which are here both reactors having an inductance L<sub>h</sub>, there is here provided a third passive energy storage element 19, in this first design in the form of a capacitor having a capacitance of C<sub>p</sub>. This third passive energy storage element 19 is thus provided in series with the first and second energy storage elements.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">There is furthermore a fourth energy storage element 20, having two ends, a first end connected to a junction between the first energy storage element 9 and the third energy storage element 19 and a second end connected to the AC terminal 6. The fourth energy storage element 20 is here an inductor having an inductance L<sub>v</sub>. There is furthermore a fifth energy storage element 21 having two ends a first end connected to a junction between the second energy storage element 10 and the third energy storage element 19 and a second end connected to the AC terminal 6. The fifth energy storage element 21 is in this design also an inductor having an inductance L<sub>v</sub>. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0003">fig. 5</figref>, the filter includes two types of passive energy storage elements, inductive and capacitive energy storage elements. As is clear the third energy storage element 19 is of one of the types, here a capacitive energy<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> storage element, while the fourth and fifth energy storage elements 20 and 21 are of another type, here inductive energy storage elements. In <figref idrefs="f0003">fig. 5</figref> there is furthermore a first further energy storage element 22 in parallel with the fourth energy storage element 20. This first further energy storage element is of another type than the fourth energy storage element and here capacitive with a capacitance C<sub>v</sub>. There is also a second further energy storage element 23 in parallel with the fifth energy storage element 21. This second further energy storage element is of another type than the fifth energy storage element and here also capacitive with a capacitance C<sub>v</sub>. Since the filter includes passive storage elements of the two types, it is clear that filtering is provided in relation to one or more frequencies. Another feature that can be readily observed is that there is a first path provided from the first DC terminal to the AC terminal via the first energy storage element 9 and the parallel connection of the fourth and first further fourth energy storage elements 20 and 22 and a second path provided from the second DC terminal to the AC terminal via the second energy storage element 10 and the parallel connection of the fifth and second further energy storage elements 21 and 23. These paths are furthermore symmetrical, which means that the filter elements in them are provided of the same types in the same orders and with the same values in the first and the second paths.

The inverse of the value of the third energy storage element is furthermore equal to a fundamental frequency dependent constant times the value of the fourth and fifth energy storage elements, where this constant includes the square of the fundamental frequency times a factor that is a multiple of 2, which multiple is in this case 36. This factor is also a raising of the number two by eight. One observation that can be made in relation to equations (2) and (3) is that the third, fourth and fifth energy storage elements are involved in reducing components at twice the fundamental frequency, while the fourth, fifth, first further and second further energy storage elements are used for reducing components at three times the fundamental frequency.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Here it may also be of interest to compare equation (4) with the selection of C<sub>p</sub> if third-harmonic blocking is not performed in the filter.

Therefore this component at the two times the fundamental frequency is removed from the circulating currents, which thus reduces the circulating currents. The first filter design also removes the component at three times the fundamental frequency, which therefore allows zero sequence third harmonics removal without using a transformer. These two types of harmonics component removal further uses some energy storage elements in relation to both<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> components, where the fourth and fifth energy storage elements are here used in this dual way. Because of this dual functionality it is furthermore possible to reduce the size of the third energy storage element. This means that the filter is very economical.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">When providing filtering of harmonics at three times the fundamental frequency there are some details that may need to be considered. The requirements for low injection of zero-sequence third-harmonic current into the grid may be strict, much more so than the requirements for suppression of the harmonic component at twice the fundamental frequency from the circulating current. Since there are always tolerances associated with the parameter values of the inductors and capacitors, as specified by the manufacturer in the case, it may be necessary to introduce an on-line tuning facility to some of the energy storage elements, for instance the ones involved in blocking second harmonics. It may also be necessary to tune the filter for tracking changes in grid frequency. It is here possible to provide an inductor with tap changers.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Take the filter in <figref idrefs="f0003">fig. 5</figref> as an example. Here it is possible to provide the fourth and fifth energy storage elements 20 and 21 with tap changers of a suitably selected number of steps and step sizes. As an alternative it is also possible to have the first and second further energy storage elements 22 and 23 variable, for instance through using capacitor banks, the capacitances of which can be modified in suitably selected steps through circuit breakers and/or switching semiconductors.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">When the energy storage elements are made adjustable in the way described above there will be provided two parallel variable elements, one in each path from a DC terminal to the AC terminal. It should here be realized that it may be advantageous to have only one such variable energy storage element in the filter, because then the provision of the same variation in relation to the two paths is easier to control. An example on this is shown in a second filter design in <figref idrefs="f0004">fig. 8</figref>. This second filter design does, however, not fall within the scope of the present invention. The only elements that differ from the first filter design are here the third energy storage element and the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> additional energy storage elements. Otherwise all elements are of the same type and provided in the same position as in the first design. Here the third energy storage element has been split into two energy storage elements 19a and 19b of the same type, i.e. capacitive. The second further energy storage element has furthermore been deleted, while the first further energy storage element 22 is adjustable and at a first end connected to a midpoint of the third energy storage element and at a second opposite end connected to the AC terminal 6. Here the midpoint of the third energy storage element is provided as the junction between the two energy storage elements 19a and 19b resulting from the splitting. This filter functions in the same way as the filter according to the first design, but the filter values can be adjusted and here through adjusting only one energy storage element. However, the selection of capacitor values C<sub>v</sub> and C<sub>p</sub> will differ from in the first design.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">As was mentioned above it may be of interest to use the converter without a transformer. Such a transformer is then not only used for removing zero sequence third harmonics. It also acts as a DC blocking element, i.e. it stops DC components appearing in a phase leg from reaching the AC grid. If no transformer is used these DC components will have to be removed or blocked in another way.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">According to the invention the filter acts, in addition to reducing harmonics at two and three times the fundamental frequency, also as a DC blocking filter.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">A filter according to a first embodiment of the invention providing this triple functionality is shown in fig- 9. <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 9</figref> thus shows a filter according to a first embodiment of the invention having a first 9', second 10', third 19, fourth 20, fifth 21, first further 22 and second further 23 energy storage element in the same positions as the corresponding elements in the first filter design.

However the first and second energy storage elements 9' and 10' are capacitive and not inductive. There are furthermore no inductive or restive elements in parallel with them.

This filter includes the first and second energy storage elements 9, 10 of the first filter design. They are thus of the same type and placed at the same position as in <figref idrefs="f0003">fig. 5</figref>. However, the third, fourth and fifth energy storage elements 19'. 20' and 21' are of the opposite type compared to the first design. This means that the third energy storage element is inductive having an inductance L<sub>p</sub>, while the fourth and fifth energy storage elements are capacitive having capacitances C<sub>v</sub>. The further energy storage elements 25 and 26 are here capactive with capacitance C<sub>p</sub> and provided in parallel with the first and second energy storage elements 9 and 10. The filter here includes two parallel connections of the two types of elements, inductive and capacitive, through the first and second energy storage elements 9 and 10 being connected in parallel with a respective further element 25 and 26 of the opposite type. These parallel connections here provide the third harmonics filtering. The second harmonics filtering is again performed by the third, fourth and fifth energy storage elements.

It blocks circulating currents without having to resort to removing the current through the control of the voltage sources. This is combined with removal of zero sequence third harmonics. In this way no transformer is needed. Here some filter element may be involved in both types of filtering. There may thus be a dual use of a filter element. This reduces the amount of filter elements needed and also allows a size reduction of such a filter element compared with a filter only filtering at twice the fundamental frequency. This is combined with stopping a DC component from reaching the grid, which is also of advantage if there is no transformer between grid and voltage source converter. In some variations of the invention a filter element may combine DC blocking with a frequency filtering function, which provides even further savings. The use of two inductors in two paths for performing the same function also reduces the losses incurred by the inner resistances of the inductors. This is due to the fact that each path only takes half the grid current, while full grid current would pass through an inductor placed at the grid interface.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">It should finally be mentioned that the element values C<sub>v</sub>, C<sub>p</sub>, L<sub>v</sub>, L<sub>p</sub> etc. are in the figures used to indicate that there is a value associated with the element of the position. It is not intended to mean that the same type of element in the same position has the same value in the different embodiments. These values will normally differ from each other.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56978111" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Vorrichtung zum Umwandeln einer Gleichspannung in eine Wechselspannung und umgekehrt, die mindestens einen Phasenzweig (1, 2, 3) umfasst, wobei jeder Phasenzweig eine erste Spannungsquelle (Uvp1, Uvp2, Uvp3) und ein erstes passives Energiespeicherelement (9, 11, 13; 9'), die zwischen einem ersten Gleichspannungsanschluss (4) und einem ersten Wechselspannungsanschluss (6) in Reihe geschaltet sind, und ein zweites passives Energiespeicherelement (10, 12, 14; 10') und eine zweite Spannungsquelle (Uvn1, Uvn2, Uvn3), die zwischen dem ersten Wechselspannungsanschluss (5) und einem zweiten Gleichspannungsanschluss (6) in Reihe geschaltet sind, aufweist, wobei jede der Spannungsquellen mindestens ein erstes und ein zweites Untermodul (15) in einer Reihenschaltung umfasst, wobei jedes Untermodul (15) mindestens zwei elektronische Schalter (16) umfasst, die mit mindestens einem Kondensator (17) parallel geschaltet sind, und ein passives elektronisches Filter (18), das passive Energiespeicherelemente umfasst, ebenso wie der erste Wechselspannungsanschluss zwischen der ersten und der zweiten Spannungsquelle angeordnet ist, wobei das Filter das erste und das zweite Energiespeicherelement, ein drittes Energiespeicherelement (19; 19'; 19a; 19b), das zwischen dem ersten und dem zweiten Energiespeicherelement in Reihe geschaltet ist, ein viertes Energiespeicherelement (20; 20') mit zwei<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> Enden, wobei ein erstes Ende mit einer Verbindung zwischen dem ersten Energiespeicherelement und dem dritten Energiespeicherelement verbunden ist und ein zweites Ende an den Wechselspannungsanschluss gekoppelt ist, und ein fünftes Energiespeicherelement (21; 21') mit zwei Enden, wobei ein erstes Ende mit einer Verbindung zwischen dem zweiten Energiespeicherelement und dem dritten Energiespeicherelement verbunden ist und ein zweites Ende an den Wechselspannungsanschluss gekoppelt ist, umfasst, wobei die Energiespeicherelemente Elemente von zwei unterschiedlichen Typen umfassen, nämlich kapazitive und induktive Energiespeicherelemente, mit Werten, die ausgewählt sind, um eine Verminderung der Frequenzkomponenten auf das Dreifache der Grundfrequenz der Wechselspannung bereitzustellen,<br/>
