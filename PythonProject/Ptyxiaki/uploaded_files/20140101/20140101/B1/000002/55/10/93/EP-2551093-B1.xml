load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a process for preparing healable composite materials, to healable composite materials obtainable by such process as well as to its use as a cabin component and/or structural component in the field of transport vehicles and a healing process.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Composite materials are made up of at least a composite matrix which is reinforced by fibres or particles and are characterized in that the constituent components retain their identities in the composite material, that is to say, they do not dissolve or merge completely into one another although they act in concert. The composite matrix surrounds and supports the reinforcing components by maintaining their relative positions, whereby the reinforcing components impart their special mechanical and physical properties to enhance the matrix properties. A synergism between the constituent components produces composite materials that are often superior in their mechanical and physical properties over the corresponding individual components or metallic structures and are thus widely used in structural applications of a great variety ranging from e.g. microelectronics and civil infrastructures such as bridges to transport vehicles such as aircrafts, spacecrafts, high-speed trains, cars, boats and ships.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Despite of the improved mechanical and physical properties of the composite materials, they are susceptible to damages on a microscopic level deep within the structure during and after an impact on the material, for example, by sudden temperature<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> changes or mechanical vibrations and mechanical stresses of various types. Once damages such as microcracks have been formed within the composite material, the integrity of the structure is significantly reduced resulting in a decrease of life-time and reliability of the corresponding prepared final product.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the art, several attempts have been made to minimize the damage caused by an impact on the composite material for maintaining the structural integrity and for increasing the life-time and reliability of a product made of a composite material.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For instance, self-repairing composite materials and corresponding processes for the preparation of these materials have been proposed in which a repairing process is initiated by the microcrack itself. In this regard, the utilization of microcapsules and/or hollow fibres dispersed within the matrix are described in the art, wherein an approaching crack ruptures dispersed microcapsules and/or hollow fibres which subsequently release a healing-agent into the microcrack through capillary actions. A polymerization reaction of the healing-agent is than initiated by its contact with an embedded catalyst. For example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6527849B"><text>US 6,527,849</text></patcit> relates to a self-repairing, fiber reinforced matrix material including a matrix material having disposed within the matrix hollow fibres having a selectively releasable modifying agent contained therein. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20110118385A"><text>US 2011/0118385</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US20100168280A"><text>US 2010/0168280</text></patcit> refer to a process for preparing a self-healing composite material including a matrix of epoxy polymer in which a catalyst of ring opening metathesis reaction and vessels containing at least one monomer able to polymerize due to a ring opening metathesis<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> reaction are dispersed. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO02064653A"><text>WO 02/064653</text></patcit> relates to a composite material containing a polymer, a polymerizer, a corresponding catalyst for the polymerizer, and a plurality of capsules. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US2007087198A"><text>US 2007/087198</text></patcit> describes a system for self-repairing matrices such as concrete or cementitous matrices, polymeric matrices, and/or fibrous matrices, including laminates thereof. The system includes repair agents retained in and/or on vessels, such as hollow fibres, within the matrix. <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US20040007784A"><text>US 2004/0007784</text></patcit> refers to a self-healing polymer composition containing a polymer media and a plurality of microcapsules of flowable polymerizable material dispersed in the polymer media, wherein the microcapsules of flowable polymerizable material contain a flowable polymerizable material and have an outer surface upon which at least one polymerization agent is attached. <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>M. Motuku et al., Smart Mater. Struct. 1999, 8, p. 623</text></nplcit> have proposed self-healing by using hollow fibres as well as micro-capsules as storage vessels for healing materials.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, it is well known that damages in the composite material initially starts in the matrix region or at the fibrematrix interface and not in the fibres so that hollow fibres and/or microcapsules will not fracture under light impact loads unless the hollow fibres and/or microcapsules are substantially weaker than conventional reinforcing fibres. In addition thereto, the crack path often proceeds along the capsule/matrix interface without fracturing the capsules. Accordingly, without fiber fracture, healing is impossible using the hollow fiber and/or microcapsule technique. Furthermore, a uniform distribution of the hollow fibres and/or microcapsules containing the healing agent in the composite matrix and the fabrication of the composite material is very<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> complicated and thus often leads to an early rupture during processing. Another disadvantage which may arise during processing of the composite material is that an improper impregnation of the hollow fiber and/or microcapsule with the matrix may lead to voids formed in the composite material and, furthermore, may cause a reduction in strength in the final material. In addition thereto, the proportion of hollow fibres and/or microcapsules must be high in order to provide a good distribution of healing agent in the event of damage which also causes a reduction in the overall structural strength of the composite material. Furthermore, this method using capsules only allows one healing cycle, after which the healing agent has reacted and is passified.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Another approach utilizes the properties of thermoplastic materials which are, unlike thermoset materials which are usually used as composite matrix, softened by application of heat or other catalysts and can thus be heated and reshaped for several times. For instance, <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US20110023611A"><text>US 2011/0023611</text></patcit> describes self-healing composite materials comprising a fiber-reinforced polymeric matrix, wherein the polymeric matrix comprises a thermosetting polymer and a thermoplastic polymer. <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="WO2006072767A"><text>WO 2006/072767</text></patcit> relates to a composite material provided with a damage detection system, the composite material comprising a fiber-reinforced polymeric matrix, wherein the fiber reinforcement comprises electrically conductive fibres and the polymeric matrix comprises a thermosetting polymer and a thermoplastic polymer. <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="WO2011144971A"><text>WO 2011/144971</text></patcit> refers to a self healing polymer material comprising a primary polymer phase and a secondary polymer phase, wherein the primary polymer phase comprises a thermoset polymer matrix or one or more polymerizable thermoset agents capable, on curing, of producing<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> a thermoset polymer matrix; the secondary polymer phase comprises a thermoplastic polymer that is capable of acting as a self healing agent and being chemically reactive, on post-curing or healing of the self healing polymer material.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Also self-healing materials wherein the polymeric matrix comprises a thermosetting polymer and a thermoplastic polymer suffer several disadvantages as the thermoplastic matrix provides a low healing efficiency so that a substantial weakening of the structural integrity cannot be prevented in most cases if an impact occurs on the material. Furthermore, the incorporation of a thermoplastic polymer into a thermosetting polmer increases the viscosity of the polymeric matrix and may, thus, hinder the subsequent infusion or infiltration processing. As a consequence, areas of variable polymer matrices may be observed in the composite matrix which may lead to a reduction in the overall structural integrity of the prepared composite material.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Thus, there is still a need in the art for providing a process which avoids the foregoing disadvantages and especially allows for improving the mechanical and physical properties of the composite material during and/or after an impact on the composite material.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a process for preparing a composite material wherein the structural integrity of the resulting composite material can be restored during and/or after an impact on the composite material. A further objective of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing a composite material wherein the resulting composite material suffers less damage<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> such as microcracks during and/or after an impact on the composite material. Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing a composite material wherein the resulting composite material maintains its structural integrity during and/or after an impact on the composite material. A further objective of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing a composite material wherein the composite material has an increased life-time.
